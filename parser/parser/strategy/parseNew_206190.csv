												First ten minutes: Haha, what a cool concept, and it's funny!First hour: Whoa, this is a game built on barely-coherent mechanics that would definitely appeal to someone with neurochemistry very different from my own.Fourth hour: I just rerouted power from a lightswitch into a power socket into an elevator call button which when activated will knock out a guard patrolling near the elevator which clears the room so when I arrive the sound detector will open a door that contains a guard whose gun is linked to a different gun on a different floor so when the guard fires he'll trigger the other gun which will kill a guard defending a laptop with sensitive data which I can only reach by throwing a different switch and leaping down through a glass ceiling and knocking out the gunman guard before he can reload at which point I bolt through the vault door before it closes.

												I definitely milked every ounce of entertainment and replay value out of this game after I bought it by going for A+ grades on all of the levels and 100% achievement completion, but despite the tedium that I thought that that would entail, I enjoyed every second I spent playing this little indie gem. It has a convoluted sense of humor akin to a Yotam Perel or Edd Gould cartoon, but with more f-words. The gameplay involves 2D stealth platforming similar to Mark of the Ninja, but with a pixel-art style and a noir theme. The music is great, and makes you feel like a modernized incarnation of a gumshoe detective as you punch out guards and rewire electronics while trying to solve a twisted, oppurtunistic murder. My personal score for Gunpoint is a 9/10. There isn't much true replay value to speak of, which takes away from a perfect score from me, but like I said I had a lot of fun replaying levels and achievement hunting for over 15 hours after I had beaten the game.

												After interviewing the creator of Gunpoint, Tom Francis, on my channel on this game I delved into it passionately. The game is incredibly fun and intuitive, hilarious and just all-round excellent!The game has you playing as a private detective working for both sides of the law, where you as the player are able to decide where your future will take you. The uniqueness of the game comes down to the control you have over all the electronics and nuances of the scene, letting you recalibrate lightswitches to open doors or computers to shoot guns, foiling the guards on duty and collecting your reward.I completed the game in 5 hours, with full A+s on each level, and had a great time with every minute of it! Check this out as soon as you can!Nilesy			"

												Richard Conway is a private detective in the wrong place at the wrong time. Shortly after strapping on his new pair of hypertrousers he finds himself on the receiving end of quite a few pointed fingers, the result of making himself seen on a security camera seconds before a key figure was killed in the same building. Rather than come clean and hope the police believe his story, he decides to take the easy root of breaking into the companies headquarters and destroying the footage, and hopefully getting out with his new coat blood stain free.Tom Francis's Gunpoint isn't what you might think. This isn't a game about guns, or about pointing them; it's about jumping through windows like a maniacal frog and rewiring security systems to suit your needs. To an outsider I imagine this sounds incredibly silly, but that's part of why it's so brilliant. It manages to be both self aware and hilarious, yet remarkably smart in every aspect of its design, and the pieces come together so perfectly that it never ceased to blow me away as I dug deeper into it.You could call Gunpoint a platformer, but if anything it's more of a human catapult simulator. Using your futuristic hypertrousers you can jump incredible distances without the worry of a quick death when you hit the ground, or more accurately, smash through a window or onto an unsuspecting guard. Movement is made even more fluid by Conway's spider-like ability to climb walls and cling to ceilings, essentially turning you into the ultimate cat burglar as you effortlessly move through buildings. It's an extremely impressive move set that feels amazing and as if its constantly evolving as you play, with new levels making use of moves you may have never used or even known were possible before, creating a constantly satisfying and stylistic loop of continual mechanical growth.Standing between you and a parkour bonanza however is a plethora of electronic doors, security switches, cameras, alarms, and other traps that will send you home in a body bag if the guards are alerted, or simply stuck in place. Luckily Conway comes prepared with the ability to hack and rewire these devices to his own uses, with the animatronic like guards being more objects that need to be rerouted than anything resembling human intelligence. This is where Gunpoint evolves into something beyond a clever hook into a ridiculously smart puzzle game, allowing you to quickly reconfigure circuits to set off other devices, open doors, disable guns, and on the whole make you feel like a tech wizard. It's not so much the great mechanics themselves that make Gunpoint an amazing game though, as it is how they are balanced so effortlessly between being clever and keeping the player moving forward, something all to often lost with puzzle games but that Tom Francis has got down to an absolute science. There was never a moment when I felt I wasn't doing something useful in Gunpoint, and even when I failed the brilliant auto save let me quickly restart just seconds prior..It can't be stressed enough just how much style Gunpoint exudes, from its subtle but unique art design to its masterful noire tinged soundtrack. The graphics are simple yet have a ton of detail squeezed into every pixel, with superb use of lighting setting the mood for a dark detective story and smooth animations allowing you to forget how simple the character designs actually are. Gunpoint succeeds most where so many ""retro"" games fail in making itself instantly identifiable and memorable, and using its aesthetics to compliment its mechanics and narrative.I said it before but I'll say it again, it blows my mind when I think about how amazing every single moment of Gunpoint is. The writing is witty yet crafts an engrossing, compelling narrative that didn't need to be complex for me to devour every line of dialog eagerly awaiting how it would all end. The mechanics fit together as if they share a cellular bond, evolving and challenging the player while keeping them in constant control and giving them the option to approach encounters however they see fit. The absurdly polished presentation makes it effortless to sink into its world for the few hours it takes to complete, which left me satisfied yet eager to go back and see how I might could play through it differently. It's an absolutely astounding accomplishment for something almost entirely developed by one person, and a brilliant experience that topped any expectations I might have had before hand but have since been all but forgotten.Now if I could just get a pair of those pants for myself...You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Gunpoint is a stealth puzzle platformer game that is one of my all time favourite indie games. You play as a freelance spy who takes jobs from both sides of the law which usually involve you breaking into high security buildings to steal important information, preferably without being noticed. However you are not a regular spy, equipped with trousers that let you jump inhumanly high and gadgets to outsmart your enemies you're the kind of spy everyone wants to be.+Great art style+Great level design and gadget design+Unique gameplay, the first gadget you unlock (the Crosslink) allows you to rewire anything electrical so that you can bypass the security measures of the building, trap guards or create new paths to your objective+Interesting story with interesting characters combined with great writing+You get upgrades for your bullfrog trousers which makes them charge faster and jump higher+A number of different gadgets to unlock, each introducing a new gameplay mechanic+Gunpoint has a great editor which allows you to create your own missions and share them through the Steam workshop+The main story takes place over 20 missions and how long each one takes depends on how good you are at the game and the main story is very replayable due to how good the game's mechanics are+If you just want to play the puzzles you can skip all of the story but I'm not sure why you would want to+You can trick guards in to doing all kinds of things, from trapping themselves to killing other guards+Has Steam achievements and Trading Cards-The story is very short at approximately 3 hours but the game does have a lot of replayability and there is also the editor mode to keep you busyVerdict:9.5An outstandingly good stealth puzzle game that is an absolute steal at its price, a must buy for fans of stealth games and puzzle games alike.El K.

												Richard Conway: Professional spy. Amateur electrician. Weaponized jerk.Gunpoint is an excellent stealth puzzle game that excels not only in core game mechanics but also in ambience. Never has face-smashing into windows been so fun as you hack into computers, rewire closed-circuit security systems, and tackle unsuspecting guards. It features 23 short but sweet levels spread across 5 clients. It also gives a semblance of choice by providing the player with various modes of discourse wherein you can opt to use the many humorous lines provided or converse in a more serious tone.Here's what else you can expect if you decide to play the game:- appropriately awesome jazzy music- great implementation of steam workshop (just check out all the great maps!)- multiple ways to play the game- humourous main character- lots of faceplants			"

												Very different game but really fun. It took me a while to buy this game. It had been on sale before, but I looked at it and thought 'Nope, won't like it... probably waste of money'. Damn, I was so wrong. I wish I had bought it sooner. Gunpoint really surprised me. Never played a game like this one before. Very simple and easy to play but very difficult sometimes. You really have to think and pay attention in order to solve each stage. Really entertaining. You just can't stop playing it until the end. Found the game a little bit short. Finished it twice and got all achievements in about 10 hours. Wanted more. Hope they do Gunpoint 2. Bought it on sale but I believe it's worth the full price. I recommend! And I still want more...

The interesting use of stealth, hacking, puzzles and the level design is just superb. It's just a brilliant indie game that any type of gamer can enjoy.

												This is a great example of a incredibly well done indie game. Absolutely flawless in every aspect I can think of. From graphical representation, gameplay mechanics, level progress to humour and level design, I loved it.You are in a role of one Richard Conway, a freelance thief, or a cat burglar (I like the way it sounds) who finds himself in a tricky position at the start of the game and has to complete all sorts of missions for his multiple employers to get himself out of the trouble, and learn some secrets along the way. The story itself is very interesting and made me play just one more mission, so I won't spoil any of it, just so you can feel the same way I did.The main gameplay mechanic we have control over is Crosslink, with which we can rewire the building's electrical skeleton, which consits of various doors, switches, lights, alarms and such that we will manipulate to help us get to the intel we want. Different types of guards make the gameplay more challenging and force you to plan your way more carefully. The missions start out easy and ramp the difficulty up as you progress in the game. After every mission a new contract will be ready for you along with the amount you will recieve upon it's completion.The characters are very well done, and I really liked the main guy's style and humourous way of dealing with things along the way. You can upgrade your character with new gadgets after every mission, and your own stats, such as longer and quicker jumps.Fluid gameplay makes playing this game an absolute delight and I have not encountered any bugs in two playthroughs (except for some typos, but it's ok :)) I've gone through.Oh and there is a level editor, so you can create your own levels and spice it up with everything you got, or you can play other people's creations if you are not a creative type.Overall:+ fluid and responsive controls+ simple, yet aesthetically pleasing graphics+ great story+ level design+ humour+ level editor- absolutely nothingRecommended to everyone, this is a little masterpiece and go do yourself a favour and play it right now.  10/10			"

												Gunpoint is a 2D puzzle game where the basic goal on each level is to avoid/kill guards and hack a computer, then escape. The main gameplay mechanic involves rewiring switches and electronic devices. For example, if you need to open a locked door, you can link a light switch to the door so that it opens when you press the switch. As the levels progress you can create lots of complex solutions. Walk in front of a surveillance camera to summon an elevator which sets off a sound detector which opens a trap door causing a guard to fall to his death. The story revolves around corporate espionage and murder, and the whole game has a great sense of humour. Character dialogue is text only, and the graphics and sound are basic, but the music is pretty good. Unfortunately Gunpoint is quite short. I finished in under 3 hours, although you can make choices that change how the story plays out which adds some replay value. Its definitely worth playing, but perhaps best to pick it up on sale.			"

												Game is great, but also buggyGameplay: its a puzzle platformer with stealth elements.I finished the game in 3 hours(and i tried to do it mostly perfect the first time, if i rushed i could finished it faster), and then total 10 hours for all the achievements. (i would do that faster if the game wasnt buggy)Bad stuff:- Resolution!!! If you set a resolution in game, and exit the game, that game resolution will stay on windows, so you need change it in windows EVERY TIME. You cant change the resolution inside your game, it will restart your mission. - Game wont minimize properly, even when it runs in windowed mode, it just wants to be on top (alt tab + random clicking did the trick once)- Game looks zoomed in/out on different resolutions. which is weird... 1080p too small (but i played it like that) 800x640 you can only see a small part of the map, it limits you on small resolutions.- NO BULLETS - i think this is a bug, some call it a feature. but when you get your gun, you get 6 bullets, and even if you load your save and you used a bullet before, bullet doesn't come back. There is no fix, i needed to get a bullet for the achievement, i used a gun a few times just to make the guards start searching or to start the sound detector. so i played the entire game from the start, and purchased a resolver at the end. (None of the tips and tricks i found online fix this problem)- Undo feature (to make you go back is useful ) but its weird at the same time, it just returns you sometimes in weird places/random times, one time 0 seconds, other times 60+seconds- Save feature sucks, lets say i finished a mission and started it again then aborted, it would just delete all my progress from before (no ladder boards, nothing to challenge me to do it better) Got on all maps a+ and im not satisfied.Meh: - Tools, i think developers were thinking, lets add more stuff just to add content, and lets add this gadget, and that gadget... most of the stuff is not even needed. you can finish the entire game just by using the jumping and rewire tool (even the last level, i successfully finished it without the door breaking thing, that the game said it was required). i used some tools just to get the achievement. ( I WOULD USE THEM MORE IF I HAD MANY BATTERIES TO USE THEM ) - Enemies, there are only 3 types of enemies, normal guard, tough guard, and elite guard. i would prefer if there were more enemies, with different abilities.- Maps, most of them are ok, but the only thing that challenged me for a few minutes was the last one map middle part puzzle (because of the resolution it took me a while to see what is going where) the rest are mostly simple. i would add some traps, for example if you make a mistake that the game locks you in a room (That happend only once to me on the last map)- Weird money system. i have no clue how much money will i get and what is rewarded the most, stealth, speed, killing, not killing? - Cameras are there mostly to help me, and not the enemy.Good stuff:- The gameplay is good, you can go full stealth ninja ghost :) or full psycho.- Story is ok- It has some humor- Workshop (level editor)What would i add:- Bonus missions (Side missions) not related to the story, that could give me more batteries(and higher battery capacity), so that i could use the tools properly, and not just save them for the achievements.- More enemies as i said above (different enemies), lazy/sleeping guards, guards that dont move, maybe civilians. - Maps that i would add, Monitor room, where guards would watch the cameras, and when i appear or rewire them they would go to inspect. Blocked rooms, where i cant use my rewire tool. - I dont know, im just brainstorming...			"

												Gunpoint is a stealth game that throws you right into the middle of a conspiracy which threatens to take away your freedom. Murder! Did you commit it? Will the corporations manage to trap you in their web of lies? Who will make it out alive? What is your fate, and the fate of others? Gunpoint will answer all these questions as you play it again and again. Probably one of the most interesting mixed genre games I've played in awhile. You've got stealth, you've got puzzling of a sort, and you've got platforming. Combine them all together and you end up with a masterful combination that takes you on a journey of punching, zapping, and eventually even kicking things into people in order to infiltrate and discover ""Who dun it?""Sound: For the game and the setting, the music is so appropriate. It just keeps you in the mood to keep going even when you've failed a few times. The few sound effect assets aside from the music are simple, to the point, and not bothersome. Graphics: This game as very simple graphics, but they do exactly what the dev intended. Though they aren't complex, they do exactly what they need to in order to keep the game going. You can tell the dev put some work into the various levels.Controls: Very simple, responsive, and intuitive. Except for one small bug, discussed below. Gameplay: I had no real issues though I thought I did till I discovered the reason I was frustrated. When you first start crosslinking, a popup at the bottom of the screen tells you how it works. Click and drag to connect two things, and click on something to remove the connection. Somehow I made it through half the game before it decided to finally put the information on my screen when I was completing a mission. Prior to that, I was having issues disconnecting things, sometimes they would, sometimes they wouldn't. Perhaps it's my fault for not figuring it out on my own, yet personally, I think that's a devs job. But I wouldn't know how to report this anyways.... Either way - Now you know in case you run into the same issue. Click and drag to connect.... Click and release to disconnect. Now go punch people in the face... No really. Do it. Overall: 9/10 - This game has great replay value at least a few times to discover the various arcs. I haven't completed them all myself, but even on your first playthrough you can tell that this will be an option later. Sadly the game has been bundled, but even so, the game is worth it. Personally, I'd probably try to get a coupon, but it's still not a bad way to spend $10, but better if it was six or seven instead. Definitely will go kicking more things later. And Punching. Lots more Punching. Punching is love... Punching is life. Eat, Pray, Punch.  "

Gunpoint is one of the most unique and enjoyable indie games I’ve played this year. The innovative gameplay style, the storyline, the dialogue, music and aesthetic all came together to create a very nifty little package.SettingYou play as Richard Conway, a trenchcoat-wearing freelance spy. Immediately after donning your newly-received Bullfrog Hypertrousers (high-tech pants that allows you to make massive leaps), you’ll be summoned by Selena Delgado, an employee for gun manufacturer Rooke. Unfortunately, by the time you ascend the elevators to see her, you find that Selena has been shot. Even worse is the fact that security cameras in the building indicate that you were in the building at the time of the murder, thereby making you the prime suspect.  You're then tasked with clearing your name and finding the true murderer. Throughout the game, you quickly discover that there’s a huge rivalry in the city between two weapons manufacturers, Rooke and Intex, and the murder of Selena Delgado fits somewhere in between this. There are several twists and turns in the story as the mystery surrounding the murder is slowly brought to light. It’s not the most original or innovative story ever told, but the game breathes extra life into the story to life by giving the main character so much personality. Much of the narrative is told in the form of text messages between you and the people giving you missions to fulfil. During these text-based conversations, you’ll often be given a conversation tree, allowing you to pick your response. Whilst the majority of choices don’t affect the direction of the storyline, many of the lines are incredibly humorous and witty. If you want your version of Richard Conway to be a complete smartass, you’re in luck. It’s been a while since a game has made me laugh out loud like this one. GameplayDespite looking somewhat like a 2D-platformer, Gunpoint is a puzzle game at heart. It plays like a 2D version of Portal in many ways. Rather than using the portal gun, you're instead given two other major abilities that you'll use to complete objectives.The first of these is your epic super jump, which allows you to jump massive distances and with force great enough to break glass windows. You aim your jump with your left mouse button (which will draw an arc) and release it to make the jump. For whatever reason, you’re also able to climb walls like Spiderman, but we’ll leave that alone for now. The other major ability comes from your ""Crosslink"", a device that allows you to rewire circuits. It sounds complicated, so perhaps it’s best illustrated with examples. Whilst anyone can flick a light switch, only  the roaming security guards have the ability to activate the switch to open the security doors. To work around this, you can use your crosslink to hack the light switch so that the switch that usually turns on the light instead activates the door-switch, which opens the security door for you. A more complicated scenario would involve you hacking a motion detector, which upon activation will cause an elevator to move down to a certain level, which subsequently activates the sound detector (which hears the “ding” of the elevator), which then opens the vault door containing the computer that you have to hack to complete the objective.The game becomes far more complicated in later levels due to the addition of extra circuits, represented by a separate colours. Only objects of the same colour can be connected, and activating these additional circuits in the first place requires you to access a point to “wirejack”. It adds an extra layer of challenge and forces you to be more creative in your approach. Aside from the main objective, each level also includes several optional objectives, which usually boils down to either minimising violence, ensuring no witnesses are alive, or hacking a laptop that’s placed in the level. Performing these optional objectives rewards you with a higher grade that’s given to you at the end of the level, although getting higher grades doesn’t appear to reward you in any way (other than, well, bragging rights I guess). Upon completing each level, you’re rewarded with a certain amount of cash, which can be used in between levels to purchase several tools that’ll make your life a bit easier. The Hushcracker, for example, allows you to go flying through windows without making a sound. Whilst I would question the realism of such a device in the real world, the point is that it works, and it helps you navigate around the security guards like a ninja. Whilst there’s probably an ideal way to complete each level, the game gives you a butt-tonne of freedom in order to find your own way through. The game encourages trial-and-error, and is very forgiving when you make a mistake due to the fact that it kindly autosaves every few seconds. Upon dying, the game gives you a choice as to where you’d like to restart. Since there’s nothing in the world that frustrates me more than re-doing simple segments of a game over and over again, this is stupendously appreciated. Tom Francis, you’re doing God’s work here.If there’s any gripe with the game that I have, it would have to be the short length. Sadly, you’ll reach the end of Gunpoint before the 3-hour mark. Clever and humorous achievements (probably the best I've seen in a long time) might extend the time a little, but overall you’ll likely be so enamoured with the game that you can’t help but wish there was just a little more of it to go around. Luckily, the game features a level editor and Steam Workshop integration, which allows you to both create, share and download levels from other people. PresentationThe game takes place in a very simple pixelated 2-D art style found so commonly in the indie industry. It looks absolutely fine in its own right, but playing at the higher resolutions make certain objects or switches just a tad too small to see. Furthermore, the game looks a bit dark, which can make certain security personnel (notably the all-in-black Professionals) a bit difficult to discern at first. Other than that, you’ll hear no more complaints from me about the aesthetics. Also included is a very jazzy soundtrack that appropriately accompanies and builds on the dark, crime-filled motif that makes up the games setting.Overall impressionDespite all the hype surrounding the game on release and all the wonderful reviews that the game had, I really wasn’t expecting much from it. Needless to say, this short journey that ended way too soon completely blew my expectations and more. The beauty of the game is embedded in the simplicity and addictiveness of the game mechanics and the humorous, tongue-in-cheek writing that complements the dark tale. Do yourself a favour and buy this game.			"

Click on the comment button of the review for full review if you are looking from my profile. I had already finish this game several time outside of steam before finishing it several times more while on steam therefor my playtime is not reflective of the game itself. Should be 3 - 4 hours tops.  GUNPOINT Developer: Tom Franchis and others.Release Date: 3 June 2013Genre: Platformer, 2D Espionage, Detective, PuzzleOfficial Website: http://www.pentadact.com/ What is Gunpoint? A stealth action platformer game made by an ex PC-GAMER editor Tom Franchis using gamemaker. The game stars you as Conway, a freelance spy for hire who also happens to be a hat fancier. The game has you break into building quietly or if you happen to be a jerk, loudly, to accomplish your objectives and mission before getting the hell out. Also comes with the unique twist in the form of the wirejack module. Option Menu Very GoodYou have a wide variety of options to choose from rebindeable keys to colourblind options to the large range of resolution on offer. The only issue is if this incredibly basic game lags on your laptop then the best you can do is lower the resolution since there is no graphical option settings. Graphic GoodThe game is a stealth 2D espionage game therefor the main concern should be clean graphic style and easy to identify elements all which Gunpoint delivers very well. While the basic sprite based graphics aren't too much of a looker they do have their own charm in Gunpoint noir inspired setting. At the very least you won't confuse the background with the buttons. Music/Sound Effect[MERGED] Music:The game has a soothing nostalgic jazz based music while in the menu screen and a quick jumpy music while in mission. SFX: Very good, other than the fact that gunshot sounds like popcap gun, everything else is near perfect. Especially the SFX of the glass being smashed and guards face being pulverized. Controls ExcellentYou use the mouse to aim your bullfrog module and alt button to toggle your wirejack. For most part Conway controls well enough to not feel like you're controlling an ice skater in the middle of a competition.  Gameplay Now that I have written at length about Gunpoint other point lets touch upon its gameplay mechanic. Your character has a basic device called the Bullfrog Propulsion Module which is the mainstay of most of the mechanic. You press the left mouse button to aim a reticule and releasing the result in which Conway will propel himself rather weakly towards the direction you have given him. The other highlight is the wirejack system where through a series of module you can buy Conway will turn the electrical grid to his advantage by rewiring doors, calling elevator and other such gameplay elements.Other than that, it is a fairly standard stealth game.  Guards have cones of vision that you can sneak through using the walls and ceiling or if you are feeling particularly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you can just Bullfrog straight into them and punch them in the face. That is a legitimate gameplay element. But its not just 1 type of guard no, more will be introduced as you play through the story mode.Mission usually involves you breaking into a building and either retrieve something or to hack something, basic stuff but the level design and short length of the game keeps it fresh.After a mission your results will be tallied and you can acquire a skillpoint used to upgrade the Bullfrog charge time and power, the money you earn can also be used to purchase modules for Kenway which ranges from snuffing out the noise he makes when he smashes through glass to him having a gun to literally make a guard stand still at Gunpoint.Another thing that should be touch upon is that while the game itself is linear the story outcome itself is not, choices of dialogue you made and the result that comes from it will indirectly influence how other character will think of you and will go so far as to change the ending itself. Conclusion Recommendation? Yes I will say this a yes old chap. Its a fun quirky little game that does not overstay its welcome while having a rather deep story that encourages a few playthrough to get all of the ending. If you were to trust my words then yes I would tell you to get it and to get it at your convenience. Scoring Methology:-S-Rank: excellent-A-Rank: very good-B-Rank: solid-C-Rank: satisfactory-D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: S-Rank. [Short Quirky And Fun]Credit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help! Extra Note This game has hidden achievement so the achievement hunter out there might want to use a guide to get it all but otherwise the normal achievement itself is easy to get.The Special and Exclusive edition contains some extra goodies but if you do not feel like it then just get the one with the soundtrack, the tune is rather relaxing.Also has steam workshop support so you can upload your own level or play with others to expand your playtime.

												It took me a while to get around to this game, and by the time I did I'd heard many good things but not a lot of specifics. I wasn't disappointed.Brief but often dense building-infiltration missions are punctuated by well-written and often funny dialogue sequences, and upgrades increase the number of ways you can approach situations. It feels like a more stealth-based, zoomed-out, 2D version of infiltrating an open-ended area in the original Deus Ex, in that the level has a goal, but it's set up as a playground to allow you to explore your abilities and exploit opportunistic, er, opportunities. It doesn't take long to get through this, but I enjoyed every moment of it, and some significant branching decision points in the game and in the dialogue make me wonder how things would change around in a second play.

												Fantastic game. That is what Gunpoint is.Gunpoint is a stealth platformer puzzle game that has you hacking terminals as a freelance spy. It has beautiful 2D pixel graphics and fun gameplay.Your character uses a gadget to link devices to each other in order to advance through the levels. I can't tell you much more than that, you really have to see it in action. It's a cool device. The spy will also wear trousers that allows him to fall out of windows and jump really high without injuring himself. It can also be used a weapon; launch yourself into an enemy to tackle him, for example.The story is clever and doesn't take itself too seriously. Unfortunately, the game is kinda short. It took me a good 5 hours to complete and left me wanting more. Yes, there's the level editor and you can perfect the already completed levels, but still. After the last mission the other levels can be completed in record time.I had tremendous fun playing it and I hope more levels, free or DLC, will be released sometime in the future. It's ab-so-lute-ly worth the price.[Rating: 88/100]			"

												Gunpoint is an interesting little - uhhh... puzzle(?) game...? I'm not sure what to call it... yeah, I guess ""puzzle"" or ""puzzle/strategy"" makes the most sense. You play as a little trenchcoat-wearing pixel guy whose mission is to infiltrate a series of buildings, steal something, and escape without getting caught or killed. While most levels do have a clear-cut ""solution"", there are a variety of ways you can go about your mission, thanks to various special abilities and upgrades you get along the way. The two biggest tools at your disposal are a jumping ability that allows you to leap up to (or fall down from) crazy heights without dying, and something called a ""crosslink"" that allows you to hack into a building's electrical network and rewire stuff on-the-fly. For example, you can wire a nearby switch to open a door on another floor, or trigger an elevator remotely to distract a guard. The crosslink mechanic allows for a crap-load of possibilities, which is good, as that's the main meat of the game. You can also utilize violence as a means to an end in your solutions as well, either by punching out guards, threatening them at gunpoint, or outright killing them. Tying all of this together is a story full of twists, turns, and turns that twist around again. Frankly, it's kind of convoluted, but it does all make sense by the end (assuming you pay attention). The entire game can be completed in roughly 3-4 hours, so it's not overly long. I suppose this could be a bullet point in the ""negatives"" column, but I felt it was a decent enough amount of content for the price. It's fun while it lasts, and is worth checking out.Technical notes: while the game itself is fundamentally good, a few technical issues do bring it down a bit. I ran into several bugs in my playthrough that caused critical elements of levels to stop working as they should, forcing a restart. It's not a huge deal, as most levels can be completed in just a few minutes, but it is worth noting. Additionally, there are some really weird resolution issues with the game. If you set it at a high resolution, you can see more of each level, but that also means that the tiles and sprites that make up the levels get smaller, making it more difficult to play (at least, I thought so). This issue can be solved by setting the game to a lower resolution so that the important areas of each level fit mostly within that area (I found 1600x900 to be a decent size, or possibly slightly larger depending on your monitor).

												Wow.I got this game as part of a humble bundle a while ago and I had no idea what it was, so naturally I went in fairly opinionless. As soon as I started the game there is a small cutscene that welcomes you to the game and I loved it immediately from then. This game is one of the few games I can say that is nearly totally original being a weird platformer hack-them-up stealth game.Gunpoint is a game about breaking into buildings with the aim of stealing data from computers, simple enough. But the way you must make your way through these levels is by rewiring circuits to activate doors, alarms and even enemy guns. The whole game can be made slightly easier and arguably more fun by buying addons like the ability to use your own pistol or smash glass silently. As you can probably tell I don't have many hours on gunpoint and thats probably because it isn't a very big game. The actual game took me about 2 hours to complete and I just needed to play more, thank god there is the workshop. I apologise that I can't comment on the storyline as I gave up following it after about mission 2, however from what I did read, the game gives you a lot of opportunities to choose your own path in a humourous and personalised way. The ""choose your path"" style to the storyline also grants you the opportunity to multiple endings and ways to kill the final boss.All in all, the only downside I have about this game is the length of it, I do feel however that this can be overlooked with the addition of the workshop. The gameplay is original, the graphics are awesome, the soundtrack is seriously amazing and it has one of the best checkpoint systems in a game ever (allows you to choose one of 3 checkpoints at time increments). Is it worth the £6 ($9.30ish)? Totally, I couldn't recommend this game more to any kind of gamer... seriously, get it now!I would have to give this game a strong 9/10.EDIT: I actually worked and got all the achievements in this game! totally worth the effort!

												Well, it's a great game. Fun stealth action with puzzles you got to solve along the way. Great hacking mechanics. In fact they are pulled off better in this game than the first Watchdogs game. Lots of meta humor within the story. The game is not very long although not too short either. Took me about 4 1/2 hours to beat. There is some re-playability with the level editor. Play your own levels or from the gaming community. Graphics are simple and nice for that pixel 2D gameplay. Love the noire soundtrack. 8/10			"

												This game is a very fun journey, with multiple different endings and storylines. You are able to use everything to your advantage, including wiring, lights and even the switches themselves! The visuals are good and each 'map' is different from the last, making Gunpoint an immersive experience. It has just the right level of shadiness and stealth as you would expect from a game about a guy in a trenchoat, but also gives you a bit of action and panic to keep you enthralled in the gameplay. I would give this game an 8/10, and I would recommend it.			"

Posted: July 1, 2015
-Quick Review-Gunpoint is an indie puzzle game with loose ties to “stealth” and “technology”, Gunpoint was developed by Suspicious Developments and released 2013.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The story is all in written format, somedays I feel like reading all that is writen in a video game, other times I see a chunk of text and think “I don't really care” and skip right into the mission.Gunpoint lets you skip dialogue and jump right into the puzzle solving action if you feel so inclined, however the story is quite well written. You're a detective and have multiple choices for interaction with your clients. (Naturally I was as condescending and insulting as possible – the reactions were very much worth it!)Gameplay: The game controls start out very simple, jump, and movement. You jump with the mouse button, and you use ASDW to move right or left, and climb up or down. As you complete various missions you earn skill points that you can spend to improve your skills, and money to unlock upgrades. Some missions require certain upgrades to progress, but generally the game is very doable with minimum upgrades.Generally there are two elements to the various puzzles you face while playing Gunpoint. Firstly, you need to keep out of the site of guards. This is where the “stealth” tag gets placed on the game. The guards line of site is pretty standard for most games of this genre... Secondly, there is “wiring” you do some very rudimentary “wiring”, for example you can wire a switch to turn off a light, call an elevator, ...and when the elevator arrives it makes a noise and that triggers a sound sensor to open the door in front of you.Achievements: There are two types of Achievements in this game: Hidden, and visible.I personally find “hidden” achievements annoying because you can find them by looking at global statistics anyway. (The purpose of hidden achievements are for people to accidentally stumble across them while playing the game.)After your first play through you will probably have roughly 40% of the achievements, a second play through will earn you another 40% (as long as you do things differently). After my second time through I simply replayed the levels required.As a side note, you don't need to reset your game and start from scratch like I did, you could just replay old levels. Since the game is such a fast play through anyway, it hardly maters if you reset or not.One final note, for achievement hunters, this game is an easy 100% completion with relatively less commitment for achievement work.Price: Gunpoint is priced at $9.99. I personally spent 8.6 hours playing the game. I played through twice, and earned all the achievements. As far as I'm concerned the game value comes out nearly perfectly at 1 dollar an hour. (this is my personal method of measuring a game's play value)If you're tight on money you could certainly wait for a sale, however... the developers are indie, so supporting them is good!Conclusion: The game itself was fun, the humor in Gunpoint was hilarious, the story was well written, the gameplay was fun and easy to learn, the achievements were all relatively easy to get but more importantly funny to get (generally the achievement text is a joke based on what's happening in game), the price is as fair as you can expect.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys 2D games, indie titles, puzzle games, or “stealth” types of games....Maybe all that matters is that I now have the ability to kick down doors. Thanks for reading my review!------Edits and updates------Edit/Update July 01, 2015:Spellcheck			"

												A hidden gem, a masterpiece of a game...This game is the defenition of an indie developer absolutely destroying AAA developers. Yes, the game is short and there are a few bugs here and there (nothing game braking, mind you) BUT:- THE MUSIC IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME, I absolutely love jazz and I am a pioneer of it in everything I do. This music is absolutely amazing, it gives me goose bumps. The music also fits perfectly with everything while still staying unique and having its own 'je ne se quoi'.- THE STORY IS FANTASTIC, why is content like this never visible in other, higher budget titles? This is fantastic, and the reason for that is because the writer of that story knew how to think for himself. He didn't just take a popular game story genre and put that in, he actually THOUGHT for himself; which is what video game stories are all about - being unique.- THE HUMOUR - would get an achievment for punching a guard in the face more than needed again.- THE MECHANICS!!!!!, never, ever, EVER before seen mechanics, stealth and just overall gameplay. This game puts other expensive stealth titles to shame AND I PICKED THIS GAME UP ON 50% OFF.Verdict? 100/10 - where is the sequel?			"

												To begin with, this game's story is actually pretty short. Even if you are going to spend quite a time analyzing each level you will probably spend 3-4 hours max. However, it got big replayability potential, because not only each level supports different solutions, but also ways of playing it. It allows you either rely on your planning and tactics or also just pure luck. One of the things that I really liked is that you can choose whatever equipment you want at any point of the game (If you have enough money) so If you buy pistol you can refund it anytime and grab something else instead. Few things that I think would be a nice addition are ability to create a noise or sound that would attract nearby guard and being able to remove Gatecrasher ability from custom levels would make them more harder.

												Genre - Film Noir Sci-Fi Puzzle GameI was given this game when it was on sale and although I wouldn't have gone for it on 1st impressions I decided to give it a go. I actually really enjoyed the 2-3 hours I stuck with it. There is a story to guide you through the short levels and differnet waysto to solve each each level. Most of the game involves re-wiring switches and devices to other devices in specific orders. You then need to navigate past different types of guards to get to each objective. Upgrades are bought and earned after each level. You can also make different choices to get different achievements for extra re-playability. The graphical style fits the game as long as you pick the right resolution for your monitor. If you want a quick, quirky puzzle game with guns then this is for you!			"

												Short but incredible game.Noir style story, great humor, beautiful graphics, fun puzzles.Not a huge fan of having to restart the whole game to get all achievements but if you're not obsessed with achievement hunting that shouldn't bother you.Even better it comes with a level editor offering a nice way of extending its playability.It is quite a short game for $10 but if it's on sale GET IT.

												One of my favorites.This game has a very good screenplay it's also comical,no special skills required and has a great workshop community where people share their custom scenaries for others to play them,this makes the game almost never ending and more challenging.You play as a private investigator and help some other characters on getting hidden info inside of strongly guarded pc's.Pixel and draw graphics and some great surprises .The jump mechanics are so relaxing!.Stealth is adviced but not in all missions.Btw i started to play it again after purchasing the game ""Ronin"" which is very similar but damned hard and with a poor screenplay,made me miss a lot the simple beauty of Gunpoint.10/10			"

Easy to learn and hard to master, there simply isn't much to say here, since the game does such a wonderful job of giving the player options that you'll just have to find out for yourself what is and isn't possible.Made by one man in game maker, my only true complaint is that we have yet another indie game that looks like pixel art.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Suspicious Developments Publishers: Suspicious Developments Initial release: June 2013Genre: Action, Strategy, Stealth #Worth/NotWorth: #DefinitelyWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationThis is one the most unique games I've ever laid my hands on.. so to speak. You play as super cool ultra spy man. With the ability to jump to absurd heights and stick on anything, walls and ceilings included. Each mission has some preamble to give some context and is very clever and quite funny. Your objectives include (mostly hacking into a monitor) or picking up laptops. The crux of the gameplay is staying out of sight. Turning off lights, hanging off the ceiling and tackling the guards. One simple punch should do the trick. Preceding to the objective and extracting. Buts that not all. You soon discover that you are magic.. or least have the ability to connect things electrically from great distances. This process is called crosslink. You can switch between regular vision and crosslink with a simple flick of your mouse wheel. There are multiple colors which basically identify the different circuits in the building or buildings on the map. You can try things like connecting a switch to a door so that when flicked it operates the door. I'd elaborate but experimenting is its own reward, the proverbial 'EMMERGENT GAMEPLAY' that marketing teams get so excited about. There are sockets, alarms, cameras, sound detectors, elevators among other things for you to experiment with. These are sometimes puzzle-esk but mostly serve as tools to infiltrate undetected. You die real fast. One shot one kill but what's great is restarting is almost instantaneous making experimenting really fun and interesting. You can even choose to start at different intervals some seconds away from when you met your demise. There are also gadgets that require batteries that can can aid you in infiltration and those things are fun but the best way to play is to get real familiar with and into crosslink to prevail, the most rewarding way if I was to give a suggestion. Arguably, the ability to crash through windows silently may be a bit over powered but that ability is mitigated by using a lot of your batteries. In a recent update after I finished the campaign twice (it's relatively short, about 4-5 hours) user created levels are now available in the steam workshop. Which invariably as user created content goes has some truly great levels and some others that are less than stellar. THE GISTI love this game, one of the very very few games I bothered to actually go after all the achievements and actually get them (as some are hidden within dialogue choices and gameplay actions and are very rewarding) plus enjoyed the process of doing so as well as just experimenting with the mechanics. I'm not entirely sure if this was exclusively the work of Tom Francis or if someone helped but regardless of that. This absolute gem is worth every penny. More so even.Follow my curation for more "

												Gunpoint’s a clever game. It’s clever in all the ways you’d expect a good game to be, of course; It’s got a distinctive art style and soundtrack that effectively create the feeling of a noir-inspired, near future world. It’s also got a nicely refined difficulty and progression curve, holding your hand and building your strength without insulting you. There’s a bunch of other core gameplay elements Gunpoint does well – yet it is not really these that which make it so clever.The first thing that really does this, and which catapults the game into being something more special, come in the form of its core gameplay feature - the Crosslink. In short, it’s a device that lets you rewire one device to another, changing the way they operate. This can be simple as wiring up a switch to open up a door instead of turning on a light... Or it can be as complicated as using a lift to trigger a sound sensor, which in turn turns off a light, causing a curious guard to wander over to the lightswitch, which electrocutes a socket elsewhere when flipped, which in turn knocks out another guard. It sounds confusing, but it’s surprisingly intuitive and easy to get used to; it’s not long before you’ll start to feel like a real Crosslink expert. This is clever in itself, but the real brilliance comes from the fact that’s there’s no real negative result to messing around with this power that brings your fun coming to a screeching standstill. Either your elaborate Crosslink scheme succeeds, making you feel like a diabolical mastermind, or it ends up falling apart, at which point you’re just eager to refine your strategy and work out what went wrong instead of being infuriated. There’s always the third result that your plan was so stupid that it ends up with a door swinging open and knocking you flying, you won’t care regardless, because that’s just hilarious. Another way the game’s quite ingenious is that you’re free to play it however you want. Want to buy a gun and just shoot every problem you face? You can do that. Want to use your super jump to arc gracefully through the air and silently smash through a window like a twisted, trench coat wearing Spiderman? Go ahead! It’s possible for every player to have a different experience on a level just because of all the different ways you can approach each situation. I myself went for a no-upgrade run on my second playthrough, which presents its own challenges and its own little moments. The game itself even subtly reacts to your play style – there’s a nice easter egg for if you get too punch happy on a guard, and the story and future missions can even subtly change based on how you’ve played previously. Smart! Again. This ability to choose you own play style even leaks into the story – while your choices here don’t affect things that much, you can still choose to respond to your client’s calls deadly seriously, or just make endless deadpan comments and jokes about the absurdity of the situation. The writing’s witty and genuinely funny at points, and while the story itself got a little overly complicated for my tiny brain to comprehend as it neared its end, in general it’s compelling and has a nice few twists and turns that keep things moving well. It’s all... Well, I think you can guess what I’m going to say.Overall, it’s hard to fault Gunpoint. There’s possibly an argument to be made that it’s a little short, but as noted above, there’s tons of replay value that comes in changing your technique, and the fact you can build your own levels is just more reason to keep playing. Overall, this is a smart and entertaining title that’s certainly worthy of your time.  "

The only problem with the game is that it ended too quickly.I highly recommend it.9/10 Better than Watch Dogs "

												Basically, you play a bad♥♥♥♥♥secret agent spy man.I honestly did not pay attention to the story because I was having too much fun playing it. I did eventually read some of the dialogue that takes place before each mission and it put a smile on my face as it is humorously written and its nice to see that even in game. Smashing guards through windows, remodeling their faces through means of punching and causing general prankster shenanigans feels rewarding in a strange way.Most missions will task you with stealing some data from a computer in a secure (or so they thought) building with guards, locked doors, security cameras and such devices. But once you've reached specific points in the building, you can hack it all. Hack the guards gun to fire when you flick a light switch, make a wall socket buzz out electricity killing a guard when another guard walks through a motion sensor one floor above... its all possible.The fun part is, you can ignore it all and do it your way. All levels can be beat without any guards noticing you were even there - the true spy way. You can go in, kill everyone and make Rambo proud or just have fun hacking everything you can. It is a puzzle game as its core, it can be as tough is you want it to be - killing everyone will generally be easier than going in sneaky peaky like.Its worthy to mention the soundtrack is fantastic and blends with the game nicely. I wouldn't penny pinch if I was on the fence about getting the special edition. The main story will take about 1-4 hours to complete, depending on how you play and how bad you are at puzzle games. It does come with an easy to use level editor and steam workshop support where other people's levels are shared. This potentially gives countless hours of replay-ability.			"

Yes, it's a bit on the short side, but is fairly replayable.Due to the small game time, I'd try and get it in a sale. Gunpoint is definitely still worth the full price, it's just not that large a game. Overall, a VERY good game.			"

While gunpoint is a very short-yet-sweet game it offers alot of replay-ability and puzzles that will the best spy to beat. Gunpoint is a 2-D game because it is too good for 3-D renderings. With a good story and a lovable main character, Gunpoint is one that will stay in my favorites list.			"

I wish the game were longer, but it is what it is.

												My favourite 2D puzzler. I dislike most puzzle-platformers, but this one is very light on platforming: you can clearly see where you’re going to land before you make a jump. And it autosaves every 5 seconds or so, you don’t have to replay the whole level if you screw up. Great gameplay, story, writing, music, pixel art. It is quite short, though. The biggest flaw is its poor support of highres monitors (there’s no scaler, the sprites look tiny in 2560×1440 or blurry in 1280×720 (with hardware scaling); the only solution is to use windowed mode and Windows magnifier to scale things up—inconvenient). The new version uses a better engine (the game was originally made in GameMaker: Studio, I’ve no idea how they managed to port it over). Full Steam Workshop support for custom levels.			"

												Awesome game. Too short. Cool atmosphere, fun puzzle solving.You play as a sardonic (darkly humoured/ironic) spy-for-hire, its a ""film noir/gumshoe/detective"" aesthetic with some really funny, self-aware, and crass humour throughout the campaign (see Acknowledged Ludonarrative Dissonance achievement). You're faced with a few narrative changing decisions, and objectives that require you to use unlockable items (some cool/funny ones :D ) and problem solving talent to complete missions. Overall, really good level design; some missions aren't as challenging as others, but are still a lot of fun to play given the solid mechanics, humour, and punny dialogue. You'll get a good 3 hours out of the campaign, and there is a level editor to keep you coming back (although, really its the narrative/campaign/missions that make this game worthwhile).I really enjoyed this game. The aesthetics, missions, narrative, and humour were all on point to make a worthwhile purchase. Full price is a little steap for a 3 hour campaign, but if you can buy it on sale this game is an excellent example of an indie doing it right.			"

												I love music, so first for this review is the soundtrack: Incredible. It's got a great Noir-Jazz style which totally makes me want to shell out however much I must may to buy it. I hear the music and my wallet loosens in my pocket.Last time I tried writing a review for this game, I was jaded by the fact that, for some incomprehensible reason, this game runs like trash on my computer even though it can install in less than thirty seconds. After uninstalling it in anger and leaving it aside for a time, I recently decided to load it up again for the heck of it, and, despite the game running badly sometimes, I remembered that I did actually like this game.The main character is Richard Conway, a spy-for-hire. I had a joke here that had to do with the nickname ""D i c k"" (which Steam tried to censor, hence the spacing), but it sucked so I got rid of it. He happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up a prime suspect for a murder he didn't commit. He then gets dragged into a tale of intrigue, corporate espionage, and potentially corrupt police officers. I don't want to spoil anymore, but the story is very well written, with loads of snappy dialogue options and interesting characters and separate story arcs and such. The story also has some branching storylines that allow you to side with different characters.The gameplay is very smooth (when it doesn't lag like hell, which is a me problem I think), in which you control Conway and run about throughout buildings avoiding (or beating up) guards who stand in your way. There are some neat and really novel gadgets that Conway uses to traverse the level, like his Bullfrog Hypertrousers, which let him jump long distances, up walls, and close distances to things quickly. You can tackle guards and punch them many more times than is probably necessary and certainly illegal. If you noticed in the trailer, there's also plenty of opportunities to tackle a guards straight out a window. Conway also has a Crosslink, which allows him to rewire the electronics in a building. You can wire a light switch to a door, so clicking the switch opens, it, or wire the arrival of an elevator to turn off the lights on that floor. Here's a ringer for you: You can wire pressing a button to call an elevator, which will ding and trigger a sound sensor, which will turn off the lights and draw a guard to the switch, which he presses and opens a trap door for the player.Okay, so not too many situations call for anything nearly so complicated, but it is possible to create such Rube Goldberg machines out of the building's electronics, though usually there's probably a simpler solution. There are many great ways to manipuate your surroundings, turning off lights to distract and blind guards, smashing glass panes to draw attention, making guards shoot each other accidentally, and so much more. It's amazing how this little 10 dollar game managed to make hacking your environment so much more satisfying and effective than some big game like Watch Dogs or whatever. It really is perfectly done. Not to mention you have so many more other gadgets and gizmos besides the Crosslink which can do many other things or add onto your preexisting abilities.Overall, between rewiring electronics to pass through a building with ease and the ability to neutralize and bypass guards, doing missions stealthily in Gunpoint is both fairly simple and always satisfying. I went through the game the first time knocking out guards and did a fine job. On my last playthrough, I tried to be as unseen as possible, and I felt that I had so much more fun. I felt like a true ninja sometimes, and a genius at others. There's a sort of glee to finding a novel solution to a tricky electrical puzzle.I did have a huge issue with one thing: The game is just too short. I think it was maybe 3-4 hours on my first playthrough, and while it has workshop support and is DEFINITELY worth the price, I just wish there was more of it. It was super fun to expeience the story and levels, and I think there could've been lots of other cool situations, like maybe you have to infiltrate a place without power, so you have to rely on tricking guards and using them to reach your goals, or one where there's automated security, or a time trial of sorts. I'm sure stuff like that could be made in the editor, or something like it, but I feel that there's always something more special about the developer levels. High on my list of hopes and dreams is a sequel to this game.			"

												Did you ever want to be a secret agent? Or a detective who is really good at hiding in the dark? Or just like to beat the living daylights out of someone? Well, Gunpoint lets you do that, and much more. Gunpoint is a 2D indie strategy puzzle game that is visually represented via pixel art (and it’s very well done, might I add) that lets you infiltrate buildings and steal top secret data. Though, unlike most games nowadays, you can’t simply walk in and take the thing. As what the category says, you have to what war veterans would say: strategize; and invent your own solution to the level. This makes the game very interesting, for there are so many options to solve each puzzle. You can turn of lights, and attack the guards in the darkness, or just come up behind them and punch them while their comrades point their guns at you. Also, you don’t take fall damage (because ♥♥♥♥ you, physics) so jumping out of 20 story buildings is okay! Sometimes, Gunpoint can provide some hilarious gameplay. Gunpoint is exclusive with not only it’s gameplay, but also with it’s storyline. At the start, the story can be quite hard to get a grip of. But when you progress, it becomes a bit easier to understand. On that standpoint; the storyline overall, is brilliant. It’s quite interesting, dark, and sometimes humorous from time to time. Gunpoint also has a very unique little system called “Crosslink”. In this you’re able to change functions of many objects; like to link a button to open a door. This will be your main component in the game, and it’s also very fun to play with. Gunpoint is that kind of game that lets you interact with your environment and change it to your advantage. This can end up to a very interesting way to outsmart the guards, and to trick them. Each level challenges you, slowly getting harder until it’s almost cruel. All of this and more adds up to an original and superb game. To survive, you have to be smart, quick, and clever to maneuver your way around each level, can you do it?Personal Gaming Score:9/10I recommend this to those who want a mind simulator, a stealth game, and/or a good story, but Gunpoint won’t suit the needs for those are looking for games with good graphics.… and I also can’t forget about the in-game level editor!

A superbly executed 2d stealth game with a great story.Gunpoint takes the fun premise of being a private detective that can jump really high (and survive the accompanying long falls) and turns it into a stealth game with no equal. Each mission has you perform a few simple tasks (usually hack a computer or steal something), the challenge is in getting there. Which can be done in whatever way you wish.Used to guards seeing you causing a game over? Not in this game.No way forward except killing the guard always looking at the elevator? Not in this game.Time limit on the mission so you have to take risks? Not in this game!Everything is up to your play style, you can be a patient and calculating infiltrator that takes a long time but comes away unseen (and get acknowledged for both of these things) or go in fast and dirty, knocking out all guards in your path (and be acknowledged for both of these things too!).Between missions you are presented with some well-written conversations between the protagonist and his various employers.The only thing left I can consider listing are the abilities you can get over the course of the game. You can jump really high, climb all vertical surfaces, hang from ceilings, rewire electronics so a light switch on a different floor opens up a door and, yes, keep guards at Gunpoint.This game was a delight from start to finish, and my only complaint is that there should be more of it.There is an extensive level editor, and recently even steamworks support for it, but I want more of the story too!

												Simple game, simple mechanics and yet a very solid stealth experience.The main reason why I enjoyed Gunpoint (aside from it being actually a good game) is because it's a game that knows its limits: there's a plot and there's irony on the plot inside the plot itself, mechanics are solid and for just 8000$ you'll trash them all to have some fun... they even made an item just to give some kind of sense to the title of the game.Probably recommended to anyone who got interested after watching the trailer, but I actually think everyone may enjoy a good short game like this.

												Gunpoint is fun and can be appealing to all crowds, however though the puzzle factors for action gamers can be hindering.The game consists of a man who was given a suit that can absorb impact from jumping from obscene heights. The suit also gives the man amazing powers of being able to attach himself to any wall (or ceiling) and jump really high. Guards cannot be taken on directly without being shot and armored guards cannot be taken down. There are however ways to overcome certain challenges and guards that are not armored can be taken down from behind. When you do die you are given the choice to go back in time a few seconds, five seconds, and ten seconds. The pretense is to sneak around VIA jumping, stairs, elevators and steal information or an object. This is done by ""wirejacking"" certain circuits. You can ""wirejack"" or connect say a light switch to a door that you need opened, because you've connected a light switch in another room and turned off the light - that guard goes to the light switch, flicks it on thinking it'll turn on the light when it reality it opens the door for you - and now you're free to run wild. The game starts with simple colored red circuits but as the game goes on the difficulty increases.Upgrades are available throughout the game as the player collects more money. Upgrades can consist of arming your guy with a pistol or allowing for higher jumps. This game is fun don't get me wrong, the idea behind it was good. I feel though there could have been something else introduced to give me more reason to recommend it. I like the game, but I feel the rating is an honest one.RATING : 7/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

												There's a rare intersection where stealth, puzzles, and story meet, and that's where you'll find Gunpoint. It's hard to nail down as any one particular sort of game, because it does all its constituent parts so incredibly well. Much like a good book, you'll find yourself looking forward to every step of Gunpoint, even as you pine for the part you just came from.Gunpoint is the story of Richard Conway, a snarky freelance thief who specializes in corporate espionage. A fateful job lands him in the middle of a murder mystery with a surprising number of twists and side stories. Each mission sees you sent into stylish 2D high-rises to pilfer goods or information. There are guards to outwit and doors to unlock, mainly through your clever Crosslink system. Gunpoint lets you wire devices together to make them interact in unexpected ways, like a light switch unlocking a blast door or a trigger pull setting off a wall socket overload.With the Crosslink at your disposal, levels become sprawling puzzles of networked electronics. You can create incredible chain reactions of chaos and diversions, allowing you to slip past security at just the right moment. A few additional gadgets give you greater flexibility in doing just that, like spring-loaded trousers, climbing gloves, door-flattening kicks, and more. Money earned from missions are used to upgrade your abilities, but levels are designed to be completed with any or none of the optional skills unlocked.The core gameplay is plenty compelling enough, launching yourself through plate-glass windows and jury-rigging entire skyscrapers to your whims. But it's the writing that elevates Gunpoint to an instant classic. Dialogues between Conway and his clients are snappy, natural, and endlessly entertaining. You get plenty of dialogue choices, split between realistic decisions and creative variations of the same responses. You'll have every opportunity to tell your foes off or ingratiate yourself to the more sympathetic characters, and every branch is its own reward of storytelling.All of this is wrapped in a delightfully detailed pixel package and a moody noir soundtrack. The menus smack a little of programmer art but that's literally the only complaint I can level against Gunpoint. The story will last you about two hours but they're some of the best gaming has to offer, and there's Workshop support for user-created levels. I'm not saying anything about Gunpoint that hasn't been said a thousand times before, but it's worth my time if I help even one more person discover it. No matter what you enjoy about your games, you're sure to find it here.			"

												             What a suprisingly great game! You play as a spy (think Inspector Gadget) who's missions consist of stealing video tapes, taking out targets, or simpy hacking into  corporate servers to get info that you in turn can use to help the Corporation or bring it down. This game also gives you decisions story-wise that allow you to be the morally ""good"" guy or if it's your thing you can be a murderous ""bad"" guy. The story is not long by any means, you should be able to finish it in about 2-3 hours. The replayability is definitely there though. Each mission gets graded which makes you want to go back and beat your old score. You can beat the game in a few different ways. It's also backed with steam workshop, so you can create your own missions and confrontations or just play someone other persons creation.             Gameplay wise think ""Mark of the Ninja"" mixed with ""Watch Dogs"". The mechanics are heavy on stealth and strategy. There is no one way to complete a mission, instead the game gives you options on how you want to beat each level. Want to kill everyone and leave no witnesses? You can. Want to sneak past every gaurd after you hack the lights and beat the mission without killing anyone? You can. Want to just knock their asses unconscious and move freely? You can. In between each mission is a shop where you can purchase items (Revolver, etc..) and spend upgrade points (Higher jump, faster jump charge time, etc..) I would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy, nior mysteries, or dudes in trench coats.            Here's a recap of my first play-through>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>A case of crossed wires19 dead. 28 injured. 20 jobs. $13,000. The week echoed in my mind like a gunshot in an empty street.. They don't let me name names on this blog, but the person behind the hit I was investigating is probably being picked up by the East Point police about now. Killing him wasn't worth the stain on my conscience. I didn't get the trigger man. It was the only play I could stomach. Wish I could say it was the right one. I don't know. I guess I picked the least ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of two incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sides. Maybe that doesn't matter. Maybe all that matters is justice. Either way, I need a drink. -Casey			"

												Excellent fun. Always nice to find something which has a unique feature. Even better when that unique feature is useful and makes the game worth playing. You play a corporate espionage guy, roaming about office buildings to steal things or spy on people while avoiding the guards and trying to find a way through the security.Don't be distracted by the retro graphics, just think of the fun gameplay. This game is a steal, low price, unique gameplay (or at least in my 35+ years of gameplaying I don't remember anything like it), and it is entertaining. Amusing puzzles, and the character interaction actually made me laugh, a GENUINE lol from a game is something to respect.Buy it, I'm sure you'll love it.			"

Genre: 2D ""Platformer"" Stealth GameReccommendation: A must play for all kinds of gamers, wether casual or hardcore, as long as they are interested in the stealth genre.Playtime: ~3 hoursRating: 10/10Review:Quite an amazing and innovative game. Even if it is short, it's worth whatever price you spend on it, wether full store price or discounted.The gameplay all has a really nice feeling. It is centered on stealth, where you have the ability to jump great distances at will. A lot of things could get the guards' attention, especially breaking windows and the ""ding"" sound of an elevator reaching a floor.It has some nice humor too, and the game sometimes makes fun of itself.The part I liked the most in this game was the soundtracks, as they're somewhat dynamic and they're actually nice songs. Other than that, I liked jumping over unsuspecting guards and reaching my objective without hurting anybody and even not letting them know I exist.Also, the autosave system in this game... It's cool stuff. The game autosaves every ~5-6 seconds, and also before any important moves. If you close (and autosave) the game while in a mission and re-open the game later on, it'll instantly load the autosave on the mission you were in, which does great for casual play or simply quick play.The difficulty of this game can vary easily, as you are not punished for taking a long time to think about how to infiltrate a facility. You can make it a little more difficult by not enabling special perks, and by playing in a certain way. This game is great for all players. Don't worry, if you're a hardcore player (Dark Souls as an example), you'll still love this game because of the many things it has.It barely has glitches too, and they're not gamebreaking.My rating is 10/10, quite one of those must play games.

												AWESOME puzzle in neo-noir setting with great plot, humour and music. Levels require some thinking but are not mind♥♥♥♥ing. You can finish any level almost easily, but you'll feel the need in replaying it to master your skill and get an A+ mark (which happens to me very seldom, I usually play just to beat the game). After completing the story for the first time (which takes 3 hours max) you'll want to replay it at least one more time, because apart from finishing levels in different way there are several twists in  plot as well. By the way, cute surprise awaits you in the end of the game. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone who likes puzzles and noir/detective atmosphere.			"

												Digging Yourself Deeper: The Video Game.Gunpoint is honestly the best game I've played in a long time. It's a little hard for me to describe just how hilariously crazy the narrative gets without spoiling the experience, but when it opens with the protagonist accidentally flinging himself out of a fifth story window you know you're in for a good time.Yes, the game is short. Very short.  Even without bypassing puzzles by smashing through windows or incapacitating guards, it only took me around three hours to complete the storyline. There are no sidequests and only a handful of collectibles. That's possibly my biggest issue with Gunpoint - the sheer lack of content makes it feels more like a tech demo than a fully fledged game. But considering this is the creator's first game (and made in GameMaker, for Pete's sake) I'm not fussed.The level editor also might as well be nonexistent. While it's relatively easy to create or install player-made levels yourself, the lack of a Steam workshop means there's barely any public interest in doing so. A dialogue editor also would have been a nice way of making custom stories, but would probably be a nightmare to code. (Edit: Steam Workshop compatability has since been added. Fantastic.)As much as I'd love a more fleshed-out sequel (or at least some sidestories/sidequests), I'm more interested in seeing what else the creator has in store. Dude's got a lot of promise.Additional: If you're looking to buy the Special Edition DLC for just the soundtrack, don't bother. Go to the official Bandcamp page instead - it's five dollars cheaper and comes with bonus tracks, remixes and unused audio files.			"

												Gameplay: 10/10Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 9.50/10SoundTrack: 9/10Overall: 9.62/10Gunpoint is a stealth-based puzzle-platform game from indie developer Tom Francis. It was released earlier this month and in it, players will take on the role of secret agent Conway in his task to be a great spy. Players will be able to infiltrate buildings and retrieve data from mission objects by avoiding guards and other security features using gadgets and Bullfrog pants. The trick with the game is thinking completely outside the box because you get a Crosswire device fairly early in the game and this allows you to make some fun and very interesting things happen.If you see a light switch on the bottom floor and want it linked to the gun of an agent, then that’s something that you can go ahead and do with the Crosswire. The end result would be that as you turn the light on or off, the agent’s gun starts firing uncontrollably. This is one of the funnier aspects of the game because you can actually do a lot of useful things with the Crosswire. For example, you could wire it so that a light in this room, opens the door in another room and when a guard walks past a certain trigger, it would open the floor beneath him, making him fall to his death. This is the nature of Gunpoint and as you progress through the game, more and more things will crop up for you to do. Thankfully though, a lot of thought has been put into it and you can only Crosswire with the same colour and you will need to progress through stages that way.What’s awesome about Gunpoint though is not just the way in which the pixelated game plays, it’s the ability to tell jokes and create a story out of almost thin air. The game is funny and has a dark sense of humour about it which appeals to me in a great way. It starts off with you flying out of a window and landing on a floor by complete and utter mistake. A few seconds worth of flashback earlier, you see Conway testing out his new Bullfrog pants which allow him to leap high and walk up and down walls. From there, you can tell that the game is going to be something special and thankfully, it really is.In and amongst the humour and silly things that go on, Gunpoint is able to tell a story to gamers, one that is engrossing nevertheless. I found myself first skimming through a lot of the conversation but as things progressed, I found it really difficult to formulate a reply in the multiple choices that are given to you.All in all, Gunpoint is a short, little game and will probably only get you about two or three hours of gameplay.gaming.do.co.za			"

												Pixelart, hacking, rewiring and bullfrog pants. What do you want more? It has great gameplay and the story can be choosen by your answers in the briefing (sort of, it matters only for a few missions). You have always different ways and approaches to problems. For example: You could turn the light of and sneek into a room OR just slam the door open, jump on the guard and beat the hell out of him.And even when you have finished the story there are so many user made levels that the playtime rise into infinity (or you build your own level with the easy editor)			"

												Gunpoint was a pretty short game, but it's got good replayability thanks to having multiple solutions for most scenarios. There's apparently a level editor, too, but I haven't looked at that yet.  The wiring mechanic (which I had expected to be clunky and confusing) is elegantly simple but still offers a lot of depth. Gunpoint's definitely going down as one of my favorite games.			"

Short ReviewThis is what Watch_Dogs Should have been. The replayability is fantastic with branching paths, and is enjoyable from start to finish. With multiple approaches to each level, no 2 playthroughs are the same. You can go in violently and kill everyone, sneak around without a single punch, or maybe a little bit of both. It's a great game, and for only $10, you can't go wrong.Long ReviewGraphics: 9.5Gameplay: 10Story/Lore: 10Controls: 10Difficulty: Difficult (9.5)Total: 9.8Graphics:Although it is pixelated, the graphics are top notch. For the parts that aren't pixelated (the menus) are sharp and crisp. It's high quality, and doesn't use pixel graphics as an excuse for low quality.Gameplay:The gameplay in this game is top notch. It's very streamlined, easy to learn, but difficult to master. With multiple upgrades, you can build your character the way you like. With Workshop support, there is an endless amount of levels to play. Each level has multiple ways to play it, with hidden hidden collectables. Story/Lore:With branching missions, side missions, side missions within side missions, the game lets you play multiple ways. Each character with their own personalities and reason to hire you. With multiple endings, the replayability is great.Controls:The controls are excellent, and very basic. Left click to jump, WASD to move, Alt for hacking. More is added through upgrades, but those are the basics. No issues with them.Difficulty:I am a firm believer that a game without difficulty isn't a game at all. Difficulty is needed to make it good. However, there are many games that add artifical difficulty: Horror games add in monsters that'll kill you in one hit if they see you, Roguelikes have one life (I'm not actually upset about this one, though), and then there are games that sell based off difficulty, like Dark Souls. However, Gunpoint has difficulty that isn't artifical, making it an enjoyable experience all around.			"

												Hey, ajichuchu-chan here for another review, this time for Gunpoint! First off, the soundtrack fits the theme really well, didn't feel repetitive throughout my ~4 hours of play time. It's good, SO GOOD I'd recommend others to get the Special Edition for a few bucks more. (I don't work for SD in any way, shape or form). The story is pretty straightforward, the actions players make doesn't influence the story much, if at all. However, the dialogue is funny. They dont take themselves TOO seriously. The gameplay is where Gunpoint takes the cake. Its difficulty varies depending on how you want to tackle the levels. It has a low skill floor, this is for players whos playstyles are influenced by the likes of John Wick or Deckard Shaw, no-nonsense playstyles where what they do doesn't matter as long as they finish the levels. However, completing levels whilst making minimal noise and leaving very little witnesses feels very rewarding. These different ways of completing levels gives the game decent amount of replayability.The gameplay gets 10x better towards the end. Having the ability of kicking down doors like they're nothing is great fun! Dont think that's fun? Imagine your 16 year-old self being late on your first day of high school. The strict, old, cranky lady you have as your English teacher has little tolerance of latecomers. The door is locked. ""Jokes on you, woman!"" you shout. The door is knocked down, the woman and your fellow students alike stare at you, dominance is immediately asserted the first second you come to class. Your territory? Marked. I'd like to give a shoutout to Root-chan for providing me this opportunity. Thanks for reading, friends.			"

												There are so many things about this game that I enjoy, and I wish it wasn't over so fast. Replayability comes through branching story threads and community content, but I still want more. The writing is razor-sharp and full of genuine wit and sarcasm, with the occasional breaking of the fourth wall to comment on gaming conventions. The art is simple but effective, using its minimal tech to create a convincing mood. The jazzy soundtrack is perfect for the story. And while its particular selling point of rewiring the building around you as you sneak through it wasn't implemented as well as it could have been, it still makes for some highly elaborate, complex solutions to puzzles at times. Everything about it was a treat, and I didn't have any complaints but for its fairly short running time. This is one of my highest recommendations when it comes to indie games.			"

												When I bought this, I had no idea what I'm going into.I found pure awesomeness.Gunpoint is a 2D stealth game about breaking into secure buildings, rewiring things and punching people. It says that in the description, and for once, the game description doesn't lie to you. It's exactly about that. However, it's unbelievable how much fun can you have with it.You are playing as Richard Conaway, a freelance hacker. Your usual job is to steal and sell sensitive data. But to achieve that, you first need to get to the terminals the data's in. How do you do that? Using a couple interesting gadgets, of course!The first gagdets you get are Bullfrog Hypertrousers and a Longfall Coat. With only the ability to jump very high, survive falls and climb walls, this basic equipment lets you complete a few missions before you gain access to the Crosslink Device.Crosslink allows you to rewire things - Locked door? Hang on, let me just link this light switch to it and open it. Camera linked to an alarm? No worries, we'll just disconnect that. And it gets even crazier - How about stunning your enemies using power sockets? Or remotely shoot their own guns? Right into the back of another guard?This puzzle system is incredibly fun to use and surprisingly simple to understand. You can't fight the guards head-on, but you can turn their lights off, wait for them to open the locked door, connect it to a motion sensor, walk trough and have it close just in time to knock them out. Or just run into it and use the Gatecrasher device to kick the door open in such it throws the guard out of the window behind. Later on, the levels get more complex, multiple Crosslink nets are set up without being connected into eachother, your enemies get body armors, can see in dark... yet you can still outsmart them in multiple ways, which lets you play the game how you want.But it gets even better. The game has a beautiful soundtrack, which perfectly suits the atmosphere, a great noir-ish atmosphere, and a great sense of humor even when you're being held at Gunpoint. It also features one of the best achievements I've ever seen. Anywhere.In the end, the only thing you'll be sad about in this game is how short it is. The campaign provides only about 150 minutes of fun and brilliant story. Luckily, the game supports Steamworks and has Level Editor - this combination can provide numerous hours of fun.If you haven't played this yet, then I recommend doing so. Otherwise you'll missing one of the greatest puzzle masterpieces in the history of video games. Seriously.			"

												A short game, but I found it worth the money thanks to the constant sass options available. Most games don't have your character glibly text his contacts the bracketed notes you assume are for your own benefit.The puzzles are engaging, tricky, and combat is hilariously satisfying. The game is somewhat dynamic and you can play for most sides like any true espionage agent. You can play like a consumate professional, or you can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with spring-loaded pants and an itchy punching fist.The only real downside is that in the end, it all boils down to a single ending. It's an ending you can handle several different ways, but it's the same one, really.Protip: Don't get too fancy when you clear the final level for the first time, save whatever battery you have, because whatever you have at the end is how much battery you have for any post-game easter egg hunting you might want to do.

												This is a game where you play as a spy who can hack into devices in a building that you're infiltrating. The spy can also burst out of windows and beat guards up. The fun comes when you're hacking though, and you can do stuff like electrify a socket that a guard is standing next to or confuse a guard by turning off a light. Now I'm not saying I'm better than anybody but when a light gets turned off I don't get confused and start pacing the room like a weirdo but this is a video game I think. Anyway, the writing is actually competent for a video game and there's a lot of options as to how you tackle a level.

												Cheap and fun. That's what an Indie game should be. Gunpoint is both of those things. Gunpoint is a pixellated action/strategy combination that goes together better than bacon and literally anything else you could think of. The text presented dialogue is funny and the gameplay is fastpaced and entertaining. Deaths...and there will be many of them...let you restart the game from literally seconds before you made the mistake so you never feel bad for trying something interesting and failing badly. And Gunpoint is one of those games where failure is half the fun.Using a variety of tools, you can hack doors, tackle guards, and perform a whole slew of complex or simple tricks to outwit your enemies and complete your objectives. The levels are diverse and varied, and the gameplay, which is very simple, never grows boring nor seems repetitious. ---Rags' Rating - The Maltese Shiba  / 10			"

												To me, Gunpoint is a true example of pixel art, it exelently blends the story, style of gameplay and mechanics together,if you read the dialog (which most people i guess dont) you'll find that the story is really well written, its a really little stealth game and when the campaign finishes you will be begging for more, thats where the LEVEL EDITOR comes in, also if you're like me you will want to finish all of the achievements, ive read a few review before i bought this game and they said to buy this game while its on sale, but i didnt and really DO NOT regret it, its currently my FAVORET game, and i also cant wait for the developer (Tom Francis) to get his new game ""Heat signature"" out on steam..Pros:-VERY well written story.-Exelent mechanics.-Nice pixel art style.-Level editor.-Cheap and pleasing.-To me its worth the price.However the ONLY 2 cons are :-No workshop integration (coming soon though).-No CO-OP.If this game had these 2 feutures, then it will be a bestseller...This game is a MUST HAVE if you're a fan of platformers....and if you arent, then this game will MAKE you one.Update: The developer has announced that workshop integration will be added, but he isnt sure when the update will be released because he's planning on porting Gunpoint to another engine, also, alot of people say this game is over priced, it is NOT.

												Wow first off I'm glade I found this game ans gave it a try as it's really good it's a bit of a mix of a puzzle game (e.g portal) and a stealth game. It's really fun and don't cost loads so i would recommend picking this one up and adding it to our libary over all I would give it a 9/10 theres not much wrong with this game apart from that theres like no replay value apart from trying to get acheivments.

												Another excelent noir themed masterpiece. This game design is so inteligent, well thought, that this premisse could make an AAA successful game easily. Wait a sec... yeah, Watchdogs! Now that I thought about it, this game is like a Watchdogs 2d, except this one here came earlier and is more awesome on its own way. I mean, this game did not need to be a $50+, super graphics, ""open world"" to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥innovative game. PS, Watchdogs fans: I'm just kidding, guys. Watchdogs seems pretty good aswell, even though I still have not played. Also, they are definitely different games with only good similarities.Back to review:The levels on this game are perfectly designed to improve the difficulty more and more and the learning curve of your ""hacking powers"" is great. Challenges you will face includes lasers, armed guards, sensors, alarms, doors, noise, police, etc. Think of this game like Mission: Impossible 1 (the very best).Good gameplay is good. Innovative. You need to plan every movement, wire (""hack"") the right cables on the right moment to close a door over a unarmed guard, or to keep an armed one stucked in a room. You can buy a lot of upgrades aswell, like, for instance, a cloak for jumping across glass without making noise, or upgrades on your pants to jump higher.The story also has a good part here. Is great, fun, intriguing and yet light and casual. Each level is a mission that you receive as a job from secret employers. More than one time you will need to make a choice, take sides, etc. The payment for mission completion is what lets you buy new stuff and upgrades. Don't fear this game. The title might be misleading but it's not a 90's shooter, its more like a stealth game 2d. I recommend this game to pretty much everyone, since awesomeness is meant for everyone. You'll have a good time with this and replayability grants you another few fun hours if you wanna see all the endings and/or if you are an achievement hunter.			"

												Arguably one of the best games I've ever played on steam, Great concept, controls and to an extent story. The game would be lucky to last you 5 hours (6 for me because I suuuuck) I can't recommend the game at full price just because of the length however if you can get it cheap it will repay you with a great experience that will leave you desperate for more8/10			"

												Gunpoint is one of those ""indie"" games that proves there is something new under the sun. Platformer is nothing new... Donkey Kong and Mario had been around forever. Stealth games are nothing new either. Metal Gear had been around for a long time too. But combine the two, and a healthy dose of puzzle via the Crosslink, where you hack switches, doors, and more, by rewiring them to do something else, and you have something unique yet familiar. As a super freelance agent, jump, sneak, and bash your way through the levels doing work... for whatever side you choose. Graphics are pixely, but that's part of the charm. Definitely give it a try, then design your own levels with the editor and share it with the community.			"

												If wielding a pair of hypertrousers with blatant disregard for large glass windows, security personnel, and gravity itself seems like a good idea then Gunpoint is probably for you.This is a nice little stealth-puzzler with open-ended problem solving, comedic dialogue, and a laid back, jazzy soundtrack. The campaign may be short, but when you're done with it there's plenty of content on the Workshop.Definitely worth the low price of admission.			"

												I just finished the game. And boy, for a platformer-2d-indie-shooter etc etc... it was great ! It took me 3 hours to complete it , ( it wasnt that long) but for 10 $ it's worth it. The characters were great in their own special way. I felt connected with my character and the story was like reading a detective novel . Also, you got to make your own decisions , which is always great. Also , you can upgrade your player , spend money and oh , carry a gun with 1 or sometimes 2 bullets ! In this game all you need is jump. Nothing else, seriously, i'm not a fun of these indie games but it was very well done. Also , there are 2 possible endings , You get to choose which one. Quote from my ending. I picked the sentences. : << I guess I picked the least ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of two incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sides. Maybe that doesn't matter. Maybe all that matters is that I now have the ability to kick down doors.Either way, I need a drink. >>Buy it . 8/10			"

												There are just not enough detective/sluth games out there. Not enough games make you feel like that underground vigilante, trying to manipulate the intrigue between competeting factions. Even less games allow you to be a clever spy tinkering with your electronic environment to outsmart guards and enemy spies. It's hard to fine that ""Yes!"" feeling when an intricate plan goes perfectly according to plan, leaving no witness and no casualties. There's just a certain smug satisfaction you get from watching guard try to turn a light back on, only to be opening doors or turning other lights off elsewhere. It's a certain satisfaction you can only really get out of Gunpoint right now.I'll make this somewhat brief. You should buy Gunpoint. It's an incredibly clever and fun game with lots of funny and well written dialog along with fantastic stealth gameplay. There are multiple-ish ways around each level depending on what upgrades you've gone for, and there are multiple storylines you can follow, although they don't ultimately effect the final ending. It is an incredibly polished and thought-out game, and you should play it.Although, you might want to wait for a sale. If there is a problem with Gunpoint, it's that it's way, way to short. Took only a little more than two hours to beat, and while there is some incentive to replay levels for a better rating or follow different contracts, there isn't much incentive to spend that much time with the game after beating it. There is a workshop, but it's fairly limited. There are a few good maps, but a lot of them are just boring or broken, and there's rarely something new uploaded. So, if you're the type that needs to maximize bang for your buck, $10 for 2 hours of gameplay might be too steep a price, and you might want to wait for the sale.But at some point, you should buy and play this game. Simply put, it's fantastic.			"

												Gunpoint is a very unique little game. Let's get my opinions out of the way first: OMG BUY THIS GAME AND THROW MONEY AT THESE DEVELOPERS THEY ARE AMAZING.Anyways, lets get to it.Gunpoint is a great game, with a good story and great mechanics. Plus a good sense of humor.Mechanics:Its a 2d ""sidescroller"" platformer. Sidescroller in a loose sense of the word. In this game, you play the role of Freelance spy Richard Conway, who owns a Pair of hypertrousers, which allow him to jump great heights. after the first mission, you unlock the ""Wiretapper."" Which is where this game really shines, and what turns it into a puzzle game. With the wiretapper, You can change the Circuity of the building. Altering the circuits of alarms, security cameras, doors, lights, and plug sockets. The combination of these two mechanics is what makes this a great stealth game.Story: After purchasing his Hypertrousers, Conway accidentally leaps out the window of his apartment building and into the lobby of a nearby building, one in which someone was murdered. After hearing gunshots, and going up the building to investigate, conway walks in front of a security camera, which would put him at the scene of the crime, he has to erase the backups before the tapes are found.I Don't want to spoil anything, because this is all adressed by the first mission.Extras:If there isn't enough reason to buy this game, it also comes with a Level Editor, so you can make your own puzzles. And i really do hope at some point this gets steam workshop support. I'd really like to see what others come up with.Not to mention you get a free Tf2 hat with the deal. I mean, C'mon, the hat looks pretty cool.And you can have the spy wear it. Because why not.			"

												I really like Gunpoint. There's only one or two things I dislike:1. The replay value is slightly reduced because if you replay a level and you do slightly worse, (e.g. not getting as many achievements) the game takes this to be your final score and applies it on the menu. 2. There isn't a lot of it! The main story was wonderfully witty and cleverly created, and I know there's the Workshop and level creator, but a bigger core game would have made it more perfect.The rest of it is fantastic. The movement mechanic somehow combines action and fast playing with strategy and planning in the cross-link and those brilliant hyper-trouser things. Conway's character is a hilarious parody of itself and the player. His interaction with the other characters is always funny, and I love the method of communication between them too. The art is great, I'm a sucker for pixels!Please get it, and also give the talented people on the workshop some love.			"

												There are just not enough detective/sluth games out there. Not enough games make you feel like that underground vigilante, trying to manipulate the intrigue between competeting factions. Even less games allow you to be a clever spy tinkering with your electronic environment to outsmart guards and enemy spies. It's hard to fine that ""Yes!"" feeling when an intricate plan goes perfectly according to plan, leaving no witness and no casualties. There's just a certain smug satisfaction you get from watching guard try to turn a light back on, only to be opening doors or turning other lights off elsewhere. It's a certain satisfaction you can only really get out of Gunpoint right now.I'll make this somewhat brief. You should buy Gunpoint. It's an incredibly clever and fun game with lots of funny and well written dialog along with fantastic stealth gameplay. There are multiple-ish ways around each level depending on what upgrades you've gone for, and there are multiple storylines you can follow, although they don't ultimately effect the final ending. It is an incredibly polished and thought-out game, and you should play it.Although, you might want to wait for a sale. If there is a problem with Gunpoint, it's that it's way, way to short. Took only a little more than two hours to beat, and while there is some incentive to replay levels for a better rating or follow different contracts, there isn't much incentive to spend that much time with the game after beating it. There is a workshop, but it's fairly limited. There are a few good maps, but a lot of them are just boring or broken, and there's rarely something new uploaded. So, if you're the type that needs to maximize bang for your buck, $10 for 2 hours of gameplay might be too steep a price, and you might want to wait for the sale.But at some point, you should buy and play this game. Simply put, it's fantastic.			"

												Gunpoint is a very fun and extremely unique stealth-action game. Think Mark of the Ninja crossed with Watch Dogs. (I can't really explain the gameplay well, watch a trailer or something.) As soon as I saw the press demo years ago, I knew this would probably become one of my favorite games. I even bought it on its launch day. Lo and behold, I wasn't wrong. Honestly, I regret taking this long to finish it. Intriguing story, fun gameplay, neat asthetics; what more can you ask for in a game made by one guy? A bit short, but not unpleasantly so, with my playtime clocking in around 3 hours. The length feels right for the game. Even then, there's tons of replayability in the story, and if you're not into replaying, there's a level editor. A definite recommendation from me, even if you aren't a fan of stealth games. Honestly, you can play the game in so many different ways I struggle to shoehorn it into one genre like that. Definitely worth more than $10, buy it if you can.			"

I'm currently playing it for the third time and its still a very fun game and worth buying.What is this game about?In Gunpoint you play as a freelance spy called Richard Conway and you break into differant guarded buildings to get vital information, you get it by using your gadgets to reqire circuits and trick guards.The genre of Gunpoint is stealth, puzzle and 2-D and it's a no-brainer to buy it.

												I really like Gunpoint. There's only one or two things I dislike:1. The replay value is slightly reduced because if you replay a level and you do slightly worse, (e.g. not getting as many achievements) the game takes this to be your final score and applies it on the menu. 2. There isn't a lot of it! The main story was wonderfully witty and cleverly created, and I know there's the Workshop and level creator, but a bigger core game would have made it more perfect.The rest of it is fantastic. The movement mechanic somehow combines action and fast playing with strategy and planning in the cross-link and those brilliant hyper-trouser things. Conway's character is a hilarious parody of itself and the player. His interaction with the other characters is always funny, and I love the method of communication between them too. The art is great, I'm a sucker for pixels!Please get it, and also give the talented people on the workshop some love.			"

I bought it on a sale expecting a few hours of a reasonably fun game, but I got way more out of it (although not in hours, since the game is very short).All the levels are very well designed, and offer a kind of difficulty mode integrated into them - you can just fulfill your goal in any way you like, which is not that hard, or you can go to the optional objectives and requirements, which requires more of the player. It's very fun and rewarding to use all your gadgets to successfully complete an infiltration.The story is simple, but very well-told, with funny writing combined with a noir atmosphere, and a satisfiyng conclusion, which is always a plus.So, yeah, I recommend it even at full-price, even with its short length.

												In this excellent stealth-puzzler, you play a dude (a some kind of a freelance spy-detective) who just bought hypertrousers. Unfortunately, he got caught on a camera and is now a murder suspect: on to destroy the evidence because who would believe you anyway? Murderer too used the awesometrousers.Your guy can jump very high, cling to ceilings and floor and with some additional gadgets rewire the electronics systems of buildings. He does not choose his targets: his clients do. Smartpants, he accepts any mission that pays money and tries to sound witty doing that. In case it left you wondering, that pun was totally intended.A typical level goes like this: break into a building, hack into a computer and get out, and if you're like me, do it totally undetected and without hurting, let alone killing anyone. The rewind system ensures you don't have to restart too often. Actually, the ability to rewire electronics is even more important than bouncing like a cat and you may even debate whichever is the best.Definitely worth it for the sneaky-puzzly mechanics if not for the witty albeit quirky dialogue and story.

Like, really short. Shorter than the shortest person on Earth.Pretty buggy. You can push people straight through doors, and occasionally the background of buildings cease to existYou can hold someone at gunpoint, but it isn't a good idea, because bullets don't restock and they'll shoot you if you get too close.Great game, you should buy it.

												Gunpoint was an enjoyable experience and rather satisfying considering its rather short length. The gameplay is fluid, only if you the player are skilled. I am not skilled so there was a lot of floundering around however when I was playing the game well, utilising all the tools at my disposal I realised just how much depth the games mechanics have. However for some odd reason the difficulty of the game fluctuates from sit back and spend 10 minutes strategising and formulating a plan to ""really, thats it?"". Arguably the last two levels were dissapointing, being relatively simple and more an example of quantity rather than puzzle quality. However the sheer amount of guards and mini puzzles in the last level allow  the mechanics to shine and we see just how hectic this game can get mechanically when pushed. The length may deter some but the game is worth it for the price. The music in this game is passable. One or two tracks stand out but nothing you will find yourself humming later on. The writing is most likely going to divide players. I took the zany approach and made my character a gun wielding psychopathic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, resulting in some of the funniest dialogue I have read in a while. However I know that this writing will come of as random for the sake of random for some. It is possible however to play a straight and narrow character with no shenanigans if desired. Overall Gunpoint was a fun distraction, you will most likely beat this in one sitting and unless you enjoy challenging yourself replaying levels for times then the replayability isnt really there. There are some alternate dialogues depending on the ingame choices but not much besides that. But the pixel art style, dialogue, story and combat makes this a worthwile indie title to play on a lazy day. I give gunpoint a 2.5 out of 5.			"

												Game is great, but also buggyGameplay: its a puzzle platformer with stealth elements.Bad stuff:- Game wont minimize properly, even when it runs in windowed mode, it just wants to be on top (alt tab + random clicking did the trick once)- Game looks zoomed in/out on different resolutions. which is weird... 1080p too small (but i played it like that) 800x640 you can only see a small part of the map, it limits you on small resolutions.- Undo feature (to make you go back is useful ) but its weird at the same time, it just returns you sometimes in weird places/random times, one time 0 seconds, other times 60+secondsMeh: - Tools, i think developers were thinking, lets add more stuff just to add content, and lets add this gadget, and that gadget... most of the stuff is not even needed. you can finish the entire game just by using the jumping and rewire tool (even the last level, i successfully finished it without the door breaking thing, that the game said it was required). i used some tools just to get the achievement. ( I WOULD USE THEM MORE IF I HAD MANY BATTERIES TO USE THEM ) - Enemies, there are only 3 types of enemies, normal guard, tough guard, and elite guard. i would prefer if there were more enemies, with different abilities.- Maps, most of them are ok, but the only thing that challenged me for a few minutes was the last one map middle part puzzle (because of the resolution it took me a while to see what is going where) the rest are mostly simple. i would add some traps, for example if you make a mistake that the game locks you in a room (That happend only once to me on the last map)Good stuff:- The gameplay is good, you can go full stealth ninja ghost :) or full psycho.- Story is ok- It has some humor- Workshop (level editor)			"

												A really unique stealth game that gives you the room to be creative. It's a bit short, but that's forgivable because of the lengthy list of ways to complete each level and even a level editor mode. The creator's a pretty funny and humble guy, and it often shows in the dialogue. Definitely worth the small price.			"

												Gunpoint is a very fun and extremely unique stealth-action game. Think Mark of the Ninja crossed with Watch Dogs. (I can't really explain the gameplay well, watch a trailer or something.) As soon as I saw the press demo years ago, I knew this would probably become one of my favorite games. I even bought it on its launch day. Lo and behold, I wasn't wrong. Honestly, I regret taking this long to finish it. Intriguing story, fun gameplay, neat asthetics; what more can you ask for in a game made by one guy? A bit short, but not unpleasantly so, with my playtime clocking in around 3 hours. The length feels right for the game. Even then, there's tons of replayability in the story, and if you're not into replaying, there's a level editor. A definite recommendation from me, even if you aren't a fan of stealth games. Honestly, you can play the game in so many different ways I struggle to shoehorn it into one genre like that. Definitely worth more than $10, buy it if you can.			"

												GUNPOINT IS A TREASURE. I can't possibly recommend it enough.The creative gameplay mechanic of ""rewiring"" elements of the level mean that there's a lot of flexibility in playstyle and even in solutions to each mission. Use your sneaky spy tools to switch off lights, avoid cameras, and disable traps--or enable them right as a guard walks past. Or just shoot everyone in the face. Or do a combination of both. It's the greatest.The dialogue is awesome too: funny, perfectly interactive, and seasoned with a dash of noir-detective smarm.The main campaign is short--it took me, the world's slowest gamer, about 5 hours, so it should take most normal folks about half that time--but it has full Steam Workshop support with a level editor for player-creatable maps, and I played it again to get better stealth ratings on some of the missions and still loved it the second time around.Art style may not be to everyone's taste (I loved it, personally) but I think the fun of the gameplay is well worth giving this game a shot even if you're hesitant about it.Rating: 5/55: Loved it; 4: Liked it; 3: It's OK; 2: Didn't like it; 1: Hated it "

												I had high hopes for this game and i wasnt disappointed.  This game harkens back to the day where your imagination ran wild with the story game, filling in the blanks that the lack of voice acting and ""good graphics"" created.  This in turn creating an immersive gaming experience.  I've only finsihed the storyline and am now dipping into the workshop.  So much replay value.  Would totally kick a door in again. 11/10			"

												An incredibly simple premise with astounding execution. The story centers around a freelance spy named Conway that was almost framed for the murder of a friend and employee of a weapons manufacturing company, basing itself on the whole ""Cyberpunk future"" idea and possibilities. For instance, Conway owns a pair of high-tech pants that allow him to jump to ludicrous heights and sustain little to no falling damage, as well as a device that allows him to rewire virtually anything connected to a power source to fulfill whatever needs he might have. And let's not forget corrupt companies with their evil tycoons sitting at the CEO chair.Graphically speaking, it's hit-and-miss. If you like pixel art, you'll like this game's style, but if you don't, well, at least the gameplay and music can make it up to you.Musically speaking, spectacular. If you're a fan of old noir movies and games, the atmospheric soundtrack to this game will touch your inner detective.And finally, gameplay. 2D sidescrolling with high jumping and stealth elements, in a nutshell. Every thing is responsive, you definitely feel in control of your environment as Conway peruses the electrical grid of the building he's trying to sneak into and of Conway himself, as he either skillfully jumps into an open window, pummels someone to a temporary coma (or death) or silently crawls on ceilings and walls avoiding the watchful eyes of the guards.All in all, this game is fantastic. Props to Tom Francis and his development team.			"

												Game is great, but also buggyGameplay: its a puzzle platformer with stealth elements.Bad stuff:- Game wont minimize properly, even when it runs in windowed mode, it just wants to be on top (alt tab + random clicking did the trick once)- Game looks zoomed in/out on different resolutions. which is weird... 1080p too small (but i played it like that) 800x640 you can only see a small part of the map, it limits you on small resolutions.- Undo feature (to make you go back is useful ) but its weird at the same time, it just returns you sometimes in weird places/random times, one time 0 seconds, other times 60+secondsMeh: - Tools, i think developers were thinking, lets add more stuff just to add content, and lets add this gadget, and that gadget... most of the stuff is not even needed. you can finish the entire game just by using the jumping and rewire tool (even the last level, i successfully finished it without the door breaking thing, that the game said it was required). i used some tools just to get the achievement. ( I WOULD USE THEM MORE IF I HAD MANY BATTERIES TO USE THEM ) - Enemies, there are only 3 types of enemies, normal guard, tough guard, and elite guard. i would prefer if there were more enemies, with different abilities.- Maps, most of them are ok, but the only thing that challenged me for a few minutes was the last one map middle part puzzle (because of the resolution it took me a while to see what is going where) the rest are mostly simple. i would add some traps, for example if you make a mistake that the game locks you in a room (That happend only once to me on the last map)Good stuff:- The gameplay is good, you can go full stealth ninja ghost :) or full psycho.- Story is ok- It has some humor- Workshop (level editor)			"

												The game presents you with a simple objective (hack this, steal that) each level but gives you a really useful set of tricks to accomplish your goal.  The way this is presented and your control of the game world is what makes this title stand out.  I've managed to wire a light switch to an elevator call button, which sets of a sound alarm which opens a door granting me access to a locked room for example. The game has various electronic devices (buttons, lights, elevators, alarms, doors, cameras) that are nominally assigned to coloured circuits.  You can wire devices up in a building any way you like as long as you don't cross coloured circuits, however judicious use of the aforementioned sound detectors etc. will let you do this.  Play it, makes me think a bit of the cancelled Introversion game 'Subversion'.  I'm not going to mention any of the plot, it's good and serves it's purpose quite well with charm and style. I really quite like this, the main 'campaign' is short (about 3 or so hours if you fiddle about) but quite wonderfully done.  The levels are very well designed with absolutely loads of routes and tactics that can be taken to beat them.  You really can go back and play each level an entirely different way.  The level designer as it stands I've found easier than most to use, however it seems to be less capabable than the ones used to create the in game levels.  I cannot seem to wire places up to the same degree, and I cannot find any way to access the sound sensors etc. present in the main campaign.  My understanding though is the levels and campaign are straight forward text files so editing/creating anything used in the main campaign is well within reach.So yes, buy it on the understanding that the included content is quite short but well worth the money and you'll have a minor amount of legwork to do for extra levels (try http://www.gunpointlevels.net/).An advanced level editor is also available here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/206190/discussions/0/864971139146390709/ "

Story has some twist and turn but its OK. But its bit pricey. As a 10$ game it should have game play time worth 10-12 hours. Another negative point is there is replay value to it. So special mission no extra missions nothing. Just plan old 1.5 hour of game play and you will never look back to it.My recommendation is buy this game when it is cheap like it was on sale for 75% off. That is its true value.

												PLEASE BUY THIS GAMEDo yourself a huge favor and check it out. And line the pockets of some really slick developers. They deserve it. How is it that I am more satisfied with this $10 game ($3, if you get it during this sale), than with the $60 Watch_Dogs. One of the few games that actually delivers on the ""Solve The Puzzle Your Way"" claims. It plays very smoothly. Very responsive. And it's free-form in a lot of ways. The mechanics of the game are sound, and extremely satisfying. The writing and dialogue is phenomenal. I laughed SO hard at some of the dialogue choices.Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It's such a perfect feel for the game. It really makes you feel like a sly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes. Other times you feel like a total buffoon, and you get shot in the♥♥♥♥♥ which is equally as entertaining. And all the little things they added. All the nuiance. The little things are what make it. It's like Casablanca and Shadowrun got together and made a (hilarious) baby.I liked it as a whole package. Nothing, not a thing about it was disappointing, and it even exceeded my expectations frequently. And in case you're worried about replayability? Level editor. After playing it, I had to go back and download the special edition DLC that comes with the soundtrack. That's pretty rare for me.Full points. Also, the people who are saying that this game is too short, and unsatisfying after one run-through, don't know how to make their own fun. I'm personally going to do at least two, considering there are so many different ways a situation can play out. Don't knock points off the game because you aren't creative enough to get your enjoyment out of it.			"

Just plan old 1.5 hour of game play and you will never look back to it.My recommendation is buy this game when it is cheap like it was on sale for 75% off. That is its true value. Not at full price.			"

												Gunpoint is a film noir-inspired puzzle game by indie developer Tom Francis. The game consists of a variety of puzzles that are solved using your crosslink, a handy hacking device that you use to rewire doors, buttons and other assorted mechanisms. These puzzles are weaved together by an excellent story. You play as Richard Conway, a detective who is out to clear his name after being framed for murder. The music in this game is phenomenal. The soundtrack consists of many jazz tracks, most of which are remixed in a more techno-esque fashion. I 100% completed the game in 7.4 hours, including all achievements and A+'s in all the levels. The final level of the game is one of the best in any game ever, providing an extremely satisfying ending. My only complaint is that the game is a tad short, but this could be easily solved by a story-expanding DLC release.OVERALL RATING: 9.5/10			"

												Gunpoint is a fun little game. I cannot compare it to anything I've played before, but it could be described as stealth puzzle game. Mostly it's about connecting devices to other to make them work properly so the protagonist can continue his investigation. Combinations are sometimes fun, but options felt lacking; or my imagination was. I just felt that there could've been more ""to do"", but I guess that there would've if I've tried to do A+ in everything. Jumping guards was too easy that made the game less about stealth and more about wiring and jumping.Music is nice and graphics are okay. Visually the game looks clear but somewhat boring. Then again it works so smooth, it doesn't really matter. The plot kept me interested in the game so I pretty much played this game in one day. The game lasted for about 4 hours for me and that was pretty much enough. It didn't get repetetive nor boring at any point. One can try to improve their stats afterwards, but apart from that, the game is pretty much done.It's hard to recommend this kind of game because I lack reference points. If you try the complete version, you almost surely will complete it before you made up your mind about playing it any further. There's a demo though, so if you didn't get this from a bundle, try the demo before bying.			"

No, it's good writing (though a bit hard to follow, but funny!)! And the mechanics are good, but falter in terms of relaying information around the second half of the game.

												At a first glance it looked like a typical platformer, but in fact this was a rare breed of stealth + puzzle + action game. The puzzle part was not hard-core challenging but it's very good and enjoyable. Actually, the game had a glitch and no music, but the game is so fun that I didn't notice that it was a glitch until I finished the game! (I finally realized that there's supposed to be music when I looked into the forum posts). So yeah, I can say this is one of best purchases in 2013 on Steam.			"

												Picked this up in a sale for next-to-nothing.  Fun game, albeit terribly short - under 6 hours to complete at a leisurely pace.Gunpoint shows that super-duper graphics is not required to make fun game-play.  It's a fairly simple puzzle game, and nothing is going to leave you thinking for long.  The challenge comes in your style.  Trying to complete a level without being seen etc.  Getting to the objective quickly and out is fairly simple but not very rewarding.Don't pay full price for this game, but if you see it in a bargain bin then pick it up.  I played it on my laptop with my feet up - it's that sort of game.			"

												Wow, where to begin...I bought this on the Steam Christmas Sale 2014 as something to play on my awful laptop. I should perhaps mention that I had no idea what the game was about at the time, but it was cheap and scored high on Metacritic.What did I find? One of the best games I have played in recent years. It is difficult to explain just why it is so good without spoiling the game, suffice it to say that both the story and mechanics, as well as their execution, are without fault. The game has a subtle, dark sense of humour which punctuates its noir storytelling. In terms of actual gameplay, I would describe it as an immersive puzzle platformer, though its beauty is that each problem can be approached in a variety of ways.  The game is not particularly long, and I completed it in roughly four hours, though my playstyle is ponderous at best. However, that should not discourage you from spending money on this gem of a game. The variety of solutions as well as the multitude of achievements will make subsequent playthroughs as riveting as the first.In conclusion: Buy it, download it, play it, recommend it.			"

												Charming, funny and clever. Three words that are usually the signs of a well-made game.Whilst it's not going to keep you up at night racking your brain on how to beat that ONE level, it's enough of a challenge to keep your brain ticking over.A standard 2D stealth-em-up with a novel twist, the game encourages and rewards creativity, although if you get frustrated, there's always the option to go charging in as well. The dialogue between missions bounces from pretty amusing to out-and-out hilarious without ever compromising a story that becomes more interesting and less 'token' than you may think at first glance.Personally, this is well worth your money if you have even a passing interest in this sort of game. A very pleasant impulse buy.			"

												9/10Had a great time playing through this game despite its short length. I would have given it a 10 but it really does end way too soon. The mechanics and game play are great, the challenge is moderate, and you will probably want to complete it at least once. Despite the multiple endings there is really not much different on a second playthrough. If you can find it on sale it’s a definite buy. "

												Where do I start? Really, where do I?I believe this game to be one of the best strategy games of this time, simply because it is not giving you one solution. Somehow, this game makes it still hard to complete an actual level entirely, even though the solution is yours to create.And the fact that it is sounds like it's set in the 40's helps hugely.			"

												Just had a very agreeable day with Gunpoint. The plot is an entertaining and irreverent take on the noir and robot trouser genres. If you fancy some indie fun that features: progressively intricate levels, puzzling, stealthing about, leaping with a callus disregard for gravity, and (when the time is right) kicking bloody doors in. Then this is the game for you. The gameplay is well balanced you feel badass, but extremely vulnerable at the same time.The story shows hidden depths and just like the building offers you a degree of choice about how you tackle it. Primarily how serious you want to take it. The pixel art is pitch perfect. It hits that level of representing what's being shown, rather than looking like a compressed image or generic block figures. However pixel art does make it harder to judge if a character is supposed to be a classic femme fatal.I'm looking forward to an expansion pack or whatever comes next from this developer. In the mean there's a level editor and a growing list of maps in the steam workshop. Few really stand out yet but I'm sure it's just a matter of time.			"

The genres it straddles are puzzle and platformer  You can be a stealth spy who avoids witnesses and moves like a ghost.  Or you can say “F it” and bring a gun and shoot your way through a level at a blazing pace.  Worth $10 for both the excellent writing and unique gameplay.			"

It's simple yet smart and has its' fair share of challenges, humor, and developing features. The level editor gives it unlimited replay value and the Steam Workshop capability is a plus. A fun noire feel along with a retro soundtrack really makes this indie game click. I recommend this one for sure.			"

												Gunpoint, on the surface is puzzle platformer with quirky dialog. Deep down; however, Gunpoint offers humour, a good twisty narative, and fresh take on the murder mystery genre. The plot itself is relatively similar to other hard-boiled detective stories thyat provide a corrupt corporate executive and the girl who's caught up in it all (ie, Ian Rankin's 'Let it Bleed,' or Raymond Chandler's 'The Big Sleep') but this game gives you control over Conway in the dialog portions. Allowign the player to choose what style of character Conway is what really makes this game special. The player gets 3 basic choices of personality: stoic, crazy, and not-giving-a♥♥♥♥♥♥ All 3 are wonderful, and this alone would make me recommend this game, but when you add on the exceptionally fun gameplay, Gunpoint stands above many other puzzle-platformers of its ilk.

Glad that the Steam Workshop is attached to this and that there are some 463 other maps, stories, and variations on a theme for Gunpoint that can be experienced. This is also one of those games that you can play at work or at home since it is not that fast paced but it will tax your mind and patience some to complete some of the trickier levels.

YouTube™ Video: SteamPunk Episode 8: Gunpoint 

			Views: 32		

			SteamPunk Bob insists that the game designer ripped off the idea for this game from his award winning fanfiction: ""From the Files of Police Squad! The Maltese Batman""		

It's a stealth game, but it's so much more. It includes important information to the stealth genre, such as knowing what guards can and cannot see. You can choose how you're going to solve your issues. Will you use subtlety and grace, guards not knowing there was a break in? Do you wait until they turn their back, then tackle and beat them unconcious? Do you hunt and murder every possible witness?There's interaction between your various clients, and it's just good fun.

												For those who want a quick answer: INCREDIBLE. BUY. IT. NOW.For those who want to know why:This is game is exactly what I expected Watch Dogs to be like - either using clever tricks to outsmart your enemies and stealth to try to avoid violence, or running in and rushing the objective, not caring about what, or who, gets in you way. However, in every conceivable way, this game is far, far, far better than Watch Dogs. SO, are you considering buying Watch Dogs? Don't. Buy 5 copies of this instead. The mechanics are impeccable, the intriguing story keeps you playing until the end, then lets you replay any mission you want - with your new upgrades. I can honestly say, this is one of the best games I have ever played, and the best £6 I have ever spent.			"

												Cool little indie game!It's rather short since it took me a little more than 3hours to complete my first playthrough without being in a rush, but it has replayability since you can pick differant sides in the storyline.The noire-cyberpunk atmosphere's pretty well done for a pixelish indie title, the story's catchy as ♥♥♥♥, the dialogues are great, and so is the humor! (I wasn't expecting to laugh so much at the sassy answers from the main character)The gameplay is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing smooth and satisfying, and the hacking-rewiring thing works well, tho in my opinion they kinda underexploited it since there was truly a way to make complexe paths. But it gets you in the cyber-thief mood.I liked it more than I thought I would. Then again...Humble Bundle, so I don't know if I would've been pleased about paying full price for it.			"

												I beat this game in 4 hours. It has quite a few laughs and it is nice to be stealthy. There are multiple unique ways of progressing through levels and different types of enemies to avoid, knockout, or kill. The story has a lot of twists and your contribution to the story doesn't seem to matter much besides achievements (maybe this was just my personal path's experience), but it is a very intricate story. I give this game 8/10! The best feature is being able to punch as much as you want. :)			"

Many of the missions are also flexible and can be solved in different ways.All in all, it's a very fun little game that's great to pick up and play whenever.			"

												Gunpoint is a 2d stealth/puzzle game. You can rewire devices in the level to do certain things, such as rewiring a light switch so that instead of turning out the lights, it opens a door into a guard, knocking him out. There are a ton of devices that all do different things when triggered and you can wire almost any combination of triggers/devices together. Your character is also very mobile: you can crawl up walls and hang from the ceiling, and you can superjump with a pair of robolegs your character buys in the opening cutscene. Levels also have a couple of collectibles, in the form of laptops that you can hack to read emails from the game's characters. The characters are really well written, and the dialog is pretty funny. The characters will also give optional goals at the start of levels if you want more of a challenge. And if you want to spend more than a couple of hours on the game, you had really better go for every one of those challenges and collectibles, because this game is short as HELL. I took my time and meandered about the levels, reset them a few times, and I still beat the whole game in like 3 hours. There's a level editor with workshop integration, but a game shouldn't have to rely on user generated content to last for more than one short sitting.In short;PROS: solid gameplay with interesting mechanics, well written characters, funny dialogCONS: short as hell, can easily be beaten in a few hours			"

So my advice would be to buy this game on sale.I can find no faults with this game except that it doesn't have much playtime. Other than that, it is a fascinating game.

												This is easily one of the best downloadable ""indie"" games I've ever played. Incredibly simple in its mechanics, it still manages to deliver a suprising amount of depth due to the way it lets the player get through the missions in any way they see fit. The simple gameplay feels very satisfying, the puzzles are clever, and the noir soundtrack and 8/16 bit era look of the game are pitch perfect. This is just overall great, no-frills gameplay stripped down to its purest form. I really, really hope that Tom Francis (the developer) gives us more of this, whether it be DLC, an expansion, or a sequel, because this was one of the most enjoyable games I've had the pleasure of playing in quite some time.

												A simple, short game about a spy with no allegiances who's just trying to keep himself from getting screwed over and make some money. Gunpoint's strategy with a stealth element and it's game mecahnics are what really makes the game unique. They are fascinating because they make you think in terms of open and closed circuts - e.g. object A does this which triggers object B and electrocutes a guard. While it's easy to catch on, it's not so easy that mental effort isn't required - I'd say medium on the challenging scale. If just doing the bare minimum, one can finish this game in a matter of hours, but there are extra achievements possible for doing levels with a specific style or speed if that's your kind of thing. The dialogue is cute and made me laugh. While it's not an adventure game per say, you are given a few choices that will affect the game. And the ability to choose different dialogue options in between missions made me feel more invested in my character. (For example, I made my character as snarky as possible.) The music is well done and quite fitting, as is the 16-bit design; both really help to aid the cloak and dagger atmosphere for our spy protagonist. All in all it's a cute little indie game that's definitely worth getting on sale.			"

												The beauty of Gunpoint is its simplicity: the visuals are low-fi, but the gameplay is decidedly high-tech. Equipped with mechanical trousers that permit you to leap tall buildings in a--well, a couple of bounds--you assume the role of a detective caught up in a murder conspiracy, armed with only your pants and a couple of upgrades. It's one of the most deliciously well-written, atmospheric, and satisfying puzzlers I've played in a long time. VISUALS: Simple and clean, pixel-art that communicates the environment without any clutter to distract you from the gameplay. SOUND/MUSIC: The tunes in this game are legitimately good listening all on their own, but they add a noir ambience that is undeniably a character unto itself. GAMEPLAY: Aside from acrobatic feats, you can use a wiremapping device to re-wire entire buildings, so that a light-switch in one room might short a light socket in another--and thereby electrocute and pacify a patrolling guard. There are many opportunities for game-breaking shenanigans here. Add in a level creator and you've got room for plenty of replayability. Great stealth-action title, very funny, highly recommended.

												I can only recommend this with a caveat: DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE.For some reason, there are a lot of developers out there with much hate in their heart for headphone-wearing gamers.  Gunpoint doubles the hate quotient by neglecting to include options for remapping the controls, as well as the sound volume.  You do get the option to change your (windowed) screen resolution, but it requires restarting the game.  For the $10-$15 price that Gunpoint is asking, I expect a game written in a proper framework that supports all the conventional options that have been the norm for PC gaming for decades now.  Instead, we get a game that feels like it was made using the same kind of software people use for creating training videos or websites.  It's great that there's authorware out there that enables people with creative vision to make games without requiring any technical know-how, but I don't want to see the resulting products proffered up at the same price as purpose-built software.  There are a quite a few other games in this price range that have the polish of AAA titles, but everything about Gunpoint feels amateurish.  With that out of the way, please let me say that this is a pretty fun puzzle game.  The rewiring mechanic is well executed, and sets this game apart from other 2D puzzlers and platformers.			"

												I'm rarely an impulse buyer when it comes to new releases.  In fact I more resemble a certain XKCD comic about delayed enjoyment of major releases.  Somethng about Gunpoint though grabbed me right off.  I threw my $9 down and let the chips fall where they may.  They... uhm... I'm not sure how to finish that metaphor.  It wasn't $9 wasted, let's just say that.The entire thing is a wonderful mix of retro-puzzle-cool, with visuals in the vein of a 386-era platformer but with that modern twist of ingenuity and ""hey, you're a spy now, cool!""  The ambiance is great, very 30's hardboiled/gumshoe/spy but with a pseudo-modern setting and sci-fi gadgetry.  As a kid, did you ever wish there was an awesome ""be a super spy"" game that you could play?  This is that game, except designed by an adult with rather good development sensibilities.The gameplay itself is that perfect mix of ""easy to pick up"" and ""takes practice"".  All your gadgets have their obvious uses, but after you spend enough time playing around you start to learn all the other cool things they can do... and the other cool trouble they can get you into.  You can generally get through the game if you take your time, but after you do you can challenge yourself to do it faster and possibly with certain restrictions, like never knocking out a guard or even being seen by one.  Yes, you will want to play it again.Gunpoint's plot is satisfying but somewhat short, leaving you wanting more.  As I said above you can get some of that satisfaction from playing the game over again, or even going back through old levels with your new gadgetry to completely break the intended puzzle aspects.  There's also a level editor and the ability to load custom levels, which can further satisfy that need for more.  The only downside is that they can't (as far as I can tell) be arranged into a plot-based progression like the main ones are.The last thing I'll say in this surprisingly long recommendation is that the game really reminds me of Deus Ex, of all things.  That's hardly surprising though given that the game was designed by Tom Francis, a self-confessed fan of the game who's written articles on it for major game publications as recently as 2010.  Gunpoint definitely has that ""multiple solutions to every problem"" thing down, and it tickles that same part of my Game-brain.In short, buy this if you like Deus Ex and/or puzzle platformers and/or spy coolness.

												If this game doesnt earn a 10/10, no game does. the simplistic art style is expressive enough to convey the noir of the story (be prepared there is quite a lot of strong language). Murder, double-crossing, drama, door-kicking, window-breaking the list is endless! I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Kudos ""Suspicious games""!!!			"

7 dead. 13 injured. 20 jobs. $13,000. The week echoed in my mind like a gunshot in an empty street..They don't let me name names on this blog, but the person behind the hit I was investigating is dead now.In fact, I may have killed more people than I actually avenged here.The trigger man's dead. That would have felt good if I hadn't just taken a seven story body slam.I don't know.I guess I picked the least ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of two incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sides.Maybe that doesn't matter. Maybe all that matters is that I now have the ability to kick down doors.Either way, I need a drink. "

												After play gunpoint there was only one thing I wanted...MORE! The game is really short, I beat it in one whole sitting which took about an hour or so. I had to go to the steam workshop to get more levels. The gameplay is what makes this game amazing! The hacking in this game, I would say, is better than the hacking in watch_dogs and punching guards repetedly is hilarious. unfourtunatly, I do not think this game is worth $10 or 6.36 Pounds for being a very short game. I would reccomend this game if it goes on sale. ~Kittens out			"

												Quite an entertaining game. If I had to summarize this game in a single sentence, I'd probably say ""A game about feeling stealthy"". I don't know how else to say it, I really don't. This has been the first ""stealth"" game I have played where I have felt truly stealthy and badass. And I've played quite a few, and found the stealth sections to be boring and annoying. The soundtrack probably brings some of those feelings. The soundtrack is fantastic, albeit short, and every track is a joy to listen to. If you want a small dose of the music, I'd recommend listening to the trailer. The storyline is lacking, but I wouldn't consider that to be something that makes it a terrible game. In fact, even without a storyline, this game still shines. The storyline does what it should do, however. It gives you an objective. A villain, per-se. And that's all you really need. Last of all, the gameplay is what brings it all together. Early in the game, you are given the ability to ""jump"". It's exactly what you think. You can do whatever you want with it, though. Climb on walls, hang on ceilings, etc. All the while, being extremely unrealistic and silly. The other main mechanic, the rewiring of electricity, is a joy. For any puzzle game enthusiasts, this part of the game is for you. However, don't expect any puzzles to be too complex. There are multiple ways to reach your endgoal. And all of them are fun. I would definitely recommend this game even if it is very short.8.5/10			"

												Gunpoint is a special game to me. It was one of the first games I bought on Steam and I can't get enough of it. Gunpoint is one of the, if not the best, indie game I have ever played.Pros:The crosslink is a really cool feature and it makes you think about where you need to wire buttons or motion/sound detectors or unwire them to prevent one of the AI from activating what you just activated.The story is pretty cool. It isn't the best story I've ever seen but it's good in it's own right and I was interested the entire way through the game to know what would eventually happen. SPOILER: The ending is really cool to me, I like that you find the killer and finally face up against him and Fritz and avenge Selena's death.The soundtrack is awesome and it sounds appropriate for this game. This easily passes for me because I'm a sucker for good music.The game is an overall fun experience. It's definetly one that I'll never forget.The art in Gunpoint looks nice. The backgrounds are really detailed and the levels have so much detail to them, too. The game never gets too hard to the point where you want to punch a hole into a wall. The game is well-balanced.The outlets.Cons:There isn't really a bonus at the end of the game for getting all of the achievements and getting A+ on every level.In the end, Gunpoint is a really amazing game. I wasn't expecting much going into Gunpoint as I only bought it for $5 while on a sale. I was very surprised at first when I completed Gunpoint and ended up loving it. I always come back to the game when I'm bored to get lower times on levels I had a couple minutes on. It's really cool to complete your record you got from the beginning of the game in more than half the time... and it feels great to beat a level faster than the developer.			"

												One time in a game design class, we attempted to create a puzzle game with multiple possible solutions. Gunpoint is a game that does this better then I ever will. It is well thought out in its puzzles and story, and every level has many solutions. Even the final boss has four (I think) distinct solutions to beating him. My only complaitent is how short the game is, I had my full after two playthroughs, totallying only 8 hours. But those hours was worth the price.			"

												Short: Buy it when it is on sale. Great game. Funny. Very short. Little replay value after finishing story.Not too long of a game. Didn't take too long to progress through the game. It has some pretty funny dialogue, some good puzzle solving, fitting graphics, immersive music soundtrack, and quite a bit of unexpected satisfaction after face punching an agent in the face over 250+ times while simultaneously earning an achievement for it that I had no clue about. That, in my opinion, made up for the time it took to get through the game (taking my sweet time). Launched an armored guard out of a 6 story window. Kicked several doors down in a few guards' faces. Had some good fun. Bought it during the Autumn sale for less than 1/3 the price. Don't regret it at all. Well worth the price that I got it for on sale.If you haven't checked out this game, give it a shot. However, if it isn't on sale, I would definitely wait. The normal price is a no go since it is a bit short and has only a little bit of replay value.			"

A great hacking mechanic, level design is ranging from simple to complex, and a good range of enemy types for certain situations help bring this game to life.  While this game is really fun, my one problem is the time it took for me to be done with it (2 hours), but that's fixed by community made maps, and there are plenty of them.			"

												I'm rarely an impulse buyer when it comes to new releases.  In fact I more resemble a certain XKCD comic about delayed enjoyment of major releases.  Somethng about Gunpoint though grabbed me right off.  I threw my $9 down and let the chips fall where they may.  They... uhm... I'm not sure how to finish that metaphor.  It wasn't $9 wasted, let's just say that.The entire thing is a wonderful mix of retro-puzzle-cool, with visuals in the vein of a 386-era platformer but with that modern twist of ingenuity and ""hey, you're a spy now, cool!""  The ambiance is great, very 30's hardboiled/gumshoe/spy but with a pseudo-modern setting and sci-fi gadgetry.  As a kid, did you ever wish there was an awesome ""be a super spy"" game that you could play?  This is that game, except designed by an adult with rather good development sensibilities.The gameplay itself is that perfect mix of ""easy to pick up"" and ""takes practice"".  All your gadgets have their obvious uses, but after you spend enough time playing around you start to learn all the other cool things they can do... and the other cool trouble they can get you into.  You can generally get through the game if you take your time, but after you do you can challenge yourself to do it faster and possibly with certain restrictions, like never knocking out a guard or even being seen by one.  Yes, you will want to play it again.Gunpoint's plot is satisfying but somewhat short, leaving you wanting more.  As I said above you can get some of that satisfaction from playing the game over again, or even going back through old levels with your new gadgetry to completely break the intended puzzle aspects.  There's also a level editor and the ability to load custom levels, which can further satisfy that need for more.  The only downside is that they can't (as far as I can tell) be arranged into a plot-based progression like the main ones are.The last thing I'll say in this surprisingly long recommendation is that the game really reminds me of Deus Ex, of all things.  That's hardly surprising though given that the game was designed by Tom Francis, a self-confessed fan of the game who's written articles on it for major game publications as recently as 2010.  Gunpoint definitely has that ""multiple solutions to every problem"" thing down, and it tickles that same part of my Game-brain.In short, buy this if you like Deus Ex and/or puzzle platformers and/or spy coolness.

												This is an excellent game.Main premise: You are an industrial spy who wears a cool hat and a trenchcoat while trying to solve a murder (and make a killing in the meantime). You have two main abilities to help you do this (besides the hat): the BullFrog Jump Trousers which allow you to jump absurdly high distances and your Crosslink which allows you to hack into nearly any system, influding doors, security cameras, guns, trapdoors, and so on. The game requires you to master both of these abilities to be able to complete the brilliant puzzles it throws at you.In case you didn't know this already, this is a puzzle game. The main point of the game is to solve puzzles by avoiding (or slaying) guards and hacking systems to acheive some objective.Another fun element of the game is how much control you have over your character's morality. I personally tried to play the game without killing, hitting, or being seen by any guards, a feat I did not successfully accomplish. You can just as legitimately try to tackle every guard out of a window, however. There isn't that much of a different ending either way, but it was fun to try and solve the puzzles in so many different ways.All in all, Gunpoint is a great puzzle game that I really enjoyed. My only critique is a relatively small one: the bug causing the game to crash on my computer unless I disable the Steam Overlay is a little irritating, especially because it keeps me from being able to play the Steam Workshop levels. Overall a great game, however. Keep 'em coming!			"

												A short game, but its worth every single second. The breaking of the forth wall and well developed, funny, interesting dialog made it worth punching a dude 300 times in the face. Plus the puzzling twists and multiple ending / choices even early in the game made it feel new.Plus the creativity of the maps was brilliant, making you think with all of your wit. The realism and realistic AI is shown when you break glass, a guard rushes out of its designated area to investigate, then the AI sets them there. Finally, the open ended was to beat each level makes me play a level 5 times, just to see if I find a new responce. The game to me felt like a glued paper, you would need a crowbar to get me off.I dont know. . .I feel like this game, it grows on your personality, considering I am the main character.But if you love punching a guy in the face, crosslinking doors to hit a guy in the face on the push of a button, kicking doors, doing whatever the f*ck you want since your freelance, this is your game!

												Words that describe Gunpoint and my time while playing: Fun, Exciting, Plentiful, Achievements ♥♥♥♥♥, Frustrating, Puzzling, Mysterious, etc.My first indie game that I played and bought on steam happened to be Gunpoint. Ever since I got the game, I have had countless hours of enjoyable fun with over 4 playthroughs already to my profile and also a steam community workshop item. Ever since I bought the game, I have been able to watch it grow and prosper through the new updates along with the new community fanbase, something that is easily visible through the steam workshop titles, and also the third party programs that people have used in partnership with the developers to design custom levels with textures other than from in the regular editor. My personal opinion of the game coming into it was that of excitement and joy, because of how the game was a perfect match to my playing style and how it was easy enough to get achievements (which I love). It provided me with a 4 hour straight period of joy and commitment that led to me wanting more out of the game and also the game's level editor. I felt the need after everything, to show my experience with the world and essentially show how much fun the game was. Overall however, the game's graphics are smooth and artful, providing a meaningful experience even on ""toasters"" that will never fail to provide you with continous fun throughout your day. If I had to give this game a score, I would most definently give it a 10/10 no matter what people have to say about it.			"

While holding a relatively short story, the games mechanics and workshop features allow one to easily see the replayability.Red recommends this for casual gamers who are looking to kill time, but suggests that you buy it when on sale.

												For those who want a quick answer: INCREDIBLE. BUY. IT. NOW.For those who want to know why:This is game is exactly what I expected Watch Dogs to be like - either using clever tricks to outsmart your enemies and stealth to try to avoid violence, or running in and rushing the objective, not caring about what, or who, gets in you way. However, in every conceivable way, this game is far, far, far better than Watch Dogs. SO, are you considering buying Watch Dogs? Don't. Buy 5 copies of this instead. The mechanics are impeccable, the intriguing story keeps you playing until the end, then lets you replay any mission you want - with your new upgrades. I can honestly say, this is one of the best games I have ever played, and the best £6 I have ever spent.			"

												Gunpoint, on the surface is puzzle platformer with quirky dialog. Deep down; however, Gunpoint offers humour, a good twisty narative, and fresh take on the murder mystery genre. The plot itself is relatively similar to other hard-boiled detective stories thyat provide a corrupt corporate executive and the girl who's caught up in it all (ie, Ian Rankin's 'Let it Bleed,' or Raymond Chandler's 'The Big Sleep') but this game gives you control over Conway in the dialog portions. Allowign the player to choose what style of character Conway is what really makes this game special. The player gets 3 basic choices of personality: stoic, crazy, and not-giving-a♥♥♥♥♥♥ All 3 are wonderful, and this alone would make me recommend this game, but when you add on the exceptionally fun gameplay, Gunpoint stands above many other puzzle-platformers of its ilk.

The game mechanics are cool and original, the graphics are decent pixel art, and the story is a hilarious noir bizarre intrigue.The game is very short, but it has a level editor and there is plenty of user generated content. You can also replay the main story and, because it is so funny, see different dialog options.Worth your time and money.			"

												The gameplay encourages creativity without punishing mistakes. Each mission gives you an objective; how you complete that objective is completely up to you. No playstyle or mechanic takes precedence over any other. With its smart design, creative mechanics and Film Noir atmosphere (complemented with an impressive soundtrack) Gunpoint is one of the best gameplay experiences I’ve had in recent years. My only complaint is that the story only takes about 2 hours to complete.The Steam achievements are a lot of fun adding to the replayability.			"

												Hell yes!!!I have been waiting for a game like this for a long time and just didn't realize it untill i bought it.Here is why....1) not only can you do everything that the demo video shows you such as leap like a puma and take down enemies and punch the crap out of them. but you can launch them out a window..... then punch the crap out of them. but much more!2) the re-wire system is so good. such puzzle, very wow.you can hook up a lightswitch to a door, to a light then to a trap door to slow down the circut a bit so you can get into an area. you can also hook it up to a power point/light so when you turn the light off you can then trigger a spark in the power point as a guard walks past and knock him out.3) i love the humor in this game, nice and dry... like my martini when i listen to smooth jazz. which brings me to my next point4) the music is awesome! i love it as it fits the overall theme and makes you feel all the more like your in a propper spy gamei highly recommend this game as it is worth more imo than the asking price. dont be detured by the art style, it is also what makes this game so damn awesome. to be enjoyed with a martini... shaken, not stirred.9013/9000 (ITS OVER NINE THOUSAND!!!)

												This is easily one of the best downloadable ""indie"" games I've ever played. Incredibly simple in its mechanics, it still manages to deliver a suprising amount of depth due to the way it lets the player get through the missions in any way they see fit. The simple gameplay feels very satisfying, the puzzles are clever, and the noir soundtrack and 8/16 bit era look of the game are pitch perfect. This is just overall great, no-frills gameplay stripped down to its purest form. I really, really hope that Tom Francis (the developer) gives us more of this, whether it be DLC, an expansion, or a sequel, because this was one of the most enjoyable games I've had the pleasure of playing in quite some time.

Just the way it works is so good!- The dialog and talking is some of the funniest stuff i've ever seen in a game. I actually laughed out loud at some of the stuff said in the conversations between chracters. Its very well done. - The smooth jazz that plays along in the background is great too, perfect for a sneaky, smooth spy ninja like Roberts.I highly recommend this game, I love it!

Being a spy was so much fun in this game, and you'll probably think the same thing.The way you can rewire electricity to make traps, or just open a door to get into the special room makes this game one of my favorites. I also like how you can pick sides, you don't know which are the good guys or the bad guys, I would recommend this game to my friends any time.I believe it was worth the money. "

												Wow, where to begin...I bought this on the Steam Christmas Sale 2014 as something to play on my awful laptop. I should perhaps mention that I had no idea what the game was about at the time, but it was cheap and scored high on Metacritic.What did I find? One of the best games I have played in recent years. It is difficult to explain just why it is so good without spoiling the game, suffice it to say that both the story and mechanics, as well as their execution, are without fault. The game has a subtle, dark sense of humour which punctuates its noir storytelling. In terms of actual gameplay, I would describe it as an immersive puzzle platformer, though its beauty is that each problem can be approached in a variety of ways.  The game is not particularly long, and I completed it in roughly four hours, though my playstyle is ponderous at best. However, that should not discourage you from spending money on this gem of a game. The variety of solutions as well as the multitude of achievements will make subsequent playthroughs as riveting as the first.In conclusion: Buy it, download it, play it, recommend it.			"

												Gunpoint is an awesome puzzle/strategy game that is available on all platforms. The game is short (less than four hours) but because the in-game level editor could potentially provide a lot more play time, I would say this game is definitely worth it. The gameplay is new and excellent.Pros:+Excellent and unique gameplay+Cheesy but funny humor+Great noir feel to the game (with the exception of the goofy jokes, but they're funny, so it's ok)+Level editor for making and sharing your own levelsCons:-Main game is very short (took like 3.5 hours for me)-Game menus sometimes feel a little unpolished; not sure how to describe it, they just feel slightly unfinished in some way. However, this does not make the menus difficult to navigate and is not present during the actual gameplay.-(Linux only) Did not work in XFCE for some reason. I switched to dwm and the game worked.The real reason to buy Gunpoint is that the gameplay is new and innovative. It's also the kind of game where the amount of crazy scenarios that can occur can go way beyond the main game, which is why the level editor is such a great feature. I recommend it at full price, particularly if you love noir or puzzles. If it's on sale it's a no-brainer.			"

												This game was excellent.  The way the story was  loved it. The way the fighting went loved it.  controls loved them too.  This game will take you around 3 to 7 hours of gameplay. In my case it took me about 7.5 to 8 hours to beat it.  Those were the pros now there is only one problem i had with this game the gliches.  These glitches made mestart the whole level over or even fall through a wall.  With all this sid i give gunpoint 9/10			"

												To be honest I was disappointed this game ended after just 6 hours of gameplay cause I was having such a good time! Glad that the Steam Workshop is attached to this and that there are some 463 other maps, stories, and variations on a theme for Gunpoint that can be experienced. This is also one of those games that you can play at work or at home since it is not that fast paced but it will tax your mind and patience some to complete some of the trickier levels. YouTube is your friend when it comes to hints to help here.			"

												The hacking in this game is better than Watch Dogs. Yes, I am being serious.Gunpoint is a new unique indie game that is very fun and worth $10. It's simple yet smart and has its' fair share of challenges, humor, and developing features. The level editor gives it unlimited replay value and the Steam Workshop capability is a plus. A fun noire feel along with a retro soundtrack really makes this indie game click. I recommend this one for sure.			"

												It's the only game I've got all achievments in on steam It's so unique, I mean it's so satisfying when your plan comes together.  Example: You could turn off the lights then wire the light switch to the guards gun then his friend will go turn the lights on and then his friend shoots him. Also that's quite a basic trap you could do way more things than that, the story is really good instead of just following a normal story you get to make choices and what you say will make a difference.

												This game is incredible, one of 2013's finest. Rewiring switches and cams to outsmart or violently beat down guards, never gets old. Gunpoint has the most mundane final powerup ever, but in the context of the game it makes you feel like a god. Takes about 4-5 hours to get through the game, but I can't wait to go back to those levels to try different things. Buy this. Play this.			"

												If you enjoy games such as Deadbolt and Mark of the Ninja where basic stealth mechanics are blended with puzzle ones, you will almost certainly enjoy Gunpoint, an indie game that I picked up on sale last year for £1.50. If you are a fan of games with stealth mechanics that are fleshed out further like Dishonoured and the Deus Ex games, you be tempted to give Gunpoint a miss, but there are still plenty of mechanics despite this that make Gunpoint an overall brilliant game for fans of puzzle and stealth games alike.It's main mechanic, ""crosslinking"" means that your character is able to rewire objects by hacking them. This mechanic means that there are several ways to clear missions. For example, if there is a locked door in your way, you could simply rewire the light switch next to you to open the door, or you could be slightly more creative by turning off the lights to bait a guard into pressing the light switch, then rewiring the light switch to the door to open it. This mechanic is very satisfying as most of the time, I found myself finding strategies just by experimenting with the rewiring mechanic. This is also helped by there being no intrusive and mundane tutorial sections. Instead you have the choice to be guided through a short and basic tutorial for a specific item. The rest is left up to you.Pros:-The art style (pixel graphics) are similar to those shown in games like Hyper Light Drifter and Papers Please, and is a very beautiful and minimalistic depiction of a cyberpunk style city.-The upgrade system, while being very basic is also very rewarding. Without spoiling much, many gadgets that make your missions easier and more satisfying can be purchased. Some examples include the ability to hack plug sockets so you can electrocute guards who walk past them, the ability to jump through windows without making any sound and the ability to hack enemy guns. You would think that with the eventual progression of upgrades, the missions would become easier, but many of your gadgets drain the charge on your battery meter meaning that the strategic use of these gadgets is better than running in and using all of them.-You can complete most levels with your basic equipment (although some later missions require specific items) although they are much harder this way. This means that specific missions are rarely tied to one specific mechanic and there are many ways to carry out your mission as I mentioned before.-Although the game can be completed in around 3 hours, I believe that the starting price of the game (around £6.99) is worth it since the game is extremely replayable. I have played through the game twice in the last 6 months and plan to again soon. The missions can be replayed to get a better score in aspects such as the amount of noise you make, if you were seen during your mission or not and whether you killed guards or knocked them out. Furthermore, there is a level editor that functions really well, meaning that after you have played through the main story, you can play and create levels in the Steam Workshop.-For people who don't really care about this stuff, then ignore this. The soundtrack to Gunpoint is one of my favourites of all time. It is a perfect blend of electro music and jazz and I sometimes listen to it to relax. Because the sound effects in each level are limited, the music is not background music, but rather part of the level itself. -As for the story, it's not Mass Effect but there are a few choices in dialogue that will change the outcome of the story. Most exchanges are done through text conversations and you have the choice to respond to characters seriously or jokingly, often with fourth-wall breaking lines. Although these exchanges mostly do not affect the story, the dialogue is well written and witty.-Speaking of funny things, the achievements in this game are actual achievements you have to go out of your way to complete. In the first playthrough of the game, you will likely only get a few, but they are very creative ones. One example of this is if you kick down a door and knocka guard over, you are rewarded with an achievement appropriately called ""Open Door Policy"".-The story is simple, yet satisfying. The plot uses many standard spy film tropes but manages to hold up because of the witty protagonist and the interesting cast of characters you are speaking to.Cons:-The autosave feature, where when you die, lets you continue from a choice of three points in your mission, some recently and some a few minutes ago. Becuase there is no icon or autosave animation, you sometimes do not know where you will respawn.-The atosave feature also sometimes decides to save right when a guard would spot you if you were not paying attention, so when you reload it, you instantly die.-I encountered probelms in my playthrough where I would clip through walls when I jumped at them, meaning I had to restart the mission again. Although this only happened twice, it was very annoying to have to restart becuase of a glitch I had no control over.-Becuase the story is presented through text, you have to be paying attention to follow the story. Normally this is fine as you are only reading short messages, but sometimes you are faced with a large chunk of text to read. This meant that the story was more convoluted than I would have hoped.Overall, Gunpoint does very well at blending puzzle and stealth gameplay into a strategic and methodical game. The writing is hilarious and the pixel art visuals look great. Only a few technical problems and bugs stop this game from being perfect.Gunpoint gets a 9/10			"

												Fun game especially if you love indie games with different non-mainstream mechanics (isn't that the whole point of indie games ?). The only complaint I have for this game is that is not very challenging at all. I hope with its success the creator will make a more challenging sequel or DLC. With that being said the game does make you think a little bit to solve each level and is a unique blend of stealth/adventure game. If you like playing indie games this is a must have especially when on Steam sale.			"

												If you're the kind of person who enjoys putting restrictions on themselves to find new ways to solve things or who demands getting the best possible scores, you'll find a lot of replay value in Gunpoint. If you want to just hammer through the fastest possible solutions every time, you'll finish in two hours and never play it again. Fun game with some elements of branching plot, the ability to execute your runs quickly, quietly and professionally or with as much violence and broken glass as possible. The writing is also very funny.			"

												Very unique in every aspect. Best described as a noir themed stealth puzzle platformer game where you play as a freelance spy, wearing super jump trousers and a crosslink mechanism allowing you to tinker about with the buildings electronics. The soundtrack is undeniably cool, same goes for the characters who can be pretty funny too with the right dialogue options. Despite the game cutting short at no more than three hours there is plenty of replayability to be found in the ranking system, level editor and just because there is no other game like it.			"

												This is a game where you leap thirty feet into the air through a window to tackle a guard, then magically re-wire another guard's gun so that when he tries to shoot you it instead slams a door on a third guard two floors down, knocking him unconcious.  It is not a game where you do a lot of anything at gunpoint, and in fact if you do finally obtain a gun you only get a handful of bullets and can never get more.  Try to get through all the levels without hurting anyone!  Try to knock out as many guards as you can without ever entering the building!  Make your own levels with a mostly-okay level editor!  Enjoy the genuinely hilarious dialogue! This is a game you can buy using money, and you should do that.			"

												Gunpoint is a cozy, puzzle-like game for whenever you've got some time to spare.Playing as Richard Conway, a freelance spy, your job is to infiltrate guarded facilities and retrieve valuable intel and objects while remaining in the shadows. To your help, you're given a device that can help you hack the environment around you; everything from doors to power sockets. As you progress through the story and your missions get harder, you get to choose from new gadgets, giving the game more variation. Its pretty yet simple rural evironment is well accompanied by a perfect (really) set of jazz songs and witty humor between Conway and his contacts that further enhances the immersiveness and coziness of the game.

As you progress you can unlock new gadgets that will be required for future story missions.  All around the gameplay is really fluid and well done, and you can probably get through the story in about 3 hours, give or take. Alongside the story, there is also a level editor, and the ability to play other user-made levels.			"

												Very well worth it. Especially considering it cost £1 or so.The only real downside is the story being a bit short. I've done it in 2 hours, and I was taking my time.On the other hand, the pros are many. The gameplay is simple but smart, nice puzzles, and hilarious things happen. I laughed out loud more than once. Soundtrack is pretty cool, if you lower its volume. The story is quite funny and entertaining. And so on and so forth.If the game had more missions and a longer story, or even more than one storyline, I'd easily give it a 10/10 for a very entertaining non-hardcore title.			"

												Gunpoint is a noir stealth-action puzzle platformer. You're a freelance spy with a number of high-tech gadgets that are to be used in your jobs. Smart innovative gameplay, nice pixel graphics, atmospheric music — everything about Gunpoint is great! But the most remarkable part of the game for me is adorable sense of humour. Quotation forthcoming.People complain about the game's length, but there's nothing wrong with living short, but brilliant life.			"

												I don't remember last time when playing as spy was so fun like in Gunpoint. I love how many different ways you can use to beat the level - from just shooting everyone to using many of great gadgets for more effective way to do it. It's really good stealth game. If you don't mind rather simple / pixel graphics and dozen of comedy - play it.			"

												I really enjoyed this game for it's cool hard-boiled, sci-fi noir theme with a great soundtrack, cool visuals, and fun gameplay. When I first heard about this game, what attracted me to it is how reminiscent it was to the old arcade classic, Elevator Action. So if you want an idea of what this game is like, picture Elevator Action, but with better visuals, more stealth, building hacking, and a story.			"

												Fun puzzle/stealth game. Not super challenging, but there are a handful of situations that will make you think. The game is worth playing by measure of its style and snark alone. Only negative is that it's ridiculously short! if you don't take time to smell the roses (IE: read all of the fun dialogue and look for optional objectives) you can easily complete this game in an hour or less. Not that you should, that is.. if you do that you're missing out on what really makes this game entertaining.			"

												I'm rarely an impulse buyer when it comes to new releases.  In fact I more resemble a certain XKCD comic about delayed enjoyment of major releases.  Somethng about Gunpoint though grabbed me right off.  I threw my $9 down and let the chips fall where they may.  They... uhm... I'm not sure how to finish that metaphor.  It wasn't $9 wasted, let's just say that.The entire thing is a wonderful mix of retro-puzzle-cool, with visuals in the vein of a 386-era platformer but with that modern twist of ingenuity and ""hey, you're a spy now, cool!""  The ambiance is great, very 30's hardboiled/gumshoe/spy but with a pseudo-modern setting and sci-fi gadgetry.  As a kid, did you ever wish there was an awesome ""be a super spy"" game that you could play?  This is that game, except designed by an adult with rather good development sensibilities.The gameplay itself is that perfect mix of ""easy to pick up"" and ""takes practice"".  All your gadgets have their obvious uses, but after you spend enough time playing around you start to learn all the other cool things they can do... and the other cool trouble they can get you into.  You can generally get through the game if you take your time, but after you do you can challenge yourself to do it faster and possibly with certain restrictions, like never knocking out a guard or even being seen by one.  Yes, you will want to play it again.Gunpoint's plot is satisfying but somewhat short, leaving you wanting more.  As I said above you can get some of that satisfaction from playing the game over again, or even going back through old levels with your new gadgetry to completely break the intended puzzle aspects.  There's also a level editor and the ability to load custom levels, which can further satisfy that need for more.  The only downside is that they can't (as far as I can tell) be arranged into a plot-based progression like the main ones are.The last thing I'll say in this surprisingly long recommendation is that the game really reminds me of Deus Ex, of all things.  That's hardly surprising though given that the game was designed by Tom Francis, a self-confessed fan of the game who's written articles on it for major game publications as recently as 2010.  Gunpoint definitely has that ""multiple solutions to every problem"" thing down, and it tickles that same part of my Game-brain.In short, buy this if you like Deus Ex and/or puzzle platformers and/or spy coolness.

												This is easily one of the best downloadable ""indie"" games I've ever played. Incredibly simple in its mechanics, it still manages to deliver a suprising amount of depth due to the way it lets the player get through the missions in any way they see fit. The simple gameplay feels very satisfying, the puzzles are clever, and the noir soundtrack and 8/16 bit era look of the game are pitch perfect. This is just overall great, no-frills gameplay stripped down to its purest form. I really, really hope that Tom Francis (the developer) gives us more of this, whether it be DLC, an expansion, or a sequel, because this was one of the most enjoyable games I've had the pleasure of playing in quite some time.

No playstyle or mechanic takes precedence over any other. With its smart design, creative mechanics and Film Noir atmosphere (complemented with an impressive soundtrack) Gunpoint is one of the best gameplay experiences I’ve had in recent years. My only complaint is that the story only takes about 2 hours to complete.The Steam achievements are a lot of fun adding to the replayability.			"

												Now let's have a look at the pros and cons of the story line first.(I know that you urge for them at first, just scroll down for a more detailed description)Pro:-Great level design-Campaign plays smooth-Great humor and jokes between the missions-Steam Workshop offers a long-term playabilityContra:-Story line is just about 2 hours long-Story isn't that replayable in my opinion it becomes boring too fast-Decisions do not affect the ending, but it doesn't make the game linearSide Note:So I bought the game at the release date andI was satisfied with the game UNTIL the story campaign was over.Many people in the review section may had complained about the issue before.They were longing for a missing feature for a long time, but now after a year of waiting it's avaible; STEAM WORKSHOP!Story:You play a charakter called ""Conway"",he's a person whose a type of hacking contract killer bulgar.Who just got another contract, what he doesn't know is, he is going on a big one this time.Gameplay:Conway has unique equipment, whereas I tell you the most useful and main gadget of  the game: the ""crosslink"" tool. It's therefore to connect every interactable object to another -e.g. A switch to a door-, with this gadget you can interact with your surroundings and reach the objective; hacking and stealing sensitive data. As in stealing this data, you will have to get to the data container first, which is for example: a computer which is in posses of information, which in turn your client needs.Just expect that and a lot more.Workshop:Steam Workshop offers about an amount of 500 levels at the first two weeks of its release.It's incredible how quickly the game turned me on again, I really wanted to play the game after a year again.Level Editor:Making your own levels is pretty simple, you only have to click on the ""Level Editor"" option in the menu, and you are good to go. Though, you don't get access to all the features in the level editor.Therefore we have ""PointEdit"", a level editor which has every item of the game included.Rating:A clear 9.5/10, due to the Steam Workshop.

The levels are very well put toghether, and are not too difficult, if you think hard enough. +Old fashioned-esque beauitiful graphics+Makes you feel like a baddass-WARNING: Contains adult language and violence=Crude humor, I love it, some might not.=Short story, made up for in decent replayability, especcially with the post-game powerups.10/10, No complaints.

												Charming, funny and clever. Three words that are usually the signs of a well-made game.Whilst it's not going to keep you up at night racking your brain on how to beat that ONE level, it's enough of a challenge to keep your brain ticking over.A standard 2D stealth-em-up with a novel twist, the game encourages and rewards creativity, although if you get frustrated, there's always the option to go charging in as well. The dialogue between missions bounces from pretty amusing to out-and-out hilarious without ever compromising a story that becomes more interesting and less 'token' than you may think at first glance.Personally, this is well worth your money if you have even a passing interest in this sort of game. A very pleasant impulse buy.			"

												So in one sentence, this game had unique mechanics, amusing dialog, and was fun to play but was surprisingly short. You start out with the power to super jump which you can use to tackle guards and crash through windows, and you start adding other gadgets to your arsenal. The most significant to gameplay allows you to re-route circuits in the levels to activate different types of objects. So for example, you can re-route a lightswitch to open a locked door, assuming you have access to that circuit. This gives each level a bit of a sandbox were you can do silly stuff, like rigging the elevator so that when it opens, it turns off a light, and when the guard tries to turn off the light, he'll inadvertently unlock a door for you by flipping a switch. These rube-goldberg-esque solutions aren't usually the most practical way to play the game, but are usually the most fun.I was going for all objectives, no kills, no noise just like I usually do with stealth-type games, and still beat the game in like 3 hours or something, all told. Usually this playstyle makes my playtimes really long, but not so with Gunpoint.  It does have a level editor, so if you're into hidden value, it might be there, and I think that there's tons and tons of unexplored design territory for budding puzzle designers. So while I do recommend Gunpoint, it's hard to recommend at full price. They did a good job tying everything together with a story, but a couple dozen cheaply made puzzle levels would've really added to the game's value and would've been a totally welcome post-game unlock like some kind of challenge mode.Some friends might chastise me for this caveat against an indie developer, but as fun as the mechanics are, I feel like they under-utilized what they had.

												GunPoint is a welcome title amongst all the High Def, 3D, indepth titles we see now.  It is refreashing too see that some game developers remember the roots of iconic pixel games.  But it's not just the nastalgia that makes Gunpoint unique.  It's the complex puzzles required for completing a mission.  There are multiple ways of completing a mission, either way is preferable.  From hiding in the dark to knocking the guards off a 5 story building through the window.  The game includes a unique story that adds some witty humor.  From jumping out of the building to talking with yoru clients.What makes the game stand out are the puzzles.  You need to work your way through various guards and security cameras in order too accomplish your goal.  Hacking terminals, doors, cameras and even the pistols of the guards.			"

												Incredible, if short, game. Clever puzzles, brilliant writing, amazing pixel art, it really does everything right. Een the music is so good. It's basically a puzzle/action/strategic game that's more easy to get when played than explained. It can be a little pricey for the amount of hours it lasts but I really doubt anyone could complain even when buying it at full price. Also, I can see many people playing every mission many times to improve the time and the rating. It's one of the best games I played this year... strike that, it's one of the best games I played on Steam.			"

												One time in a game design class, we attempted to create a puzzle game with multiple possible solutions. Gunpoint is a game that does this better then I ever will. It is well thought out in its puzzles and story, and every level has many solutions. Even the final boss has four (I think) distinct solutions to beating him. My only complaitent is how short the game is, I had my full after two playthroughs, totallying only 8 hours. But those hours was worth the price.			"

												If this game doesnt earn a 10/10, no game does. the simplistic art style is expressive enough to convey the noir of the story (be prepared there is quite a lot of strong language). Murder, double-crossing, drama, door-kicking, window-breaking the list is endless! I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Kudos ""Suspicious games""!!!			"

												The beauty of Gunpoint is its simplicity: the visuals are low-fi, but the gameplay is decidedly high-tech. Equipped with mechanical trousers that permit you to leap tall buildings in a--well, a couple of bounds--you assume the role of a detective caught up in a murder conspiracy, armed with only your pants and a couple of upgrades. It's one of the most deliciously well-written, atmospheric, and satisfying puzzlers I've played in a long time. VISUALS: Simple and clean, pixel-art that communicates the environment without any clutter to distract you from the gameplay. SOUND/MUSIC: The tunes in this game are legitimately good listening all on their own, but they add a noir ambience that is undeniably a character unto itself. GAMEPLAY: Aside from acrobatic feats, you can use a wiremapping device to re-wire entire buildings, so that a light-switch in one room might short a light socket in another--and thereby electrocute and pacify a patrolling guard. There are many opportunities for game-breaking shenanigans here. Add in a level creator and you've got room for plenty of replayability. Great stealth-action title, very funny, highly recommended.

The game is so good that I didn't realize the music is not there!Be warned though, the game is kinda sort, about 3-4 hours per playthrough. I do want to play again though since there are choices at several points that might be offering me different overall outcome.Plus, if you fond of achievement, be aware that this game has tons of hidden achievement!

												Amazing, I have never been so intrigued to write a review for a game that I purchased for $2.99. Shifting through the 2016 Summer Sale, I came across a rather ""impulse buy"" and a knowledgeable one. I had purchased Gunpoint on a late night after I had finished my final exams, I was up to try something I've never heard of, something that I would never think of buying. I installed and played Gunpoint for about 3 and a half hours, I finished majority of the campaign and unlocked almost everything. I have to say, it was a huge refreshment to play Gunpoint. The amazing and hilarious dialog made me laugh so much that I wanted to replay the campaign for a second time to see the different dialogs I could trigger. If that wasn't funny enough for you, check out the achievements. On the other hand the gameplay was solid and simple, creating a feeling of ""more than what meets the eye"" type of game. Other than that, All I could say is that Gunpoint is a short little fun game that you should pick up on sale. It's going to be worth the price with high replay value.			"

Example: You could turn off the lights then wire the light switch to the guards gun then his friend will go turn the lights on and then his friend shoots him.

												Even if it wasn't for the 'overwhelmingly positive reviews' it has to be said that it's a really great game.In a nutshell: you're a freelance spy and you can act it out however you please. Be a ninja, an avid fan of noise and violence or a genius electrician.. if not a bit of everything. The dialogue is very amusing to say the least and the story in itself is pretty solid. Really, the only possible downside I can think of is that it's pretty short, which isn't that bad considering you may want to give it another playthrough to make different choices. And if that's not enough for replayability there's always the Steam Workshop/level editor to create and play custom levels.I'd say it has more than enough charm to justify it's price.			"

												A simple, short game about a spy with no allegiances who's just trying to keep himself from getting screwed over and make some money. Gunpoint's strategy with a stealth element and it's game mecahnics are what really makes the game unique. They are fascinating because they make you think in terms of open and closed circuts - e.g. object A does this which triggers object B and electrocutes a guard. While it's easy to catch on, it's not so easy that mental effort isn't required - I'd say medium on the challenging scale. If just doing the bare minimum, one can finish this game in a matter of hours, but there are extra achievements possible for doing levels with a specific style or speed if that's your kind of thing. The dialogue is cute and made me laugh. While it's not an adventure game per say, you are given a few choices that will affect the game. And the ability to choose different dialogue options in between missions made me feel more invested in my character. (For example, I made my character as snarky as possible.) The music is well done and quite fitting, as is the 16-bit design; both really help to aid the cloak and dagger atmosphere for our spy protagonist. All in all it's a cute little indie game that's definitely worth getting on sale.			"

												This game is pretty short, hence the $10 price tag, but I feel it's pretty worth it. There are several different ways of approaching most of the levels. Want to rush though and beat the crap out of everyone? Go for it. Wanna be stealthy and avoid being seen? You can do that too~ The storyline also branches in a few parts, so there's some replayablity to it. I still go back and replay it from time to time (hence the review now), so if you're looking for a neat little puzzle/action game to sink some time into, would recommend it 100%.			"

												Game is decent. It's a stealth puzzle game where you act as a private detective and complete objectives as requested by clients. The plot is fairly interesting for such a short game there are about 19 missions that have multiple approaches you can take to complete the objective. The shop upgrades aren't 100% needed until certain missions forces you to get them but they do help and can be quite funny.  Only problem i found was some bugs when crosslink isn't connecting when it should be... especially with the guns. Price was well worth if you buy it in a bundle.			"

												Gunpoint was the very first indie game I ever bought. Ever since then I've been an avid fan of all sorts of indie games that comprise of such attention to detail and atmosphere as Gunpoint. Some additional features were added like the Steam workshop, and there was even a time you could get a refund back in in early 2014 because the developer didn't think he would be able to pull through to add Steam worshop. Late 2014 and Steam workshop was added. The reason this was very important, because with Steam workshop, the amount of levels are now endless, and you can now create your own levels and share them with the Steam community. Before you were stuck replaying the same levels over and over again just to get the best possible rating. Which is another cool feature in Gunpoint, every time you complete a level, you get a rating, obviously, stealth, and non-violence will only earn you the best rating possible. Undoubtly, Gunpoint is one of the best indie games I've ever played, and I'll certainly say it is one of the few games that pioneered and paved the way for other indie games of similar quality to follow.

												Very funny game!I was lucky enough to be invloved in the very early testing of this game when it was being developed and I have to say that I'm very impressed with how it has progressed from a very simple concept of hacking, jumping falling and punching (and punching and punching and punching etc..).The diolouge throughout the campaign was hilarious and the multichoice made it all come together.Mechanics-wise: The game plays very smoothly. I find my self smiling when I pull of jumping around from ceiling to wall to another walls and behind a patroling guard and then proceed to punch him into oblivion and it all working out just as I'd hoped. I also love the ""OH CRAP!"" moments when that exact situation turns out to be a complete failure whether it be due to me jumping straight infront of the guard and starting in shock like a deer in the headlights or whether it was my fault for not disabling a sound sensor or even more hilariously, forgetting that I've linked the guards gun to an electrical output which is where I happen to be standing at that very moment.This is truly a game that leaves it up to the player, but never loses its charm no matter how you play it.Although the campaign is only about 2hrs, it has a level editor with steamworkshop support so enjoy playing other users levels :)Definitely recommended.

Don't buy this for story, because there really isn't one, the user made levels are awesome and are SUPER unique.

												Gunpoint is a really, really fun game. Once you know the basics, it's like a piece of cake. The game is a puzzle steathy kind of game. You'll be able to purchase new upgrades through on out you're missions. Not my top game. But deffinitly worth the money			"

												Very fun game. Unfortunately a bit too short, but there is a planned integration with the Steam Workshop and it has an in-game level creator. I bought the exclusive edition when it was on sale and it is worth it but perhaps not to everyone. If you like puzzles with creative solutions you won't regret buying this, though you might want to wait until the planned full rewrite of the game is done and it's integrated into the Steam Workshop, which will no doubt extend the longevity of the game like 10k%. Try the demo - short but sweet.			"

												I finished this game fairly quick at the 2 hour to 3 number mark, but its worth the money.Pros-Not hard (well a few of them are)-Multiple ways to solve a puzzle so you won't sit there stumped.-Has workshop!-Great storyline-Allows you to restart the level, spawn 10, 5 or 1 seconds beforeCons-sorta short -gun ammo mechanics are confusing (to me)-its extremely hard to play stealthily, so the easiest way is to just punch everyone to death(sorta like broforce, if you play normally you get killed)-a few levels allow you to jump across most of the areaOverall I'd rate it a 8.5/10Very nice!

												One of the best (out of the view) indie games I've ever played. Great story and plot that let's the player make his/hers own decisions on how to progress and how the story will unfold. Beautiful soundtrack that really makes you feel like an old fashioned detective. Funny achievements and allows for the player to decide whether he will complete the mission with stealth or to just fight his way through a building, sneak through the shadows or hang on the ceiling waiting to pounce on an unsuspecting guard? No matter which way you play it, Gunpoint is worth the purchase. Kinda wish the story lasted longer, but remember you can always just go back and finish the story in a completely different way or complete missions differently!			"

												It's fun. It's different. It takes a little getting used to. But it's... Disapointingly short. I remember playing the demo and thinking that this was going to be a fantastic game... And well... it is and it isn't.  It took me less than 3 hours to 100% the game, minus a few odds and ends achievements that I could go back and do in less than 10 minutes. Don't buy this if you expect a good value for your money, because 5 dollars an hour is more expensive than the average movie time to price value. Laughably easy, a story that seems shoehorned in to try and keep the gameplay in line and a gadget variety so small you really do feel like a spy on a budget. Don't expect the gameplay to change from switching light switches to doors and cameras to doors until the last level, where a 'big' surprise lies in wait for you. (Hint: It's not that big, but it changes how you can tackle early levels.)Shortcap: In less than 3 hours you can A+ every level, get 95% of the achievements and crush the story without mercy. Not worth 10 bucks, but 5 dollars or less it's a solid buy, especially if you're a big supporter of indie games.I'm a little disapointed by the creator, as this game could have gone seriously far. I hope to see a sequel or better yet, a free expansion that adds some content.I give it a 2.5 out of 5 stars.			"

												This is honestly one of my favorite games. When I first saw it mentioned a few years ago while in development, I knew I wanted it. I absolutly love it.The game is extremly atmospheric, I love the asthetics, the music, the sound effects. It all fits together. The levels are simple, yet challenging, and everytime I run through it, I can see the multitude of different paths I could take to finish the level. The writing and story is sharp and witty. There is nothing this game does not have going for it.I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Gunpoint is a stealth indie game. While not a fan of stealth games i say that this is a superb game that is a very entertaining, though short ride. Gunpoint can appeal to people even if they are not a fan of stealth games. Gunpoint is definitely worth the price tag and i woud certainly recommend anyone looking for a small, enjoyable game. My only gripe with the game is that it is pretty short though this game is good for a second or third playthrough.Also the protagonist has a nice hat.			"

												I bought this a while back, when it was on sale, and never really looked at it again. Today I loaded it up, dived in and found a game that realised what made a good puzzle game, ingenuity. You see, you don't have all that much in the way of abilities, apart from being able to jump really high (and fall from great heights safely), being able to punch people out in one hit, and a habit of dying after being hit with anything remotely bulletlike from any angle (although that last one might just be common sense). Soon you get the ability to rewire electronics, which is where the game shines. Each level presents itself as a maze of sorts, where you can open close, break or otherwise wreak havoc with various objects in some remarkably clever ways, all through a simple set of controls.I know it says stealth up there, but that's really kind of optional. You do kind of have to go the stealthy route (since, again, one bullet = death) you can either be noisy or quiet, or most often a mix of the both. But its rewarding, and doesn't really value one over the other. You can spend a minute setting up a connection so that a door whacks a guard in the face as he walks through it, or you run up behind him and knock him out a window, or come the other way through said window, send glass flying everywhere, land on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and beat him until the floor is covered in a fine red sludge. Or you could, you know, just go past whilst he's not looking. Your choiceThe only real problem I have is that its not very long. I finished it in 3 and a bit hours, and whilst there's a level editor (and presumably the ability to download other people's levels) that might not add too much. Its good, but short.			"

												Very funny game!I was lucky enough to be invloved in the very early testing of this game when it was being developed and I have to say that I'm very impressed with how it has progressed from a very simple concept of hacking, jumping falling and punching (and punching and punching and punching etc..).The diolouge throughout the campaign was hilarious and the multichoice made it all come together.Mechanics-wise: The game plays very smoothly. I find my self smiling when I pull of jumping around from ceiling to wall to another walls and behind a patroling guard and then proceed to punch him into oblivion and it all working out just as I'd hoped. I also love the ""OH CRAP!"" moments when that exact situation turns out to be a complete failure whether it be due to me jumping straight infront of the guard and starting in shock like a deer in the headlights or whether it was my fault for not disabling a sound sensor or even more hilariously, forgetting that I've linked the guards gun to an electrical output which is where I happen to be standing at that very moment.This is truly a game that leaves it up to the player, but never loses its charm no matter how you play it.Although the campaign is only about 2hrs, it has a level editor with steamworkshop support so enjoy playing other users levels :)Definitely recommended.

												Gunpoint is a stealth puzzle game just as the developer says, and is a very competent game as well. The game boils down to its two main mechanics and ties in a detective story with some humor too. With some simple gameplay mechanics, the level design is done in such a way to take full advantage of your toolset for some invigorating puzzles and stealth.The story in Gunpoint revolves around freelance spy Richard Conway, as he tries to clear his name from someone’s murder and solve a murder mystery. The majority of the story is told through messages on Conway’s phone, and this is where the humor comes in. You the player are given multiple dialog options, and several of Conway’s responses are snarky or bizarre in context. Whichever response is picked, there’s bound to be some good laughs at the overall script and the player dialog. In the main game there are a few choices to be made. They do change the story slightly, though the levels remain mostly the same. Anyhow, the strong film noir story works out fine with some excellent humor mixed in, along with good variety in dialog responses and story choices to mix things up.Gunpoint’s stealth puzzle gameplay is in two distinct pieces. The first is the Bullfrog, a set of trousers that allow Conway to leap really tall distances and at a high speed. Conway can also pounce on enemies and punch them either to knock them out or to death. The second is the Crosslink, a tool to hack and rewire electrical components together to solve puzzles. These two components are the basis for the puzzles and stealth of the game, with the levels strongly using these mechanics in interesting ways. Throughout the game, unlocks can be received, either through using skill points for upgrading the Bullfrog and battery system or for unlocking new abilities. The new abilities tie in closely with the core mechanics, and serve to augment certain playstyles players may have as they complete each level. The levels and abilities serve multiple kinds of solutions, whether it be violent engagements or undetected stealth. With these two gameplay mechanics and great level design that gives players multiple ways to solve them, Gunpoint’s stealth puzzle gameplay is quite open ended on giving players freedom using just these two main tools.The art style of Gunpoint is a 2d pixelated style. The world of Gunpoint is pretty well detailed, while still having a pixel art style that isn’t too retro. The environments do a great job in expressing the film noir style with the different buildings and the urban setting, with relatively simple character and object models to make gameplay streamlined with easy to see designs. Overall it’s a mix of good detail in the buildings and backgrounds, with more simple designs on characters and objects to easily stick out in gameplay.The music of Gunpoint is an excellent jazzy soundtrack. Since this game is heavily inspired by film noir, it would only be natural to have the music reflect that style. Each of the music pieces range from slower songs played in the menu or during the phone dialog, to faster songs well suited to the espionage during gameplay. The songs played during gameplay have essentially two versions, one when the view is normal and the other when Crosslink mode is active. It’s a very nice touch that helps to identify which mode the player is in, and suits the current display too with a more electronic style when hacking along with the jazzy style while in the main view. The music of Gunpoint brings in some nice sounding jazz that sounds great while playing through both the story and gameplay sections.Gunpoint takes stealth puzzle gameplay with its two main mechanics: leaping and hacking. The game takes these concepts and uses them in new ways with its levels and unlockable abilities. Alongside that is a film noir story that packs some solid humor with both the overall script and possible dialog choices. To tie the game together are a fitting detailed pixel art style and a solid jazz soundtrack that makes gameplay fun and fitting to the theme. Gunpoint plays well with these elements for a unique game experience that is fun to play through along with some bright ideas for some smart game design.			"

												It is difficult not to compare 'Gunpoint' and 'Watch_Dogs'. I played 'Watch_Dogs' before 'Gunpoint', with the latter released about a year and half earlier. I liked 'Watch_Dogs'; it's good (but not $69.99 good, making me feel lucky that I got my free copy from nVidia), but I feel that it is not as polished as it could have been and some features could have been implemented better.This brings us to 'Gunpoint', which ironically features less guns than 'Watch_Dogs'. Both games require players to use hacking as a tool to solve puzzles, but 'Gunpoint' implements the hacking better and is a more polished game. Its game design actually puts hacking into the forefront and encourages players to complete the game in a stealthy, non-lethal and even non-violent ways. You need to think creatively to solve the puzzles, especially if you aim for an A or A+ rating. Completing a mission with a high rating is, therefore, very rewarding. The game's replayability is very high as it also includes a level editor.On the other hand, the hacking in 'Watch_Dogs', while fun at times, seems like an afterthought and gimmicky. In some 'Watch_Dogs' missions, it is often easier to shoot than to hack your way out of a difficult situation. I think most people will agree with me that the best parts of 'Watch_Dogs' are ones where your hacking skills and wit are your only disposable tools. 'Gunpoint' is pretty much all these ""best parts"", making it a superior game to 'Watch_Dogs' overall.Needless to say, I highly recommend 'Gunpoint'. It is a well-made game and it is one of the best puzzle games I have played. If you are interested in 'Watch_Dogs', well, get it when it costs $30 or less. Like I said before, I enjoyed 'Watch_Dogs', but I think your time will be better spent if you play 'Gunpoint' instead.			"

												Gunpoint is an innovative, fun puzzle/stealth game.Different types of gadgets give you the oppertunity to finish the stages in lots of different ways, with the main feature of this game being rewiring electronics. You can kill every guard with traps you set, for example by slamming the door in their face as they try to put on the lights that you just shut, having rewired the switch for the electronical door and the light switch, or you can sneak by undetected using the very same mechanics. Besides that Gunpoint also delivers a very interesting story which can be manipulated by choices you make in-game.Like I said, the new feature gives lots of ways to beat a level and it makes it a very fun and different type of game. Tom Francis, the developer behind this game, has done very, very well.			"

												Gunpoint is like a mix of Hotline Miami, Mark of the Ninja, and Arkham Asylum. You're a corporate spy in a 2-D world trying to solve a murder that you unwittingly pin on yourself. Each mission involves avoiding or knocking out guards, re-wiring electrical systems, smashing through windows, and hanging off the walls like Batman. You can jump ultra-high too without hurting yourself. Late in the game you can pull out your gun, but I don't recommend it.You gain abilities by purchasing them in the store, and take missions for a variety of (competing) clients. You communicate with them via text message, and the conversations are often hilarious. They may have a variety of requests - complete the mission without hurting anyone, or kill everyone, or be completely silent.Manipulating the various buildings is simple but extremely fun, and doesn't get old for the three hours it takes to beat the game. Given the length it might be a stretch to recommend this one at full price, but at $5 or less it's a no-brainer.Some performance notes: it's more demanding than a 2-d pixel art game warrants. My 2010 Macbook couldn't play it, despite meeting the minimum Mac requirements. I have 4.6 hours of playtime because the first 1.6 hours were spent struggling to try to play it on the Macbook before I gave up and played it on my main rig.			"

												It's a must buy. Even though it's fairly short, the puzzles are fun and challenging. I bought it in sale for €3, which is a great price for this game. Yet when it's the normal price of €10, it's a bit overpriced in my opinion. Even though the game is amazing, you finish it in roughly 5 hours.			"

												    I very much recommend Gunpoint to anyone that is reading this. A few friends told me to check this game out and when I did I loved it.    The art is fantastic, the music is great, and the mechanics are fun. The story is interesting, branching, and full of witty humor. There might seem to be a shorter story than what most games have, but there is endless fun to be had by finding new ways to finish your missions and by exploring player created levels in the workshop. Overall this is a great game by a cool developer, and I cant wait to get my hands on Heat Signiture.Also check out Tom's youtube channel, Hes a great guy: https://www.youtube.com/user/Pentadact "

												This game is amazing. Although short, it is a lot more fun than some of the excruciatingly long, big budget games out there. The story is good, it gets to the point yet not in a way that it feels rushed. The gameplay and levels are definitely the best part; during playing or after you completed a task, you really do feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥spy. Another awesome touch is that when communicating to people through text, you can choose your responce, you can either be a quiet and polite, a one-toned gentleman or you can be sarcastic (which is defineately my favourite because it's really funny). Even after I finished the game, I can go back and play with it for hours, by either replaying levels (which is still really fun), or by making my own levels and playing other's.Should you buy this game? Yes.10/10			"

Soundtrack is pretty cool, if you lower its volume. The story is quite funny and entertaining. And so on and so forth.If the game had more missions and a longer story, or even more than one storyline, I'd easily give it a 10/10 for a very entertaining non-hardcore title.			"

												This is a game where you leap thirty feet into the air through a window to tackle a guard, then magically re-wire another guard's gun so that when he tries to shoot you it instead slams a door on a third guard two floors down, knocking him unconcious.  It is not a game where you do a lot of anything at gunpoint, and in fact if you do finally obtain a gun you only get a handful of bullets and can never get more.  Try to get through all the levels without hurting anyone!  Try to knock out as many guards as you can without ever entering the building!  Make your own levels with a mostly-okay level editor!  Enjoy the genuinely hilarious dialogue! This is a game you can buy using money, and you should do that.			"

												Gunpoint is an innovative, fun puzzle/stealth game.Different types of gadgets give you the oppertunity to finish the stages in lots of different ways, with the main feature of this game being rewiring electronics. You can kill every guard with traps you set, for example by slamming the door in their face as they try to put on the lights that you just shut, having rewired the switch for the electronical door and the light switch, or you can sneak by undetected using the very same mechanics. Besides that Gunpoint also delivers a very interesting story which can be manipulated by choices you make in-game.Like I said, the new feature gives lots of ways to beat a level and it makes it a very fun and different type of game. Tom Francis, the developer behind this game, has done very, very well.			"

												It is difficult not to compare 'Gunpoint' and 'Watch_Dogs'. I played 'Watch_Dogs' before 'Gunpoint', with the latter released about a year and half earlier. I liked 'Watch_Dogs'; it's good (but not $69.99 good, making me feel lucky that I got my free copy from nVidia), but I feel that it is not as polished as it could have been and some features could have been implemented better.This brings us to 'Gunpoint', which ironically features less guns than 'Watch_Dogs'. Both games require players to use hacking as a tool to solve puzzles, but 'Gunpoint' implements the hacking better and is a more polished game. Its game design actually puts hacking into the forefront and encourages players to complete the game in a stealthy, non-lethal and even non-violent ways. You need to think creatively to solve the puzzles, especially if you aim for an A or A+ rating. Completing a mission with a high rating is, therefore, very rewarding. The game's replayability is very high as it also includes a level editor.On the other hand, the hacking in 'Watch_Dogs', while fun at times, seems like an afterthought and gimmicky. In some 'Watch_Dogs' missions, it is often easier to shoot than to hack your way out of a difficult situation. I think most people will agree with me that the best parts of 'Watch_Dogs' are ones where your hacking skills and wit are your only disposable tools. 'Gunpoint' is pretty much all these ""best parts"", making it a superior game to 'Watch_Dogs' overall.Needless to say, I highly recommend 'Gunpoint'. It is a well-made game and it is one of the best puzzle games I have played. If you are interested in 'Watch_Dogs', well, get it when it costs $30 or less. Like I said before, I enjoyed 'Watch_Dogs', but I think your time will be better spent if you play 'Gunpoint' instead.			"

												This is a stealth game about rewiring things and punching people.  And it's a great game.Each mission, you're asked to break into a building and reach a computer terminal.  To do this, you need to figure out how to rewire circuits to open the correct doors, while avoiding being shot in the face.  This gives the game a pseudo-puzzle-game feel.  However, if you don't feel like solving puzzles, or are just a generally violent person, you also have the option of pushing the guards out the windows or beating them with your fists.The best part of this game though is the dialog.

I enjoyed the unlocks and the way I felt more powerful and clever with each mission.My only wish is that it was longer.

												Very funny game!I was lucky enough to be invloved in the very early testing of this game when it was being developed and I have to say that I'm very impressed with how it has progressed from a very simple concept of hacking, jumping falling and punching (and punching and punching and punching etc..).The diolouge throughout the campaign was hilarious and the multichoice made it all come together.Mechanics-wise: The game plays very smoothly. I find my self smiling when I pull of jumping around from ceiling to wall to another walls and behind a patroling guard and then proceed to punch him into oblivion and it all working out just as I'd hoped. I also love the ""OH CRAP!"" moments when that exact situation turns out to be a complete failure whether it be due to me jumping straight infront of the guard and starting in shock like a deer in the headlights or whether it was my fault for not disabling a sound sensor or even more hilariously, forgetting that I've linked the guards gun to an electrical output which is where I happen to be standing at that very moment.This is truly a game that leaves it up to the player, but never loses its charm no matter how you play it.Although the campaign is only about 2hrs, it has a level editor with steamworkshop support so enjoy playing other users levels :)Definitely recommended.

												I wasn't so sure that this game would be good. It was on sale, so I got it. This is now my favorite Indie game. The soundtrack is incredible, you can buy it up there as an addon dlc. The soundtrack matches the gameplay precisely. I would have definitely bought this at more than full price and still be happy. The actual gameplay is awesome. Addicting it is! Even though it may be simple, it still is fun. Yes. A truly beautiful game. Highly recommend this. 11/10 Buy it, or die.			"

												Gunpoint is a good game with a good story. On paper, it might seem difficult, but it's actually pretty easy once you understand the hacking mechanics. It's on the short side, so you can breeze right through it in a few hours.The story revolves around a freelance espionage agent that is startled by a murder in a building next to his apartment building. He only ends up investigating it because he sets off these new spring shoes he bought which launches him into the murder building. Conway ends up being part of a conspiracy and helps track down the real killer why also figuring out why the victim was killed.Good game. Good soundtrack.8.5/10			"

												Gunpoint is like a mix of Hotline Miami, Mark of the Ninja, and Arkham Asylum. You're a corporate spy in a 2-D world trying to solve a murder that you unwittingly pin on yourself. Each mission involves avoiding or knocking out guards, re-wiring electrical systems, smashing through windows, and hanging off the walls like Batman. You can jump ultra-high too without hurting yourself. Late in the game you can pull out your gun, but I don't recommend it.You gain abilities by purchasing them in the store, and take missions for a variety of (competing) clients. You communicate with them via text message, and the conversations are often hilarious. They may have a variety of requests - complete the mission without hurting anyone, or kill everyone, or be completely silent.Manipulating the various buildings is simple but extremely fun, and doesn't get old for the three hours it takes to beat the game. Given the length it might be a stretch to recommend this one at full price, but at $5 or less it's a no-brainer.Some performance notes: it's more demanding than a 2-d pixel art game warrants. My 2010 Macbook couldn't play it, despite meeting the minimum Mac requirements. I have 4.6 hours of playtime because the first 1.6 hours were spent struggling to try to play it on the Macbook before I gave up and played it on my main rig.			"

												Gunpoint is a stealth puzzle game just as the developer says, and is a very competent game as well. The game boils down to its two main mechanics and ties in a detective story with some humor too. With some simple gameplay mechanics, the level design is done in such a way to take full advantage of your toolset for some invigorating puzzles and stealth.The story in Gunpoint revolves around freelance spy Richard Conway, as he tries to clear his name from someone’s murder and solve a murder mystery. The majority of the story is told through messages on Conway’s phone, and this is where the humor comes in. You the player are given multiple dialog options, and several of Conway’s responses are snarky or bizarre in context. Whichever response is picked, there’s bound to be some good laughs at the overall script and the player dialog. In the main game there are a few choices to be made. They do change the story slightly, though the levels remain mostly the same. Anyhow, the strong film noir story works out fine with some excellent humor mixed in, along with good variety in dialog responses and story choices to mix things up.Gunpoint’s stealth puzzle gameplay is in two distinct pieces. The first is the Bullfrog, a set of trousers that allow Conway to leap really tall distances and at a high speed. Conway can also pounce on enemies and punch them either to knock them out or to death. The second is the Crosslink, a tool to hack and rewire electrical components together to solve puzzles. These two components are the basis for the puzzles and stealth of the game, with the levels strongly using these mechanics in interesting ways. Throughout the game, unlocks can be received, either through using skill points for upgrading the Bullfrog and battery system or for unlocking new abilities. The new abilities tie in closely with the core mechanics, and serve to augment certain playstyles players may have as they complete each level. The levels and abilities serve multiple kinds of solutions, whether it be violent engagements or undetected stealth. With these two gameplay mechanics and great level design that gives players multiple ways to solve them, Gunpoint’s stealth puzzle gameplay is quite open ended on giving players freedom using just these two main tools.The art style of Gunpoint is a 2d pixelated style. The world of Gunpoint is pretty well detailed, while still having a pixel art style that isn’t too retro. The environments do a great job in expressing the film noir style with the different buildings and the urban setting, with relatively simple character and object models to make gameplay streamlined with easy to see designs. Overall it’s a mix of good detail in the buildings and backgrounds, with more simple designs on characters and objects to easily stick out in gameplay.The music of Gunpoint is an excellent jazzy soundtrack. Since this game is heavily inspired by film noir, it would only be natural to have the music reflect that style. Each of the music pieces range from slower songs played in the menu or during the phone dialog, to faster songs well suited to the espionage during gameplay. The songs played during gameplay have essentially two versions, one when the view is normal and the other when Crosslink mode is active. It’s a very nice touch that helps to identify which mode the player is in, and suits the current display too with a more electronic style when hacking along with the jazzy style while in the main view. The music of Gunpoint brings in some nice sounding jazz that sounds great while playing through both the story and gameplay sections.Gunpoint takes stealth puzzle gameplay with its two main mechanics: leaping and hacking. The game takes these concepts and uses them in new ways with its levels and unlockable abilities. Alongside that is a film noir story that packs some solid humor with both the overall script and possible dialog choices. To tie the game together are a fitting detailed pixel art style and a solid jazz soundtrack that makes gameplay fun and fitting to the theme. Gunpoint plays well with these elements for a unique game experience that is fun to play through along with some bright ideas for some smart game design.			"

												This is one of my favourite videogames ever.It's like someone took a Raymond Chandler novel, made it self-aware enough to be cute and funny, and incidentally made it a puzzle videogame set in a cyberpunk future with nice pixel art.The aesthetic is very much film-noir inspired with cyberpunk elements just slightly tinting the edges. Don't think kaleidoscopic William Gibson-esque punks with giant purple mohawks and uzis. Instead, think spies in huge trenchcoats carrying a couple of high-tech gadgets and smartphones. Think cigar-chewing shirt and suspenders wearing boors who don't give a damn who gets hurt but no ♥♥♥♥ing witnesses, capisce? Think handsome men in fashionable sweaters with precisely trendy haircuts patiently and articulately explaining to you why you need to let them get away with ruining that person's life and isn't this such a large suitcase full of money? You could do things with that. Think elegant dames with perfect glamour who spend every spare moment of their waking lives thinking up ever more untraceable ways to utterly destroy a man. You'd have to be an idiot to betray her.The soundtrack is gorgeous. Each level has two soundtracks: its main track, which is tense jazz, and a second mirror version that the game slips into when you switch to hacking mode, with a more electronic sound. Each level's music creates a variation on the same feeling: that here before us is an intently dangerous problem of immense personal importance to us, upon which we are bringing to bear powerful tools, strength and cleverness and (in the hacking/electronic version) willfully indiscriminate application of being a GIANT FREAKING NERD.The player character is witty, stylish, slightly lacking in common sense, has good taste in hats, he's called ""Richard"" and he's just a little bit of a knob without really meaning to be. I like him.The writing is phenominal. It's like VtM: Bloodlines in that there are a cast of varied, interesting characters who have intricate relationships with one another and the player character, interesting goals and motivations and good reasons for hating one another, which is why they're paying you to untraceably destroy that other character's life. There are jokes which are both cheesy and funny. The art and writing interplay with one another in ways where one will swoop in to reinforce or take the mick out of what the other just did.The hacking parts are like someone finally made a game version of @internetofshit - these buildings all contain a menagerie of faulty devices that are plugged into the internet and shouldn't be, and you get to arbitrarily screw with the inhabitants at will by suborning their gadgets. See https://twitter.com/internetofshit for inspiration.The puzzles all make sense. Impressively, this is a puzzle game that never makes you feel dumb, but also rewards cleverness. Some levels will take some studying but none are frustrating and you can always make a tradeoff between how long you want to spend thinking about each level and how sloppy, risky or violent you want to be. Most levels admit multiple solutions, some sneakier and some faster or more violent. Doing a real pacifist run is both challenging and fun.Notably, in a world where most videogame morality is a conflict between ""rescue kitten"" and ""kill and eat kitten"", Gunpoint does not arbitrarily punish the player for using violence, but at the same time it does not omit consequences for it and it does not let you forget that you've used it.I did not encounter any interestingly bad bugs in this game. It's possible (but rare) to trigger physics glitches that let you bypass obstacles in some levels. The experience of seeing your character's blog post at the end is not seamless because it closes the game to open a browser for you? Meh. I haven't			"

												I have to admit I am generally not a huge fan of indie games, but this one works for me. The graphics, as you can tell, are not that stellar, but it works well in the context of the game.I would characterize the game as a puzzle game, with the main goal trying to figure out how to open the various doors without getting shot. The game is designed very well, with auto-save checkpoints letting you go back a couple seconds, so you are not penalized for dying and experimenting. I wish more games were like this as redoing the same thing over and over is not very fun. As you progress through the game you will unlock new techs which can drastically change the strategies available - this adds some re-playability to the game. The game takes 4-5 hours to beat, which for me is a perfect length - long enough to understand the depth, but short enough that the story isn't drawn out for no good reason.Overall, 8/10.			"

												This game is a masterpiece, don't let the 3-hour campaign fool you, there's a cacaphony of user-generated content that will keep you busy for days. The story, if you pay attention to it, is written well enough so that you care about the characters while mixing in some well-placed humor for good effect. The in-game dialogue lets you choose what the player character, Conway, says in between jobs, and I often found myself torn between selecting the hard-boiled bit of dialogue or the less serious, more hilarious option.I got this game for $3 and ended up wishing I spent the full 10. Gunpoint is a game that'll stick with you for a long while, and I won't soon remove it from my steam library.			"

The story is good, it gets to the point yet not in a way that it feels rushed. The gameplay and levels are definitely the best part; during playing or after you completed a task, you really do feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥spy. Another awesome touch is that when communicating to people through text, you can choose your responce, you can either be a quiet and polite, a one-toned gentleman or you can be sarcastic (which is defineately my favourite because it's really funny). Even after I finished the game, I can go back and play with it for hours, by either replaying levels (which is still really fun), or by making my own levels and playing other's.Should you buy this game?

												A comedic take on the Noir style, this 2D puzzle-platformer knows how to introduce jokes into an otherwise serious, game. It starts off with a murder, and you need to figure out not who did it, but why. At the end of the first mission, there's an admittedly funny scene that shows you how you got your first piece of equipment, and then you're told that there is evidence you're the killer, but you obviously aren't.As I mentioned, the game in general is fun, both to play and to read. There are several achievements were the developpers make some obviously cheesy jokes, like one where you beat a guy a bunch of times, but they really work if its your first time experiencing them. The controls are easy to learn, and there is more than one way to stealthily finish a level. The new Worhkshop integration lets users create their own levels, some of which are admittedly creative and harder than the ones in the game. It's short and direct, so it leaves you wanting the more it doesn't have, which is filled by thr Workshop levels. About halfway through, there's a mission that lets you take one of two choices, either supporting the innocent company or helping out the guilty one. There's also a different mission where you can tell, or not, the bad guy that you were contracted to steal from him.[/spolier] I definitely want there to be a sequel, and this is definitely worth the $10.10/10 "

Achievement unlocked!Acknowledged Ludonarrative DissonanceNotice the story doesn't necessarily get with the mechanics. Become qualified games journalist.One of my favourite little games at the moment! I wanted to play this game since it came out and I did now, and I don't regret a minute of it. The narrative is linear yet clever and witty, the mechanics are somewhat unique, the main character has sass for days and it doesn't take itself serious. It doesn't take long to complete (3 to 4 hours), but every stage seems thought-out and relevant. So if you like stealth games with a little bit of creative thinking, this is definitely something for you. I definitely recommend this game and will play it again! "

												I honestly did not think I'd get a full playthrough done of this game. I bought it just for no reason, but this has easily reached the top of my favorites list. Y'see, I'm a sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so the little remarks the main character says really hit home. This is the only stealth game where I actually tried to be stealthy. The mechanics in this game are probably my favorite of all my time playing video games, truthfully. I don't know why I didn't buy this any sooner. In my opinion, this is THE epitome of a perfect game, just my opinion. 10/10 :)✦Glows✦ Mechanics Soundtrack Workshop so you can always find more content Humor✦Grows✦ None "

												I Highly recommend this game, another game that proves you don't need good graphics to enjoy it. Gunpoint really does a good job of showing Richard Conway as an anti-hero out for himself but also willing to help, if the price is right. The upgrades and gadgets you can buy are well thought out and add an interesting factor to your character's ability to mess with a buildings electronics.			"

												I can't remember the last time I played a game with such an original concept, deep mechanics and well-designed puzzles, rewarding gameplay, and a great sense of humor. On the surface, it's a run-of-the mill stealth action game, but early on, you get access to the ""cross link"" which allows you to rewire switches to open doors, call elevators, and even (after an upgrade) rewire enemy guns to lightbulbs and elevators! So what if it's not realistic, this is about fun!			"

I saw gunpoint was on sale and snapped it up instantly. I tried to play it but it wouldn't work for some reason. I took all the advice of the developers and did everything they said. Nothing happened. Finally I got it to work by deleteing my music file. I played for a good 40 minutes and had a blast. Then it broke again. And would not fix. Now I'm sad. Buy this game because it's great, but buy it at your own risk because it does break occasionally.			"

												Gunpoint is a puzzle game with platforming and stealth elements.The 'puzzles' come in the form of an incredibly unique, fun, and interesting rewiring system, where you can make one thing connect to another.For example, you can open a door with a switch.It is amazing. One of the most clever and enjoyable mechanics I've ever had the joy of performing.There are many fun upgrades you can buy for your character, Conway. Anything from increasing the height you can jump (did i mention you can jump super high in this game? its awesome) to kicking down doors.Every upgrade is fun in its own unique way and is worth your attention at some point.The game isn't open world but it has a workshop page, full of user-created levels, that you can also create if you please.The game has a little replayability as there is different play styles.In short, the gameplay is absolutely amazing.There's a lot more to Gunpoint then jumping around and rewiring, though.There is an extremely captivating, motivating, and interesting story that actually interested me from the moment I started the game to the end.I'm not gonna spoil a thing because it's something everyone should experience without being spoiled.But it was the best story in a game I've ever experienced since The Walking Dead.The charm in this game is constantly present.There wasn't a single moment in this game that I didn't have a smile on my face.During the dialouge there are some lines that actually made my chest hurt from laughing so hard.Even while you are in the middle of a mission the charm is present.When you are first prompted to punch a guard, being the person I am, I punched him in the face a remarkable amount of times. To my surprise messages kept popping up, eventually even keeping count of how many times you've punched the guard in the face and rightfully chastising you for it.Hell, at the end of the game, you get to pick what things your character will put in his blog post that summarizes the case. When you hit sumbit a real, existing, web page is created, containing the content you chose. And it's great.In short, Gunpoint is actually my favorite game I've played in a long, long time.Amazing gameplay.Amazing story.Amazing charm.Amazing game.10/10.A must-buy.My blog post: (CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS, DO NOT VISIT UNLESS YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE GAME.

Shame it only took me three hours to beat it, with an A+ for every level (maybe I'm just that good) but hey there's plenty of DLC and custom maps to keep me going. Aside from that, a surprisingly good story, and plenty of funny dialogue - you can tell the developers not only have a great sense of humour but a clear passion for hard boiled detective stories. An absolute must have in your library! Now it's time for me to have a go at the fan-made challenges, which are probably unsolvable...			"

Soundtrack is pretty cool, if you lower its volume. The story is quite funny and entertaining. And so on and so forth.If the game had more missions and a longer story, or even more than one storyline, I'd easily give it a 10/10 for a very entertaining non-hardcore title.			"

As you progress you can unlock new gadgets that will be required for future story missions.  All around the gameplay is really fluid and well done, and you can probably get through the story in about 3 hours, give or take.

												This is a game where you leap thirty feet into the air through a window to tackle a guard, then magically re-wire another guard's gun so that when he tries to shoot you it instead slams a door on a third guard two floors down, knocking him unconcious.  It is not a game where you do a lot of anything at gunpoint, and in fact if you do finally obtain a gun you only get a handful of bullets and can never get more.  Try to get through all the levels without hurting anyone!  Try to knock out as many guards as you can without ever entering the building!  Make your own levels with a mostly-okay level editor!  Enjoy the genuinely hilarious dialogue! This is a game you can buy using money, and you should do that.			"

												I cannot stress enough how good this game is. It's short, but that's really it's only downfall. There are different ways to approaching each level, and I love it. Tom has done a really good job.Be sure to also check out Heat Signature when it comes out. It's made by the same guy, and it's bound to be just as good			"

												Gunpoint is a mixture of action and puzzle with stealth mechanics. It has a level creator so you can create your own levels to play and mess around with the physics of the game(or you could just make one door that you kick down on all the guards, killing them all instantaneously). In the story the game gives you 2-3 choices of diologue so not every ending will be the same. But honestly, I wouldn't have played the whole story in one sitting if it wasn't for that third choice, which was definitely the most smartass choice you could possibly pick. Won't spoil it for ya- just kidding. John dies at the end.			"

												Very amazing game for me! Nowadays we have a hundreds of 3D games of all kind - shooters, RPG's, action games, racing simulators, etc... All these are cool. But Gunpoint is a remarkable example that idea of the good game was always on the first place. And only after it come different effects and other good-looking stuff. Gunpoint is a 2-dimensional stealth with a little shooter part. The game also has a good scenario which involves industrial espionage. The main thing that you have to do is resolving different puzzles. And this is the great fun and the most strong feature of the game. You always can solve each of them different ways and gain more achievements for this. Gunpoint has good soundtracks which suit the game perfectly. The only drawback is that the game relatively short.So I recomend this game to all the people who want fresh attitude to the game process and overall game experiance.			"

												Gunpoint is a retro platformer in which you rewire electronics to fool guards and progress through levels. You use an array of upgradable and purchasable (yes, only in-game money - this isn't EA) gadgets to accomplish a plethora of tasks. Via these gadgets, you can jump onto walls, ceilings, or through glass - and then you can rewire a guards pistol to turn off the lights when the trigger is pulled. Everything was very fun and was quite innovative.The writing in Gunpoint is one of its strong points, for sure. The story is both good and quite funny, I laughed (hard) quite a bit through the game. Just the sounds and motions of you accidentally crashing through a window are absolutely hilarious.Although the game uses the increasingly generic retro style, the designers did a fairly good job incorporating it - even the point where I really couldn't imagine Gunpoint looking any different. The soundtrack is quite good as well, I found it to be very fitting.Overall, I recommend that you buy this game. Although it only lasts for a few hours, there are multiple endings, so there is some replayability. Even given the short length, I feel that Gunpoint is completely worth it at its current $10 price.Before I end this, I'd like to thank my friend Rocky Raccoon for gifting me this game out of the blue. You're awesome!			"

												Picked this up during the Steam Sale after trying the demo. It's a very interesting premise with great, and humorous, writing. Some of the later maps were somewhat challenging, not because they threw a bunch of enemies at you, but because the puzzles to gain entry to certain areas were well put together. Major complaint is without a doubt, the length. Around 2 hours of campaign at best.			"

												Loads of fun, very interesting puzzles with a clever way of doing them, rewiring circuits and all that. Awesome upgrades and abilities and a fun story with humorous dialogue made this a very enjoyable experience for me. It's a bit too short though, only clocking in at 3 hours. But still, it's good.Also, there's a level editor, which is the perfect thing for this game to have, so people who are way more creative than me will make loads of extra content for gunpoint that you can play. I don't know how or even IF you can play other peoples levels yet though.			"

												A great game about a witty detective with gadgets that seem like they were taken right out of the batcave (excluding the gun, of course). Runs well, has a great soundtrack, has Workshop integration, decent puzzles and a branching story, which means it has at least decent replayability. I played a lot of the story offline, which accounts for my low recorded game time, but the story is not long by any measure. I picked it up on sale, but I reckon it's worth full price.			"

												Gunpoint, one of my favorite games as of late. Let's go over some of the main parts of the game. First off, let me say that while I have low hours, that is because this is a game that most people can complete in one sitting, but it is a very satisfying one sitting.__Alright, so here's the rundown of the very absolute basics of Gunpoint.Gunpoint is a fairly unique game. You play as a noir-style freelance spy named Richard Conway that can leap very far, cling and climb on walls and ceilings, and can survive long falls thanks to what the game explains simply as advanced equipment your character possesses. In every level, you must infiltrate a building to get to the goal (which is almost always a computer you must hack) and get back out without the guards shooting you. Guards can see you and you will not lose, unlike some other stealth games.__Now, for some of the more clever mechanics in the game.A big part of getting in and out of the buildings in Gunpoint is the Crosslink. Once you have the Crosslink after the first few tutorial levels, you can switch into Crosslink mode quickly and smoothy by rolling your mousewheel down a click. Every device in Gunpoint uses wiring systems, and in Crosslink mode you can rewire any device to any other device. Wire a lightswitch to a hand scanner that wires to a door, and when you hit the switch the end result is the door opening. Wire a guard's weapon into a power socket he's standing near, and when he tries to fire it the socket will overload and shock him.You can't wire a guard's gun right at the start of the game, however. There are upgrades you can to get from the ingame store (all of the upgrades become available fairly quickly), one of which being the ability to wire guns. Other abilities are things like being able to go through a window without making a loud noise, and there are more unique purchases, such as the Resolver, the only gun you can use in the game.Guards can be snuck past (my personal favorite way is to cling to the ceiling above them as they patrol), taken down by leaping at them and knocking them out with a punch, or killed by tackling them out a window (or punching them several times, if you're excessive like that). As said before, you can use more creative ways of knocking out a guard, like with power sockets. There are multiple types of guards, some are the standard that can be easly tackled to remove, some a more advanced kind that can only be taken out through more robust methods. All guards shoot on sight, which can be a bit finnicky at times (specifically after you get the upgrade that makes them sometimes miss) but overall works very well. A single bullet will kill you instantly, but the game has a very good checkpoint system, autosaving your position every few seconds. This allows you to jump back a little ways if you make a mistake without restarting the whole level, or allows you to restart the whole thing if you decide on a different approach.__The ExperienceA general level goes like this: You start off the left of a building. First you must find a way in, either through diving into a window or finding a way to open a door (or entering into an already-open door). You need to open the doors to the computer you want to hack on the third floor, but it runs on blue wiring, and you only start with red. You must sneak hijack the blue wirebox on the first floor in order to manipulate the blue wires on the third. After a quick look over the building, you decide the best way to get in is by leaping through a window on the second floor. However, doing so would alert the guard, who will shoot you on sight. There happens to be a camera outside the building, and a light in the room the guard is in. You wire the camera to the light, then go under the camera. The light turns off, and the guard wanders into the next room over, looking for the lightswitch. You quickly leap into the window while his back is turned and dash down to the first floor, right as the lights come on. In the first floor, you quickly leap into the guard before he turns around and knock him out. After that, you can get to the blue wirebox, allowing you to manipulate the doors on the third floor. You sneak back up past the guard on the second floor, up to floor three, where you open the doors by wiring the blue lightswitch to the blue door. After that, you dash through the window on the third floor and make your escape off stage right.__The StoryWhen you accept a mission, there is a brief dialogue between Conway and whoever is giving you the mission. You can choose many dialogue options for different paths in the game (the paths, however, do not really change level layouts and mostly affect dialogue options). There is also a dialogue scene like this after you complete a mission. The story is a murder-mystery noir-styled tale that will quickly grab your interest and keep you begging for a resolve. For this reason, I cannot go into specific depth on the story, but I will say this is one of the strongest points of the game. You could make a movie out of it, and it would be awesome.I will say, and I only say this because it happens right at the beginning, how the story starts.--PLEASE DON'T READ THIS IF YOU ALREADY INTEND TO GET THIS GAME, IT'S BETTER TO EXPERIENCE IT YOURSELF--  You see Conway just getting his Hypertrousers from the mail, the device he wears that allows him to leap at incredible heights as mentioned earlier, and a note on them reads that they are not to be used indoors. He immediately tries them inside his appartment and flings himself out of his window, and into the window to the lobby of the building next door. He receieves a call from the person inside the building, saying they were about to call him about a job and think they just saw him get thrown out of his window. Conway shrugs it off and says to let him upstairs, but as you go upstairs you see a suspicious character creep out of a door and shoot the person in the building before throwing them out the window and dashing away. __ Rating This game is great on all accounts. It welcomes several different playstyles, whether you like more aggresive or stealthy ones. The story is incredibly strong and at times silly, guaranteed to keep your attention, but if you like you can ignore it entirely. The game combines action elements with puzzle elements and allows to think about the actions you take, and the ability to restart if you die just seconds back allows for lots of experimenting and trial-and-error. It includes a scoring system for those of you who enjoy getting more points than your friends. It even has a level editor and workshop compatibility if you're so inclined.Overall it is a very, very fun game and the biggest critisism I have is that is ended so soon. I truly do wish for a sequel or even DLC. I'm quite literally wishing for DLC, that's how much I want more of this game. Gameplay: 5/5Story: 5/5Replayability: 4/5 That's an overall average of about 4.65/5. I would tell anyone to buy this game. It's a real gem.			"

Gunpoint : ReviewGunpoint is a game I truly love to call 'Beauty'. It's fast paced, or slow paced (if you're that kind of person) adventure stealth 'em up. There is so much this game gets right, it's just a purely amazing bit of fun, and for $10, why not try it?ProsReally tight gameplayHilarious dialogueGreat puzzle designHyper trowsersConsStory is a little shallow at times.Defintely not a game for everyoneSummaryGunpoint is a stealth based adventure game based off of an agent who was framed for a crime. Or did he commit it the crime? Or was the camera wrong? Honestly, I don't remember. And that's it's one problem I seem to have with it, it's not very memorable. A great game nevertheless. I always found myself enjoying my time. And the ending is really quite a nice summary of what happened during the events of the game. I played this game mainly offline so it only shows 4 hours of gameplay on this account, but I got roughly 15 hours of gameplay out of it and there's still content I've missed.In short, I recommened this game to most gamers, some may not like it and they can have their reasons. But on a technical level, it's near flawless. If you're looking for about 15+ hours of fun and have $10 lying around, I'd definitely recommened this.Final rating: 8/10			"

												Ah Gunpoint.      Let's start out with the negatives of this game: It's too damned short.Roughly 20 missions, most of which can be beaten in less than 5 minutes, can result in a very short game. I only wish that there was a workshop for this game so that the level editors that MAKE levels can be more easily seen, subscribed, and then played.As for the game itself let's get down to the bare bones.I don't think I've ever played a game like this. In Gunpoint you are able to cross wires remotely and as a result- different things cause different things. E.x: A switch turns off a door- you rewire it to open a door- and that door can be rewired to open another door and so on, and so on. That is an amazing system than can be easily abused in a fun way.     Now for the enemies. There are 2 forms of enemies encountered in Gunpoint- normal guards, and enforcers.Normal guards are easy to deal with; pouncing on them being the most common way of dealing with them.Enforcers are more deadly forms of guard that cannot be pounced, so you have to use more stealth and wit to either take these guys down, or avoid them entirely.The fun part about taking down each enemy has it's own special feel.When you take down a normal guard and bash his face in for the second...third... fourth.... 300th time in a row, it kinda gives a sense of brutal joy out of it.When you take down an enforcer; either by electrocuting them, or knocking them out of a window- you gain a certain sense of accomplishment of taking down a non-pouncable enemy.The upgrades in Gunpoint are nice and very useful, especially after the story is well and done- so you can see how far you've come along ever since the start of the game.Now for the more artsy fartsy aspect of the game.The game itself is a pixleated, and for this game, I don't there there would be a better way to portray this game.It's simplistic, and get's the job done. A lot of dark tones of the surrounding city, bright insides to show contrast. The environment of the game is well done.The music- oh the music! It's  from cool jazz to an electronic feel, and that's a beautiful mixture in this game.You may or may not notice it when playing, but it's there- and it sets the tone for the game.The story itself is very short, and I am not going to give anyone any spoilers.Story is thought out, and executed as the basis of why you are in the levels you are.If it had a lot more levels, I would like it much much more.Overall 9/10 for the price, try the demo if you are uncertain if you want to buy this game or not.I'm looking forward to what other games Suspicious Developments makes in the future.

												Gunpoint's title does it a slight disservice. In no way is this game the pixelated platform shooter that images and its title art may make it seem. Instead, it's a crafty, awesomly mechanical stealth puzzle game that's easy to pick up and play that feels genuinely rewarding when you're able to clear out missions in your own ways with whatever gadgets and power-ups you may have. The main mechanics are your super jumpy hyper trousers and the ability to re-wire the electrical circuits in every building. The former provides fantastic mobility, letting you launch yourself like a dart at enemies, through windows, and land safely from any ridiculous height you can reach.  The latter is how you'll spend a lot of your time working your way through the game's puzzles. With the crosslink ability you'll be hooking up light switches to open doors, security cameras to call elevators, and a number of other fun and easy to execute chain of events. Your creativity and the ease of how all these mechanics work is really what sells the gameplay and makes it fascinating. The game's only real bump is the relatively short playtime. Depending on your ability to quickly assess every situation, you could finish the game in as little as three hours, but honestly the mechanics are top notch and satisfying and the narrative intriguing enough to make this worth a play even at its current price point. Get it, it's fun.			"

												I bought this game and I can easily say I don't regret it. The gameplay is great, you can manipulate guards to do things towards your advatnage, even by making a guard shoot another guard. The stealth aspect is maginificent, turning off the lights and not being seen are key to making it through the game. For the story, it was great. It starts out with you being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Althought the story is quite short, I loved every partof it. You have dialouge options that can make the conversation you are having with your contracter funny. If a few cases you can chose who to work for, when you're given the option. If you get bored of the story missions, you can go over to the steam workshop to download playermade maps. Overall I give this game a 9.5/10. Defiently worth the price.			"

												It's a pretty short game. You can bum rush through the story mode in a couple of hours and unlock all the achievements pretty easily. Thanks to the level editor and the Steam Workshop support, though, the replay value is infinite. The autosave feature is pretty much essential, since, at least on my system, the game crashes every now and then. You can play the game with a certain degree of freedom, and at the end you'll be judged for your performance: the grades and titles you'll receive have no repercussion on the game's mechanics and development, they are just for show.If you enjoy puzzle games with a bit of action and the opportunity to make your own levels and share them, this game is for you.

												Gunpoint is a very clever ""connect-the-dots"" puzzle game, with an espionage spy theme and LA Noire like soundtrack.  Under its simple-complex shell, lies humor in the dialogue in-between missions that  forgetfully takes you out of the puzzle-element for relief comedy, done right.When you have successfully gone full stealth in a mission, it feels very satisfying, but it can be abrutly ended with a ""gunpoint"" encounter with an enemy.  Sleuth around and avoid enemy detection and reward yourself with stealthy playthrough and jump away to freedom and more cash.After understanding Gunpoint's puzzle system, you can come up with very creative ways to sneak around each level and go undetected, and laugh at your own mistakes, as well as overcoming each level with finese.  If you are a fan of puzzles and stealth, and you like detective movies, this game is definitely for you.Rating:  7.5 out of 10			"

												Gunpoint is a a solid little stealth platformer puzzle game. You control a spy-for-hire who sneaks into various buildings to steal items or hack information. The game eases you into the systems at a steady pace, with the complexity ramping up nicely. There's also an interesting assortment of upgrades that give you various advantages like increased stealth or stronger abilities.The music is pretty perfect for the gameply, sorta jazzy but with a Mission Impossible/Oceans Eleven feel to it. The graphics are retro but plenty serviceable, with everything important to gameplay easy to discern. And it also has a pretty good sense of humor in the between mission dialogue and achievements.Only downfall is the whole game can be completed in about four hours, but there's some replayability, as it's pretty clear there are at least two endings, and plenty of different achievements for doing missions perfectly and using all the abilities to their maximum potential. I'd had this one in my library for quite a while and finally got around to playing it, and I'm glad I did. If you're considering it but on the fence, let this be your endorsement from a fellow former fence-sitter.			"

												Gunpoint takes sneaking around to an interesting new extreme by redefining what normally distinguishes one stealthy action game from another (this being the tools you use to make not being seen easier) and gives you the wiring of the entire building to play with. Fundamentally, Gunpoint is fun for the same reason the first two Thief games were fun; the levels are extremely non-linear, and your goal typically consists of ""get the room being pointed out, then get out as un-harassed as possible.""The store page hype claims that you can rewire electrical sockets and enemy pistols, but these functions are only unlocked by limited use gadgets which become available after several missions are played. The majority of the gameplay experience consists of figuring out what daisy-chain of lightswitches, doors, and elevator call buttons will clear a path through the building and keep you out of the security guards' sight. This can become tedious and a little formulaic after a while, though it isn't enough to make me stop playing.The story is fairly good if you enjoy sarcastic comedy, but wouldn't be quite enough to give the game a shining recommendation on its own. Gunpoint's gameplay is more than enough fun to overcome any of these fairly minor shortcomings, though, and this is a double recommendation for anyone who played a great deal of Splinter Cell, Tenchu, and/or Thief in the early parts of these respective series.

												While it wasn't really a long game, Gunpoint is a memorable game with some interesting and fun gameplay. Playing as a private contractor with some pants that make you jump really high, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time and you have to prove your innocence and deal with the aftermath of what you did to prove your innocence. There's some light RPG elements that change things up, namely different upgrade paths, dialogue choices, and, towards the end, choosing one of two paths that help resolve the story in their own way.Toss in a level editor with maps you can get on the workshop, a customizable blog post at the very end, and some funny dialogue here and there, Gunpoint has some replayability after you finish the story, whether it's major or minor, however, I cannot say. 8/10, you should get this game eventually, whether you get it right now or during a sale, that's up to you.

												Gunpoint is a good blend of a smart story, light puzzles, occasional humor, and almost-deaf guards with superhuman sight and reflexes in which you must steal (and optionally destroy the video surveillance) which can either acquit or convict George Zimmerman. Perhaps its because of the pixel art, but I want to draw parallels between this and Monaco, another game which continually occupies a significantly percentage of my consiousness. I am not even certain it is reasonable to try to draw a parallel, but emotions are running hot and baby ain't nothing going to stop this steam engine. They're not similar in the gameplay so much, which are actually quite different from one another, so much as the atmosphere and theme which evoked similar feelings. They both share the mechanics of guards and security cameras and the ability to hack the environment. But the short story is that Monaco is almost impossible to top. The puzzles in gunpoint are never very hard, but stopping for a moment to analyze the situation does unfortunately pull you out of the action. Not every meal needs to be tenderloin in a mushroom pan sauce. Sometimes a good juicy burger is all you need.			"

												Gunpoint is a stealth-based puzzle-platform game. You play as Richard Conway, a freelance spy in a noir themed world. You were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and have been framed for murder. You must go through numerous levels to find out who framed you, and clear your name. The gameplay is great. You have a gadget called the ""crosslink"". It is used to rewire circuits in any way you wish. From basic changes such as making a light switch open a door, to causing an elevator to switch off the lights, making a guard walk through a booby trapped door, and having it slam in his face. The combinations are endless. The game is very much stealth focused. Confrontation with a guard will quickly result in your death. But this does not mean you cannot sneak up on everyone and beat them to death. You can get through levels silently, with no witnesses. Or you could rush through and make sure no one is left breathing to be a witness. You have multiple other gadgets to utilize too. Conway wears no ordinary trousers. They are spring loaded allowing him to jump great distances. His trenchcoat allows him to survive a fall from high distances. There is also an upgrade system which allows you to buy new gadgets, and improve already purchased ones. The story is great. The dialogue is incredibly funny, and the characters brilliantly wrote. The game also has an absolutely superb soundtrack. One of my favourite in any video game. You can check it out for free here[gunpointgame.bandcamp.com].The average time for completion is about 2-3 hours. So if you are looking for a short game to pass time, this is definitely one to consider. With multiple dialogue options, and plenty of achievements to earn, the replayability is great too. Gunpoint is easily my 2013 Game of the Year. I absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone.Edit: As of some date a few days ago, workshop has now been integrated into the game. You can now browse from hundreds of user-created levels, adding hours more fun to the game.			"

												I got this game semi-recently from the humble bundle, and this is a great game. From the instance new game mechanics were being introduced though, I got an unpleasant feeling that the game would become unfairly difficult, because I could see that it had the potential too. Fortunately it never became so difficult that it was not fun to play. All the levels can be completed in a variety of ways that adds replayablity to the game. There are also user-made levels that can be extremely challenging. Also the plot of this game is very intriguing and convoluted. I enjoyed playing each mission to find out a bit more abou the events unfolding in the plot. Definitely one of my favorite games.			"

												The mechanics are simple to learn but the graphics, story, and gameplay are so charming and enjoyable and the puzzles can take some time to figure out that the game is more than worth it.There are multiple pathways through the game as you can take missions from certain people that will either make other people want to or not want to give you more missions. The stealth is also really engaging and fun and the characters are all likable.Plus it's really fun to jump around really high and then tackle a guard and punch him in the face multiple times.			"

												Excellent game, just finished the initial story, and looking forward to plunging into the Level Editor. The game is short, granted, but I enjoyed it way too much for this to be a complaint. 5 hours playtime is probably because I took my time and re-did several missions. You could almost certainly shoot through this in a couple of hours but it's your choice. Probably best to pick up in a sale, perhaps not at full price, but I can't recommend this game much more.			"

The game has beautiful pixel art, well done background music, and challenging puzzles.Presentation:     In Gunpoint, you play the role of a freelance detective/secret agent. This means you take the jobs YOU want and get paid accordingly. Because of this, you can beat the game and never see some levels! Also, this concecpt is introduced in a really unique way. Everything is done over texts, and you choose how to communicate. You can lie, tell the truth, or cover up your tracks. The game also has a suprisingly good story. The writing is clever, and well done.9/10Sound:     Gunpoint has great music that I was happy to hear. The music matches the game's tone and feel and really complements it. Unfortunately, if I ever got stuck on a stage, the music did get a little repititious. The sound effects in the game are perfect and feel perfect.7/10Graphics:     The graphics is perfectly done pixel art. Nuf said.10/10Gameplay:     This is where Gunpoint shines. The actual gameplay is Gunpoint is absolutely amazing! I had genuine fun all through the game (excpept for a bug at the end which made me have to restart the level multiple times) even when I lost. The goal of the game is usually to either grab some prototype weapon or hack a computer then leave. How you do that, can be achieved in multiple ways. You could be a merciless killer and destroy everyone in your path, or you could flip lights off and sneak through the given building. A major point that I must mention on hacking. The hacking (or better called as in the game ""rewiring"") can be confusing at first but gets really cool. You can rewire a light switch so when the switch is hit, a trap door opens that sends a guard to his doom, for example. With all these great gameplay elements, I have little complaints with Gunpoint. The one knockoff, however, is how short the game is. The only reason I am not slamming Gunpoint for the short campaign is because there are levels I haven't even played because of my desicions. So I am just gonna replay the game!10/10Lasting Appeal:     As stated above, the campaign is great, but short lived. The game does come with a level editor, but it feels somewhat limited. The level editor is great, don't get me wrong, but it is simply not the focus of the game.8/10Verdict:Gunpoint is an amazing stealth adventure game that sadly ends way too early.+ Great Story                                                          - Short lived fun+ Fun Gameplay                                                     - Simple level editor+ Spectacular audio and visualsI hope this review helps :D			"

In my spree, I picked up Gunpoint after being satisfied with the demo I had downloaded. This game has delivered. It makes you think, it's full of action, and there are so many ways to tackle a mission (loud,guns,sneak,non-lethal,powergrid shut-down,etc.). Point being, this game is worth the $4 I payed for it, heck its worth more than that. With all of the new map creating features on the way and enjoyable campaign, this game can sell itself. So go try the demo, NOW! You have nothing to lose.			"

												Gunpoint is a brilliantly designed platformer that simultaneously makes you feel like a badass hacker, super spy, and gumshoe detective all at once. The best part of this game has to be Tom Francis' GREAT sense of humor that comes out in the speech choices and mission dialogue delivered through your smart device.  You can really go at your own pace during all of these missions and have a lot of fun sort of solving the puzzle of the buildings' electronics setps.  And you don't have to fret over dying much, as you have the option to reload X amount of seconds earlier upon dying to keep gameplay going.  I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone.			"

You have to manipulate the circuits of a building for getting in your objective whit minimal violence, whitnesses, time and noise. The game has a great music, a great story which you can listen to both sides of the story and manipulate the people involved. Last but not least, the game is really hilarious and every single dialog in the game makes you laugh.			"

												Gunpoint is a brilliant puzzle/stealth game which uses hacking mechanics which are pretty rare. The game is very fun though the story of the game is very short, I completed it in under two hours. There is yet a bit of replay value because of the story moral choices and also trying to beat your top times. There is a portal for playing levels that other people have created on its way and when that arrive, I would recomend this game to anyone. 8/10			"

												Watch_Dogs 2 The Pre-Sequel lives up to its hype and more. It keeps the fun of seeing into the personal lives of strangers and wielding tech to slaughter anyone in your path from the original game. While still making the environment feel that it took place before the first game with an insane downgrade of graphics and a more arcade feel more similar to Pong and Space Invaders.Gameplay: Pretty sick, old fun from original game, maybe less but who knowsStory: Seemed average, honestly didn't pay attention as I was focused on acheievementsGraphics: Comparing the ""new"" and ""updated"" graphics of this game from its predecessor, I can't help but wonder what     Ubisoft was smokingEngine: I had some minor lag problems from time to time in this game, unlike the original which ran smoothly and beautifully, though not surprising considering this second game is newerOverall: 9/10 feels new and old at the same time! Can't wait for the next Watch_Dogs!			"

												This game is a great fun couple of hours. The fun is in the approach. You can go in gun (once acquired) or fists blazing, grab the objective and get out, or you can work out your perfect stealth infiltration and exit plan. With a light film noir feel, it looks and sounds nice, with a good compact story to boot. Reminiscent of Hitman games, you are graded after missions with regards to whether you were seen, used aggression, caused noise, as well as time taken. You can run through the story very quickly but half the fun is in trying to get the perfect A+ grade. Could easily have new story expansions for SP in DLCs and could suit a MP style (perhaps like a side-on version of Monaco) in future updates.			"

												The mechanics are simple to learn but the graphics, story, and gameplay are so charming and enjoyable and the puzzles can take some time to figure out that the game is more than worth it.There are multiple pathways through the game as you can take missions from certain people that will either make other people want to or not want to give you more missions. The stealth is also really engaging and fun and the characters are all likable.Plus it's really fun to jump around really high and then tackle a guard and punch him in the face multiple times.			"

												Gunpoint is a stealth-based puzzle-platform video game created by indie developer Tom Francis.The game is set in the near future and sees players assume the role of freelance spy Richard Conway, who is tasked with infiltrating buildings to fulfil assignments from various clients. OK enough copying stuff from wiki..... No, but seriously, the game is fun, i really liked it... I could play it for hours and hours, but i have a life to live :)The creator did a good job here, i really appreciate it, he could make another game like this, maybe Gunpoint 2 ?!?The game really deserves a nine. So 9/10Good job Tom			"

Although the campaign is quite short with only 25 missions, there is a lever creator and editor to make your own levels as much as you want. There's also a workshop update, so you can play other players' levels. Also, you can go back and play missions that you've already finished, getting new badges and achievements each time. With fun upgrades like kicking down doors, a handgun and muffling breaking windows, this is worth it.Alright, we're done here.			"

												This game is a tricky review since it's sorta a puzzle game but sorta a platformer but also sorta an action game...From the puzzle perspective, your character can edit the electronics so when a guard sees the lights go off, he runs for the switch, flips it on, the switch however calls a lift which upon arriving causes a sound detector to go off which turns off the upstairs lights and when the officer goes to hit the light switch his gun discharges and shoots the person he's patroling with. The entire time your character sindles accross the ceiling like a monkey taking a gymnastic's class.What I found charming was the presence of humor in the game- you could make choices and these choices actually influence the game (not a whole ton, but enough...) for example: one of the achivements would be to solve the police officer's missions without incriminating yourself. How do you do that? You show the officer that there is no way you could have committed the murder you see in the intro.... as well as hide any evidence that says otherwise.Overall though, this is a great game and it will get its money's worth as it has several replays in it before it gets boring. Keep in mind it also has a custom mode where you can create your own levels filled with guards and wall sockets to electicute said guards at the switch of a button... you know, to blow off some steam since they shot you for the 19 billionth time that game...

												I've been playing Gunpoint for a while and I am pretty intrigued so far. It's quite a stealth-based game, but you'll find yourself having to use violence from time to time... or you might as well go full thug. At each end of the mission you'll be rated how much violence/stealth/noise you used. You'll get rewarded money to buy gadgets and the choices you make will influence the story.>I'd give it a 8/10>Pros: Strategic stealth weird mix game, interesting leap technique, story changes based on choices.>Cons: The time to finish levels is so low, yet it takes me 5x more than that.

It has brilliant stealth and hacking mechanics, and the combat is avoidable if you're like me and don't like murdering people who're just doing their jobs. But if you do, there are a host of ways to creatively and entertainingly murder guards. (I don't recommend using the gun, unless you want to deal with a police sniper)Anyway, I feel like doing the thing that everybody else does in reviews, with the chain of events thing.*Got to last level*Took hours to get through it*Accidently killed a pro with a trapdoor*Finally got to the spy*Desperatly clicked ""punch"" because I didn't want to deal with the cops*Got back to Gessler*Rewired his gun so he didn't shoot me*Accidently kicked a door into him instead of shooting him*Wins anyway*Writes blog post*Writes actual blog post*Fails miserably at trying to make a level*Writes this review			"

I also love the noir detective feel the game has to it, and the super jumping boots you wear are a nice mechanic. You can feel like a frog jumping from doors and windows to ceilings to pouncing on guards, etc. You also have numerous dialogue options with people as you progress through the story that can change the outcome. It's really something that must be experienced on your own. Gunpoint is probably my favorite indie game, 9.25/10.			"

												A short, yet very enjoyable ""Film Noir""-experience.The dialogs are witty and the game's mechanics challenge you to replay the game ...While the game is not as complex or long as more expansive productions (""Mark of the Ninja"" comes to my mind), it delivers some dark and sharp dialogs/cut-scenes.Great job and a showcase for indie-games!

												""Simple yet fun"" meets jumpy pants... This game is a must have if you love puzzle platforms.I loved almost all levels. Difficulty was not an issue though. Puzzle designs are delicious, but not challenging enough most of the time. (But you can always have custom levels from other players.)Don't expect a long gameplay time but you'll enjoy each minute, including those strangely addictive dialogues between levels. :)Strongly and strooongly recommended.

												This game is fantastic, just brilliant; in the gameplay, the comedy in the gameplay, the dialogue, the comedy in the dialogue and the music! Oh god the music is good! It is a fantastic mix of Jazz and Noir style which just fits the game so well, as well it being just gorgeous to listen to on its own.The gameplay is smooth quick and easy to grab hold of, but provides a deep puzzle and intersting experience which will sometimes need you to think about it for a while to find a solution, as the trailer says; PLAN!The visual style is also very nice it's not too horribly pixelated, the building style looks unique and has a sort of semi-futuristic noir to it, and the cross-wire views look suitably futuristic as well.Overall: JUST BYE THIS GAME!

												About in-game story:It is quite simply presented in conversations between the characters before each stage (and u have the option to choose what to answer although its superficial and most of the time it won't result in different reactions nor change storyline). I got interested in the dialogs, they were fun and I didn't feel like skipping the talks (they are short) nor wanted to rush to the gameplay only.About gameplay:There are various missions in this game and each get more challenging, and the fun in Gunpoint is to solve them with the stealth/puzzle system present in it, which is pretty amazing. About etc:Controls are very simple, graphics are even simpler, and the music is just very relaxing (jazz).  Only came across a bug once where i got through a locked door I had no means of passing yet. Sadly, the only replay value in this game is to get the best rating and time on each mission.The game is short, finished in few hours even tho I took my time, but definitely enjoyed the hours playing it and the feeling of money well spent is there!

												A very enjoyable stealth puzzle game where you infiltrate high security buildings with subterfuge, violence, and electronic sabotage.  The game is short, but it manages to perfectly combine film noir, stealth and hacking into an enjoyable experience.  You are not forced to play one way or the other and you can eventually crash through doors and murder everyone if you want to.  Gunpoint isn't really punishing, but I did feel like I couldn't stop playing it until completion.  I then went and played it all again making some different choices along the way.  Thankfully the short story is not a major problem as the Steam Workshop allows countless custom levels and the level editor allows you to make your own.  I would describe it as more of a puzzle game with some humour and solid stealth mechanics thrown in.  I can only recommend this gem of an indie title and if you can get it on sale then it's definitely worth your time and money.			"

												The shortest I can describe this game as: 2D Version (and better one) of Watch Dogs. You play as a trenchcoat wearing hacker who can manipulate anything in the power grid of the building, and infiltrates server rooms to hack them.I definitely recommend this game to any lover of strategy games. Very nice looking pixel graphics, fluid motions, nice ambiental music, but the most important aspect is the gameplay, which uses simple puzzle elements to create complex scenarios for you to complete - in any way you want. This game has a choose-your-own-style approach, where you can choose whether to be the stealthy spy that never leaves any mark behind, or the hardcore maniac who bashes doors in over his enemies. Time between missions are also entertaining, as before and after each mission you are texting with your employer. Some of them are quite fun to read.Another HUGE pro on the game's side is the simple and intuitive Level Editor, along with Workshop integration. Much like Portal 2, this game now gives you a virtually unlimited list of levels other players made for you to complete, so you don't need to replay the campaign over and over again.Achievement-wise, they are easy and fun to make. It took me about 5 hours to complete all 42 of them! Definitely a big recommendation for Achievement Hunters.All in all, this game is wonderful. Don't miss the chance to play it!			"

												A really enjoyable stealth game, featuring system manipulation and pummeling people into bloody pulps. Comes with a fun level editor aswell and some community made level editors are more indepth and expand one's options.The stealth in and of itself is quite satisfying; I always get a kick out of demolishing every guard in the level, but you could do thing pacifisticly should you desire; it gives you alot of ways to approach problems. The level editor gives you even more flexibility to create ideal maps and the like.This is a stealth game I feel many people would feel comfortable with, and those familiar with the game can do some pretty neat things with the rewiring mechanics, which allow you to wire up different electronics to eachother and bamboozle guards.In terms of downsides, I'd say the single player is short, which is not necessarily a bad thing considering the plethora of levels workshop provides. I haven't really seen anything big in terms of bugs, either. I had alot of hype for this game, and it definitely delivered.			"

												This is one of the best stories that I have ever played in a game. I am a very, very sarcastic person. This game allows me to use my sarcasm to its full extent. It's an enabler. The game overall is very short, about an hour and a half to complete, and I got all the achievements in about 6 hours. This doesn't include player levels. The game sets up a terrific atmosphere that could definitely have more content added to it at a later date. Right now, it is definitely worth the $10 American or equivalent.TL:DR - Sarcastic as ****, 9/10 could have more contenthttp://www.pentadact.com/category/conwaysblog/?K=25&U=31&C0=2&E1=2&C1=5&E2=1&C2=2&C3=3&C4=3&C5=3 "

												This game is just phenomenal! The story is very good even though it is quite short. The characters and the dialouges are funny and entertaining as you can pretty much always choose between 1-3 answers.This makes the story a little less linear. The gameplay is something different than the usual games. You can leap around with your Hyper-Trousers by holding the left mouse button and releasing it. By scrolling up on the mouse wheel you enter the 'Crosslink-mode'. In this mode you can rewire certain things for example, instead of turning on/off the light you can rewire the light switch to open/close a door or even fire off a gun by a patroling enemy. But there are different circuits with different colours. You can wire a red light switch to a red door but you can't wire a red light switch to a bue door. Pretty obvious, right? You can also buy/upgrade your gear to make things a little bit easier but also more interesting. You can solve the levels in many different ways depending on the gear that you have bought with the money you get from completing a level. The levels all work the same way. Get in the building hack one or more computers and leave without getting shot. You can do this stealthy and not kill anyone but you can also kill the guards and hack the computer without having to hope not to be seen. At least in the first few levels because as you advance in the story the buildings become bigger and the guards become more and stronger. But I don't want to spoil too much about the story as I think you should play it yourself. Another thing I really like about this game is the level editor and the Steam Workshop. The user-made levels can make you play the game even after finishing the story as there are so many and a lot are very good. Also the soundtrack of this game is just amazing but I suggest you listen to it yourself as it might not be the kind of music you like (opinions and stuff)!I excuse for any typos and want to thank you for reading! I hope this review might help you to decide if you want to buy this game.TL;DR: BUY THIS  GAME. BUY THIS GAME NOW.			"

												Do you like puzzles, witty writing, cool mechanics, a lovely artstyle, well characterized.. Characters, aaand games in general? No? Well I'd still recommend you play this game, 'cus it's just that damn good! And it's only like 4 hours long, so it's not like you'd be wasting a lot of your precious time either. And if you do enjoy it, then there's always a buttload of well made community maps as well. This game is most likely worth your money, even if it costed twice as much, and it's certainly worth your time.			"

The game is overall short, 4 or 5 hours tops, but the presence of the level editor makes it more long-running with anything you want to create or the material you can find in the workshop.			"

												Undenialbly one of the best games I have played in the past few years after its release.GunPoint is a 2D stealth action and puzzle game, which forces you to adapt to each induvidual level that it throws at you, you can also say it is hardcore in a way, as it only takes one hit for you to get killed by a security guard. The story, from my perspective anyway is cool. You play as Richard Conway, a freelance spy who is equipped with a special pair of trousers which allow him to jump at great lengths and to places where no person without them can go. Thats all i'll go for at the moment but some of the major plot points are seen in the early stages of the game. But here are some of the good things about the game.- Allows you to do any level the way you want to.- The soundtrack is really good, giving you that sense that you are playing a Noire-type of game- The Sneaky sections of the game are well done for a 2D oriented game.- It is also hardcore, meaning that you die in one hit from a gunshot, similar to the system in hotline miami.- The crosslink upgrade allows you to become a true hacker.- And finally the game has a lot of strategy behind the game, meaning that ou have to use your brain to figure out the best possible way to complete your objective.There are some Hicups i the game though that I would address;-The game is locked at 60 frames per second, meaning that your beast of a PC won't be able to boost out over 9000 frames per second on this game.-Some of the deaths of this game are kinda cheap, but thats probably just me.-And a few game setup issues (for me anyways) prevented the game from starting up.Overall score = 9.0/10 - Even though the game has a few negatives surrounding it, the positives far outweigh them, and its only for £6.00. for a far complete game that has a good chance of a sequel coming out in the future.

												So having completed the game in almost 1 sitting of 3 hours, what would I rate this game?Well starting off I found the story began brilliantly, I enjoyed the witty humor and the way you could choose the responses you gave which had an effect on the way the story actually played out, I found though the story seemed a litle short for my liking, but the overall gameplay made up for this shortfall.Gameplay I found hilarious, being able to jump on enemies and punch them in the face repeatedly for no reason at all, jumping through windows from high up and landing on your face, and especially kicking doors into the faces of unspuspecting enemies had me laughing all the way through the gameplay.The mechanics of the game are fantastic, the way you can rewire things to your advantage to go uber sneaky or zapping the crap out of guards for the hell of it it, in the later levels providing a unique challenge that I havent seen in a game for a long time, it does get you thinking on how you can get through that door without being seen as well as then making it to the next one on a timer.With this in mind, I would highly recommend this game to anyone, even with its short story line I think it has replayability value, and with the workshop levels also there to provide another level of challenge - Gunpoint for me scores a solid 9.6/10.

It is a fantastic mix of Jazz and Noir style which just fits the game so well, as well it being just gorgeous to listen to on its own.The gameplay is smooth quick and easy to grab hold of, but provides a deep puzzle and intersting experience which will sometimes need you to think about it for a while to find a solution, as the trailer says; PLAN!The visual style is also very nice it's not too horribly pixelated, the building style looks unique and has a sort of semi-futuristic noir to it, and the cross-wire views look suitably futuristic as well.Overall: JUST BYE THIS GAME!

												One of the most creative concepts for a game that I have ever seen, and it was very fun. The sound is great, the graphics are cool retro but not too retro, and the gameplay is fun and very creative. Whoever created this is quite smart to come up with such a cool unique idea. I really had a great time playing through this. The only issue is that it is short: I beat it in a little more than four hours. And it is like Portal 2 in that once you beat it, you really can't replay it because you already know how to solve each level. I would say because of its short four to five hour length, don't pay ten bucks for it. Unless you are jumping out of your skin to play it, catch it on sale for $5 or less if you can which is what I did.			"

												Hello there! Are you the average FPS/MOBA/RPG/RTS player who has just completed/got tired of a great AAA title and craves any kind of gaming break?Well, Gunpoint might just be the medicine for you. This well-designed platforming gem combines several of the things that a derided game we all know as Lookhounds (seriously Ubisoft, I'm coming for you) should have had in the first place. Aside from pretty neat hacking and movement mechanics, Gunpoint implements the one thing that is missing in most of all the games - smart humour. You'll be hooked in no time.All in all, Gunpoint stands as a unique and laid-back platformer, which I recommend to everyone who just wants to ward off the usual games and still have fun. Get it during a sale and you won't regret it.			"

												Gunnpoint is about a dectectivewho is given a corporate objective;sneak into some placespunch some guys in their faces,and make their faces defective.You use a tool like a gunto get the missions doneIt rewires their systemsto help you through missions,and you wont have to kill everyone!But the option is certainly thereif you don't have patience to spare.Kick down some doors, bust through glass floors,and get it done fair and square.But you get rated based on stealth,go loud and it'll be unhappy as hell.did you make lots of noise?Ge the neightbors annoyed?Well then you get one star- oh well!The puzzles arent bad at allyou'll love getting them solvedYou do well you get money,the writing is funny,it's just a great game overall.

												This game is fun, seriously fun let me tell you why.First off all the graphics are good in the art style its going for,But a game like this doesn't shine in the graphics compartiment no no noA game excels in (you guessed it, if not you might be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sorry.) GAMEPLAY and boy does gunpoint deliver in gameplay, it's not a particulary long game but it's short and sweet.There are so many ways to tackle a mission wich offers really nice replayability.And don't get me started on the whitty humor this game has, the amount of whitty humor is surely over 9000.+ you get to choose your asnwers wich in my opinion makes it alot more immersive.so a little recap for you guys, this game has solid gameplay, great sense of humor, the art style is well designed and the music really suits the settings. If you  are thinking about getting this game or not obvioously i would say yes go for it, even at it's full price it's deffinitely worth it's value!			"

												First of all; WOW. This is such an awesome game on so many levels. The artwork is so beautiful and the music fits really well and the cleverness, like omg the cleverness of this game and the overall feeling you get from playing this game, it´s all amazing. I got it in a humble bundle for like 1 dollar but i could easily have payed 29.99 for this little piece of geniusness, even though it's a short game, and yeah it is short, for me it took a little over 3 hours to finish it, but maybe that´s just because i suck, my friend did it in 2 hours. But it´s that type of game you wanna re-play as soon as you finished it, so that´s also what makes it worth alot more money than it´s sold for, atleast to me. This is now one of my all time favourite games, and i normally don´t even like puzzles!			"

												For $5 (I actually bought it for around $1.49), this game was TOTALLY worth it!  This game really makes you think strategically on how to make everything you want to happen... Happen.  Even though there aren't a ton of missions in the base game, you can play levels made by others or you can make levels yourself!  From someone who can't play games for very long, this game kept me very focused and I wanted to keep playing.  I would highly recommend buying this game.			"

												Gunpoint is a very nice combination of a stealth game and a puzzle and focusses clearly on the gameplay itself rather than on graphics. The levels are all part of a crime story in which the player itself is involved. Your part is to break into buildings and steal data/information/stuff without getting caught. As if this wasn't challenging enough, you also have to rewire circuits to open doors, dim lights and so on. I really love this game and strongly recommend it to every stealth fan.			"

												One of the most creative concepts for a game that I have ever seen, and it was very fun. The sound is great, the graphics are cool retro but not too retro, and the gameplay is fun and very creative. Whoever created this is quite smart to come up with such a cool unique idea. I really had a great time playing through this. The only issue is that it is short: I beat it in a little more than four hours. And it is like Portal 2 in that once you beat it, you really can't replay it because you already know how to solve each level. I would say because of its short four to five hour length, don't pay ten bucks for it. Unless you are jumping out of your skin to play it, catch it on sale for $5 or less if you can which is what I did.			"

												This is one of the most unique stealth games I've played in a while; the gameplay feels open ended and endlessly creative in the way you can approach the problems. The storyline isn't anything revolutionary, but its compelling enough to keep you going, and the script is funnier than you'd expect. It's definitely short, but it's got some replay value, and the level editor ensures there will be plenty of user made content for the game.As short as it is, it's entirely worth picking up, or at least trying the demo. It's probably my favorite thing I've played that's come out this year so far. It's at the very least on the short list.			"

												This is very much a stealth and puzzle sort of game. While the puzzle aspect isn't apparent, moving through the levels stealthily in my mind makes it something you must think about and iI call it a puzzle. Plus you are armed with gadgets which you use to unlock electrical devices, and use them to connect switches to doors, lights, and other things. Every mission you must try and figure out how to get to the data you need, or whatever it is you are there for by bypassing the security systems of that building, and not getting killed by the guards. The game has great humor and the stealth aspects of finding clues, getting data, etc. make it a very fun and rewarding experience. You don't have to do it all stealthily, however. You can just run in and jump on guards and punch them in the face 1337 times as well. Of course this lowers your score for that particular mission as most of them require you to keep the violence to a minimum. The title of the game is a little misleading, as you actually rarely use a gun, and if you do it is a last resort. Like you only have one bullet, and you really don't want to be using it at all because it means you are seen and your score will lower. You can hold up enemies, but it is best to avoid them altogether. Definitely a game worth buying and a fun use of your mind. The game also includes a level creator  and Trading cards. you get 4 drops of 8 cards.			"

												Gunpoint is a very entertaining stealth/puzzle game in which you use your ""Crosslink"" gadget to rewire the electronics of buildings to get in, get to your objective and get out as stealthily - or unstealthily - as possible. You can rewire lighswitches, security cameras and other sensors to do whatever you want - confuse guards, unlock doors, turn off lights, etc...whatever you need to finish your objective. The open-ended gameplay is complimented by the humorous story and characters. The only problem with this game is that it felt a little on the short side to me, at 3 hours long. No worries though, as it's an excellent game while it lasts. Really great indie game.			"

This game would be amazing with Steam workshop though, lets hope that they put it in... though they probably won't. It's a fantastic game though, just far too short and far too expensive.			"

												Gunpoint is an action puzzle game designed, coded and written by PC Gamer journalist Tom Francis who just recently, after Gunpoint proved to be a success, left the publication to fully pursue a career in game development. And the world now has another talented independent developer.Gunpoint’s simple yet pleasing retro looks may fool you into thinking that the game is a throwback to times long past, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. This is a wholly modern, unique and innovative game that rewards players for experimentation. The players assume the role of freelance spy Richard Conway who gets tangled up in a rather convoluted story of murder, betrayal and industrial espionage. The writing is great for the most part, it’s witty and often intentionally breaks the fourth wall. The noir atmosphere is surprisingly strong thanks to the great soundtrack and the pleasing aesthetics.Conway’s objective usually involves breaking into a building and retrieving sensitive data. To achieve this, the players are given complete freedom to choose whichever play style fits them best. Every mission can be completed without ever making a noise or being seen by the guards, but on the flipside, you can smash through windows, break down doors and simply kill everyone standing in your way. To do either, you earn upgrades for your newly acquired pants which allow you to jump over great heights and distances. You can also move on walls and ceilings. This allows for sneaking, but can also lead to all sorts of great action such as pouncing on a guard and knocking him out of the window.Conway can also purchase a variety of gadgets such as the Crosslink and Wirejack which introduces you to Gunpoint’s most compelling mechanic. By changing to an alternative view mode, you can rewire electric circuits. For example, you can rewire a light switch to open a door or a motion detector to turn off the lights. Later on, you can even purchase a gadget that allows you to rewire the guard’s weapons. This complete freedom of gameplay opens up numerous possibilities and the game never penalizes you for playing the way you want to play. Different clients will have different requests such as minimal violence or leaving no living witnesses, but these are completely optional objectives that only affect how the client rates you, but the mission will still be a success and you will get payed the same.The only major drawback is that the game is pretty short. It will definitely leave you craving for more content, but at least you can play all the missions again with all the gadgets and abilities you’ve unlocked which is compelling in its own way as it lets you further experiment with all the crazy stuff you can pull off.Gunpoint is an original and intelligent game that treats players with respect and facilitates emergent gameplay through the use of compelling, innovative and slick mechanics.8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)			"
