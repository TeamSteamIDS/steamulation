Early Access Review
								Steam Squad.What it is: Squad based turn strategy game, with a Steam Punk, cartoonish WWI setting.PROS: Solid game mechanics. Easy to learn yet tactic gameplay. Beautiful graphics. Nice, interesting story and setting. Great steam mechas (planes and tanks), that will be usable in the final release (according to developers) Mele weapons! Bring out the pitchforks!! The developer is VERY involved in the forums, and many of the bugs/fixes/changes adressed there have been taken care of. The developer promised to work on a modding extension after the release.  Battlecam!! It has been implemented and works great, with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling. Great!CONS: Gameplay feels a little light, specially if you compare it to old school tbs games like Silent Storm, JA2 or Fallout tactics. Hopefully the tank play will compensate that. In order to make the gameplay more fluid, prone/kneel/stand positions have been changed to a more fluid ""kneel while standing still, stand while running/shooting for cover - no prone"" mechanics. More fluid, but also lighter.What I LIKE: Setting. Graphics and game concept. Game mechanics. Full ballistics engine. Destroyable enviroment (promised by developers, not yet implemented). Interactive fauna. Graphical display of Action Points, both in the small valve like dial, and in the movement line, where it shows you in easy to read green-amber-red tones how far your character can move before running out of AP. Part of the game is developed in  Blender, which is Free and Open Source Software, and it's released for linux.  "

What is Steam Squad?Steam Squad is a tactical, turn-based strategy game that places you in control of a squad. The game occurs in a world that is vastly different to the one we know today. The developers at Bretwalda Games have reached alternative conclusions to many of the outcomes that have shaped the modern world. These conclusions include:The British never losing control over the United StatesThe Tianxian Empire colonizing Siberia before RussiaThe Gao (Chinese) colonizing Australia instead of the BritishIt is because of these game setting decisions that I found myself deeply fascinated with it before I began to play.Poor/Inconsistent AIArguably the biggest negative effecting Steam Squad is the unpredictability of the AI. More often than not I would argue that unpredictability is a key strength. However, in this instance, there are enemy soldiers who are able to kill you from the other side of the world. On the other hand, there are soldiers who would make the perfect candidates for hired the Empire to employ as Stormtroopers. I believe that this is a problem with the RNG.This isn't simply a case of the AI getting better as the levels become more difficult. I could understand if it were a case of the game proclaiming you to be becoming too good for it and ramping up the difficulty. Unfortunately, it isn't and it appears to be this way throughout the game. And when you do replay a level it isn't the same enemy that has the same ability. As a result, I am left to conclude that randomization can be good is good but not if it comes at the cost of poor AI.Streamlined Gameplay MechanicsSteam Squad has a tendency to feel very streamlined as far as turn-based strategy games go. The classics seem to have much greater depth and variety to the gameplay. However, I wouldn't necessarily mark this as a negative against the game for everyone. If you've played the classics and want something a little less hardcore then this game would be very suitable for you. Likewise, if you are new to the genre and some of the older titles feel too daunting then this is the game for you. In other words, it has the potential to be a great gateway game. Consequently, I believe that it is sometimes games such as this that offer sufficient challenge but are not too full on that provide the gameplay that we need.User Interface and GraphicsIn my experience, I have found that some of the games that are too daunting are because of their user interface. In the case of Steam Squad the developers need to be applauded. This is because UI is very player friendly. It has been well thought out and ultimately implemented to perfection. Of particular note are the way in which action points are displayed. There are multiple points where this is displayed. The first is in the soldier's status which is located immediately below the soldier. The second is in the UI which is also where you can set the number of AP that you will use per move. I believe that if you set it to a higher amount accuracy will tail off slightly and increase if you set it to a lower number. Consequently, this has a significant impact on the strategy employed.In other aspects of the game, I was both pleased and frustrated with the graphics. Perhaps cover is the most frustrating aspect of the graphical display. It can be frustrating to believe that you are in cover only to find out that you are not. As a result, I learned to err on the side of caution and to believe that my soldiers were not in cover. Sometimes they were and that was great but it wasn't always the case. I would recommend taking this strategy. Otherwise, the game is very pleasing on the eyes and accomplishes what it sets out to do.Is it Steamified?The developers have done their job in regards to making their game Steamified. They have added both trading cards and Steam achievements.VerdictIf you're a fan of alternative world histories and strategy games then Steam Squad is the game for you. I believe that the developers are committed to correcting the issue with the AI. Everything else runs fine. The presentation is pretty and well presented. It's a solid game by a small indie studio and they should be proud of their effort.For similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways, including PC hardware, please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

Early Access Review
								I disagree with many of the complaints being written here, because they forget this is not a complete. Its a beta, so don't expect all those features to be implemented just yet. When you expect a game in its Beta build to be fantastic, youll only end up disapointed. Take Kenshi as an example. I've been following Kenshi for years, ever since version .2. It was a terrible game back then, with no base building, no crafting, just a bunch of dudes swinging swords. But I didnt not immediately dismiss it, saying the music was terrible (because there was no music), or the AI was the dumbest I had ever seen (because it was) or the fact the it was incredibly ugly (God was it ugly). No, because I did not expect a complete game. I liked what the premise of the game was, so I backed the developer so they could further expand the game into what they wanted it to be. That being said, the game still needs to have a little bit of work done. But as it is in Beta .3, I can forgive many of the faults I find in it. The music is ok. Not great, but not terrible. The only major complaint I have had thus far is the damn whistleing. And when the biggest fault you can find in a game is the fact they sometimes whistle the begining of the Indian Jones theme song, It cant be that bad of a game.			"

								Steam squad is a very nice game with very interesting historic backend. How would have gone the history, if some historical events had not been like the ones which had taken place? What if the USA had still been a colony of Great Britain? For people who like me loves history it can be very attractive try to find out the answers to such questions. This game will try to answer some of them. And as soon as it tells us about the Great War we also will find a lot of new about this epoch.Speaking about the gameplay. This game is a tactic game, I don't play a lot of games of such genre, but it took me a little time to understand the mechanics of Steam Squad, so I feel pleasure in it. As soon as this is an early access, there are still a lot of things, which one can improve. But the guys make a great progress from version to version, so I hope the release version could be great.I liked the style of the game, the historical backend, the authenticity of the epoch, the game engine, the music.The things I think the guys should work on is the AI. It could be better.			"

Early Access Review
								As a great fan of turn based strategies and everything related to Great war, I have been following developing of this game since its campaign at Kickstarter for a year or so, waiting for it to become usable and interesting. Finally after recent updates - being able to equip its own squad and use heavy machinery, decided to go for into playing in it. If to summarize its pros and contras, here they are:Difficult to accomplish missions if you do not play accurately and smart. Soldiers are killed with 1-2 shots or grenade and you have just few of them - like it when it is hard :-)Good looking and high quality graphics, music, game mechanics etc;Updates are coming every week and as it have been told by developers it is scheduled to be ready in full this summer already. Feels like it is progressing fast to be finalized;Cons: Still too few missions :-( and only one is so far with tanks and artillery; Quite many of the iconic symbols of Great War are missing - barbed wire, gas, cavalry attacks...or at least I did not see it yet - did not find info from developers if they plan to have it			"

												For a turn-based squad game there is enough for me to recommend it.  * It incorporates action points well* The maps are interesting* Units are role based rather then stat based* It has freaking opportunity fire!* The alt history makes the engagements interesting and funThat said, the UI is a bit rough and lacks pollish.  Graphically, it's a bit jarring, but completely serviceable.  If you can get past those warts, the game has many gameplay delights to offer.  "

												Turn based wargame set in altenative steam-punk WWI universe. Made with a great respect to the old-school games, while it's relatively simple on the first missions, it becomes harder as you advance. Gameplay became much better since EA version with introduction of user controlled vehicles and stationary weapons.			"

Early Access Review
-Recommended Title-Steam Squad is a ""Steampunk"" Turn Based Strategy game, currently available as early access  (in Beta - currently v0.371b)Whilst the game is based on ""The Great War"", it's historical content does not include the Entente and Central Powers forces per se, but the British and ""Exotic Asian"" (Han) forces instead, this dynamic is interesting - and refreshing and sets a very plausible scene.


First Mission - Gameplay 
A Screenshot of Steam Squad
By: NightMorph




The main character in the story is a British Captain - Ken Whitehall, and his troop of ""Gentlemen"", whom are battling the ""Han"". The storyline follows Ken and his men, through different missions as they undertake the battle and stop the march of the Han.Versions:0.31 June 20140.32 July 20140.371b October 2014 0.40b November 20140.41b December 2014 View latest changelogThe graphics in Steam Squad are still being developed, they are similar to Men of War in it's current state. The artwork is interesting and fun, with of course a steampunk look. The Gameplay is the typical turn based type, where you get to move your troops into position, fire at the enemy and then end the turn,waiting for the enemy to make their move. As always, placement of the troops is important, as the Han are very good shooters!Steam Squad will include tanks, artillery and other ""steam"" powered instuments of war ,which will be drivable. This increases the playability value - and turns this game from a typical strategy shooter. Destructable environments are currently not included, but will be at a later date.

There is no ability to control the camera - other than panning (zoom is not enabled), and the camera does not focus on the enemy when they take their turn. I believe that some camera tweaks are being worked on and will be released in a later version. The camera view is dimetric. **Update v 0.371**  The camera now follows the actions of the player and npcs. It also includes the zoom function. These improvements have made a big difference to gameplay.The UI looks great, but again, some work needs to be done on this to make it more polished and easier to use. Having said that, it does not stop you being able to have an enjoyable game.**Update v 0.371** There have been tweaks made to the UI, both in the main menu, mission selection, and gameplay screens.The music is ok, the  background effects lack the atmosphere of explosions and gun fire. . more needs to be done with improving the audio emmersion.Overall, Steam Squad performs very well, and is not a walk in the park to play. It's an early beta, so expect that there are going to be things that are missing, don't work, or need improvement. The developer - Bretwalda Games - is constantly working on Steam Squad with an further update v 0.371 just released.I think that there is plenty of room for Great War era games such as this, in a overly populated Second World War gaming universe. I recommend Steam Squad, even in it's current Beta build, it shows great potential, and whilst Bretwalda Games are a relatively new company on the scene, the quality of their work, and commitment to ensuring that the comunity voice is heard equates to what I hope is a very successful game.Definately a strategy title to add to the collection at under $10 doleros, if you don't mind putting up with a few annoyances along the beta journey, until release. And help support smaller develop studio's.7/10			"

The game is stable although it is yet an early beta and I had a lot of fun playing the first mission. According to developers, they are going to add vehicles and cannons soon. I'm waiting for these additions and wish to developers a good luck with all new features.			"

 This review is for the beta branch for the game, currently on version 1.03 Steam Squad is a turn-based RPG, set in an alternate history of World War I that puts heavy emphasis on role and AP management. With it’s beautiful steampunk aesthetic and intriguing “What if?” scenario, this little game is able to caught my attention. It’s a fun little game (albeit a little too light) with an active development. With that in mind, I have to change my review to be a more feedback-like than usual. Graphics Steam Squad is one of the most visually pleasant turn-based strategy game I’ve ever played for quite some time, it might not have the highest model poly count, but the beautiful steampunk aesthetic, and clean and user friendly UI is really nice to look at. It’s a perfect balance of realism and a steampunk universe, which fits perfectly with its plot and theme. UI puts emphasize on Action Point-related info, and most if not all important info shows on various cursor metadata, like remaining AP, accuracy, and cover (only in beta branch, for the time being).  There’s one noticeable flaw in term of graphic, and that will be the animation, it’s weird, robotic, and clunky. It’s fine when you look it from its standard tactical view, but things got funny when it switch to close-up action cam. Story Interesting and intriguing so far. What if the British never lose control of the U.S? What if the Holly Roman Empire is still standing until World War I? Narrative told through letters, news articles, and operation map, which is a really good choice.  Sound While it’s kinda lacking in quantity when it comes to sound and music, it sounds pretty good when there is one. Great music, fitting ambient, and the highlight are the sound of weapons and vehicles. They really nail the chosen universe with this one, well. How do I put it? If you’re familiar with a steampunk fiction, the loud machinery and guns that doesn’t sound too powerful, but at the same time sound like they are giving a really good punch. Now the flaw, sort of.. While I don’t mind the quantity of voice in this game, it will be nice to have more of it, especially the soldiers. Like XCOM where it feels like they communicate with each other in battle, getting fired, suppressing, moving, or they are not in an optimal cover, it helps brings the battle livelier. Gameplay Steam Squad, like its name implies, is a squad/role-based strategy game rather than stats based. Simple yet solid mechanic that works pretty well. It focused on role assignment, AP management, and unit positioning. Accuracy is based on viewing angle and the optimal weapon range. AP plays a big part where your accuracy (and perhaps damage) is based on how much you put an AP on your attack, and you will be put on overwatch mode if you still have a sufficient amount of AP. Steam Squad offers a freedom of movement, unlike most turn based game that use tile-based mechanic, that works well with the accuracy and damage modifier of this game. The map layout is pretty well thought, you will be sent into a bunch of missions with various style, terrain, landscape, and overall feel. The size of the map is “just right”, not insanely huge, and not too small and cramped either, making every battle feels tight and intense. And the maps itself are filled with tanks, Anti-tank guns, and machine gun bunkers, which add some depth to the core gameplay.The mechanic is not without a flaw though. First thing is the lack of unit variety. There is only 3 units, infantry, machine gunner, and mortar gunner, while it works just fine at the current state, it’ll be nice to have some more units like scout/recon, medic, and sniper for instance, to compensate for the absence of perks system. And the second one is…  *drum roll*  … RNG.. that somehow managed to be more infuriating than XCOM. Well.. do I need to explain more? Eh, I don’t think so. And do I mention it’s built on top of unpredictable AI? Well, at least the AI is seeing a noticeable improvement in this version. While this thing did contribute on tactical and careful play it can be frustrating and somewhat unfair at times.  Conclusion Steam Squad is an “easy to learn, hard to master” kind of game with a really pleasing and defining art style, and intriguing story. With a simple yet solid mechanic and user friendly UI, its tutorial mission and the official manual is enough to learn the core and logic of the gameplay, while the real challenge is from the tactical gameplay, emphasizing on AP, role, and positioning that demands careful planning. The unpredictable AI should be a plus with a game, but coupled with the RNG, it can be frustrating at times. As for replay value, it’s yet unseen for me, Steam Squad do have a really varied maps, with its own carefully crafted layout, but the lack of unit type somewhat dampens the experience. If you like games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Silent Storm, and to an extent Valkyria Chronicles, I say give this game a go, it has a lot of potential, and the fact that it’s still on active development, it’ll get better as time goes.

YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Steam Squad 

			Views: 64		

			Today we check out Steam Squad. It's a turn based strategy game about the lead up to World War I. We fight as the Brits as we try to stop some Russian fools.		

Steam Squad is a fun turn-based strategy game set in an alternate history World War I. That being said, it does have its issues.So, if you've ever played XCom you know the basis of Steam Squad. You have your squad, the enemy has theirs and it's a firefight from there on out. The controls are mostly run by the mouse with left click executing most commands and right click over-watching. It's pretty easy to pick up once you've done the tutorial and the first few missions are easy enough for you to get a hang of them.Overall the system works out pretty well, but I do have some gripes with the game. I'll just list them out here:Cover - This is my biggest issue with the game. There is clearly cover mechanics in the game, but the game gives no indication to the player of whether or not you've actually gotten into cover, or what is actually considered cover. Low sandbag walls and trenches? Obviously those are cover. That stump out in the field? I can't be certain. Have you poked your unit so far around the corner that he's not in cover anymore? It's hard to tell. Units - There are only three types of units: soldiers, machine gunners, and grenadiers. This is fine, they all have their position and I've never really pined for any other units (outside of maybe a sniper).Action Cams - As a lot of other players have stated, I don't like the action cams. There's not much to see and they just slow down the combat. Plus, when up close the units run really weirdly ( which, I'll admit, I quite enjoy watching them waddle around).Despite these things, the game is fun to play. It uses an action point system that allows for more variety than something like ""two actions per turn"" (aka the XCom system). The scenarios can be challenging while not being so brutal you want to throw your computer out of the window (or wherever you want to throw it, I won't judge), and the aesthetic is quite nice.Overall, this is a fun turn-based strategy. It seems mostly glitch free and is a game I will definitely play to completion in the future. If you love turn-based strategy games, you should check it out.			"

												I have followed the game for the last couple of years and truly wondered if it would ever be released out of early access. Not seeing anything much in the discussions lately I had pretty much given it up on it. I was very glad to see I was wrong and version 1.0 was released.I like Steampunk and I really like squad based games. This kind of reminds me of Jagged Alliance, Commandos, Silent Storm and an old PC game called Grom. So far I have played the tutorial and the first four missions (out of 30 I'm told). The first two are defending a specific area, the third was to escort a general to a certain location, and the fourth is to take an enemy position. Nice variety so far. I can't wait to see the other missions once they become available. You also have a chance to replay any mission once its completed. The first two missions were pretty easy but I actually had to try the escort mission 3 times before I successfully completed it.The game runs fine. The animations are smooth. I really like the old looking black and white movies between missions. The only complaint I have so far is that the cows in the second misson just stood still while a fire fight was going on around them (must of been some fine tasting hay). Anyway...Before each mission you get a print out, a map, sometimes a letter and info on the upcoming mission. You also get to choose your troops and their equipment (Infantry, Machine Gunner, Mortar, etc).  So far I'm really liking this game. I can't wait to try all of the missions. I hope there will be more missions added or additional DLC. Will update this review after I've played more missions. "

												Feels like an early access game.  The game has a lot of potential if they fix some things.  I wanted to like this game, but I just found myself getting frustrated with it.  If they do fix some of the issues I could see myself recommending this game, but I can't in it's current state.- Minimap could use some work, you can't see the area that your camera is view on it.  - Cover is very frustrating for me.  It's hard to know if you are in cover or not and what area you will be able to see from positions if you decide to move to that spot.  I had one situation where I thought my guy was in cover behind a building.  I could see that he was on overwatch in the direction I wanted with all of his action points available.  Then on the enemy's turn some invisible guy was able to spot mine and kill him while my guy never saw him.  - It would be nice if I had some indication if my solder can fire on an enemy.- Not colorblind friendly, it does ok, but there are no options to adjust the color at all.

Colorful graphics and excellent musical accompaniment leave only positive impressions about the game.Pros:+Graphics+Music+Trading Cards+AchievementsMinuses:-PriceThe price of the game is obviously overestimated, I advise to take only at a discount, but if you're a fan of strategy is possible and without it.I recommend!

												The action of the game takes place in a parallel reality in which familiar to us a world map redrawn beyond recognition and is divided between a maximum of 15-20 countries. Game begins in 1914 after the events that are similar to those that marked the beginning of the WW1. You can find more info about the world in the special paragraph in the menu.The genre of the game is turn-based shooter. Unlike ""XCom"" the levels here haven't cells for movement and another type of movement points is implemented. Here you can spend different quantity of the points for single shot: more points you spend - more chances to kill you have. But lack of fixed places for movement leads to many troubles with choice of the right position behind the covers.Game is hard, you can lose all your squad during one turn.+ alternate story with a lof of references to actual history+ nice surroundings+/- unpredictable AI which can kill you from 9000 metres or can miss from 5m- long loading of the opponent's turn- fixed camera which can't be rotated- no info about the protectable qualities of your current cover- clumsy animationOn the current stage game is pretty playable, but lack of detailed cover's system makes it not so good. But surroundings, music and history are counterbalancing this situation.			"

												I decided to write a review (though usually do not do), I liked the game, and here's why:Passing the game is not easy, missions of the first company are not very hard, but further became much more difficult. You can't save during a mission, so you have to play carefully and cleverly (I've gone only 12 levels). Before the start of the mission you just in general terms imagine what awaits you, and already it is necessary to choose the squad on a mission (cool that the game offers total freedom in terms of units equipment), it is very exciting.The game is very aesthetic, you can spend hours looking at all these details, structure of buildings and nature. The look and style deserve the highest score.Equipment.  All these guns, tanks, bunkers, which can use all the soldiers (for example - opponent can hijack your tank!). It brings freshness into the game, the more interesting that they are styled according to the units nation.Variety of locations and objectives (one time you have to break through the defense, then hold the position, the escape from the subway, or steal a bag with documents) every time I wonder what will happen in the new mission.AI is not dumb at all, as sometimes happens in games like this.After the first run, I stuck for three hours in the game.  I think it also says a lot.			"

												The game is ok but there needs to be a way to rotate the map.  Additionally there needs to be a ""retreat"" mode or ""end mission"" option.  Having to fight to the last man every time is unnecesarily time consuming.  I would also like the option of killing the cut scenes where i have to watch members of my squad make thier first move.  Boring and useless.On the up side, I did get it on sale.....			"

												Was really hoping this was going to be a gem, but it seems to have totally missed the mark for me.  Ultimately, this is an extremely shallow game, granted I only made it to the third mission before having to quit forever, so maybe there's more content I haven't seen... but doubtful.For starters, the first thing I noticed about this was the extremely amateur production.  And that's not in like a indy-dev boot-straps and moxy kind of way, it's a very unpolished game that shows very little thought was put into many of the design choices, even things that have been standard for years.  Interface is pretty lacking, common QoL shortcuts are none-existant, prepare for lots of needless clicks.  Mission briefs are full of useless nonsense and lacking in actual content, you'll read a few .jpg's sliding on the screen and wait for the animation of pages shuffling to see each useless one.  Random transitions during the intro cinematic were absolutely jarring really the first big red flag I noticed.  They quickly, often, and randomly changed from cartoony animated 3D, to 2D, to actual live footage, to still shots, and then back again.  Pick a style!  It's like all the content was salvaged from the free demo bin Baby's First Game Dev book.  It honestly feels like a lot of things in here were added to increase the game's run time and pad the clock.  Either to create and illusion of lots of content, or to get people past the Steam refund wall.But, that's all kind of nit-picky stuff I realize most won't care about.  So actual gameplay.  It's shallow, real shallow.  In the first three missions I played through I was presented with the same 3 unit types.  Their differences end up being trivial ultimately to the mission at hand.  There is an inventory but it is clunky and I regret even noticing it because it was irrelevant to the game and just forced me to navigate more terrible menus.  The actual missions are dull just wait for them to rush into our overwatch areas, forced cinematics that are hardly what I would call 'animated' that add nothing but time to the mission.  At the end your well performing troops get experience and stats... but what that is good for I've yet to determine.  3 missions, you'd think you'd get a level up, or new gear, or new unit, or something.  But no, there is absolutely nothing new to incentivize good performance or even loading the next map... so I didn't.So at the end of that, I think this game is really close to being something great but seems to have been pretty mismanaged for a while and is way off target for what would be expected of a modern game.  P2W mobile games have more content than this for before the paywall.			"

												There is not tha much games on Mac. The number of tactical wargames are counted on the fingers of one hand. I can remember only X-Com on the spot.Back to the game it has impressive setting that starts from the nice before mission briefing and continues all through the gameplay. Really awaiting the hot-seat multiplayer and ipad version.			"

								The game is still very similar to what it was at the beginning. The slow motion of the game is slowly degrading its value even more.			"

												The game looked like a gem, but failed in too many aspects. I played only to the 3d mission, may be it would go better, and there'll be bugfixes, but in current state I definitely can't recommend it to anyone.Cons (that's  why it is negative after all):1. The game is very unpolished. Things are little but they are everywhere.2. AI. It is not stupid, strange mix of bad RNG (it is even worse then in X-Com), good tactics and dumb pathfinding.3. Bugs. Annoying. Enemy perfectly fine goes through 4 man on overwatch (AP left) and kills one of them in melee. Other time my soldier shoot on overwatch out of cone of fire...4. graphics are ok in some places and just bad  and unpolished in others, screenshots are carefully picked. X-com like action camera is the worst part, it is funny here, not dramatic.5. Combat system is shallow, expected much more from the description.Pros:1. Nice setting2. Really good atmosphere (when not hindered by funny jumping soldiers), all these films and letters home are very nice.3. UI is nice, but not as informative as I would like it to be. But very nice.4. Music is good too.May be devs shod consider making a movie or a comics. Most good things about this game is, sadly, not about gameplay,			"

								One of worst games I ever played so far. I got this title for free from the developers. I should not complain, right? But really\, this is the worse game I have played since many years. I decided to write this to the developers and tell them that they should stop making this game, because it's horrible.- Music. Why can't I disable this? I don't like it. But it's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my ears. Just small single option to disable it, where's it?- Camera smoothing, why can't I disable this? It's annoying as hell- Small maps, 6 vs 6 or so?- Ugly mechanics, there's no option to hide- Multiplayer? Nope, just hotseat with friend, on one computerOne, freaking, huge, lie.			"

								Early days yet. I don't really know what an early access beta is supposed to look like, but I can't imagine this is it. Played the first scenario (I guess). There was no tutorial. There was no explanation of the campaign. It is quite obvious that English is a second language.  I am hoping the game will get the attention it needs I really like the concept, but right now if I could I'd ask for my money back.			"

Early Access Review
								I can't believe I paid money for this. The screen pan is really awful. Game play is far too slow. There's no way of telling whether you're damaging the enemy until a soldier dies. Remaining Action Points are virtually invisible, and there's no way to tell how many action points a move will take. the game is virtually unplayable at the moment.			"
