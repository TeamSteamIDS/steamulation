												I want to recommend this game. I really, really do. It's a refreshing style of turn-based strategy that makes you rely quite heavily on your wits and intuition. It's the sort of game where the winner is not decided by the size of their ship and its guns, but by the savvy of the player. It has a timeless style and an endearing sense of humor that tends to leave one in a good mood, even as their ships sink to the briny deep.I want to recommend this game, but I can't. The single player campaign could be beaten in a matter of hours, even at a leasurely pace, and leaves much to be desired. It was obviously designed to recieve regular attention from the developers, who seem to have forgotten it. However, the thing that really sinks this game (pun intended) is the lack of a multiplayer community. This game was made with the intention that players would faithfully and regularly play with and against each other, and although it started out that way, it never coelesced. Unless you have friends that you know also want to play this game, it's simply not worth it.			"

												This game was great. And then it ended.That's the only major issue here. This game is not for anyone who likes to play singleplayer, the entire singleplayer campaign ends after 9 missions, even though the plot is on going - and it's not a good plot anyway. *Spoilers* Giant aliens basically. The turn based system can be painful when trying to travel long distance and the interface is glitchy at times. Also not enough customisation is available. In the tutorial it shows you all your defense options, and by the end of the missions you only unlock 3/4 of them - radar remains locked even when you beat the game. This game in general just was unfinished. A disappointment tha tParadox published this.I got this on the humble bundle, otherwise I'd be really upset - it's so not worth the price unless you have friends who also own it, and then multiplayer might be fun.

												A really great trailer, that is probably what makes the game great, but after that trailer is gone the rest is just... Offline non workingess that is left.The game does its own ""check"" if you have internet connection, if it fails that it doesn't let you go online, but it is flawed.It doesn't even let you TRY to log in to their servers, nor give any useful information to you to help you troubleshoot the problem.All it takes to break this system? Exit the game after first launch, then restart it.So the multiplayer part is out of the window, the UI is very clunky and the functions aren't intuitive to use, basically a lot of saving is done, and those saves you can't use if you are in ""Offline mode"", so if you built a nice fleet it is all goners.Overall, this game is now EOL (End Of Life) but the best part about it you can enjoy for free, and that is the launch trailer.You want naval warfare you have to look at Dangerous Waters or SCS Fleet Command for something that somewhat works, but it is a dead market today with very few good ones popping up to replace the oldies.

												(Posting my unfinished draft review to warn people during the sale!) Tutorial sucks, campaign sucks, interface is awkward and forces you to do WAY too much clicking to see basic info (use mouseover, Sideshow Bob!). On sale for three bucks, it might still be worth the money if the the idea of customizable futuristic turn-based battleships appeals to you, but if you have any kind of backlog it won't be worth your TIME.

												Really cool concept, pretty good execution. If you ever played Intra Galactic Battles on your 386, this is like that but with boats. So I guess that makes it a bit like Starfleet Battles.It's like Gratuitous Space Battles (love that game still), but you have direct control over each ship, and you generally only have a fleet big enough for a few ships at a time.So before the mission, you choose hulls and equipment for every ship in your fleet, based on a predetermined total ""fleet value,"" which I imagine is calculated based on the difficulty of the mission in question. Then you micro-manage your fleet in a turn-based battle.You issue move and targetting orders per ship, or if you're really a micromanager, you issue fire orders per weapon.Cool concept, right? Well I'm happy to say that this game pullis it off smashingly. The interface takes a bit of getting used to, but the tutorial is actually VERY good. Only once did I find myself thinking ""okay... How do I do that again?"" It's very intuitive, and the missions are varied and overall the game is just fun.I give Leviathan Warships an A-. Really neat concept, nearly flawless interface, and just plain fun.			"

												It's kinda cool for half of a game.The single player is fun, but it is only 9 missions. And then there are the co-op missions that I have been playing over and over, but they will soon be a bit boring as i will have run out of different fleet customizations that I can use.Multiplayer however, is ultimately worthless. Nobody plays online anymore, and if you do find a game, most likely the people in the lobby will just be sitting there, as they have been for literally a year. I can't say anything about it cause I haven't played a game online yet, but I'm sure it is fun.One thing that annoys me is the fact that you have to create a custom fleet for EVERY SERVER you play on! That means that the ships I make on ""Leviathan 1"" server will not be on ""US Server 1"", so if you do manage to play online, than make sure you write down or remember what kind of ships and guns you had.For what I have played so far, 7.5/10. Of course I got this game and the $3.00 DLC in a weekend sale for about $3.00 total. So if you wan thsi game, wait until them unless you want to spend the $10.00.			"

												I was following this game round about the time they released an announcement trailer earlier this year, but then my attention was diverted elsewhere and completely forgot the existence of this game until the recent Humble Bundle. Leviathan is a strategic, turn-based game in which the player customises their fleet using a variety of battleships and equip them with an array of offensive and defensive add-ons. Similar to the gameplay mechanics of Frozen Synapse, the game has a planning phase during which the player assigns movement, direction of ship, aiming & attacking, deploying defensive shields and so on. The actions are then enacted in a 10 second animation.I completed the campaign in cooperative mode within 2 hours. The premise involves tackling the growing Marauder threats through escorting key vessels across the river or ocean, protecting areas of high value priority, breaking into a well-fortified bunkers, and destroying key enemy warships serving as boss encounters. Although there isn't much to the story, the key area of satisfaction becomes evident once you engage in naval combat. In terms of gameplay the game responds and plays really well, although there isn't much to the complexity. At first glimpse boss encounters may startle you a bit, but as you discover the pros and cons of individual weapons you will come to realise what works and what doesn't, leading to a more strategical approach on consecutive playthroughs. You occasionally find yourself taking on more vessels than you can handle regardless of how many cannons and railguns you have attached to your fleet, so being able to maneuver them effectively becomes second nature. Aside from the campaign, the game also serves special challenge missions such as waves, or battle against friends and strangers over a variety of maps. A tiny but fun package with plenty strategical possibilities.			"

												I like this game, actually, and will probably play it some more.  However the in-game store is broken, and neither Steam nor Paradox are supporting a viable support staff to address.  I found the message board, and my exact problem was reported over 6 months ago, with zero responses.  So be prepared to play with whatever is in the box, and the Steam DLC.  If this problem were somehow addressed, I would consider changing my recommendation.I find the game play itself to be reminiscent of the old Starfleet Battles paper game, where you plan your moves then players execute the planning together to see the results.  If you like that sort of thing, you might like Leviathan: Warships.  The game is easily accessible, as the advertising suggests (possibly the cleverest thing about the game is the video ad) and the learning curve is pretty flat before you can start dusting it up with friends whom you've also hooked into buying the game (catch it on sale! I paid $2) or against the notional campaign.As some other unanswered soul in the Leviathan support thread said, a mission editor would be nice if no other missions are forthcoming, but this looks like an abandoned game to me.

												This is a very addicting little game. In essence, the game is like chess mixed with battleship.You have a limited amount of points you can take into each round, and you have to invest them wisely. This game is not about building a fleet that will annihilate everything in its way. You have to apply strategy and you have to accept that you sometimes will have to make a sacrifice to succeed.There was one particular level that would be nearly impossible if you tried to fight your way through. The most efficient path is to equip your ships for speed and cluster them to make maximum use of shields. Only one of my ships actually made it to the end.			"

												Leviathan Warships can actually be enjoyable. Provided it doesnt crash, the game doesnt loose server-connection and youre content with the Singleplayer-campaign which, again, can be enjoyable if youre okay with basic AI and heavy scripting.This game was meant for online-multiplayer - shame though, theres noone playing this game. I would say its another victim to poor or nonexistent marketing as the first time I actually heard about this not-too-bad game from a humble-bundle which is usually a place for games which had their peak-time.Me?

MP is empty as far as I can tell.There are issues with the gameplay like ships that will fire at friendly ships frequently by accident, forcing you to micromanage, or weapon ranges that aren't even visible in the ship design screen because of a zoom level too close in.  It just comes off as something that had a lot of potential but was left unfinished.			"

												Leviathan warships is an excellent game for its price. The base ship variety is somewhat limmited, but there are three dlc packs available which all contain three new ships, raising the total amount of ship types available to 14. And even if you don't want to buy any dlc, you can customize the loadout of the ships yourself, providing an endless variety of tactics. I feel the game can be somewhat unbalanced at times, but there are still plenty of viable tactics available and some strategies that may seem overpowered at first can usually easily be countered.  The biggest problem with this game is the playerbase, or rather, lack there of. There are very few people playing this game at the time of me writing this review. It can sometimes take a very long time to get into a game. That is also the main reason i'm writing this review; to get more people to play. There is a singleplayer campaign, but it's not nearly as much fun as the multiplayer. Just as a side note, this game is also available on tablets (for much cheaper). So if that is your thing, get it there (I believe you will play on the same server as the pc version, but don't quote me on that). One last tip: in my experience most people play on the ""Leviathan 1"" server, so if you are looking for a multiplayer game, you should probably look there.p.s.Yes, Jazz Boatman does the ingame commentary, and it's awesome!

												This game had a large amount of potential, but ultimetly wound up short. A friend and I pre-ordered it, but after playing it for some time we started to feel like we were playing a half-baked game. The AI is almost non-existant, usually going straight at your ships while firing and not actually trying any other tactic. The Developers also tried to go for a multi-platform game, such that you would be able to play the same game from your computer as well as tablet. Ultimetly, they came up with a fairly bad system of implementing this by keeping all of your save data (For anything, including singleplayer) on their server. Saves on one server are not transferred to the others, so if you swictch servers you will not be able to access anything that you had on the other server. There are also 5 servers up at the moment and most likely only 5 players online.			"

												This game gets a bad rep simply for the fact that people feel it should deliver on everything a $50+ mainstream title should deliver on. It's not a AAA+ shooter, so apparently there are next to no multiplayer matches. With that said, I got this game in the hopes of playing a fun single-player campaign, and I managed to squeeze over 6 hours of fun out of it in one day because of how addictive it is. I got this as part of a bundle even though I had been eyeing it on Steam for a very long time, and quite frankly, the game delivers more than enough entertainment if all you want is turn-based strategy. The graphics still look great, the sound design is incredible with a good set of speakers, and the campaign + challenge missions should give you well over 10 hours of gameplay if you are anything like me. If you multiplayer is not as important to you as the single-player experience, this game is worth at least $10, but if you get it for under $5 with a bunch of other games, don't even question it. It really is a fun game. Just a shame I did not notice it earlier and that it did not grow into something more.			"

												This game is the most fun I've had with a strategy game in a long time. The strategy is at all levels of the game--what ship types, what guns you gave them, and what support items are all just as important as your commands in-game.Trying weird and harebrained strategies is one of the things that makes this game replayable and absolutely hilarious, whether they work or not. Watching an armada of tiny ships swarm a gargantuan battleship is hilarious no matter who wins.So buy it, play it with your friends, and have a hull of a good time.			"

												It's one of those games that I just can't play online because I feel the other guy has a spreadsheet on how to win.So as you can see, its a bit difficult when the singleplayer is so shallow. Its a cool game none the less. Just not my flavor.			"

With no support, some bugs, and very very short single player, I cannot recommend this game even thought I would like to.			"

The single player is there, but they really expect you to use single player as a tutorial so that you can play multiplayer with friends.			"

												If you want to save your progression, or play with other people, you have to create an account. This means a login and a password, which you need to retype every time. Want a strong and long password? Think twice, there is no copy/paste on the login screen. Have a password manager to remember al those long passwords for you? Won't be of any use here. It may sound as nothing, but having to memorize and to retype passwords each time you want to play your games is really a pain. Lack of user friendiness may reflect badly on a game.			"

												This game is interesting due to it gimmick of mixing turn base and real time strategy. But it broken controls (Units control was inconsistent, which would often result in units facing the wrong direction) prevented it from being fun/enjoyable.			"

												Leviathan warships makes a good effort, but there simply is no need to own this game when Frozen Synapse did it earlier and better. Ships are naturally sluggish and difficult to maneuver, which makes sense, but simply uprooting a real-world model and transplating it into a digital form does not suddenly bestow upon it a measure of enjoyment.

YouTube™ Video: Steam Cleaning - Leviathan: Warships 

			Views: 18		

			The great wars of our time were not fought on land or in the air but in and the oceans and possibly the seas. Seas that are cruel and harsh ruled by the iron fist of tactical combat.		

The great wars of our time were not fought on land or in the air but in and the oceans and possibly the seas.  Seas that are cruel and harsh ruled by the iron fist of tactical combat.Build massive warships with modern and futuristic weapons and defenses to pit against other similarly crafted ships.  Positioning and momentum play a large role in their success along with knowing the range of weapons.Leviathan: Warships lands just an inch away from greatness with it's clunky UI making it difficulty to click on just the right thing and the lack of adjustable game speed.  That said, the core mechanics are robust enough to offer a lot of fun for the effort.			"

												Within the first 30 minutes of gameplay, this product left the impression of a very laid-back product where you, as a player, can take your time and completely focus on (thoughtful) planning and execution. While this caters towards strategic thinking, it unfortunately also removes the tension of play. Controls are, for my taste, quite fiddely as well.			"

												Leviathan: Warships is a turn-based, strategic action game where players can build and customize their own fleet of warships. Play with or against your friends across multiple game modes. Team up in the co-op campaign to battle the growing Marauder threat or fight through special challenge missions with your friends. You can also go online and test your admiral capabilities against friends or foes in skirmishes on multiple maps. The fleet editor features multiple ship and weapon types which can be combined in almost any possible way. This allows players to try out a vast array of strategic possibilities.			"

												Leviathan Warships, is a promising naval strategy game that ""takes on water"" early on. Simple and uninspired GFX and color palette leave no visual impact. The turn based mechanics could be truly good if they were actually turn based. The wait periods before the game actually acknowledges your commands and executes them is slow, and the interface is lack luster and plain. No redeeming qualities to speak of. Only for extreme Naval enthusiasts, psudo-simulation gamers, and those with damage to their frontal cortex. Triple Axis Rating: Burn			"

												Server lag and horrible tutorials aside (having to commit 2 times before learning to move? seriously?) after playing in offline mode for the campaign I had a lot of fun with this game but certain aspects of the GUI design and general controls leave a bitter taste in my mouth.Let's start with rebindable controls.I appreciate the fact you gave us the use of WASD and QE for moving the camera and zooming but since I am left handed and rebind all my games controls to use the arrows (including FPS games) I find the inability to change them to be a minor annoyance.Why do I need to click and drag everything when I have 2 mouse buttons?Why can't I press 'Delete' destroy a highlighted waypoint or any previously made and redundant commands active on a ship? Why didn't you tell me that 'space' was the shortcut for commit? (I apprechiate that it's there but at least tell me about it.) Why isn't space also used to progress any dialogue on the screen instead of having to move the cursor to click the little arrow?Why can't I bind and select ships quickly with shortcut keys like 1, 2, 3, 4?Overall this game is a fair amount of fun provided you can get a game running but some basic technical oversights from being designed for tablets first and foremost leaves me unhappy.

												While I enjoyed the game, I'm afraid I can't recommend it. The gameplay is basically what you'd expect, move, aim your guns and shoot, etc. The singleplayer is fun but short and seems tacked on compared to the multiplayer, but I don't find the multiplayer very fun either (seems more restricted them SP). Let's face it, you bought this game to make a rad ship decked out with guns on every slot. Well guess what, you can't do that. At least, not unless you're willing to make do with commanding only one ship. See there's this point system in place, guns and ships cost points and you can only place as many guns/ships as your point capacity will allow. Basically this means that you'll really never be able to make that awesome fleet you always wanted to. Maybe if this game had a sandbox mode, or at least was moddable, I'd give it a recommendation, but sadly, it has neither.			"

												This is an amazingly fun tactical naval game. Play takes place in turns, planning and action. In planning mode, you can control which way your ship will turn, how fast it will move forward or backwards, and if your guns will fire or not. Guns take time to reload, which is part of the strategy, and these cooldown timers are key to how you maneuver your ship. Once you've planned out all your moves, you hit the ""commit"" button and watch all of your ships move and fire.. as do the enemies. Add to this a bunch of cool powers like directional shields, beam weapons, etc and total customability of your ships via build points pre-grame. In addition, there are several game modes, including Versus, Co-op, and Campaign. If you like tactical games and want a really fun and easy-to-learn/hard-to-master game to play with some friends, this is it.			"

Oh jeah there is a laser that can hit you at close range. Its one of the 2 smallest and weakest weapons and most of the enemy ships use one or two of them...to bore you to death. It takes up to 5 minutes to kill you. Ramming the enemy does more damage.

The ""fog of war"" element keeps you guessing about exactly where you will enounter the enemy and can lead to some painful surpirzes.  Definitely worth picking up.			"

The developers could have turned this game around if they had developed the single player side with far more depth. Like Civilization it need a balnce between the two and this is decidedly lopsided for multi player. There is no hook for this game to get you into it just a short single player campain then nothing. Also I though recently I would give this game another go and when I whent to log in to the server it wouldn't accept my password I asked for a reminder to be sent to my email but it never came and it would not let me set up a new account.

												I bought this when it was on sale, but I think this game is worth the regular $10 price. I love the turn based combat because it allows me to play at a slower pace without dumbing down actual gameplay. You still need stratagy and tactics to get through the levels. I would totally recommend this game to anyone that loves tactical battles and sexy boats.			"

												While I enjoyed the game, I'm afraid I can't recommend it. The gameplay is basically what you'd expect, move, aim your guns and shoot, etc. The singleplayer is fun but short and seems tacked on compared to the multiplayer, but I don't find the multiplayer very fun either (seems more restricted them SP). Let's face it, you bought this game to make a rad ship decked out with guns on every slot. Well guess what, you can't do that. At least, not unless you're willing to make do with commanding only one ship. See there's this point system in place, guns and ships cost points and you can only place as many guns/ships as your point capacity will allow. Basically this means that you'll really never be able to make that awesome fleet you always wanted to. Maybe if this game had a sandbox mode, or at least was moddable, I'd give it a recommendation, but sadly, it has neither.			"

												There was a lot of hype because of the way the trailer was made, but this is a fairly crappy game otherwise. It is not optimized at all. FPS is all over the place, and that's with two 7970s. The campaign was, although enjoyable, short. The other missions aren't really all that fun and not connected at all. The multiplayer is slow, and requires that you have friends who also have this game, who I don't, because I recommended they don't get this game because of reasons below. When I pre-ordered this, I expected a full product. The product I recieved was more of a demo. Because I like the way the combat system is set up, I thought I might buy the full game that they would release as DLC. I'm glad I read the descriptions of the DLC before buying. More ship shapes. That's it. I am very disapointed in this game. I expected so much out of this cool idea for a combat sytem, but it let me down. This game is just an attempt at trying to get into peoples wallets with a funny commercial. I would not recommend this game to anyone. Do not buy. Play the demo...oh wait, the demo costs $10. There is no full game. You'd be better off buying sone candy. Go do that instead. It'd be more enjoyable.You might also notice I only have 8 hours total for this game. The campaign took a solid hour. Then I tried to find some other way of enjoying it, but was only able to stand it for another 4 hours. The other 3 hours was me accidently leaving it open.			"

												A lost opportunity.If you are looking for something like Gratituous Space/Tank Battles, go on, unfortunately this is not the naval version of those games. The Campaign is short, the ships customizations are very limited (e.g.: very low number of maximum guns, you can't use extra space for anything, unlike in GSB, where you could e.g.: armor up), plus the battles are done in a weird, ""give orders for a virtual turn then try to execute it"" way.The ships can't avoid environmental hazards on the way, nor will the UI warn you of these. They will even collide, and you can't control them as one battlegroup, just individually. The maps are more so than not too narrow and too small, etc. On the flip side, it seems equally easy to lead enemies into damaging environments, e.g.: beaching them. Maybe it has some redeeming features in multiplayer, but looking at the single player side, I really doubt it. It has no replay value, a very short single player, and lots of ideas that should have been explored fully.Also, sometimes you just lose your save game.			"

Oh jeah there is a laser that can hit you at close range. Its one of the 2 smallest and weakest weapons and most of the enemy ships use one or two of them...to bore you to death. It takes up to 5 minutes to kill you. Ramming the enemy does more damage. Oh jeah and here have this limited-ammo-rocketlauncher right before the endboss...against who it is absolut useless because LIMITED AMMO. Wanna win the campain without even trying? Build ships with the smallest weapons, build them looking at the front=win the game. Even the endboss. Good thing this was 75% off or i would have been...more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥then I am at the moment.

												If comparing to other games I guess Frozen Synapse would be the closest comparison. It might be a tad bit simpler than FS but the suspense is as murdering. It's tactical awesomesauce like a delicious hot chiliburger that you have to figure out how to devour with out it killing you.It can be played single player, co-op and versus and all of those are superb. Also; this could easily be remade into a great Star Trek-game as the ships have shields and different weapons (from classic cannons to lasers) so let's hope someone mods the hell out of this.""Easy to learn - hard to master"" is an overused statement, but to those other games this is the grizzly among mice. If you like Frozen Synapse this is almost a must. If you don't - what kinda monster are you really?!			"

												The general handling of the turns and game systems were good, but the ship hulls are disappointing.  In particular there are slots for lots of guns, and an arbitrary limit on the number of weapons!  It is sad to have a hull that looks like it should be able to mount 20+ guns but be limited to 8 not because of weight or size but a fixed limit.  Also the gun reload times were not in turns but in seconds, which can sometimes be awkward.			"

												Review is based on the Campaign / Co-Op Experience:Online versus doesn't have many players as a side note.The let down:The reason I've decided to mark this as a negative recommendation is due to it's lack of content, there's only 9 missions and a handfull of challenges... and that's it. If you're looking for a single player on co-op experience to last, this isn't your game.Gameplay:Although there's only a few missions and around three of them I didn't enjoy as much as the others. I really enjoyed the gameplay, I liked the turn based combat, I liked how ships positioning was an important aspect of the game, I really liked being able to design a ship and then create a strategy for what you've created, the whole system in place is just fun, interesting and something I would honestly play more of... if there were more game to actually play.Extra:I can only hope that one day they revisit the game inbetwen projects they're developing and add in some form of map editor / campaign creation tool, I'm almost certain users would populate the lack of content in their game. (I can dream.)If you find the game on sale and want a few hours of enjoyment with friends, it's a great time. Otherwise I can't recommend a $10.00 game which has little content a small player base.(Price checker: https://www.cheapshark.com/search?q=Leviathan:_Warships )I'd also like to mention during the time me and my other 2 players were playing the game we counted for 50% of the peak players for that day ( www.steamcharts.com/app/202270 ) Which is very unfortunate for a game which could of been great.

												This is an amazingly fun tactical naval game. Play takes place in turns, planning and action. In planning mode, you can control which way your ship will turn, how fast it will move forward or backwards, and if your guns will fire or not. Guns take time to reload, which is part of the strategy, and these cooldown timers are key to how you maneuver your ship. Once you've planned out all your moves, you hit the ""commit"" button and watch all of your ships move and fire.. as do the enemies. Add to this a bunch of cool powers like directional shields, beam weapons, etc and total customability of your ships via build points pre-grame. In addition, there are several game modes, including Versus, Co-op, and Campaign. If you like tactical games and want a really fun and easy-to-learn/hard-to-master game to play with some friends, this is it.			"

The developers could have turned this game around if they had developed the single player side with far more depth. Like Civilization it need a balnce between the two and this is decidedly lopsided for multi player. There is no hook for this game to get you into it just a short single player campain then nothing. Also I though recently I would give this game another go and when I whent to log in to the server it wouldn't accept my password I asked for a reminder to be sent to my email but it never came and it would not let me set up a new account.

												Very fun turn based strategy game that translates into multiplayer co-op and versus modes quite well. Campaign mode is a bit short but for such a cheap title that is forgivable. Hopefully they will add more to it in the form of DLC or perhaps integrate Steam Workshop so players can create content for themselves.  I got it for $1 along with the Humble Bundle but this game is worth paying full price if you have to (especially if you have friends to play it with). Buy now.			"

												This is an amazingly fun tactical naval game. Play takes place in turns, planning and action. In planning mode, you can control which way your ship will turn, how fast it will move forward or backwards, and if your guns will fire or not. Guns take time to reload, which is part of the strategy, and these cooldown timers are key to how you maneuver your ship. Once you've planned out all your moves, you hit the ""commit"" button and watch all of your ships move and fire.. as do the enemies. Add to this a bunch of cool powers like directional shields, beam weapons, etc and total customability of your ships via build points pre-grame. In addition, there are several game modes, including Versus, Co-op, and Campaign. If you like tactical games and want a really fun and easy-to-learn/hard-to-master game to play with some friends, this is it.			"

												Leviathan: Warships is a enjoyable turn-based strategy game, emphasis on turn-based part as many of the current reviews reflect that reviewer was looking for a real-time strategy game when he/she purchased Leviathan. Instead the game speed would best be described as peaceful, therefore if you are the sort of person that can’t wait a few minutes for your turn then this probably isn’t the game for you.Total Score: 3.5 out of 5 battleships.

												There's no way to chose the deficulty level and there always seems to be more enemies than what your ships can actually handle. Thought that this would be a fun ship strategy game, it is not. If you're looking into this game, don't get it, if you you absolutely want it, just wait until it's on sale. Not worth the full price.			"

												I bought this game and really wanted to like it, but couldn't. Everyone talks about the potential of the game, and I see it too, but it got lost fast. The online community of PvP is dead and was dead when I bought it not long after launch. There is not enough missions to make single player worth it, and worst of all, half the items are still locked by the end of it. Then there is the issue with just getting the thing to run, it takes like three logins to get it to run and go online. Did I forget to mention bad missions and no story line?			"

												Right now I've only played the single player. Once I've completed all the missions, the multiplayer mishaps will begin.Leviathan: Warships was surprisingly easy to jump into: the simple commands and clean interface allow for strategy to come to the fore. The movement system creates the feel of a tabletop game, as well as giving you the amount of seconds it will take you to get to the destination.With around 10-15 different weapons and add-ons you can bolt to your ship, there is a strategy here as well, rather than relying on a myriad of weird weapons. It also means the game is much easier balanced, as each weapon has its obvious strengths and weaknesses.I hear the multiplayer is fantastic, and I recommend picking up a copy next time it comes on sale.And downsides?The networking is the worst implementation of server connection I have ever seen. If the game can't connect when you launch the game, there is no ""re-try"" button. The game must be exited and relaunched. However, this isn't such a bad thing as it launches in a swift 10-15 seconds. Also, your saves, replays, ships and stats are all per-server, which just simply sucks. However, if you stick to one server, you'll be fine and dandy. There is also an offline, and again that has its own separate saves etc.But don't let that put you off! Really, this game is jazz-a-listic.			"

												This game was very fresh and new and it was amazing....... for a couple hours and then the story missions were over. Then I tried to go to the Multiplayer and there was nothing at all. As cool as this game was, its a farce, as the game is dead and has been for a long time.Because the solo campaign is so short and the fact that the MP is dead I cannot recomend this game at all.DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!

												Review is based on the Campaign / Co-Op Experience:Online versus doesn't have many players as a side note.The let down:The reason I've decided to mark this as a negative recommendation is due to it's lack of content, there's only 9 missions and a handfull of challenges... and that's it. If you're looking for a single player on co-op experience to last, this isn't your game.Gameplay:Although there's only a few missions and around three of them I didn't enjoy as much as the others. I really enjoyed the gameplay, I liked the turn based combat, I liked how ships positioning was an important aspect of the game, I really liked being able to design a ship and then create a strategy for what you've created, the whole system in place is just fun, interesting and something I would honestly play more of... if there were more game to actually play.Extra:I can only hope that one day they revisit the game inbetwen projects they're developing and add in some form of map editor / campaign creation tool, I'm almost certain users would populate the lack of content in their game. (I can dream.)If you find the game on sale and want a few hours of enjoyment with friends, it's a great time. Otherwise I can't recommend a $10.00 game which has little content a small player base.(Price checker: https://www.cheapshark.com/search?q=Leviathan:_Warships )I'd also like to mention during the time me and my other 2 players were playing the game we counted for 50% of the peak players for that day ( www.steamcharts.com/app/202270 ) Which is very unfortunate for a game which could of been great.

UPDATE May '16: Their servers are pretty much down so multiplayer is out of the question, would not recommend at this time. Game itself was good.It's a fun game, and I've got a lot of mileage from it after having just paid five bucks. Campaign is short and fairly easy, the last mission is not well designed though.Challenge modes are quite difficult, and I'm not sure if they're properly balanced. There are other logical flaws with the game. The Commonwealth fleets are tiny, and while the number of enemies in the campagin is sensible, in challenge mode you wonder how the enemy navies have so many disposible people.I've yet to try a versus game, but coop is nice and works well. No connection issues, and games resume smoothly.EDIT:PvP is quite fun, so if you have at least 3 people willing to play a turn based naval combat game, i'd say go for it,			"

												I would love to recommend this game.  It has good game mechanics, the combat is fun, and can be challenging.HOWEVER, the game is not complete.  It only has 9 missions, even though from the dialog it's obvious they meant to add more, but just couldn't be bothered.  Not only that but the same ships from the campaign are different in multiplayer so you can't use the same designs.  There is no way to fix this, unfortuately since you can't mod the game.  Even worse is the interface, which constantly gets in the way of doing things (I blame mobile for this), but the last straw really comes down to not only is the game unfinished, but they want to charge you to make it slightly less unfinished with the DLC, which doesn't finish the campaign!!!  WTF!!!I personally feel that it should be illegal to pull the♥♥♥♥♥♥Paradox is pulling with this.			"

												The game feels only partially finished.  It has slow mechanics, clunky gameplay, and it seems overly difficult to make the ships do what I want. I'm slowly figuring it out, but it's not much fun so far. The biggest flaw seems to be the auto-targetting... it should be a simple concept to be able to decide which cannons shoot at which ships, but not so in this game.Also I can't even register for online play, so I assume it doesn't even exist anymore. I only paid a couple bucks and had really low expectations, and even so I can't recommend the game.			"
