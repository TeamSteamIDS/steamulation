												I played this game for awhile on multiple worlds, and while it was sort of fun while it lasted, in the end the game isn't worth it.The game is nothing but a ""Pay to Win"" game.Whether it's buying more cards or buying Premium Tokens, both give very big unfair advantages.To even keep up with many other players in the worlds, you will need to spend bunch of actual money to progress, otherwise you will lose fast.Despite my game time, i give this a ""Not Reccomended"" to save you the 100's upon 1000's of hours you would waste on it, only for some pay to win person to raze or capture all your villages, thus making you start all over.I should have said this before, but this is basically a Facebook Game, on Steam.Many people are correct for saying that too.---------------------------------Review Update:---------------------------------Also, i'd like to add unless you join a brand new world the moment it's active, it will be extremely hard to get far on it.You can use cards you aquired from other worlds in the new world, which is 1 way people stock up to get very far in new worlds.And, usually within the first 48 to 72 hours, people will be already Rank 14 to 16 (or higher), and start taking over major parts of the world, making factions, join big houses, and conquer large areas.Then if they move to your area, some may bully you to give up your Parish(es), or may even capture/raze your villages, just to clear you out so you don't vote for somebody else.(The above happened to me a few times on multiple worlds.)Also, the game has an ""Inactive"" system. Info below (Copied from wiki)A village will be automatically abandoned when a player hasn't played or is dormant for a specific period of time; this time is dependant upon which rank they have reached. The higher the rank, the longer it takes for the village to become abandoned. If a premium token is in play at the time of going inactive, the player's account (and therefore, their village) will remain active until the premium token runs out. More Info on days here: http://help.strongholdkingdoms.com/index.php/FAQ:Your_village#What_happens_with_inactive_players.3FSo basically, depending on your rank, if you don't sign on  after xx many of days (whether you forget, internet is down, computer is broken, etc.), ALL VILLAGES you have in that world will be deleted.Now, you will keep your same rank along with all you researched, but you will have to start over with only 1 village.And even if you restart, there is a low chance you can be placed in the same area you were previously located.And people that downvote this Review, are most likely the ""Pay to Win"" or ""Bully"" people I mentioned. Don't let them sucker you into thinking it's not pay to win.They most likely want more people to attack, so they can gain honour faster as well as maybe get free villages that you did the work setting up, but they take the rest.---------------------------------Review Update 2:---------------------------------To the people that either ""question"" why I played over 1,800+ hours in a game to not recommend it, ask yourself this:""Do you count all the hours you play of an MMO (game) you play?""The answer most likely is no.Playing one of those, can also EASILY add 100's upon 1000's of hours too.Keep in mind, the gametime spans across about 1Â½ years.This game has MANY different worlds.I originally started in World 5 where I met people and joined a guild, we tried to also start in new worlds as they opened.To keep it short, in World 6 when it opened up, there were many trolls, House members (H10 and H16) took over the area, capturing villages including mine, without warning.Me along with alot of other people gave up on that world, as there was not really any way to keep progressing.Many of them go far due to they gained rank fast with saved up cards.World 7 didn't go any better when introduced.Within 48 to 72 hours the Leaders of the House, had already been Rank 19+ .I think they had like 6+ villages by then.This was a combindation of ""Pay to Win"" and they were beta world 7 players, whose rank didn't get reset.By the time World 8 started, i didn't even bother to try for it, since i knew the outcome would be the same as World 6 and 7.World 5 was fine for awhile, but then House 1 went for World Wide Domination (which they succeeded).Again they bullied everybody to vote for them so they could take our Country and County.Most of the house leaders was in the Top 100, insanely high rank/stats/villages/troops/production/etc.Even after the World got sent to the ""2nd Age"", it didn't make a different.They just regrouped (under a new house i think) and took over the world again.I didn't even stick around to find out what happened next. I heard in ""3rd Age"" it happened again.It was like ""what's the point of playing anymore?""No matter what you try, you can't win when the enemy guilds have like 3x the villages you have (and that's PER Guild Member).They most likely have dozens upon 100's of Vasseled Armies.Each Vasseled Army = 500 Troops.As quoting the computer Joshua from WarGames, ""The only winning move is not to play"" which is sadly very true.Don't waste the time and frustration i did trying to play this game.And I just ignore all trolls STILL Questioning on gametime.Had i played like 10 hours, they would b!tch because i didn't play long enough.But I have over 1,800 and now that's considered ""too much""?---------------------------------------Reasons it's Pay to Win---------------------------------------Source Info: http://help.strongholdkingdoms.com/index.php/FAQ:Premium_AccountYou can spend money to buy Premium Tokens and Card Packs in the game.Card Packs (depending on what pack it is) will give you 5 random cards per pack.Premium Tokens let you do things that you can't do unless you buy one.(The following are for when online)First is Building Queue. This lets you in EACH village set it up to add 4 more buildings to a queue to be built next. Default it's only 1 building at a time, so you will have to be on to place the next building without a token.In the beginning it's not that big of deal, but later in the game when buildings take hours upon hours, it GREATLY helps.Move Builds - This is by far the 2nd biggest reason. The ability to MOVE your buildings you place anytime you want. By default you can't move then. If you place a building in the wrong spot, tough.You have to delete it, wait like 5 to ?? minutes (depends if you are deleting other buildings also) just to build it again, wasting resources.Research Queue - This is the biggest reason. In the beginning it won't that big of deal, but later in game when you're higher rank, research time takes longer and longer.Prince Rank, it took me up to 18 HOURS+ for each research.By default, you can only research 1 thing, no queue. This adds 4 more to the queue to auto research.Research plays a key role in the game, so that's why it's important.(Troop health, what units you unlock, what you can build for castle, food, etc.)Village Overview - Never used it. It's just more of a convenience to see each village production/stats.(The following will activate once every two (2) to four (4) hours when you're not logged in.)Auto Trading - Game will auto trade food to your parish, depending on the % you set it to.Auto Scouting - Auto Sends out scouts to stashes for you.Auto Attack - Auto Attack targets (Wolves, Bandit Camps, AI, etc).Auto Recruiting - Lets you recruit troops automatically (assuming you have gold and enough weapons).Crowns (In-Game Currency, costs actual money)http://help.strongholdkingdoms.com/index.php/Firefly_CrownsYou can read about crowns in the above link.

												This is one of the best online strategy games with a great combination of strategy, tactics and politics, but (and this is where I agree with so many of the other reviews) the balance of the game is so extraordinarily in favor of the buying-system it is basically unplayable without spending a lot of money.The problem is that there is no limit on the usage of the cards in the game. The more cards you have, the more troops you have, the faster they move and the stronger they are. You win by spending money -period-			"

												Ah, Bothold Kingdoms.Because people play using bots and dual accounts so I made a funny! :DOkay whatever, I fire myself! I have fired myself.Stronghold is like a lot of pay2win/free2play games built on the shoulders of a franchise that used to be great.The original games were about you building a castle while surviving all sorts of nasty things trying to rip your castle down and harm your villagers.Kingdoms takes that concept to the next level! Now you have to defend against other humans trying to attack you and you get to attack them too! It's great fun. Yeah that's right, I said fun. Where it falls apart is that as is the norm for games of these types everything takes a very long time to build or  do...Unless you are willing to pay cash money.Paying gives you an insane advantage over your fellow human players...At first! You see these games are played out in 'seasons' and seasons are about 4 months so if you don't join the choo-choo train immediately at the start of the season then the boundries have been drawn, alliances between players made and attacking anybody will get your castle DESTROYED!So the thing you want to do in a PvP game, which is participate in PvP, you can't do because when your castle is destroyed it can take you either lots of months and the season will be over or cost you lots of real life cash so pick your poison.Outside of the PvP you get to build your kingdom. That's, fun? I guess? You get to pick where a garden goes? And you get to plant some quarries? Yay? Yeah the city building is shallow and boring but you will spend most of your time doing that firstly because you need too since you need the resources to actually build your castle and secondly because you very rarely get to attack players due to them all banding together to rub out anyone who opposes their rulership.While that is true to history there are plenty of better games that are historically accurate and FUN. The PvP gimmick is fun when you get to partake in it but the rest of the experience is boring or financially costly.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												The game is not made for new players, the worlds are unfriendly and you will get nowhere due to the high ranking people around you destroying your village. But the developers of a much loved series (gone bad with this MMO) have given you a chance, all you have to do is give in to their micro transactions. I dont see why they cant have a one off payment for the game, up front, like any other game, instead of implementing a pay to win system. What could be a truly wonderful game is ruined by the fact that you can pay to beat the system.Do not download, regret will swallow your mind.			"

I just love politics, but I was with the strongest group on the server so politics ended up being total domination. Our factions had people that spent thousands of dollars on the game and played 16 hours a day. How do you beat people like that?			"

												After more than 400 hours on steam and at least 500 hours out of steam, I can write a review.This is one of the most interesting games I've ever played. I hate it and love it at the same time. Community is friendly towards new players, especially when you find someone from your country. They are willing to help, by giving you resources, tips on how to defend, what troops to use etc. Gameplay is good, a bit slow at start, but good.But, I still cannot recommend it, because it is P2W game. People who buy cards and tokens will absolutely destroy all others. Freeroamers can survive for some time if they work together, but eventually they'll crack. I was in an really good and friendly faction where no one was buying cards, and we held for some time. Then we declared war on p2w guys. We had sent about 50 timed attacks on one village and we lost, because he was using cards to defend. After that they just devastated our faction.Apart from that, game is really addictive and fun, but P2W aspect ruined it. Yes I am still playing it, and I can't tell you why, because I don't know myself. Don't let this game to eat your soul, you will lose it forever.			"

Now? It's really, really unbalanced. People who are the most powerful usually buy cards to make their armies & castles stronger. And the people who don't buy those stuff just get downed by those who do. But if you ask me, you can still have fun with this game. BUT again in the end, i can't really recommend this.			"

												TL;DR: If you are looking for a F2P MMO Strategy game, ignore SHK and use a search engine.FYI: I have played this game way much more than 290+ hours in total. 290+ hours is my gameplay time in Steam only. My total gameplay time must be over 1k+ hours, I played in 3 ingame-worlds and I was level 22 (Prince). Yes, i am retired. This game had awesome mechanics, probably the best mechanics you could see in a MMO game. I played it for months without getting bored, it was really fun-- killing, upgrading, capturing, scouting, expanding, producing, destroying, gathering, researching... You can multiple the fun if you are playing with your friends! Organizing, Raidcalls, supporting gets more meaning with coop-like multiplayer. You may spend your time in joy.This went very well until I witnessed something, I discovered later something in game...There is ""cards system"" (yeah, it is obvious) and the cards are making this game PVP-unplayable if you don't buy them.*Rating: Free to Play 3/10Rating: Pay to Play 4/10*Rating: Pay to Win 6/10* Paying is not balanced also. If you pay more, you should keep paying more so that you will get more power. So, this is a very big problem. If you never buy or stop buying, gameplay suddenly drops speed, and  in this game, time is everything!Even EA would make this a more-playable game. "

												Im going to save you a lot of time.The game has leadership roles where you control a province or a county etc and tax below you, but youl never get to anything besides a parish (a couple people and some repeat inactives who dont count)There are groups of people who use outside communication and know eachother from repeatedly playing over and over. They spend a bunch of money and put one of their people in, in pretty much every area... and you will never be accepted into their group, its not as inclusive as something like Evony was years ago when I played that, the leadership communicate outside the game and they use the in game system to exclude everyone else.So you will never be of any consequence unless you spend a ton of money for recognition from other players.. and even then, its a total waste... youl join a group, that group will be made just for people like you.. to exclude you from leadership or any decision making, you wont even hear this stuff talked about, it takes a long time and several games before you realize that every group you join dies off by outside forces you were told to keep your nose out of and that even if you see a massive problem thats about to destroy the whole group of hundreds of people, no one will listen and they will turn on you if you try to help them... the other thing is, you begin to realize that every single group at its head is composed of disgusting people, they are terribly selfish and arrogant, intolerable as company or companions. The scum really does rise to the top, in this game.All they want is for you to shut up and to be their slave, it really is like a feudal government system where if you dont know anyone in power right now, youre just going to be a slave for those who do.Really, find a different game, the new worlds that start are almost immediately taken over by these types of people I talk about.. extremely arrogant and unskilled wallet warriors abusing cheesy mechanics and exclusionary tactics.I also dont have 5000 hours.. and its a game where you are supposed to leave it running almost all the time to keep watch on whats happening.

												I'll skip listing personal experiences and simply offer a quick list of pros and cons. Pros:- Throwback to Stronghold Crusader's glory days.- Brilliant combination of casual Farmville and more modern RTS games.- Endless depth.- Strategy genre enthusiasts will be amused.Cons:- Obvious freemium business model. FireFly is apathetic to its drawbacks.- Plan to play with family? Don't. You'll need to spend significant amounts of money to interact in-game, aside from joining the same faction and/or engaging in chain messages.- FireFly doesn't screen for alt accounts. As long as they get their money, players are essentially free to do whatever they please, which leads to an awful lot of treachery and deception (in turn offering unfair advantages).- Bans and suspensions are extremely infrequent. One player, reported by me, spammed several parish message boards with profanity, hate speech, and other vulgar material. He hasn't missed a day since.- This game takes an inane amount of time to progress and is far too reliant on cash investment or alliances for sustainability.- Speaking of alliances, players will find themselves thrust into the middle of warring factions or houses early on, unless they are fortunate enough to align themselves with well-off, high-ranking neutral players (who are far and few between).- Politics can be fun, but it ultimately leads to drama and senseless wasting of time. You think Facebook is dramatic? Try SHK on for size.- As each World progresses into a new Age, those worlds waste away into agonizing oblivion, later to be controlled by players who were previously shunned or spent far too long on the bottom rung and now desire to be worshipped.After investing over 3,600 hours into this game, I feel qualified enough to offer a resounding ""No"" to the question of whether or not I would recommend this game. While I cannot deny the amount of fun I've had, in SHK, the bad most assuredly outweighs the good. If you have ample cash to spend, time to invest, and love persistent drama, this is the game for you. Otherwise, grab yourself a copy of Stronghold Crusader and put together a LAN party with some friends.* Edit(s) for typos.			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is without doubt a complex, unique and interesting game, mostly due to the wide range of interaction possibilities between players, that usually become more and more important the more you get into the game. But is it also a good game, that I would recommend to my friends and such? We will see.When starting as a new player you will mostly be excited about all the cool researches that you can unlock, about the ranking up and village polishing, that will keep you busy and entertained at the same time. The game does quite well at that, and manages to introduce you into all the different aspects one after another, which keeps you motivated without overdemanding you. However, it can be said that the longer you play, that these things become less and less important. Researching and ranking up will become slower and slower and less interesting, and you will most likely start to see the computer generated castles and attacks more as an annoyance, than as a welcome gameplay element. And then once you kinda got over that ""PvE"" content of the game, you will see that the ""PvP"" is all that matters.And there we go allready: despite some short noob protection time, that covers up your villages for 3-5 days right after spawn/purchase, you are ALLWAYS in PvP mode, so to say. And there is basically no way to disable it. You build your villages on a wide, open map, protect it with some simple castle structures within a fairly limited area, but no matter if you are currently taking part in a fight and staring at your screen like a maniac, or instead sleeping/busy with school, work, whatever/or simply not ONLINE (how dare you!?), you can be attacked from everyone, at any time, and from every place on the map! This game never stops, it just goes on and on, no matter if you like it or not. Combine that with the extremely fast army speeds, and you get a really really bad mixture allready. While playing within a medieval setting, the game doesn't let armies march somewhere, instead it sends them ""flying"" across the map, with the speed of a jet plane. You aren't online between the few minutes/hours of attack launch and arrival? Then say ""bye bye"" to your village. Stronghold Kingdoms in that matter can be an extremely fast and unforgiving game, and will play a lot like a RTS game, where units get moved around quickly to strike at enemy weak spots, or simply roll them over with some more armies, in case the defence is good. That could be a fun thing then, but as said this game is pretty UNIQUE, and so the outcome is pretty weird: fights slow down or stop completely, when both sides are online and aware. Like it normally is the case with any other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. But they can heat up up until total annihilation, when it turns out that one side is NOT online, and the enemy finds out about that.Even that, you could say, is no problem since you then just have to take it as bad luck, get yourself together and move on, in case you were on the receiving end. Building new villages, gathering forces, then strike back. But at this exact point, the game turns out to be terribly broken, and  this aspect then is the thing that seriously ruins the ""PvP"" experience in a whole. Because if you think rebuilding is as fast and easy as attacking, then you are wrong. It's not.Building or rebuilding a village in Stronghold Kingdoms is slow. Very slow. It takes around one month(!) to build up a full castle from scratch (with full research!), and even longer to do the same with the village part, that belongs to each castle. While placing buildings at first is easy and fast (in case you manage to supply the new village with ressources), the building speed becomes slower and slower the more buildings you placed allready. A mechanics that you normally just find in browser games. The castle building time as such means allready that you will be without proper defence for at least some weeks, but the village building speed basically tops that all and guarantees for a really slow recovering after successfull enemy attacks. Get razed within seconds, then build up again for months. Well, bad luck there, I guess you better should have stayed awake that night. :)Basically you are an idiot, for building up on your own, that's what the game tells you. But seeing that the attack option where villages get deleted completely is the most widely used variant, you might want to agree that at least someone has to do it at some point. Those people will then get insulted as ""farmers"", but truth is that they are the only ones that keep fighting gameplay alive, since they are the ones that supply the material on which wars can get fought on.So overall this can be said about Stronghold Kingdoms: It's a slowly starting, and even in later gameplay mostly also slowly playing medieval-styled game, that sadly counters this  slow and repetitive build-up part with a very fast and unforgiving wreck-down part, and therefor fails to balance out these two important core gameplay mechanics. The only thing that may keep you going at the end are the various friends and allies that you meet over time...putting the gameplay itself aside, the game offers you a lot of pretty well made communication possibilities then, with ingame forums, a private message system, and (sadly rarely used) ingame live chatrooms. You can then moan together with your friends about the plonker that just destroyed your good, fully built village over night for no good reason within 5 minutes, and maybe gather together for a just as merciless counterattack. But that, seriously, isn't half as entertaining as it may sound like. ;) So go and try out the game (it's free, after all...), have some fun with it, but watch out for the possibly unbalanced and unfair end-game part, that will mostly either bore you to death, stomp you into the ground completely, or offer you an uncertain thing inbetween those 2 options.

												I have played this game much more than 1000+ hours in total. . I am crown prince. I have played in 3 ingame worlds with my friends and now i am playing on mir 1,also i am creator of Stronghold Kingdoms Georgian Community on Facebook. It has more member than other Stronghold Kingdom (world) groups. I think Stronghold Kingdoms is one of the best online strategy game, its realy fun,(2x fun with friends  ) but... BUT its P2W. There is a card system, u need to buy cards couse the more cards you have, u are faster, stronger and e.t.cSo cant recommend it (yet).			"

												Learn from my mistakes. This is pay2win in it's full glory. Spending enough money you can have instant resources, buildings and castles completed (all instant), research? Yep, instant too. You can literally dump 1000's of $$$ in it and you won't even notice be4 it's too late (provided you have that kind of money).And if you play without paying you progress so slow that it's plain boring and people who invest money will always be able to beat you, even when you've lvled up to some decent ranks.I'm fine with pay2win in general, but the main trick in this particular game is the card system. You can't just go and buy best cards for fixed price - you buy only decks, that give you a chance to get those cards. You can buy lots of regular and some rare cards, but the best stuff is this ""chance"", in other words - prepare your wallet.Other than that game is simply too addictive in a bad way - if you want to be someone in it, you HAVE to stay online, to check on your stuff all the time, to send troops, scouts, trade, attack enemies, defend your villages, it's all very time consuming.In conclusion, you can compare it to Travian, if you know what I mean..Look at my time played and think for a moment - I know what I'm talking about.Well first 100 hours of gameplay were ""I hope it's worth it"", game promotes you to pay for cards from the start. There's even a ""quest"" to do that in order to be able to get 1 random free card each 24 hours (not much, but better than nothing too).Anyway, why I spent so much time? Because, after you dump some cash on the game you'd probably feel stupid to just leave it, you know? Trying to give it a chance.. but it sucks money like a vacuum cleaner. And I've seen players that spend so much on it it's crazy - for example, saw a guy that was under attack, his village were to be destroyed, but he didn't want it so bad he rebuilt everything with cards all the time, while armies were still marching towards him - all got destroyed except for the last timed attack when he either gave up or money enened, I bet on the last.With cards you can get instant troops, instant resources, instant buildings, even instant towers and walls in your castle, but you have to spend tons of cash. Even if you don't - there are people out there who do, and they totally own the place and dictate you their rules and you won't be able to do much.			"

												This game, this game is so much fun to play if you've got time to waste. It's like farmville on crack.The thing is, it's ridicously unbalanced. Cards that can be bought give you significant advantages. Probably one of the biggest being able to manage your villages while youre not online.The thing is, if you don't pay, you really dont get to play.The boosts (cards) in this game that people buy give people an unbalanced benefit.XP boosts (so you can expand faster and have more power)Build time reduction (no joke, castles can take weeks of real time to build) A que, (yeup you can only build one thing at  time if you dont pay)peasant management while youre not in game. (basically peasants come in at set intervals depending on happiness, they're either assigned to your army or a vacant building to do a job, however you have to do this manually if you're not paying thus peasants tend to build up while you're not playing)there's probably more that i'm missing but these ones are probably the most noteable.I've seen people who have bought cards who grow 3-4 times faster than i can.You can get cards for free...at times, but those cards will run out fast, and if you're not acquiring new ones you will fall behind.I have over 700 hours in this game, and yet i cant recommend it.

												At first, this game may seem quite fun and interesting. However, in a short matter of time becomes an immense time sink.  Thats just the beginning of the problems with this game.   SHK is a ptw game with a rather cancerous community.  I had met some nice people, but the amount of backstabbing, scheming elitism that goes with this game is horrendous.  If you are just starting out, be prepared to be run over repeatedly.  Also the fact that practically any castle build can be cracked wide open with a single attack makes no sense and makes the time you took to build your castles pointless.  And in SHK, it is conciderd ""tactical"" by the community of ""pros"" to attack someone when they are not online due to the fact that you can buy cards that can be used when online to help defend. SO after spending weeks, months of building villages and expanding, you can wake up one morning and find it all gone. Or if your lucky , maybe just a few of your villages will be captured or destroyed, along with a letter from someone telling you if you decide to try and do something about it, they will just send their entire faction of trolls after you.  If you are retired and have all the time and money to burn on a pointless game, give it a shot.  If not, stay away from this pile of $#!t.			"

												This game has the worst 'community' of any game I've ever played and one of the most blatantly Pay-to-Win... though it might not be as obvious to new players.Basically you can buy expendable cards that serve like ammunition in the form of massive buffs or just straight-up instant repair, build, or troop recruitment.  Not only does real money buy you power & time, there's no cooldown or limit on how MANY cards you can play. It may be an incredibly expensive P2W but there are no restrictions on how far your wallet can take you other than how deep it is.At top of that, they keep making new servers, spreading the playerbase thinner and thinner because the big spenders like to buy their way into world domination ASAP in new worlds, so the devs feed the wallet-warriors what they want while every other reasonable person has to suffer.STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME.

												Over 2000 hours played ended up with 5 billion honor, 24 million gold, and 6 million faith, along with 40 villages and being in the top 10 on the server for various things so stuck with it more than many, enjoyed the empire building aspect for some time, until vacation mode* (ability to protect your village from attack and disable all your production while you're away for work, school, sick, etc) was taken away and game became increasingly impossible to prevent complete destruction of all work due to extremely broken / exploited game mechanics.  (*You cannot use vacation mode unless you pay to use it -vacation mode is temporary, so you must have an active Coin to use it, and Coins cost RL cash.)Each new age brings with it changes which further break and increase the damage that can be caused by the game breaking exploits, making it easier and easier for players to lose all spent cash in an instant to any one player using the exploits.  Every building, resource, and almost all actions take time, and all of these can be lost from the heavily unbalanced system of pvp.There is zero positive admin activity and the fact that you can lose all work overnight with zero recourse, I would not recommend spending time, or money, on this game.It's a pay to win, lose everything instantly (including the money you spent on the game) while you sleep, soulless game that if you spend any length of time on, can be lost within an hour.  There is next to zero game balance and all ingame work is destructible. It is World of Tanks Gold ammo but FAR worse.  Card packs are temporary, and buffs are even more so, next to none lasting more than 23 hours.  The towns or armies they are used on can be taken out of the game, and there is no lasting aspect of the game except technology, gold, and honor, which leads to only one long-term plan for pvp, which is griefing using the aforementioned broken and easily exploitable ingame mechanics.If the game was re-balanced to provide permanent cards you bought, but used cool-downs instead of just disappearing, then this game might be worth TRYING.I do not recommend this game.If you like this game, or want to like this game, I would recommend Clash of Clans app.  It's easily more fun than any one of the seconds in the over 2000 hours I've played Stronghold Kingdoms, and hasn't cost me anything. interestingly, even if you spend money on this game and play for a long time, your work can all disappear due to inactivity.  This is standard for games like this, but when you account for real life, and the degree of pay to win this game is, this should be taken into account if you want to try the game. "

												This game COULD have been really good, but there are a lot of problems.-I'm aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥so everyone hates me-The size of the settlements is super small which requires you to blob like France in EU4-You can't blob because all the well-established rich players have gotten all the village spots-I understand that F2P games need some sort of income, but the amount of ""Pay to Win"" on this is ridiculous. You need to pay to use vacation mode? Seriously? If I am going on holiday in a place with no internet access and no access to my computer and I don't pay you sons of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es money then all my stuff will get raided? Thanks.-Talking of Pay to Win, it uses a Clash of Clans style of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ttery where people who pay can queue the construction of their buildings, which should be a normal game feature, which means that normal players have to eat up their time and come on CONSTANTLY. Great job. Way to take 90% of the challenge out of the game for rich people - oh wait, rich people only have a 10% challenge all of the time anyway-Everyone I have met is so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ toxic-They need to crack down on hackers moreHowever, there are some good points.-As far as I am aware, this is the first game of its kind, so it has originality on its side-Nice constantly evolving entirely player-made politics and economies-Uhhh.... um... crap. Nothing else.Now some suggestions:-If they just made it so you pay for the base game rather than pay to win, it would be amazing. I would happily pay like Â£10 for this game and play it if they removed all the P2W features-If they added in actual control to sieges like in the original Stronghold, it would be amazing-If two hostile armies crossed each other then there should be a battle-It should take less time to build things-Don't make the terrain of villages selectable, it should be static depending on the village's location - so only coastal villages can have salt, etc.-Add in ports, which are valuable trade places and armies need to pass through them before crossing seas. If a hostile player owns the port, you cannot use it and need to capture it first. This would add in a lot more conflict to the game-Dear God, MAKE IT SO EVERYONE CAN QUEUE CONSTRUCTIONS!And because I left this game open for a long time, mostly by accident, this is creating a 140-hourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥stain on my games list. Thanks.			"

												I've been part of stronghold kingdoms since it's early alpha stages, back when there were only a few of us and we all knew each other like neighbors. Therefore I can say that this game is a massive waste of your time.I see innovation here - a lot of it. I see opportunities to play stronghold like never before, with an MMO idea all taking place on a large map where cooperation and diplomacy are key to victory in the world of thousands of players all with their own individual strongholds they too are building. The game still has all the customization that stronghold offered you as well, placing the walls, towers, gatehouses, moats, spikes, and more all wherever you want to. It also gives you the freedom to train and manually deploy your own troops both defensively in your castle and/or offensively to siege another. In fact, at the time I began testing this game and for some time afterwards, it was unbelievably fun. But since then it's been squashed into a payment-heavy hunk of crap. ""Cards"" in the game are used to boost what you can do with no limit to how many you can use, as long as you can afford to spend real world money to get them. On top of that, you require to buy premium subscriptions just to play the game properly, or you'll be logging in every hour to do something when nothing queues up properly. Cards can be earned for free, yes, but they take a long time and are fully randomized. You can earn more for free per week, but that is locked behind not one, but TWO paywalls of buying subscriptions to the game. You must buy TWO subscription tokens in order to unlock the full range of cards. On top of that, cards can still be bought with REAL WORLD MONEY after you ALREADY had to spend REAL WORLD MONEY on buying a PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION just to play the game properly. This is massively unbalanced and, as is common among MOBILE COW CLICKERS, can take you from the bottom of the pack to #1 on the leaderboard in a matter of minutes should you pay enough money. Nobody will, but the fact that it is a possibility means the game is massively unbalanced. Any game that makes it possible to advance from bottom to top within minutes cannot be considered free to play.Outside of that, the game itself is barebones. Your castle management becomes minimal, as the tiny map areas and massively limited resources for each ""village"" means you will not be able to customize the village to look as you please, it's going to have to run for maximum efficiency, followed by waiting through timers and resource walls as you wait for enough resources or an open queue slot to continue. This game also has an issue of expansion, due to the extreme number of players - castles/villages can only be built on predetermined slots, and the number of people in the game makes it very difficult to expand peacefully without spending an absolute fortune of gold and leaving your new towns well outside your support range. Production lines are also removed now, with the only actual production being from wood/iron -> weapons. That's it. All other production chains, no matter how simple, have been ditched. To help slow you down, each time you build something, it raises its own construction cost and also increases the time required to build the next structure. So, don't go too fast - buy ourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥instead!This game offers so much room for innovation in the stronghold series. It makes me want to see a stronghold game taking place on a large meta-map managing multiple castles against various AI opponents or players doing similar things, but not in this fashion. I want to see it in a microtransaction-free, upfront paid game with no multi-day timers or subsctipitions or â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t like that. This franchise NEEDS innovation, and the ideas behind stronghold kingdoms if applied to a paid game could provide it. But this just isn't it. All it does is makes you want to go play another stronghold game instead.Avoid this.			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a possibly one of the most P2W games I have EVER played almost to the point that it becomes  hilarious. Let me explain. I played the game across 4 game worlds have hundred of hours and spent the Â£6 it takes to get the 2 free cards a day. I feel this isn't too unreasonable for what is effectively a glorified browser game(that runs through it's own launcher). However I couldn't be more wrong. It seems in each world in SHK there are literally a handful of hyper elitist, epeen obsessed, ego â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that have paid hundreds if not thousands of actual currency to roflstomp everyone who hasn't bowed down instantly to them. You can't defend against this level of P2W you just accept 'oh my village and castle i took a month to create will be gone in 1 second and have to start over'. But don't just take my word for it, download the game and look in most of the worlds you will see about 85% of them are totally dead ruled by above described players. Firefly gets around this by creating a new world every now and then so the p2w can continue.The carding P2W system allows you to for example: get to top rank of a new world in roughly 30 minutes (this takes months if you are 100% F2P), repeatedly raise a maximum sized army instantly, boost speed across the map to ridiculous levels, oh and gain totally unrestricted amount of in-game resources.The Devs don't appear to care about the level of p2w as, as I understand the game is run by a small team. At the end of the day, why actually put any effort into creating a  fair game when you can sit back and let a few whales pay your salaries right SHK devs?On a plus side the game still has the unique art style that made the early Strongholds great, but then this isn't surprising as most of this game has been ripped straight out of those early titles.To summaries I haven't written this review in a moment of rage, more of sadness that yet another once great game studio that brought us great titles back in the day such as Stronghold 1, Crusades and Stronghold 2 has descended into the excrement of the F2P P2W market. I'd say the devs should take a good long look at themselves, as Firefly does have the history and potential to make good old school (almost indie?) games.Edit: 23.04.2016Just to update this review, I decided to try this game again to see if anything had changed and if my review was still relevant. Needless to say it has got even worse. I played a totally peaceful role helping players where I could and not getting involved in any of the faction dramas that generally happen at the start of a new world.By day 10 I have been deleted from the game world with no warning by a player that has paid a lot of money to get to almost top rank already  (only day 10 remember).On asking him why he did this I was greeted by a torrent of offensive language and general elitism about ""he can because he paid"" and how anyone who hasn't spent the amount of money he has in the game is garbage. I believe in psychological fields this is a classic case of a real world inferiority complex manifesting in an online environment.As I said in my original review the devs seem fine with this level of pay to win, which in turn encorages these types of nasty individuals to group together.So I still do not reccommend anyone try this game. Unless of course you like to make up for failings in your life by spending ludicras amounts of money in online games for self gratification no one else is willing to give you in the real world.Edit: 5.08.2016Decided to give the new Domiation 3 world a go, to see if the devs had listened to any of the reviews posted on steam over the past months. Answer no. It's now day 9 of Dom 3 and the outcome of the world is already pretty much decided as the hardcore p2w players are mainly all under one house and have already taken over most of the world.The domination game mode seems to be geared for those who want to prove they have the biggest epeen (wallet). It's a game mode almost exclusivly for extracting money out of the p2w whales. I still don't recommend this game unless you have about Â£/$100 spare to burn every couple of weeks.			"

High people up in rank are horrible they are inactive often and leave their parishes for banit camps, disease, castles, and wolf layers. Going up in honor is pointless except for the research points.

												I usually don't give a ""no"" recommendation to free-to-play games. Anyone can just download it and try it out for themselves without paying anything. You will only lose time (and maybe learn how game developers think of making money through free online games). Game is fun for the first few hours, but they made it slow on purpose. I understand the business model, so I won't get angry or even annoyed that this is clearly a pay-to-win game, but don't expect a positive reaction to this.

												I will make a review with neggative and positive items so every reader can make his own opinion.Firstly, we have to keep in mind that his game is a Free To Play so you will find a cash-shop that every F2P game have. This cash-shop gives a significative advantage: 1.- Premium token (you can move buildings, auto trade, auto scout, auto attack IA, auto recruit, give resources, troops or monks to a player that shares your IP, a global view of your villages) & 2.- Card packs (militarly, production, with different lvls with differents cost). With premium token you can have a proper manage of everything (I use premium only for buildings, auto recruit and global view of villages) but I don't spend money at card-pack because are expensive.Card-Packs are used to make insta-armies, insta villages, insta resources, insta everything (even castle defences, reserachs, rank,...) When a player takes a lot of time to reach Crown Prince, there is a heavy carder that ranks to crown prince with full villages full armies full research and everything in a few days. I can talk more about this theme but there is a better choice than keep reading me: Go to stronghold kingdoms and enjoy reading all types of cards.So, there is nothing more to add about pay-theme. However, there is a topic that a lot of people don't like: How Staff manages the multi-accounting/sharing IP (not the same as multi-accounting)/etc. I have met a lot of friends in real life that got banned just because they shared IP a few times (House-LAN-party, for example) so FireFly starts to follow you. In case you get again the conflict of IP-Sharing, they start to ban you (24, 48h, 72h,...until it reachs to perma-ban). In my opinion, there is no way (at least have 100% prove) that one player has multi-accounted. And not all multi-accounting players are banned because one friend got bored from this game and he create intentionally 5 accounts to farm FP and makes a mess in different servers. He claimed that he was multi-accounting and ask FireFly to ban him, however, he did not got ban (at least perma ban).In my opinion, that is all about what I dislike of FireFly. There are other things as the number of worlds, or how FireFly organizes different stuff...but I don't think that is relevant. About the positive stuff I can clearly say that there is a big bunch of them:We can start with the experience of every MMO: It's a massive game online where you share experiences with other players & compete each other in order to be at first place and satisfy your Ego (normally, there are players that have different objectives). This game doesn't make you play only for the main goal (win era), you can make your own objectives (of course, with no monetary prize) like being the most farmer, most fighter, most diplomatic, most roler (I have found different groups that roled in SHK: Extremist religious people, pacifist people who like to feed players, ...).In addition, SHK have plenty tones of features as research tree (It gives you a lot of strategies and different ways to grow), castle design (is the only game about strategy and mmo that let's you design your own castle), armies design (mix the number of troops and how to send them), village layouts, strategy to produce, divide work & be better than others, etc... In conclusion, I don't recommend this game because his creepy-staff & high use of Cash-shop to finance his project and disbalance the game. They have improved a lot since Alpha but they have to improve a lot more if they want to increase their population. I want to keep clear that this profile only have 10 hrs because I use the stand-alone version of SHK.My nickname in game is Usurf Pieschafados.			"

												This game has  the potential to be great, but I doubt it ever will be.  While this game is ""free"" to play, you can not compete without investing a good deal of money.  Even after sinking over 1000 hours into the game, I still found myself needing to spend real world cash now and then to keep up.  There is nothing more frustrating than loosing a village to another player while you are asleep at night.  Especially if that was a village you spent months of real world time AND money developing.  If you like banging your head against the wall while repeatedly starting all over after months of ""work"", then this game is for you.  For all the sane people out there, I recomend you stay away from this incredable waste of time and money.			"

												First of all, this game is NOTHING alike the other Stronghold games. It is a strategic castle/village building game, with combat, trading, gathering ressources, monks, etc, in a real-time large world to play on. You have to wait for your buildings to be completed and your army takes a long time to get to other castles to attack so expect a less action-filled gameplay!My steam time is inacurate, i've only played the game downloaded directly from the website, I was rank 20 on 2 worlds. While it was fun and entertaining for a month, it quickly became tedious and well... Keep reading.Not only that, but it is one of the most P2W game ever created in my opinion. If you pay alot of money, you can get an unlimited amount of cards that can repair your castles, spawn troops, make your troops 3-6x faster, almost everything is possible with those cards. If you want to get them without paying, it takes a lot of time and to get a steady amount of cards you need to have purchased Crowns ( Real money currency. ).You can simply win a war by ''Carding'', yes, it actually is a term! Credit Carding pretty much. Otherwise, the game could have been fun longterm, leading your House to victory via economy, war, diplomacy or monks!			"

Once the world gets to a certain age its all about the ""Pay To Win"" and if you want to not die, then you better be playing (and buying) 10+ cards a day.Would totaly recomend you bash your head on your desk for just as much enjoyment.

Not recommended!!!It used to be a good one few years back when people were not using bots to have 10-15 accounts and the game did not add so many game breaking cash shop items. even if you pay hundreds of dollars you are guaranteed to lose when fighting botters with 10 accounts. I would suggest you to move on and play another game. Save your time and money, this game deserves neither			"

												The worst of it it's to think that it could be an excelent strategy game, taking the genre to a whole new level in terms of multiplayer but turned out to be a superb idea extremely poorly executed (and I find hard not to swear saying this).I've always been a fan of the franchise having purchased all the other titles but sadly, this game is one big piece of disapointment, and it's the second time I try to like it, but I just can't.Think of this game as a wife you give lots of time and stuff and when you think everything is doing good, all h*ll breaks loose and she elopes with a rich guy, taking everything with her, of course.To make it short: an absurd waste of time and money (if you are dumb enough for both).

												I have played Stronghold Crusader as a kid , now I am an MLG pro at the game. This is nothing like it , it's a f-ing timed game , that's what it is , and lemme tell ya. The graphics look choppy and the overlay is a mess , don't download this  game , its a P2W game. On day one it's fun but then comes the p2w part. The balance so extraordinarily in the favor of the buying-system it's basically unplayable without spending a lot of money . What are you spending lots of money on? Cards that make your troops fast and buff like a afro-american , but now in all seriousness , it goes like this : The more cards you have, the more troops you have, the faster they move and the stronger they are. And what is the mess here ?? You can buy unlimited f-ing cards. (SECOND ACCOUNT 500hrs +)(TL;DR)Cons------------------------|-Very time consuming  - Pay to win- Bugs -Non-friendly overlay   ------------------------|Pros----------------------------------------|+ Over 150 quests+ 4 Big research trees lots of variety.+ It's Stronghold----------------------------------------|I just can't reccomend it now , maybe in the future.

												With over 930.3 Hours on record. The more you play the game as a non payer, the more you start to find it frustrating and boring. Yes you can play hours on end without paying a single dime, But if you want to be anything but a inactive farmer, YOU MUST INVEST. For a start, If you do not buy crowns the max amount of cards you get a week will be three and three only,compared to the 12 you get if you've got the level for it and have invested atlest $10.00 USD. Also the game has a flaw in its system, In every world there will be that one group of people who will overrule everyone, You cannot dare to fight back, or you will loose ( Such as the H14 Alliance in World USA 1 Atm.). This is a game where soulless hours of grinding on a bland game can be wiped on in one afternoon,So to the freeplayers, Its pretty much Buy,Die, Or be stranded.			"

												Dear Wallets, the TL;DR is run from this game. It will make promises about delivering the best night of your life, only to steal your dignity, and your pocketbookI started SHK approximately a year ago, in that time i've learned that sometimes customer service does get so bad that your absuive family relations really did you a favor preparing you for the ""Real World"".The issues as I see them:1. You MUST pay to play: You can invest all the time you have to be ""the best"" but you'll never come close to the lady/fella that has thousands to spend in order to become the digital pimp of SHKland. You will forever be outclassed and outgunned, and if you want to have any hope of being a competitive player, you'll end up spending at minimum a few hundred dollars to keep up. Free to pay this game isn't.2. Cheating: All of the major Houses in the game knowing allow or look the other way to enable cheaters, they make multiple accounts and utilize automated botting programs to gain an unfair advantage. The developer does not actively participate in looking for people cheating or abusing the system, instead they wait for the players to file reports before any action is taken. There have been many documented accounts of known cheaters going months before any actions were taken, and everyone else who has played the game fairly is never compensated for the losses incurred. If you enjoy cheating to get ahead, this game may be for you!3. Apathtic Development Team: The mechanics of this game rarely see updates. They've been using the same crusty technology for years now and do not put any effort into maintaining the game engine. When bugs do occur they can go months and years before seeing any resoultion. For example a recent issue was highlighted with the the game client under windows XP, and instead of resolving the issue they asked players to use a work arond each time they try and log-in. The issue still persists as of this posting.4. Community Feedback: The Development team treats the player community like they have leprosy. They do not engage the playerbase, they make no attempt to provide timely updates about game issues or downtime, there is virtually no information about upcoming features or development goals.5. Customer Support: If you run into issues with your account the support staff will not discuss those problems with you, if they do not like something you have said, or done you can and will have your account terminated with no forum for resolution. The enforcement of game rules is incredibly selective. There are witch hunts and reporting bridages that attempt to get popular and infamous players banned.Let me repeat that, If you are even suspected of breaking rules your account, all of your invested time and money will be deleted and cease to exist with no ability to speak for or represent yourself. End of the line, Account terminated. Start another and spend more money!The primary draw for players like myself is the hardcore and dedicated community that's a joy to spend time with and battle against. Like most games past their prime it's the friends and community itself that keep you around.The bottom line for me is, Toxic Dev and Support/CSR team. The music and visuals are way past the use-by date, The gameplay itself can be fun for a few months but gets stale very quickly as feature development is not something that happens here.leaving Stronghold Kingdoms feels like the end of an abusive one-sided relationship that was only in it for the money, I can't say I'll miss it.o7Cheers!Qbit			"

												Playing all of the Stronghold games, I was excited to see what Kingdoms had to offer.  Putting your castle on a real world map and playing with/against other people has its appeal.  Playing it, it lost the appeal rather fast.  After feeling disconnect from my village, town, parish, and the game, I have yet to go back it again.  This may be for others that like this, but as a fan of the Stronghold series, and a fan of stratagy games, this one fell short of both.Pros:- Real world map- Multiplayer- Free to PlayCons:- No real time castles seges (MMO not an RTS)- Village and Castles disconnect occures- Allows non stratigic castle overbuild (Just place a lot of one good thing to win)- Never got pulled into the Kingdom's community (if it exists)- Feels like a combersom single player game			"

												I was one of the top players of Stronghold Kingdoms. This game might be the best example of a pay to win game and it's not fun at all even if you spend a fortune. I regret spending so much time and money in this game. If you're not going to spend at least a hundred bucks every month, you might as well play Farmville on Facebook. If you really really want to play this game when there are so much better things to do with your life, make sure you start this game with at least 5 skilled friends in the same province in-game and make sure to read the wiki. I highly recommend you to avoid this game if you value your time. Don't ever think that you will actually socialize and make friends in this game. Reliable friends are very rare and after playing for so long I only made a handful of them.2/10			"

Or they change the map to be better, so you buy your tokens and cards, but it keeps crashing due to being unable to handle the server load. Do not bother.

												Extremely slow paced. This game is pay to win as you can get. Its design seems to be geared more toward people who work from their computers and can constantly check their game to move stuff around and such. If you are a fan of slow games that are online only meaning when you are not online someone who might be no life playing it 10 + hours a day or paid money to get a lot of stuff quick destroy your stuff, then be my guess and play. Otherwise do the sensible thing and keep looking for something else to play.			"

												Along side the pay to win comments, and the broken mechanics and all that, I will give you my experience first hand.I figured out a great way to make use of the economy through trade early in the game to help get some extra resources to boost my production in various areas. I was accellerating quite well in the game for the first week. Then you get to a point where things start to take time and a little more strategy of what to build and upgrade based on a focus you want to persue. This I was happy with because it makes sense, you can't just major in everything and expect to go far sooner. So I went into military while prepping for religeous expansion. Once again, I was progressing along very nicely.Probably a couple of months went by of dedicated play time (logging every day). I was making smart attacks, gaining honor, rebuilding my troops to always maintain 200 defending troops in my castle, and another 200-300 attacking AI for honor. My castle had a moat around the whole area, traps set, and maxed balista towers as well as turret towers, along side my 200 archers. I had two sets of walls that circled my village for enemies to get through, the walls were 3 layers thick, and I had large/grand towers all around as well. Also started to build into religion as I was able to max out my military.2 months of work that built me up to this, and one day I get on to find out I was attacked for the first time. What was I attacked with? 2 captains who were obviously maxed out, and I think 20 pikes. None of them died because the captains apparently can heal them as well as make them go incredibly fast, as well as boost their dmg so they basically ran through the moat (which usually takes about 3-5 seconds for an enemy to fill), took down both sets of walls in a matter of 3 seconds, ran over my few pikes in my village and won the fight and looted my village. The entire attack took about 5-6 seconds after I spent about a month building my bloody castle.So what's the point of spending all of that time building when all someone has to do is max their captains upgrades (only a few upgrades to do), go in and take down a fully constructed castle in a matter of seconds? The only thing that protected me from being attacked again was an ally sending a monk to my castle and giving me protection for 24 hours or something. All that work put into protecting my village, and someone sends in 22 guys that just destroys me. That doesn't make any sense. Thus, I deleted the game.That's my rant/review of this game. Choose to support it if you will, or force them to smarten up their mechanics and balancing system. Because in reality, this is a GREAT strategy game. But I will not play it again with crap like that happening.			"

												If you, like me, are into medieval history, knights, castles, and kings, you love a medieval castle game. But you get tired of fighting the Ai, and want a challenge against another human. And, if it was free, and had alot of PvP to it, you'd have your dream computer game. But you doubt it'd be free. Then, Stronghold Kingdoms is shown on your Steam search. Bullyseye. Money on the nose. Congrats on finding your dream game, complete with PvP, castle, knights, real world maps, strategy, and excitement.Wrong. Your a ""bully"" for wanting to battle different players and get involved in House wars, and any war for that  matter, House or no House. And if you do attack a player, unknowing about the ""bully"" rules or not, you end up reset unless of course you have dozens of vassal armies, and tons of cards. Whats the point of having a PvP world, 24/7 at that, if you can never use the PvP? Mind you, the players, the ones who DESPISE you attacking another player, will gladly attack you cause they were bored, or just simply needed the supplies or wanted a new town and captured yours. But your not allowed to attack back, or else you'll be the bully, and will need to be reset! This is pathetic and an injustice to the defender. But thats not all the community has decided: The soldier recruiting. Its very limited. Your given six options to choose from: peasant, archer, pikemen, swordsmen, catapaults, and captains. Peasants are near useless, but cheap to make and handy for quick battles. Archers are vital to the game, and it would be near impossible to play the game without them. Pikemen are somewhat cheap to recruit, and are effective in battle. Swordsmen are, by far, the coolest soldier on the battlefield. Its probably the most medieval looking thing on the entire game! The catapaults are useless unless attacking. Captains look like dismounted knights, but with a cape, like a king, and wields an axe. Expensive, and best for attacking. So, with these options in mind, you can customize your army! Wrong! The community has decided archers and pikemen are the only soldiers you really need. Swordsmen are ""to aggressive"" so you hardly see them and they highly discourage you even recruiting them. And they'll expect 375+ archers on your castle walls for defense to keep out invaders. Oh and unit space. After some research, your able to have 500 units. Units include scouts, merchants, monks, and soldiers. However, 1 monk=25 spots out of your 500! Safe to say, by the time you get 8 scouts(max allowed) 10 merchants(carries enough supplies worth the time) and save enough room for even 2 monks(50 spots taken with those alone) you'll get somewhere 319-342 soldiers. How are you able to get 375 archers out of that!? Its rather a nusiance and it would be much handier if every unit cost 1 spot. Next, the castles. To save time, basically put, they'll force you to build your castle THE same way everytime in every town, in every House, on every server. They will raze your town if you dont. To prevent invaders, is there wimpy excuse. Or make fun of you, if you dont build by there own standards. And still this one style the community has picked, gets razed in every war. So shouldn't you get creative instead of this grind of castle building the same thing over and over? I mean its not like it proves indestructible. They'll launch 5+ parish armies at it, timed attacks to take out your archers, and other defenses. Cards is, pretty much, the legal way to ""cheat"" on here. Basically, within 2 hours you could have a near fully built town, high rank, lots of researchs done. And your neighbor has a tiny, barely built town, low rank and little to no research done, because he is not carding. In wars, the winning side is NOT who was the best fighter, or had better tactics. Its whoever was online the most to buy cards to use. Say I was in a battle, one-on-one, and my enemy used cards and I didn't. It'll take me four hours to recruit a full army. And then, it'll take two hours for them to reach his town. My enemy uses cards and voila! He has full army in 30 minutes, and another card and his army is reaching my town in 45 minutes, which was really 2 hours away. Cards also limit castle damage so, basically, use cards or just wait, slowly, to do ANYTHING!Finally, the players. First off, Ive met some really nice fellows on here. The rest, are so mean, its enough to make you quit this game altogether. I have been called names, as if I was being bullied on a schoolyard playground. And these were mostly in battles, and one was from another player who, thinks Im a ""bully"" for wanting to try out the battles, so he bullies me, name calls me, makes fun of me, tells others Im trouble. But he isn't a bully, according to him. Ive been threatenend to be r*ped over scouting someone. Murder threats also happen in wars. Thankfully, Ive never seen any,  my allies are the ones who told me. It caused multiple players to actually quit one server, out of fear, because they AND there familes were threatened with murder. And, so far, it seems  FireFly aint the least bit concerned over any of this. Oh and the Ai is a problem. The Wolf castles spawn WAY to fast and then, literally, destroy your castle, makes it harder to bring in peasants to build an army to destroy it, forces you to lower your taxs, and usually, no one destroys it, due to needing supplies for wars, that they discourage you from being in, until your town is in complete shambles. Cutting Wolf castle spawn rates would make this game even slightly more fun.Overall, not a good game. If they could give you an option to avoid human player attacks or not, then maybe we could have a little more of the PvP, without the innocent getting destroyed in the process. Towns defense upgrades would also be a welcome boost. Catapaults(cats, in-game) shoot so fast, that even if you manage to defend, your castle is destroyed big-time. Makes your victory feel bittersweet. But you gotta defend off 200 some archers, 150+ pikemen, and 100 or so cats, along with the captain(s) with, at max 400 possible soldiers. 500 possible attackers versus 400 possible defenders. Perhaps thats why the discourage the PvP, is because its way to unbalanced, and the defenders odd's of winning is slightly better than winning the Lottery.At the end of the day, with PvP dubbed as ""bullying"" all you have left is a building game, and watching numbers go up game. It sounds more like a math game, and who wants to spend there free time doing math related stuff, such as watching numbers go up, numbers go down(addition and subtraction) and waiting for the one building to finish so you can place another?I'd highly recommend Age of Empires 2 HD or Medieval Kingdoms 2: Total War over this game. I know you cant beat free, but the money spent on those games are worth there money. Plus, they deliver, great medieval experiences, along with highly intense battles, single player or multi player.Plus, you can avoid getting a lesson in, Bullying 101, which this game is, pretty much.

												Alright so you want to play Stronghold Kingdoms.Let me run you through it.1.) Get random placed in a ruski region. Purple house controls the region. K you got this.2.) Build castles and buy the thirty day premium token just because benefits, buy nothing else.3.) Build a faction of elite and close friends. Defeat any neutrals that cross your path.4.) Scout a castle and explain to owner that you are revamping your castle.5.) Get gangbanged by many ruskies that suddenly decide you are a threat after you have aided in building up their parish and are stronger than any one person near you.6.) Defend yourself against the gangbanging. 10/10 your castle wasn'tâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and your women weren't pillaged.7.) You've been in the game for several months by now, so you see your defeat coming. Get gang banged again by about 3 ruskies of the prince status. Your castle has beenâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Your women pillaged.8.) By looking over the reports you realize you activated the ruskies trap card. Pay2Win activated. Enemy armies replenished as soon as your castle defeats them. Your castle is taken.9.) ''You're village has been lost! Select manual or automatic to start again.''10.) Nope.There you've experienced Stronghold Kingdoms in case you wanted to play for slightly free with the premium token as a bonus.If you want to pay2win this isn't your playthrough. Your playthrough was on the ruskies side.			"

I have Windows8 so that might be only a windos8 issue. Further more there is microbuy actions which is to be expected. So i don't recommend the game But you can try it out since it's free.			"

												I approached this game with some hope that it would be a decent replacement for Lord of Ultima. Not only was this hope squashed, the game itself is quite poor and nothing more than a cash grab. I fully expect all FTP games will have some cash incentives involved, it's the nature of the beast. People need to eat, pay their bills and try to have a normal life. I have no problems paying for premiums in a FTP that is actually good. This is something at a much higher level that shows itself as soon as playing through the tutorial. At least in this regard it is out in the open.All I can say is that you can see for yourself, but I would save you a considerable waste of time.  "

												I used to play this game quite obsessively as the amount of time you are on the game greatly affects your perfomance ratings. It isn't the sort of game you can take a long break from (hours not days). Unfortunately due to this fact this game has several 'pay to win' points which completely ruins the whole idea of this being a free to play game which hasn't changed with any of the expansions or patches.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a 'add feature' payment system this is a 'massively skip ahead the free people' system. If you've got money to throw at a game and time on your hands i'd recommend this, otherwise stay clear.			"

												I played this game when it came out of the beta on one of the first worlds, I just recently came back to see how it developed and whether they worked on anything.On the bright side, it's a fun MMORTS, it's very slow paced and it takes knowledge to be excellt. Teamwork is huge, and you'll find large houses (aka ""guilds"") battling over terroity, it can get you hooked for a while, but overall I'd not recommend it, for various reasons:Great concept, but lacking mechanicsThis another bugger. The game gets very repitive very fast. You'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over and over, and it gets very tedius. Place the same buildings, send out traders evertime you login, scout resources, clearing some AIs.The only variation you really get in this game is when going at war with other factions, it's pretty much the one thing that can really give excitement, and it's one of the strong points and while the mechanics are awefully similar, you still need to think about what you do in a war situation instead of just mindlessly sending attacks. If you play smart in war,  you will survive.Overall the concept is really nice, but after seeing how little was done with it, it's a bit say, it could have been a much better game.Pay 2 WinIt's massively pay 2 win. Premium is cheap, and gives quite the advantage, you can do without, but it also means you don't have to babysit 24/7 just so you can get the next research or building. This would also be bearable, but the real problem here are cards - while there are ingame systems to obtain cards, such as free cards every 12h (but ONLY after you paid TWICE), and some quests or raids on special AI castles that give you a chance at you card packs, people who just spent TONS of money can buy justwhatever they want.The more people spend and use cards, the more massive their advantage become; if you bother to look at the maginitude of cards, you can see clearly how advantageous is this - 10x the production, 2x stronger defenses each, lots of instant troops, even instantly building castle defenes.A good example of this how the most recent world 2 europe just started, and people reached rank 14 within an hour with the use of spamming cards, and the avarage player (even with some cards AND premium), can make it to rank 4 or 5 in the same time; the righer ranks take exceptionally longer to achieve, so the first few are easy, and it would usually take a few days to get to 14. Poor DevelopersAs I said I've been returning to this game. It was fun for a while, but after 3 years it was shocking to see how little was done to the game. What has changed in such a long time period? They added quests which give you a one time bonus, ears which are mostly just restarting a world with some slight modificiations and 2 new AI castle types.Oh right, and don't forget that they existed even more pay to win cards. That's the most important part, they added tons and tons of even stronger cards, you can only recieve when you *BUY* card packs (or get really lucky when you find a card pack in game), the weaker card can be bought for card points, but the really strong ones only found. It shows they only care about the p2w and money aspect of the game.On the other hand, did anything in the gameplay evolve to make it fairer or improve it? Nope, nothing. Actually, the one change they made it made even worse, i.e. like captains (an extremly expensive unit) that now disappears after attacking other players. "

												I love this game. Building your own mini empire across several settlements, setting up trade routes between them, sending out hordes of units to assault other people's castles are all fun, and getting big enough to be tipped into a faction and start politicking is also fun. People are on 24/7, building and plotting each other's demise, and it inspires an incredible sense of dedication to checking in over the course of the day and making it a part of your life. Things happen slowly, but the decisions you make are always interesting. That said, the game has two hard currencies: time and money. The more you're on, and the more your allies are on, the more you can strategize and wage a 24/7 war against whoever. There is a way to build an efficient and collaborative war machine, and doing things besides playing this game are not it. Even if you do dedicate your waking existence to the game--and there are definitely enough people who do so that it matters--you can still be outspent by people with really deep pockets that are filled with real world currency, who spend it on things that give them free resources, production boosts, and movement boosts. I don't think it's possible for a faction that is 100% dedicated but doesn't spend a dime to overcome a faction that is 100% dedicated and has a few people spending $10. If anyone reading this knows otherwise, I'd love to hear about it.So I'm split. The game is great fun, but only until you run into a group of players who have more time and real world money than you. Once that happens, they crush theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥out of you and take your settlement and all of the buildings and resources you accumulated. Once you lose all settlements, it's back to square one. You're given a fresh hamlet to build up and inevitably have raided, and it becomes clear that all you're doing is producing a series of feeder farms for the upper echelons. And that's cool and all, but I get enough of this kind ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥in the real world.			"

												I've been playing this game for a good 2 years now. 2,000+ hours total purely on the Steam app (About 1,000 on the stand-alone application.) Combined, I've spent over 3,000 hours playing this game.I would not recommend this game to anyone, ever.This game is the best example of Free-to-Play, Pay-to-Win gone wrong.Admittedly, without ""Crowns"" (in-game currency bought using real-life currency), this game is a splendid real-time strategy game.It all falls apart, however, when a free player attempts to interact with a so-called ""premium"" player.While you spend grueling days upon days building up a modest village, army, and castle without spending a single dollar, someone can drop a couple hundred dollars on this game, and instantly wipe you out, forcing you to start from the beginning with nothing.And if the pay-to-win player is indeed wiped out somehow, he can always pay some more real-life money, and instantly be back up and running.The limiting factor in the game used to be Faith Points, but FireFly Studios has slowly begun to release cards that tamper with even that mechanic. Thus, I have decided to drop this game from my library before being forced to further endure wallet warriors.Do not get this game, unless you enjoy stressing over whether or not your months of hard work will be erased by someone with enough money to build what you built, in a mere hour.

												Firstly i played in World 1 for 3years+, ive never been a premium account holder yet i still became a pretty powerful player. At the time i quit i had 8 parish`s and 2 countys and kicking the hell out of premium players.The truth is you can not stay neutral and just do your own thing and farm in peace, you will be dragged into petty wars that little idiots start cos they havent got the social skills to be nice. It is full of cheaters, liars and two faced little c**ts that will stab you in the back and join the winning side. During war time you have to stay logged in 24h a day to take care of your castles as people only attack you when your offline, you have to constantly repair your castles because of AI attacks because the parish steward is a lazy bum that just wants power and doesnt kill the AI like he should or he stacks up tax to X9 screwing your village income and then theres the inactives. You join a faction and look forward to war except to see when the war starts all your faction mates jump ship or are afk and dont get involved leaving you to fight a war you didnt start on your own.Devs play the game or have friends in the game and they are the most unprofessional people ive ever come across. They take sides, usually the winning side and its 1 rule for them another for us and once a House starts taking over everyone joins them and your left with 80% of the active players on the winning side and the rest either fighting them or staying out of it.These are just my exp in the game, ive quit playing now i log in every now and then to say hi to some friends then log off. You wont really know what the game is like until you exp it for yourself though but my advice is to not spend a penny on it. Dont pay for a premium account and dont buy cards.PS This is an old review i made.			"

												1. Pay2win2. Playing this game becomes like chores and require you to sit here all day online if you want to achieve at least something.3. Veteran players will outrun you when scouting stashes, they will bombard you if you're a solo player and even 30d. peace period won't help you to catch up with them.4. When your premium ends, it's not chores anymore, it's a frustation (building 1 object at a time, and having 1 research happening at a time and waiting for hours until you can build something else besides castle defense structures).5. There are many pay2win veterans just farming in other words, they have tons of card points and speed cards and they will just steal (hidden stashes, lairs, camps) everything from your face, preventing you from completing quests and getting achievements, and leaving you no chance to compete with them.6. The Stronghold theme and game idea is not bad, but it's poorly developed, it hasn't changed at all to what i saw like in 2014. And you can see that new players leave like within a week after their premium runs out and they become dead bored realizing they need to throw here a fair amount of cash.7. Long story short - developers just want to suck out all your money for a dead game. If there was huge amount of playerbase for Stronghold Crusader multiplayer, then nobody would play this browser style game.TL;DR - pay2lose Waiting Simulator.			"

												community areâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥....then they just go around bullying people and forcing them to pay unreasonable taxes because yes....the game allows them to constantly force you to pay money (parish tithe). You cannot intercept attacks, they know if you try to vote them out of a parish, you need crowns to buy card packs (you need to pay real money), all purchases for crowns are unreasonably priced, you dont command your troops.......again the community is god awful. You can lose months of progress (3 months for maybe 3 villages if you know what you are doing) in the blink of an eye......the game play is not engaging whatsoever.....this game is trash and trust me do not get it. I gave them 5 bucks for card packs because I used to love firefly studios and stronghold games....but this is an insult to their fans. It says I have only played this for a few minutes...but that is because I originally installed it from their homepage....and have played this for 3 or 4 months.....its trash...they dont tell you what the tithe (tax rate) is on where you are starting. I make 20 gold coins out of the 920 i should be making on my starting village. DO NOT GET OR WASTE TIME INTO THIS GAME			"

												Not recommended because it's pay to win. You can buy strategy cards which can boost your production, or instantly replenish your army, or instantly let you finish your research, or instantly lets you place buildings, etc. Paying players can rank up in minutes what non paying members would take months. The top players have spend thousands of dollars on this game. You will see these players in multiple servers, all joining together and taking the fun out of this game. SHK would be more fun and equal if it wasn't for these strategy cards. The devs needs to release a server without them.Yes, I have played this game for months, why? Because I also had fun. You start peasant, with 1 town and no research, almost no gold and you rank up to crown prince with 15+ cities, a huge army and millions in gold. You can become a farmer and build and sell a huge amount of supplies, become a fighter and attack enemy players, or become a monker and use the power of faith to take out your enemies. You can all do it in this game.As you rank you rank up you get to research new types of food, weapons, merchants, new unit types, buildings, or increase speed/capacity of existing units/production facilities. Your villages (and later villages) will start to grow, allowing you to sell more stuff and get richer. You will start by attacking and scouting wolf lairs, and as you grow stronger, with more advanced and stronger unit types, you can attack enemy castles.Castle attacking is very basic. Just place your army and send the attack. It will then take several minuts to hours (depending on the distance) for your army to arrive. Battles are automatic and you will only see a battle report after the battle is finished. AI pathfinding can be a bit weird.Players can play together and form factions. Several factions can join a house. Houses can form alliances and fight for control over the map. Sounds fun, but in most servers super alliances are quickly formed and then everyone farms, there is no fighting for control of the map. New players should join a new server, because older servers are pretty much dead and AI is too difficult to attack.			"

												If you are a Stronghold fan and like the typical browser-based RTS games that are around these days, then you'd like this game. The persistence and MMO-style of this game means that PvP greifing will get you down, but it still has some of that Stronghold feel. The city vs. castle vs. parish castle vs. region castle can get a bit confusing, and the parish/region mechanics make it near impossible for a non-faction aligned player to have any influence. While it does have some Stronghold flair, it suffers from too many MMO/Browser game limitations.			"

												The game has a nice medieval feel and pace, that means slow. But then you get these pay players continually buying cards to speed their scouts, traders and armies and quite frankly the game becomes worthless to play unless you are willing to pay for the same things. I consider this a design flaw, as any huge benefit for a player should come at a heavy price and not soemthing that they can purchase on a daily or even weekly basis. Or maybe the maker should consider other ways to give the benefit but add that whe the term is over the units die. This would at least add some thing close to realism. After all, moving at 6x the speed of the next fastest scout should have some side affect. I am sure the maker only considers the fact that players most buy these cards and that means more money for them. Another flaw, in my opinion, is the lack of generating new worlds on a faster basis to give new players some chance of getting into a position of power, the political system is interesting and could be a great reason to play but it also limits changes later in the game that takes any chance of a late comer to a world of having any chance to be more than a faction member. I wanted to like this game but with these factors in mind I cannot recommend it and I no longer will play it.			"

												I have to say that I only played this game thanks to a former friend, and to be honest...I'm not that impressed with it.This game is above all a time consumer, like most free to play strategy games.  It is both a time consumer, and involves a lot of politics.  For most people, this is okay; for the casual gamer who likes to spend a few minutes every day managing a castle and speaking with people in your parish and your house when you get higher up it works out alright.  It can have its fun moments, and equally its pretty jerkish moments with other players, as regardless of what you're doing or how you are playing there are still many other players out there on your world that are playing at the exact same time as you are, and some take this game hardcore.This game...is too slow.  Way too slow.  I can see why; it's meant to keep players engaged in a game about castles with other people.  I can appreciate a game being slow for the sake of realism.  But if I'm going to be gathering resources, building a city, constructing a castle, or making soldiers I would like the luxury of designing everything in the glory of realtime thanks to technology.  I'm used to playing games like Age of Empires, Starcraft, Supreme Commander and the like, where playing too slow gets you booted, so when I'm forced to go immensely slow just to see my fifth or sixth pig farm get built to feed my many cities, I got a bit batsh-erhem...I go a bit wonky.I got as far as Prince before I gave up on this game.  My house was unlucky enough to be one of the lesser houses on the winning side, and knowing my luck another house would not pick up me or my faction due to the low priority of both my parish and my region.  So, I bade my party farewell and offed my castles, and have lived the better for it.  Too bad I'm not going to be getting all those hours back I should have spent studying for college.			"

												Kingdoms is fundamentally flawed - it is more efficient for established players to 'conquer' new players, and take their village(s) after allowing the new players to develop the village for them.  As a new player you will lose your village to an unstoppable force from an established player every 3 to 4 weeks of playing. Any premium tokens or card packs that you bought to help develop your village only benefit the conquering player as you must start a new village over. Rinse and repeat.I would suggest to anybody considering Stronghold Kingdoms to steer clear and instead pick up the original 2001 Stronghold game during a sale, which is by far the best of the bunch from this franchise. Alternatively, have a look for other, more popular real-time building MMOs -there are many to choose from, without the same lose-everything-you-paid-for-to-an-established-player design that Stronghold Kingdoms has.

												I was so obsessed with this game long time ago, playing it everyday, logged in 24/7 never quit unless shutting down my lappy.Besides graphic, this is definitely the best kingdom simulator.There's only one thing makes me stop playing this game...It took me 30days (without using any cash) to build a fully defended castle, by fully i mean every single space are filled, while army are fully placed. BUT it only took other players few minutes (depends on travel distance) to COMPLETELY wipe it out. Which means my castle is gone forever. So all those effort and time used to built it are all wasted. ALL OF MY HARD WORKBut I won't complain though, just giving my thoughts, this is part of the game :)TL;DR:Pros-Game contents are satisfying-Game mechanics are basic and simple -Easy to get rich and powerful as you progress to higher rank (there's a con for this)-Ranks and skills remain if you lost everythingCons-Pay2Win game-Excessive amount of time to build (depends on player)-Insane amount of time to up skills once your rank get higher-Your can lose your castles in a blink of an eye  "

												I joined right before a new world was going to open up. I had just enough time to get the basics down on an older world before switching to the new one on release. The race was on. It was thrilling and fun to level up as fast as possible and try to control the most land. As I ranked up and people began to forge alliances I began to talk to people. I soon learned that to the north, a man had spent THOUSANDS of dollars buying himself an amazing set of cities with good defenses. This is a pay to win game. I spent 90% of my time on this game for the next few weeks, and never got to the level that the man was at on Day 1. Other people caught up to me too, by paying money. If you love pay to win games, have a lot of money to burn, and enjoy strategy games you'll love this game. The community is, for the most part, good, and it is enjoyable. Stay away if you don't want to pay.			"

												I played this for a long time, over a year. It starts with logging in every so often, and if this game pulls you in then you end up playing multiple times a day for hours; whether you want to or not. It's very well designed to get you to play, grow, expand, and then the community will capture your attention as there are some amazing people playing. And then (at least in my experience) after 600 hours your NEUTRAL house will be attacked by a warring house for some awful excuse and you lose your parishes, counties, and position in the house. This sort of experience ends the game for someone who isn't into all the militarian side of the game. Overall, the military is based of P2W, and playing on Christmas Day (the county and my parishes got raided at like 6pm christmas day... sad â¥â¥â¥â¥s playing at that time) and then being pummelled over new years eve and new years day. If anything, this game made me realise how lonely and sad some gamers are. With the mix of tragically dedicated players, a clique-like sense to most houses, the whole game being pay to win, and the lack of support for beginning players, this game isn't worth your time. I played so many hours because I enjoyed the responsibilities, but I was extremely lucky in spawning in an area with a fantastic county leader who eventually passed it to me.Worlds get killed by people who have no idea what the sun is, and great people come and go because of this. I wouldn't bother.			"

												I wish I could recommend this, but I can't. Not only have I spent over 800 hours on Steam launcher, but I also have atleast 1000 hours on launcher that I downloaded from SHK's site. This game has a lot of potential to be something greater, but all that good falls with the classic F2P game situation, Pay to win... This game has given me some nice experiences, but most of time I've spent has gone wasted with losing all hard work, destroyed by the ones who pay loads of cash. So I've listed some Pros and Cons, here we go...                                                                                    -Pros-+ Four tech trees that give some variety, though most likely you're forced to pick Military sooner or later...+ Graphics are in that old Stronghold style, I personally like it.                                                                                  -Cons-- P2W... Hardest carders spend thousands of euros on new servers.-You can't place village buildings wherever you want if you want them to be effective.-Spend hours building something, just to find it captured or razed by some carder, while you were sleeping. The reasons are often random.-Kinda same as previous one. Theres no way to just farm alone... Neutrals are often captured or forced to join a side, OR BE RAZED.Don't play this game, just dont... Too much time and money wasted on this... This would be perfect without the cards etc... I'd even pay monthly fee for a cardless version of SHK. *Sigh* It won't happen though.*Edit: Still find myself playing this... Probably because I've invested so much time in this that I just cant quit and let it go to waste... Strange.			"

It's a matter of personal preference. Do you like waiting 5 hours for a house to be built?  Do you like waiting a day to get enough resources to build the house that will take 5 hours to build?Do you like researching the tech tree for 2 hours to get enough space to gather enough resources to build a house?Do you like running out of tech tree points for the tech tree that will get you enough space for the resources required to build a house?Do you like getting raided by premium players who paid irl $$$ to finish the tech tree, to get the resources, to buy the buildings, to make an army with last levelâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥knights, wiht diamond hardâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥If you answered ""no"" to any of these, then I ask you to refrain from this game, because that's all you're going to do.

												This game becomes a daily chore, keeping up with the latest news and maintaining villages and parishes is just a hassle. I think the reason why it becomes an inconvenience is because it doesnât matter how much time you ""have to"" invest in the game, you will always fall short to those factions with deep pockets. I feel like this game has something special in the fundamentals like forcing players to learn about diplomacy, politics, and war strategies, this is a great aspect, but I believe there is a lack of balance in Time spent vs Money spent.

												Not far from most strategy browser games Stronghold Kingdoms can be fun to play for a bit but it isn't likely to get you interested in the long run unless you intend to spend money with it. Just like most browser games things take their time and there is always a pack of cards to ""help"" you when money is not an issue.Don't get me wrong this game is a good browser like strategy game, possibly one of the best, the problem is that it isn't more than that. I honestly thought it was something better when i first tried it but then i understood i had played similar things without using steam.Either way you can always download the game and check for yourself, unless you don't start throwing money around it is still free to experiment :D			"

												I'm not going to lie, this would be an awesome little empire builder but it's transparently a free to play, pay to be competitive game. If you don't intend on spending money I wish you the best of luck as it is hopeless to try and advance if you don't spend money. It's actually pretty fun but hopefully you'll realize early that it's best to just move on.			"

												I played in one of the original four worlds of this game, many years ago. I will say that if you put time into it, this can be a fun game.However, the game is a pay to win game that demands a lot of time, and punishes heavily for ignoring it, typically requiring even more money to recover from mistakes. Even if you do everything right, you will need money.The communication required to successfully coordinate is staggering. I met people who literally backstabbed each  other, and showed so much distrust that they refused to play with each other anymore over a game. If you ever wanted to study how people act when a game has serious stakes, this is probably one of the games to do it.If that sounds like a game for you, then go for it. However be aware that this game will require money, coodination skills (far beyond what MMO guilds demand),likely a voice chat server, and over a 100 people you can rely on. Even if you do not plan to win the leaderboards, be aware that if someone wants, they can and will take over your villages. Even if you have nothing to do with a war, you will likely be taken over if you did not properly build your castle.In Short: If you want a demanding pay to win game that is more about making friends, coordinating, and keeping people from wanting to kill each other, then this game is for you. Do not get sucked in.			"

												Although a great game, it is tooled towards pay to win. I guess you don't have to pay but you'll get smashed and you'll waste a huge amount of time on the game.The game is littered with bugs and god help you if you need to get the attention of the devs because, they were practically unresponsive. For years people have been screaming for a tablet version of this game because GOOD GOD does it feel like it should be on a tablet. Will the devs ever listen? No of course not. Why should devs listen to their community? Speaking the community...The community is a mixed bag of strange roleplayers, trolls and clueless newbies so...  sort of like most MMOs.It is a fun mix of city building/rts/castle building and politics, I just wish it had less bugs and devs who wanted to provide a more complete gaming experience. You are much better off passing this up unless you are -really really- desparate for a game like this. "

												i played this game intensively for about a 2 week period in which time i spent over 300 dollars in hopes to become one of the dominate powers of the newly created server. i have no problem with a game being shamelessly ""pay to win"" which stronghold kingdoms is a textbook definition of, but i do have a serious problem with companies violating their own server rules and terms of service which firefly studios did in a major way. to make a long story short i was libeled against in the most severe way possible by another community member. i had documented proof of this in the form of chat logs and screenshots. this was clearly against the EULA and the server rules and was reported multiple times. firefly refused to take action becuase the person had spent some money on the service. since they violated their eula i demanded a refund which they also refused. since i used my steam wallet i submitted a steam ticket documenting my experience and firefly's failure to enforce their eula demanding a refund. steam also refused to refund me and threatened to terminate my entire steam account with over 1000 titles if i called my credit card company to report the fraud. after all this i stopped buying steam games for almost an entire year. to this day i still will not use the steam wallet nor will i ever buy or invest in another product remotely related to firefly studios. avoid this company at all cost, they do not care about the costumer they only care about how best to take your money from you and will never give it back. i believe they decided to port it to steam for this very reason, to make refunds more problematic for the customer.avoid this company at all costs. if i was an english subject and not an american citizen i would have taken legal action against the developers.

												This game is best played in conjunction with using TeamSpeak and Skype to coordinate strategy with your group of friends. This is a 24/7 game. You cannot just leave the game and come back to it days later and expect things to be as you left them.What I like best:  The social interaction. You meet people from all over the world and of different age groups. Enjoy leading a faction and/or being a house marshal, build villages, or work on leaderboard scores and quests. Trying to get your faction or house to be number one is very fun. If you are very social and enjoy spending a lot of time playing on the computer, you will love this game.What I like least:  It is a ""pay to win"" game and the customer support department doesn't really care about issues with the game function. The more crowns and cards you have, the better you can do in the game. If you don't play a premium token you won't do as well in the game. The Firefly support attitude comes across as, ""I don't care."" You cannot have other members of your household play the game (your account will be banned). When I argued a point with them, politely and with no swearing, after a temporary ban, they permanently banned my son's account. When I experienced what I thought was a bug in the game and sent in the report and explained what I did to resolve it, they sent me a generic message asking me to explain the issue more and explain what I did to resolve it. I had to remessage and explain I already did that (meaning ... they didn't even bother to read the first message).Update: I had another ""bug"" issue to contact support about. I received a generic reply and they said they could ""discern no error,"" even after I submitted screen shots of the reports and pointed out what happened. All they did was politely tell me, ""Oh well,"" and didn't do anything to resolve the problem. Not a satisfied customer right now.			"

												There's an unfair balance of power in this game. I created a new village since my first one couldn't be expanded anymore. The moment I make another village, the parish leader attacks me for no reason. This is a pay to win game and all the powerful jerks all payed just so they can kick all the little players around. I was attacked by the capital he owned, than he attacked me with a large army and destroyed my villages. Don't play this since there are just guys who do nothing but bully all the other players.This game has a very unique concept that I really like, build small village, watch it grow like a plant and be excited about your progress. You started with just a few peasents and a little bit of resources and you were able to make such an amazing settlement, you take a step back and look at how hard you've worked. Then all the players that sink a ton of money into the game come in and stomp all over it, even if you're playing it peacefully, not attacking others, only AI, and if someone attacks you and they explain that they have a perfectly good reason for it other than ""just for the resources"" or ""for the fun of it"", you just forgive them and never hold it against them. Well the Pay to Win players just attack for the fun of it, or to keep you from even getting up to where they are. The big dogs only see us small pups and the people that play this to have a good time and experience a new type of gameplay as a threat from the day we even drop into the server, and the game's PVP attack immunity doesn't even help, becuase the moment that goes away and they've had your eye on you from day 1, then nothing is stopping them from marching straight to your village, with 100+ troops, destroying the beautiful and incredible castle you worked so hard on. And once they destroy your castle, next thing you know, they already sent another army to clean up what the 1st one couldn't, then they kick you to the ground, spit on your face, and end your entire game there. Not even trying again will help you because then this entire process will start all over again.The only way to win is to give the devs money, that's it. Real world money is what drives this entire game, not skill, not tactics, not teamwork of other F2P players like you that actually want to see what this game has to offer. Without giving money, these devs just throw you to the wolves, that's it, they don't care about all the higher up breaking the rules, as long as they keep giving money to stay ahead, then anything goes. I hate to see that a game this unique is completely ruined by money and people who stay on for literally months, that's right, MONTHS, on end and never even shut down the game just so they can watch over the little guy and plan on how to end them the very second they get.This game would be great if the rich people and the higher ups didn't stomp on everyone who can't afford even the smallest in-game item like me. It would be better if it was better controlled, alt accounts are against game rules, but they don't have a way to enforce it, so you got 1 person, with a ton of money, creating 10+ accounts, ruling a huge chunk of land, sinking tons of money into those accounts, collecting all the resources they can get, just to hammer down all of the players that just want to explore the game.This game needs to be better moderated, give the F2P players a fighting chance, and even out the balance of power, becuase all those are the reason I do not recommend this game.

												""Stronghold Kingdoms"" is an answer to strategy fans who want to play in an online living and breathing world.I wanted to wait a few monthes till I review it to give a better review as the game is massive and the amount of layers it has is enourmous.Some words about the game:- Takes place on a real map, one can choose to start in many maps such as : World, Europe, Germany, UK, USA, Poland, Turkey, France, Italy, Russia etc.- You play as a lord with a fuedal titel starting from  a ""village idiot"" up until ""crown prince"", those in essence are equivalent to ""levels"" in MMORPGs and provide you with more possibilities. You rank up by gaining ""Honor"" which is in essence ""Experience"" in MMORPGs. Honor can be collected in noumerous ways: Be it warefare, economy or pollitics.- The core of the game is building and developing yours villages castles, of course as being built villages can also be conquered.Economy:-Resources are gathered from natural deposits and are used to build buildings or craft weapons (wood, stone, pitch and iron).-Food is used to feed your population (apples, cheese, meat, bread, vegetables, fish and ale)-Goods are used to hold banquets increasing your honor (meat, clothes, metalwork, furniture, wine, spices, silk and salt)-Weapons are used to arm your people (Bows, Pikes, Swords, Catapults)- Every resource can be created, traded or foraged.- Everything is wraped under a large research tree.Warefare:- Scouts are used to gather reports about enemy castles.- Armies are used to both defend your villages and attack your enemies villages.Politics:- There is a beautiful fuedal system in place, lower ranks answer to their lieges in the following system: Village < Perish < County < Province < Country. The higher position you hold the more glory you bring to your house. Political positions are acquired through voting but of course can be pressured using warefare or religeon influence.- Lords fight under a banner of a faction (equivalent to guild in MMORPGs), and factions fight under a banner of a house.- At end game houses struggle over the map domination.Costs:- How much does this cost?Sadly a freemium bussiness model is in place which means that you can invest as much as you want.In my opinion in order to stay competitive an investment of a few euros per month will be necessary.- Will a player that invests more money that you have certain advantages? Yes, he will develop and progress faster. Is this a deal breaker? Absolutly not, some people play longer and some people pay longer... Up to each one.N.B:- Some people are unhappy about being razed, conquered and loosing all their hard worked on villages. I would like to say a few words about that:It is true that ""Stronghold Kingdoms"" is not for the weak hearted... Yes you may loose all your villages in a war but you will get a new village and will still keep your fuedal rank, your research, your gold, faith and honor. So rebuilding is not a big deal and it is faster every time, like in real life... Sometimes we fall, but the whole point is to raise up again, this time even stronger.To summerize:A brilliant massive online strategy game that allows one to play as he wants. You may concentrate on warefare, farming, pollitics, religeon or whatever suits your intrests best.Look me up on Europa 3 ;)			"

												I have played all the Stronghold Games, and this game is very addictive i've spent over 600 hours in this all together with this account, with my other steam account and out of steam. It's alot of fun but it is a PAY TO WIN game, and I've tried playing with and without paying in this game.Stronghold Kingdoms took the Original Stronghold idea and made it into an online game,it is divided into five main areas:Your Villages : Where you build up your economy, you make your population happy or angry by increasing the tax levels, the ammount of food they will receive and the ale they are allowed to the drink.These 4 factors will give you honor, which is used to conquer, pillage raze or plunder other player's villages. You can get more honor by making banquets. Your Castles: Castles have always been a huge part of Stronghold games. Using the resources you get from improving your village you will be able to build huge castles to protect your economy and productivity. These castles can then be garrisoned by the troops you create, Either pikemen, archers, swordsmen or catapults. The People Around you/ Houses: Having alot of players in the same game just pillaging each other until the last man standing wouldn't be much fun all the time, So the developers decided to create Houses, these are like Factions you join there are 20 houses in the game, Each house has a marshall that decides what the house should do next.These houses devide into factions in the House which are controlled by high ranking members. The best invasion I have ever seen was the Invasion of England which was controlled by House 1 in the Europe World, France(House 11), Spain(House 9) and Portugal(House 9) all decided to go against H1, in 1 day it was in shatters most of the players had been eliminated or just deserted they're House. It was truly an impressive feet. Armies and Vassals: As you grow in the game you can decide to have liege lords ( Someone who will protect you from other people, send you resources and armies to defend yourself) and have vassals, in which case you do the same thing to the people you decide, Each vassal allows a maximum of 500 troops to be garrisoned in the village allowing the liege lord to have thousands upon thousands of men ready for an attack. And Research: Research is a major factor in Stronghold Kingdoms because it allows the player to get a step ahead on other people, either in farming, military or industry.It takes alot of time and efford to become powerful in stronghold kingdoms without Paying money.Took me about 100 days to become powerfull and that's going to stronghold every day to check up on what's going on. And what made me angry as hell was seeing that in 5 days Using loads of money a player got to The max rank! 5 DAYS man!! What in the â¥â¥â¥â¥!!  It just made all my effords seem meaningless. Therefore I do not recommend this game, it is a time waster Do not play this unless you want to spend large ammounts of your time and money.			"

												Big NO to this game, not just because it's Pay 2 Win, but because there are so many abusive ways that players use to try to win the game and the developers do nothing about it although these actions are against their rules. (Why hurt cheaters as long as they pay?)No matter how you try to start the game, no matter how you choose your playstyle, someone destroys you with the help of his alt accounts (which is illegal according to the game rules, but who cares about cheating as long as they buy crowns?)Best case scenario, you start totally neutral in a newly opened server, you try to be nice to other people, you're not behind, everything is ok for now, you help other players, join the faction that is stronger, communicate with others. Some guy makes an alt account, spawns in your parish, starts to build up and after 5 days he starts ransacking you (which means with each attack you lose atleast 1 building), You're probably thinking ""so what? defend!! build a castle"", now here's the problem, after only 10 days of play, without paying hundrends of dollars you can't be that strong to build a great castle and rank up fast at the same time, you either choose to play the honour path which leaves your castle vulnerable, or you play turtle, which again leaves you with a small amount of resources which is not exactly enough to build a castle that can defend agianst a troll who attacks with 80 peasants, his 80 peasants just need to destroy your wall and stay in the white line for 5 seconds, Nothing at that level of play can prevent upgraded peasants from entering the white area of your castle. and you're done, atleast one of your buildings is destroyed, now imagine losing a building every hour, 24 buildings per day, you're absolutely done. You lose all your buildings and you don't even know what to do except to start over. The funny thing is the honour cost to attack trolls is so high that neither you nor your allies can attack them without losing 90% of your honour (obviously no one helps you because of the honour cost). And even if you attack! he will just wait a day or two and then starts attacking again, even if you raze and destroy him, he will just respwan again and starts building and attacking once again. And meanwhile his main account is dominating and you're wondering if it's better to move to another parish or continue here!!People use alt accounts to attack, trade, to vote, any form of cheat you can imagine, and after all this you realize you've wasted your time over a game that kicks you back to day 1 every time you feel great about yourself... And they still need your money! otherwise you're back to square one...No! Please Don't Play This Game...			"

												Enjoyable at first due to the game being well designed in the terms of trade/scout and the abilty to lvl up your ""research points"" pretty much how you like.Game overall score 6/10Cons that drove down the score are : Multiplayer is abit out of sorts with 1 person controlling vast areas just waiting for a new player to steal his village , buyable cards to  crush your foes with your wallet not skills , far far too time consuming and hard to manage said time unless your stuck too your computer 24/7 /w a toilet under you to make sure you dont waste resources and or time "

												I Don't recommend playing this when you have family over who have the game and wants play it on one of your PCs, reason is, the admins are too strict when it comes to account IP adresses, because the moment they see the same IP They give that account the ban hammer, so it makes it hard to play with family.

												Rise of The Wolf update has damaged this game, especially if you are relatively new.I enjoyed the game when I first started, it was a very slow paced medieval city builder with custom designed castles and such. I spent my days gaining resources and slowly beefing up my stronghold and donating extra resources to my local parish capitol.Days of doing this was quite relaxing, and the occasional Ai attack spiced things up. Seeing how well my newly made fortifications held up against 30, then 60, then 100, then 130 enemies was quite fun.I also thought it was very cool getting to view battles between my parish and our enemy Ai, Pig. Large scale battles taking place every day while we fuel the parish with resources was amazing.Then Rise of The Wolf happened.All at once we had an enemy Siege camp, wolf dens, bandit camps, Pig and its castle of doom, and all of the associated negative morale. Pig for what ever reason appears to target my town exclusively, on top of daily sieges and bandit raids.Within 3 days my forces had been reduced to 3 archers and 2 morale resulting in a single peasant every 12 hours, my food consumption was set to max to boost morale with very little effect and my taxes were already starting to drain what little gold reserve I had. Then I realize that no one is attacking Pig, the siege camp, or the bandits.. and it appears most of their aggression is focused towards me. Our parish apparently had been innactive for several days prior so help from them was a long ways off.After speaking out in global chat, I found out that I am not the only one facing this scenario. The competent players are away or ignoring the enemies, while the weak and defenceless are destroyed by the new enemy spawn rate.So, unless you know a strong player and can get cozy with them and their army, stay away until Rise of The Wolf is put to rest.

												Regarding Kingdoms....Update: This game and those who support it  (FireflyStudios) apparently didnt  like the fact that I had ANYTHING negative to say about this game. Shortly after my ""mostly good"" review of SHK was posted here, my (and my borther's) accounts were both banned without any explanation. I created several tickets trying to find out why but this same terrible Customer Service rep(""Lord Efficient"") kept pasting canned responses about not being able to respond to individual requests, and closing the ticket.Apparently, they can take the time to ban individual acocunts for whatever they feel like is a good reason but they are FAR TOO BUSY to tell the accused what they are being accused of, much less actually using the Ban Appeals section of the system for...you know... ban appeals (Id setlle for a coherent explanation). But, I guess f you never bother to tell someone what they are banned for, you dont have to worry about them attempting to appeal. Way to stay classy, Firefly.   So at this point my account, which I have spend a couple hundred dollars on over the course of a couple of years, is banned with no explanation and (what appears to be ) their only support rep has no skills beyond copy/paste and close ticket. And this was in the BAN APPEALS section of their ticketing system. I have emailed the Firefly Head of PR about how their customers are being treated, with no response, so I suppose the disregard for their customer's happiness appears to have infected the majority of Firefly employees. I am now taking steps to get my preorder (through STEAM) of Stronghold Crusader 2 refunded as Firefly is even worse than EA in their treatement of, or regard for their customers. I, personally, do not want another one of my dollars to benefit Firefly IN ANY WAY. I play many MMO games and have never been treated like this. Even when I was accused of a TOS violation (later proven not true), I was told what I was being accused of and give a chance to answer the accusations. You will not get this courtesy out of StrongholdKingdoms support.  So If you do decide to play this game, PLEASE do not pay them for premium as you will likely, at some point, regret every dollar spent (just as I do now). Fair Warning...Dustedpuppy			"

They simply don't wanna lose a costumer and let him break the rules, i know the game is kind of pay to win and i am okay with that, but pay to break rules and get away with it something unacceptable.

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a very slow paced game that requires a lot of diplomacy with other players. It's a type of game that you leave on when you're browsing. I have played this game since early 2012 to late 2014. I really like the card system In Stronghold Kingdoms. The artwork is very nice, I really like it. Most of the content is reused from old Stronghold games but I still like it. The people I've met are very nice and friendly.However, It was very fun when I played the game at first, I played it every day, it was very addicting and I spent a lot of hours in this game before I downloaded the Steam version. I downloaded the steam version more than a year later. I started playing on World 4 when the server was still 30 days old. The game just gets boring after a some hundred days where everyone has a high rank and the world becomes dull. I tried to like it in my last few hundred days playing but it just didn't work. Then I stopped playing at about day 800. People say this game is pay to win, I kinda agree. Things like premium token will give you progress faster in the game.I have mixed feelings about this game. I like the Stronghold series. But I don't recommend this game. Because in long term playability, it kinda sucks. Stronghold Kingdoms might be enjoyable and fun at first, but in a year or several months, the World(server) will become dull. You'll need to play it every day or else you could lose all your progress, because if you have an enemy, they will try to wipe you out.			"

												Originally, the game was great.  Not only did it, like many games, have incredible potential - but even the game as it stood was really good.But then the Devs continued to add cards to the game....   to the point where the game was nothing more than a race to see who could spend the most money.  I spent far more on this game than anyone should - and I know of dozens of players who have spent thousands over the course of a few months.If you want to give it a try - go for it, but it won't be hard to see just how important it is to pay a LOT of money.  Don't think you'll just sink $20 into it or something.			"

												I'm only saying no, because I'm on the fence. If you've got the real-life money to support the in-game upgrades, then you're fine and you'll really enjoy the game, without, you're kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. For a 'free' game, it's not so free.The whole game is in real-time, and that's ok. However, with every building you place, and every thing you research, it bumps up the time. No matter the type of building, or research option. Just adds minutes to the time. And that's not so bad, until it hits over 30 minutes and you haven't got the tokens to have a building and research queue. So with this, it takes a long time to build up a decent, protected base with enough peasants to train a competent army to defend your stronghold. Problem with that is, you're a new player, and this is an online world. A lot of players will ignore rule 7 - don't be aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and just attack you for the sake of attacking. For me, who is a slow learner, that just makes the game even harder and unfair. the 2 days worth of protection at the beginning is great, but I think that needs to be a week. In a week you an have a decent wooden defence line and a good-ish sized army (depending on how happy you keep the peasants) to protect your stronghold after the timer goes out. Other than that, the user friendly-ness of the game is great, and I love the option that you get to keep the tutorial pages near by, in case you forget anything, then you an just turn it off when you're ready, and that's awesome. The graphics are alright, but since they're really simple, it doesn't lag your computer, which is a bonus if you run off wireless all the time like me. I also like having the different tabs at the top, keeping everything seperated out and neat really helps you get to grips with the game. So overall, I like the game and won't stop playing it, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'm just stubborn and miss being able to play the old Stronghold games.(Saving the money up for the complete pack though) "

												TL;DR: Got hacked, support said 'that's nice'Alright, so back in 2012 after playing this game for a few hours... (412 or so)I had an issue where my account was compromized in what I believe was an attempt by other players to destabilize our group by getting into other players' accounts and messing them up. They deleted my base, insulted all my friends, and spent all of my cards purchased with REAL MONEY.I contacted the devs to see if anything could be done and I was PROMPTLY IGNORED.I contacted them now that the new update was released, wanting back into the game after logging in and finding out that my account was blocked...And was told this: ""This account was blocked in 2012 and will not be reopened.   Players are responsible for the security of their own log in information.""Not even a ""we'll look into it"", ""we'll reset your account so you can play again"", or anything...Now because of their refusal to ever even acknowledge that my account was compromised, my steam account is banned from their game. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE WHO VALUES THEIR TIME, MONEY, OR EFFORT. "

												I was suckered into this on a random search for free-to-play games on Steam.  Time, more than anything, will be your ""make or break"" factor here.  No, you don't have to be on 24/7.  But if you want to be very successful, or rather ""not lose,"" you'll kind of have to have this in your background on a consistent basis; for example, I haven't actually played nearly 600 hours of SHK, but it ""has"" been running on my computer for that amount of time.  The mediocre charm of planting your custom-named village(s) on a real-time map wears off quickly and you're left with a grind that you can try solo'ing forever alone, or deal with inter-House politics with others in the competitive aspect of the game if you're social enough.I promise you: there are a million better ways to spend your time.  I do not suggest you waste it on this Facebook browser game not appropriately placed on Facebook.			"

												Although it is a fairly fun and exciting stratergy game, I have many problems with it. The actually game play is very slow with building times and research times getting longer and longer each time you build or research something. The scouts take about half an hour (real time) to reach an item and return when it is not that far away from your kingdom or village. Until about 10 minutes ago (from when I'm writing this), I was queueing things up like buildings and research items so I could leave the game to work for me. Now, I have to get premium coins to queue things. This means I have to check on everything more often and the game play is slow enough as it is. Now I understand this is a Free to Play game so I would guess the company would put an option in to buy things with real money so they can get some money from it but when one of the achievements is to buy coins? It makes it a game I want to punch in it's metaphorical face. I'm going to continue to play this game because I am determined to find a way to win without paying but don't start if you haven't already.			"

												     I'll admit, I certainly played this game a lot. However, I can't really recommend it. The game centers around building and protecting villages. They can be attacked by other players and the AI. That may seem like a really simplistic view of the game, but that's the core. There is not much else to it than that. Every action a player takes is for their village. There are some interesting upgrades players can get through research and buildings, but it all takes time. For me, that is what this game boiled down to. Time. A big ol' swirling drain full of time. Players can pay to accelerate the process, but why bother? The rewards are simply not worth the time required. TL;DR - Takes too much time to do anything.6/10			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms has some good ideas including an excellent village building system, interesting and balanced research tree and challenging castle building process. Although the game is free to play, it is impossible to be a strong player without purchasing coins and card points. The top players spend massive amounts of money to crush ordinary foes. Additionally, the game drags on for a very long time and soon grows stale. After a few weeks, the servers  largely empty out as most players get bored or are destroyed. Stronghold could be an excellent long term game with some improvements, but now it is a pay to win money machine.			"

Within two days, my entire collection of villages were raided and captured by various factions and houses, because I had engaged in an 'act of war' They also blacklisted me in that world. I've created six different villages since then, and each one gets razed as soon as my protection wears off.Extremely pay to win, yes. But I was fine with that, as I never paid much and was able to make the most of it. However, after these dealings with the community ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥lords in the game, all the money I have invested into this game is now officially down the tube.

												This game is fun, untill you realize its completely rigged. You can farm and attack AI targets. But once you try to get into factions and lead houses then the game changes dramactically. Once you become good enough to be a threat and you start gaining ground in an honorable way of war. You will get banned, for no given reason or explanation. When the ban is lifted most of your villages are completely burned to the ground. You will eventually notice that one team can do whatever they want and say whatever they want with no reprocussions. While your neighbor is banned for 2 days for naming his village ""Brewing Jesus Juice"" and others will have names like ""I willâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥(Player Name)"" or ""You are all Mother F#)*%#""- of course it will be properly spelled.. It will sink in that Writers and Mediators for this game are actively playing and playing to win with their group that they let do whatever they want. There are players in this game that have to spend $100 plus a month to be able to do what they do. Game is basically rigged they milk you for your money and then they cut you off and take it all away from you. DONT PLAY THIS GAME.. BETTER OFF PLAYING FARMVILLE...			"

												I loved the original concept.  However, FireFly has changed the rules so that it is more of a pay to win game than a strategy game. The addition of certain cards, and rule changes favor those that wish to win at all costs!  I don't care for games where others are better than I am just because they have more money than I do, or because they can sit in front of their computer all day long.  I enjoy learning a skill, or technique, and then being able to use it against an opponent that is not expecting it.  However, in Kingdoms, there are not many new skills or techniques to keep the game exciting.  The actual excitement comes from meeting new people, and then, that is usually in a teamspeak, or raidcall room.  But, you could do that with any game.No, I no longer recomment this game!  If you got to play in the first couple of years, it was great, but, that is no longer the case.			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is as much a game of politics as it is a game of Medieval warfare or simulation. The articulate politician will find himself advancing far more quicker than the warrior and it is not at all uncommon to find House Marshalls who have only razed a handful of players.First I'd like to address the two foremost complaints about Stronghold kingdoms; Pay to Win and Multi AccountersMulits - Players controlling 2 or more accounts per game world.The problem here is twofold and blame falls equally on both the players and Firefly. All too often I see a user on the forums calling for heads to roll after he reports a player suspected of cheating and nothing happens. The paranoid player would do well to remember that suspicious does not equal guilty and that Firefly will not disclose the outcome of any investigation to the player who filed the report. If it appears nothing has been done it's likely because the investigation turned up nothing illicit and remember the more information you include in your report the more likely the accusation is to be investigated. The other half of blame sits squarely upon Firefly's shoulders in my opinion due to the sheer ambiguity of the game rules. Time and time again I've had players coming to me with multiple accounts firm in their insistence that they weren't breaking any rules because they ""had premium tokens in play on both accounts"". Despite what anyone might say to convince you otherwise the above allegation is flat out untrue. Regardless of premium tokens, players are only allotted one account per game world. All Firefly here has to do is update the game rules page to be less ambiguous in regards to the IP restrictions and premium players clause but they will not and this apathy towards one of the top complaints about Stronghold Kingdoms promotes the continued perpetuation of the myth that Firefly doesn't care and that they don't investigate informed allegations against suspected cheaters. Pay To Win - The belief that to succeed at any level in Stronghold Kingdoms the player must spend liberal amounts of money to obtain their own virtual crown. Pay to Win (or P2W) is a hotly debated topic in many 'Free to play' games and the same applies to Stronghold Kingdoms and there is no doubt that in this case it's a grey area for sure. But to answer whether or not the game is p2w one must first define what winning means to them and what winning means to Firefly. For many players 'to win' is to beat another player in a one on one mano a mano fight. Providing both players are of the same skill level and neither receive any outside help there is no doubt that whichever of the two players spends more on the game will ultimately be the winner. There are just too many cards in the Stronghold Kingdoms deck that artificially boost combat stats such as army speed or the strength of castle structures and Firefly doesn't help the matter by continuing to introduce more powerful combat cards all the time. Sure, the only players who use those aces are probably the top 0.5% but in worlds with dwindling playerbases those players hold the entire server at their collective whim. In contrast, many experienced players realize that winning is actually more than a one on one fight and that loosing one battle doesn't mean the war is lost and that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of players participating on both sides of the conflict, carder and non carder alike. This means that while you are going up against a house with spending players your house will likely have spending players of it's own which levels the playing field. Firefly's definition is similar to the above, Houses compete against one another to gain glory, ultimately eliminating all others houses to be the last one standing. That final House is considered the winner of that age and inducted into the hall of fame while their members all share in on the spoils of the victory which mostly consists of a few quest wheel spins, card packs, and new charges for their coat of arms. This means that to 'win' Stronghold Kingdoms all one has to actually do is be a member of whichever house is left standing when the dust settles. As you can now see the definition of winning in stronghold Kingdoms is actually quite subjective and by paying attention to ongoing house politics virtually anyone can achieve victory regardless of their financial status. ## Now that that's cleared up.... ##Although my Steam time doesn't show it, I have played Stronghold Kingdoms via the Standalone client for almost 3 years now and in that time I have been active in many roles. I'm currently on a sort of hiatus with Stronghold Crusader 2 gearing up for release.Anyways, here's what I liked:+ First and foremost is the community, a game that pretty much coerces you into logging in every day lends itself to the establishment of long distance relationships that can become something like a second family to you. + 2D graphics invoke a nostalgic feeling in fans who have been with the Stronghold franchise from it's inception. + Freedom to design my castle as I please, there is no generic 'castle' building that is placed with one click. You have to determine where each wall segment and Stone Tower will be built. + Village building can be as simple or as intricate as you want, village buildings fit together much like a puzzle and those who take the time to optimize their village layout will enjoy increased production.  What I felt could be improved on:- Battles aren't fought in real time, you play puzzle games by setting up your troops and letting the AI resolve it. The AI is quite predictable and stupid at times. - The ingame chat system is so unintuitive it actually drives players away from the game. - The entire card system requires too much micromanagement. For a game that requires more and more of your time as you grow having to juggle cards daily to stay competitive gets pretty old pretty quick. - The formula used to generate AI castles needs to take the number of players in that parish into account, not only the rank of the players. It's a real kick in the head to get the strongest wolf castle in your parish every week when the only 3 villages there are yours. What I'd like to see added in the future:> Castles and villages merged into one design, this would mean that defensively strong players would have weaker economies and the inverse for economically strong players. This would encourage greater diversity in playstyle. > Actual RTS battles that allow direct player control of the attacking armies and the defending garrison if the player so wished. > More units, especially siege units. Even the original Stronghold had twice as many units as there are currently in Stronghold Kingdoms. In short, yes, I strongly recommend this game. It's probably the best free to play RTS on Steam at this moment, and while the graphics hail from a previous decade they still retain the charm of the original Stronghold. - IGN DavidSpy			"

												The game's too old, leading to the balances of power across basically all servers being so rigid that as a new (or in my case, returning) player have zero chance of catching up - ESPECIALLY not, if you refuse to pay for premium content, like the ability to build multiple buildings over night. Depending on where you have the misfortune of spawning, you may end up with players that raze your village a few hours after spawn protection ends, stating via in-game message system that ""they don't like new players"", or a Steward that you have no chance to get rid of while the parish is infested with AI camps, or people that try to force you into their houses by threatening to block the other building places or plainly raid you. Shame! This one was good during the early days, but now it's more or less dying due to the existing structures of power suffocating everything.			"

												As fun as this game can be, it's simply too short to recommend. There's not enough content to last the average gamer more than an hour at best. But in all seriousness, I cannot recommend this game to anyone who is not already invested in it. Many others have justly criticized the game's pay-to-win nature. If you're a skilled, connected, and active player you can be powerful and successful, but you will still have no chance of victory against players who are also skilled, connected, and active but spend huge sums of money on cards that give them massive gameplay advantages - and you can bet that every new world will be filled with this type of player. As a 'moderate carder' who has been blessed to be part of some excellent factions over the years, this hasn't been as huge a problem for me as it would be for the average player, but it's enough to make me wish I'd known before I started playing.Aside from the pay-to-win issue, my greatest gripe with the game is the attitude of the developers - they simply do not care about anything but money. While worthwhile gameplay updates are occasionally released, they often feel like things that should have been included with the game at launch. To this day there are features I would consider basic and essential that are still missing - like the ability to see your total faith generation per day, or a central page where you can modify the rations, taxes, troops, and castle repairs of all villages at once, instead of unnecessarily spending game time doing these things manually on 40 different village screens. And then there's the issue of rule changes. Starting with Age 1 on Day 0 of a new server, each server progresses through 'ages'. New ages reset land holdings and automatically disband factions, while uniquely changing certain global rules like base army speed and the faith cost of monk abilities. But when World 4 reached Age 4, Firefly was apparently too focused on milking their new Europe server to have even defined the Age 4 ruleset. So the whole server was forced to wait several weeks without any defined goals or any knowledge of what we needed to be preparing for. They finally announced the rules, but when the 4th Age actually began most players were horrified to learn that Firefly had reduced the faction player limit from 40 to 20 without saying ANYTHING. Day 1 of 4th Age, 50% of players found themselves without a faction or house. Factions that had been together for years were forcefully broken apart, and faction leaders were left with having to choose who would be left out. No apology was issued, but few players expected one from a company that was so obviously trying to kill old servers.Worst of all, frequent server issues can ruin your gameplay session and give unfair advantages to some players over others. The launch of a new world is generally accompanied by frequent interruptions. I recall one instance in particular during a war where the login servers went down but the game worlds were still up. A server error booted me out of the game and I was unable to log in again, but my enemies who hadn't been booted had a free 4 hour window to attack me. The number of client errors I've experienced have drastically decreased over the last year, but that's hardly a positive if you expect games to be launched in a playable state.Don't get me wrong, this game can be enjoyed - especially if you're playing with friends or making new friends in a well-managed faction - but recommending it for new players would be like an emphysema patient telling kids to take up smoking.

Basically it is comparable to most farmville clones on Facebook. Also this game crashed on me less than ten minutes in. When I went to replay it after the crash is acted buggy and lagged.

												I really like the Stronghold series like Crusader and Stronghold 2 and so on. But this game is just not good and is more pay 2 win like. Takes way to long for basically anything to happen. Only reason I got this game is cause the name Stronghold got my attention from all the other games and that it was free. Overall this game is not really what anybody these days looks for. But just my opinion and game expiriance. Have a good day and thank you for reading my review.			"

												I had been playing the game for some time, and payed about ten dollars for a card pack. It was all going well, I had just started amassing an army of pikemen and was getting ready for my second castle! My first one was pretty awesome and i was pretty proud of it.But then, one morning I log in to see that my castle had been taken by a Lord who had about 13 castles, with an army of like 1 million high tier troops (something I obviously couldn""t dream of defending against).Waste of about 40 hours and 10$. But i did enjoy my time on it, overall the other strongholds are just much better.			"

												after playing this game for thousands of hours (standalone non steam launcher) i will finally review stronghold kingdoms.make a big wide circle around this game unless you are willing to either spend alot of money or waste your life away trying to keep up with the players that do.granted, for about 2 years i had good fun playing this game.i had found a well managed faction.was willing to pay money and the concept was still fresh.also,the server where smaller than what they are now.FF doesnt care about you as the player, all they care about is getting your money and the latest ""update"" changed the rule so that this is blatantly obvious. the one core mechanic that kept the game alive..waging war against other factions/houses...is now locked behind the 2nd highest rank. you can spend alot of money to get to that rank (prince) fast, waste your live playing ""rise of the wolf world"" for free cards and cardpoints or simply just trying to keep up spending 100's of hours to get to the required rank. i have also played the farming part of this game and its incredibly boring.good luck getting support from FF if you run into problems.customer service is awfull to say the least.they will refer you to the forum or reply to you with pre made one liners.FF doesnt develop this game, they have used the same outdated mechanics for years now and bugs that have been in the game for a long time are still present.all in all, if you dont mind spending alot of time or money on this game..do yourself a favor and stay away from SHK.

												I played this for months many moons ago before it came to Steam. So much potential, wasted because it's completely P2W. The community was great. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and I enjoyed chatting with them all, but the tedious pace of the gameplay eventually wears you down. Eventually you actually start considering buying cards.....just about the time your sanity snaps back and you delete the game instead of wasting your hard earned cash.If you like idle games, this may be fun for you. But you will never be able to keep up with people who pay for cards in this game, and the extremely slow pace will drive you nuts. Everything takes forever to happen in the game.  Cards are the only way to advance at more than a glacial pace, and they really are not worth it.			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a griefer heaven; it's even more hardcore than Eve Online. You can spend months and hundreds of dollars building your villages and castles, then lose them all in a matter of minutes to someone else who spent even more months and thousands of dollars. New players will find themselves losing everything they've built on a weekly basis to other players with forces so superior they won't even break a sweat. Unlike other hardcore games like Eve Online, your village can't run or hide. As soon as your ""newb shield"" drops, your possessions go to feed whoever gets to steal them first. If you're lucky, you'll end up next to someone willing to help you. That just means it will take slightly longer for you to lose all your stuff. Why am I still playing even though I give it a NO recommendation? Because I don't care how many villages I lose as long as there's someone weaker than me, so I can wipe them out and spam them with ""GG NOOB MUCH TRYHARDS"".You've been warned.			"

												I played this game alot before on the non-steam version before so i'd like to talk about my experience. It's fun to have economics, politics and war all play essential roles in the game and it's entertaining to play because of nice surprises that happen. However it is extremely time consuming as you have to check up on everything every day or so (especially if you are a steward  or faction leader, or else, bad things will happen... It has happened to me 3 times that when i checked up on the game in the morning, everything and all my villages were gone... isn't that nice... It's also pay to win, some people spend alot of money on this game so they can be ontop, for example if a player is p2w they can reach top rank once a new world starts in an hour because they have purchased so many cards, which can literally do just about anything in the game; add recources, get military units, speed up castle and village buildings, get peasants, get money, get honour. So the requirements to play this are: A small loan of a million dollars. (hehehehe Donald Drumf jokes), another one. And last but not least.... another one. and then you're good to go and rule the world that will forever feel sad and sorry because they can't do anything.... because they can't pay. '-.- *sigh*			"

												I quit after about 30 minutes, This game is a typical mobile Pay-to-win, unlike what ZAM said (They were paid off or something). You start out with about 4 villagers, and each villager is super important, as they make buildings work, can scout for food, and be turned into military units. You get units by making the overall population happy. you do this by making more space, bribing them, or feeding them. But you can also just PAY REAL MONEY to increase your happiness, or PAY REAL MONEY to buy villagers, you can really just PAY REAL MONEY to do anything in this game, which is why it sucks hard.			"

												Soul-slurping, pay-to-win garbage. Without spending real cash you cannot be competitive. Look at my hours played. Not all of them were actively playing the game but being logged in because if people KNOW you are offline, you'll be attacked if you are a powerful player. I was a powerful player at one point and a ""wallet warrior"" as I spent a lot more money on this game than I should have (I cringe now when I look at the spreadsheet I made to track my purchases of in-game currency).To be a powerhouse, you are forced to spend lots of money (as in hundreds if not thousands of dollars) to buy premium tokens and card packs (which usually contain garbage). You can earn cards without cash, but it's not easy or a productive use of time. The price of ""booster packs"" are insane, especially their Ultimate Packs (which cost almost 5 bucks a pop!). I've opened them and gotten nothing but common cards which is a complete rip-off.There are a lot of people who cheat at this game by account-sharing, using 3rd party programs, etc. You cannot win against these people. You can't catch them unawares and they just keep coming back like herpes to attack you when you are offline and are unable to effectively defend yourself. Reporting them does nothing. If they spend money in the game, the developer will let them get away with almost anything.Also, servers quickly become stagnant once one group of whales and their tag-alongs achieve world domination. Once this happens, most people just leave the server and go to a new one, which is why they keep opening new servers all the time. This stagnation is probably deliberate as the very start of a server is when the developer makes all their money due to the whales blowing cash to try to race to the top first.Avoid this game like the plague unless you want no life and like spending your way to the top.

If a player doesn;t start from DAY 1 of a new launch, there is no way to survive even if you try to stay nuetral due to bullying allowed in game play.  If you complain very little happens especially if you spend real money to buy cards and loose everything it is just your tuff luck.			"

												Played this game will over 1000 hours, and have a good amount of hours off steam as well. And one thing i have to say about this game is its extremely addictive. The start of the game can be a bit slow and boring but once you figure everything out and know what research is best for what you need and all around aspects of the game, its really fun. End game and joining a house is a big part of it and makes the game that much funner. Many people say its P2W, yet the cards do help extremely, it doesnt mean that someone without cards can't wreck too. There are treasure castles in order to get card points and card packs to keep up with all the cards. Theres also free cards weekly and quests in order to earn some extra rewards. Eventually, once you meet people and unify, the game becomes much more open and you dont have to pay a dime. I reccomend the steam starter pack, which will help you boost passed those beginning levels and get to dominating.			"

												Well, when I first played this game a year ago, I loved it. It downloaded fast and was able to play in seconds. It was fun, exciting and good to play while doing something else. The beginning was rough, it seemed like impossible to get to an acceptable rank. Luckily I was invited to join a group of other nearby lords who later in the game invited me to the House. When I was first invited the game went smoothly because of all the support my allies gave me. Soon after I was a target for an enemy House. Of course this House member payed to get insane amount of cards, tokens and etc., and then I got destroied. I didn't pay into this game, but now I see I should. There is such a huge advantage against people who pay-to-win. I seriously don't agree with ZAM, stating ""it is not a pay-to-win"". It is. Again I tried playing again later down the year and of course the same thing happened on a different server. I thought this was ridiculous and a joke. I quit and wouldn't even bother playing with the new update. 4/10.			"

												   I liked the overall idea of the game, some of the graphics, and the possible interaction with others in the game, but that is about as far as it goes.   The progression is extremely slow, from harvesting supplies, building structures, recruiting armies, to advancement of learning. Costs for structures, armies, and such are too high in my opinion based on the length of time to aquire them. The quests in the game are decent with one exception. You can only have one atcive at a time and if something happens while you are offline that would have completed an inactive quest for you, you missed out. This game takes way too much time in my opinion to be worth it. Oh and it offers a protection period when you start the game, however, I was attacked by the AI bandits before my protection was over and lost all my army and spent most of my supplies rebuilding my castle.( which took hours)   You could spend real money to advance, but what is the point when it gets wasted after you are attacked and cannot repair your castle or rebuild your army before the next attack. Even for a free game I wouldn't try it. "

												One of many online browser games under the same genre, pay-to-win. I came in expecting this game to be like all others, Pay-to-win vs non payers. Although I see why the company would want In-game purchases, and I respect it fully. Although the constant destruction from other people who are in-game ""centuries"" ahead is annyoing and downright game killing. In Conclusion: Pay-To-Win, without paying.. Game is playable but at a rate unbelievably slow and frustrating.Difficult after the ""Safety"" era, finding it hard to not get dumped on.Nothing I expected differed from ingame itself.4/10, not good, not horrible.. Just ""Meh""			"

Title: ""Stronghold Kingdoms""Release Date: 28 Feb, 2012Developer: FireFly StudiosPublisher: FireFly StudiosGenre / Tags: Free to Play, Massively Multiplayer, Strategy1. OverviewYou have to forget about your real life and live only in this game if you wanna to achieve a really high results in this game... or... the second way is... constantly spend a large sums on donations...2. GameplayThe lack of donate feels particularly acute when you have two or more villages: warehouses are limited and you have to sell each package from the tons of your resources separately, after this you have to wait at the time when the traders sells them, the numbers of traders are also limited and they have the limited load; without donations every soldier in your army should be recruited personally by you from the peasants, but you must wait from few tens of minutes to several hours when each of them will come to your village; you don't see any statistics of your villages and each of all the parameters of the village must be checked and set or changed personally by you in the manual mode in each of your villages.So, ""donations"" is an automatic mode of the game, ""without donations"" - your personal time and only the manual mode almost to any of the aspects in the game.Also, don't expect to see your village intact if you decide to have a rest a little time and don't launch the game for a few days. Constant attacks of AI or others players will partially destroy your castle and you must almost every day launch the game and manually repair your castles in each villages, districts or capitals.3. VerdictThis game is the game of donations, ""farmers"" and the unapproachable castles - often you can find the castles which never can't be successfully stormed only by you or almost impossible to be successfully stormed by you and all your allies together.This is an unique online game with this setting and concept, good continuation of the first part of the ""Stronghold""... but all the beauty of this game can being received only with donations...Don't start to play this game... Be free...4. RecommendationsIf you like the games with the such theme, I can advise...Similar games: ""Stronghold"" (2001).			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is another F2P game ruined with pay-to-win elements. No matter how much time and in-game money you spend on your villages. No matter how tough and strategic your defenses are. There's always that one f*cker who's going to attack you with an invincible army they bought for $400. And of course they're going to attack while you're asleep and can't do sh*t about it. Of course you can just spam your villages with monks. That way you can prevent anyone from attacking you. But guess what? The enemy player can just buy more monks and remove your protection.Don't play this game unless you're willing to spend $3000 on it.			"

												I would not recommend this game. The whole thing relys on having skillful active opposition when in reality only a small number of players seem active in each world, the rest being fodder for those who are. There is no skill involved other than being able to use a timer to make all your armys land at once. The game feels generally empty and pointless, the in game chat system is not used much and from what i saw private TS is often empty. There is very little here other than a game on the ""free to play"" bandwagon flaunting the stonghold brand hoping you might spend a bit of money before you realise what a let down the whole thing is.

												As compelling as the concept of this game is, it suffers the blight of freemium. Artificial wait times and paid perks are scattered across this game in excess.Some will say that a company has a right and obligation to include ways to make money. They could have done that with a fifth of what they've injected into this game, and done fine besides.Do yourself a favor. Spend the five or ten dollars up front to get a decent MMO, pay a monthly fee even. You still will pay less, for a far better experience.			"

												If you want a decent enough game completely ruined by the pay to win factor then this is the game for you. The in game system for buying cards means that while it might not be a complete trade off for time put in the huge advantage of paying makes it a bad game to play. Cards can be used for army units, resources (including ones that help you level up and gain access to more technology and such), faster movement and more. Add on to that the fact if you get special tokens (using real money) you get building queues, tech queues and auto scouting / attacks.Overall it isn't a bad game but the pay to win aspect does make it bad if you are not willing to invest loads for every advantage. Generally one of those games about long term however long term for me doesn't include having to constantly pay to be on par with other players.Generally speaking knowledge and such will only go so far when everything is lacking compared to a heavily paying user.EDIT:Almost 2 years later tried to access game only to find out my account is locked out and I had to contact customer support. It seems customer support is ""investigating"" issues with payments in the past so either they can't do anything in almost 2 years or they are just banning me for paying them and having issue with the service. AVOID LIKE  THE PLAGUE.			"

It will give you nothing, other than you may pick up some friends from around the world. Then you will hate the world and throw you wallet at it. The world has more money than you. You can only stay up for 72 hours protecting your hard earned land and poorly spend inheritance then you will sleep. Russia will win. You will have nothing when you arise from your 24 hour coma. No lands, no castles, no friends, no family, no inheritance. Russia wins. They always win.  Now they will win at sea. Run aways me matey.			"

												If you want to buy your victory play this. If you want rule because you earned it... Good luck. I find this a failed attempt, I play this game quite a bit, but that's only because Mobile is on the way. I feel if firefly gave this another try with natural geological formations instead of a flat boring same as everyone else's land, and if they didn't use these gimmicky cards, I believe this game would do way better, just slap a 15.00$ tag. Trust me, you'd make way more money off of sales in units compared to 3.00$ card sets... All in all, it sounds food on paper, executed poorly.But, it is free, and the game actually does have a cool diplomacy system, and castle building is a waiting game but it's really pleasing watching your castle develop.There is a wait time in building though, something used in cash cow money grubbing Clash of Clans mobile games, that's probably what killed this, it doesn't work because Firefly has a relatively small fanbase, being a ""AA"" company as said by the head of the marketing department , Nick.  [{6/10}]I hope Firefly makes another Castle MMO and doesn't make it so harsh on new players, and Firefly, whatever you do, DO NOT make the next one a free to play, and completely scrap the use of cards, this isn't yu-gi-oh. Not a bad idea, but not well executed. [/u]  "

												I originally played this back in summer 2012 and returned summer 2014 to see what had improved. But like all free to play games it just has too many limitations and timers to recommend on a long term basis.What's good - Watching your village becoming fully operational, scouting, trading, researching and seeing the occasional level up process, watching the battles from bandit camps, wolf lairs or your castle keepWhat's bad - timeframe limits, the only thing that stops this is Maths but ultimately everything just takes too much time unless you play an insta-build card or time speed card and even then it only lasts a few hours. Castle building takes days, village building takes hours, raising your own military requires several researches and buildings which you ""must"" have unless you like being attacked regularly by the AI and having no means of defending yourself thus losing resources. The card system is a mess and you have to click through them until you find what you wanted at the time. 7 day premium tokens and cards are where they want you to pay but really unless you can fully use a 7 or 30 day token dont even bother. If you want me paying Â£3 a throw I expect a 30 day token, not a 7 day one, I think the 7 day ones should be scrapped entirely. But back to my point, you need merchants+speed, scouts+speed, max housing capacity and military to fully get your moneys worth from the tokens, all of which takes time. The biggest thing that kills the game however is research, once you run out of RP you either need to level up or spend gold to get more, Philosophy helps with this but like Maths it's a temporary fix at best.Conclusion - when I first played I was around a few weeks and then left, there were several things I never got to experience like trading for gold or helping a house/faction take an area while watching big all out battles occur, never raided a vilage, never done parish heals, and it goes on and on because the game is basically a giant timesink even with a premium token. Does the token speed everything up? No! Does the token provide you with extra research points? No! And guess what...when you use a token it ONLY applies to the world you were in instead of applying to ALL worlds, sorry but I want my 7 or 30 days to cover all worlds that I play instead of just the 1, forcing you to buy several tokens for the worlds you do play in assuming you can get any fun or enjoyment out of this game. Sorry Stronghold Kingdoms but ultimately you dont offer enough benefits to justify the time spent in the game and you don't do things you SHOULD be doing. Personally I dont have the time to stay up and wait for a timer to end just so I can see the end result. Which means I wont spend the money for cards and/or tokens unless I felt like I was getting proper value for money. You can do better and you can implement changes like what you did for banner creation or the recent avatar update. Give us players more options, more choices, scrap the 7 day token and make the 30 day one viable for 3 pounds a throw, give somebody like me enough of a reason to play and it's a very viable F2P game. But until you do these things I cannot recommend the game long term. This ends my review.FusionBunny			"

												I loved Stronghold on PC but sadly will have to say Stronghold kingdoms online I cannot recommend. Unless you start early on a server you don't have a chance. You will spend all your time building. If you are in a Parish in which all the players as new, the big guys make it immpossible to get anywhere.  If you like political crap then join a faction and house. This game sadly lacks in many area's. For this reason I would say, forget it, it is not like the PC game and spoils a good name in gaming.

												although i've only been at it for a month or so i've not realy got alot thats good to say... ive been razed and capped more times then worth remembering only to have an interdicted time appear when i try do a take back, i think that if the designers dont do something to ballance the pvp and pay to win aspects of the game its probably not going to get many more ""free"" players... this is happening to alot of free games out there, if the thing says free then MAKE IT FREE!!!!!the one good thing i have to say about the game is that when you make allies they generally are helpful and try to protect you (even if it accedentaly gets you killed)			"

												Oh dear, Oh dear.Before I begin, I would like to point out the major problem I have with most ""free to play"" games, Well, two.1. They suck2. They seem to all be based of the ""Farmvile Forumla""Do not get me wrong, there are plenty of Free to Play games that do not do that, like Tribes Ascend, Star Trek Online after the F2P conversion, and a few others that operate on the concept of ""Pay because you're having fun and want to support it."" not ""Pay because you have to."" Those games are fine. Hell, I enjoy playing STO still, even after the F2P change.Stronghold Kingdoms, on the other hand..is a medival reincarnation of Farmvile, but even more hands off! I came into the game expecting a cut-down version of Stronghold, but what I got out of it was pretty much like the fabled ""Age of Empires Online"".When you're put into the game, you're given a basic tutorial, and some things to help. Sadly, it's not much (unless you preordered Crusader 2, or bought the starter pack for some reason), and even if you manage to make do, it's only a matter of time before you run into some barrier, like lack of resources or even not having enough gold. When that happens, you either have to bug your friends, making them hate your guts forevermore, or get your credit card and pay up, which, again, seem very much like the Facebook games we're all spammed with.So then, would I reccomend this game? Are you joking?!  It makes me worry for the future of a decent series, being all pay to win and such.			"

												Fun until ultra serious players come and take over your parish for their own gain and attack you until you decide you've had enough and quit playing. Starting in new worlds doesn't change anything as house and factions dominate almost every parish in the game. Time to create a casual world for players that  are not on all the time and want to enjoy the game without gamers that spend every waking hour of their lives playing this game.			"

												âIt's truly NOT a pay to win gameâ ZAM (First Look) More like lies... If you're not willing to spend any amount of money on this game... You are surely going to fail. I mean it... Even though some would consider my game time inadequate... I for one think it is enough to see most of the game... And I know most of the other reviews have mentioned. That unless you are starting in a new world... You aren't going far...If you still want to download this game to see for yourself. Be my guest... But once the feeling of accomplishment gets you... There is one other player who will make sure that all you worked for... Just vanishes in one whole day.If I were you guys... Stick to the originals... And not this one.			"

												This game is one of those that is always going on, and some actions take hours or even days to complete.  It is very high strategy, and you really can't accomplish anything on your own, though it is fairly easy to fond a group to be a part of.It reminds me of those Facebook games in which you can only perform so many actions in a day unless you want to make some microtransactions.  I have never been a fan of those, and I was really disappointed to realize this to be essentially one of those.			"

												If you want a decent enough game completely ruined by the pay to win factor then this is the game for you. The in game system for buying cards means that while it might not be a complete trade off for time put in the huge advantage of paying makes it a bad game to play. Cards can be used for army units, resources (including ones that help you level up and gain access to more technology and such), faster movement and more. Add on to that the fact if you get special tokens (using real money) you get building queues, tech queues and auto scouting / attacks.Overall it isn't a bad game but the pay to win aspect does make it bad if you are not willing to invest loads for every advantage. Generally one of those games about long term however long term for me doesn't include having to constantly pay to be on par with other players.Generally speaking knowledge and such will only go so far when everything is lacking compared to a heavily paying user.EDIT:Almost 2 years later tried to access game only to find out my account is locked out and I had to contact customer support. It seems customer support is ""investigating"" issues with payments in the past so either they can't do anything in almost 2 years or they are just banning me for paying them and having issue with the service. AVOID LIKE  THE PLAGUE.			"

												A free time sink. Enjoyed it for a little while because I like the medival time period and some of the sound design felt good but quickly became repetitive. Like with many games that require extended amounts of real world time to build things it quickly became a chore rather than an enjoyable experience and my hours on the game mainly involved leaving it on in the background. Stopped playing after a few months but I still remember playing it and having some fun with the politics and interactions.If you know what your getting yourself into go ahead but if you are looking for a multiplayer strategy game there are many other titles.

												O.K....I see that SHK has made a new something.  (It's in my que steam...please remove it.)    Well, I guess I will give it a review. This game will consume your time, life and money. It will give you nothing, other than you may pick up some friends from around the world. Then you will hate the world and throw you wallet at it. The world has more money than you. You can only stay up for 72 hours protecting your hard earned land and poorly spend inheritance then you will sleep. Russia will win. You will have nothing when you arise from your 24 hour coma. No lands, no castles, no friends, no family, no inheritance. Russia wins. They always win.  Now they will win at sea. Run aways me matey.			"

												Please do not support this game.  At first it seems like a cool game and fun.  But after you get into it you cannot really do anything worth while unless you have no life and can play 24/7 and if you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars if not thousands on buying cards.  The staff that support this game are crooks all the way up to the producers.  They will do things with your account and say too bad so sad we messed you up it is our fault but too bad you can suffer no matter how much they messed you up or how much money you spent or time on the game.  To even be in the top houses which seem to be all be run by the most arrogant ignorant gang like thugs.  People seem to support and follow these people yet a lot of these people are not even good at the game or are very nice people or even have any kind of good leadership qualities.  Yet people follow them and they run the show like a cult. And if you are not in it forget ever winning. After years of play you really end up with a bad experiance in the end.  Takes a year just to finish the first glory round even if you do make it and the map is dominated.  Maps usualy become totaly dominated by one group of people and thats it.  Do not expect fair play from players or the staff.Do Not Buy this game and waste your time and money.  So many better games out there.			"

												I've enjoyed being a part of this medieval version of a modern day soap opera with catapult's since Alpha started a few years ago,, (only just started playing it through steam) and have been delighted by most of the recent patches,, which made trading a lot easier,, sped my armies up,,gave me more defensive cards.. Yes,, it is true.. if you pay real money you can be bigger,better,faster (or just play a lot). This game breeds more hatred and back stabbing than Kermit the frog and Miss piggy's backstage diva fighting.. But please remember,, whilst you're punching Miss piggy in the face,, if you dont pay to play premium,,you could always side with someone else . This game has a large and solid community,, so it's easy to make friends,, and enemies if you want to... (disclaimer: frogs are not depicted in the game,, and every frog, or representation thereof on the entire planet,, are owned in their entirety by some large company somewhere (TM))THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIENDTHE FRIEND OF MY ENEMY WHO HAS THE MOST CARDS IS ALSO MY FRIENDLORD VADER			"

												I wasted a bit of my free time on this. I love the politic aspect on the game and the community seems sane. I made a few friends off it, but far more enemies. I paid 10 euros for cards and such. Pay2win sucks. Just don't tick off any insane leaders or there will be alot ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥heading your way. Would i recommend it? Yes and no. I got a lot of enjoyment off it, but still had to pay some cash to even be able to compete. Users with lots of accounts ruin it for me. Conclusion: Meh. I wont play it again. (yet)			"

												Nothing like the original.Free, but not everything free is good.I would rather play this mobile than PC (They are working on it)I think firefly should work rather on full games than this.Oh and yea you can lose almost everything too.Weeks of work? More like week of useless work.This is alright but only if you put it turn it on and leave it on while playing another game.I don't recommend to play this game, I rather recommend to play this game 2-3 times a day.This game is pretty fun but if you want to play a fun RTS, or a Stronghold game, play any other stronghold game but not Crusader 2 (Unless they make it fun) or Stronghold 3. This game might be bad, not as bad as Stronghold 3.			"

												Donât do it, save your money and spend on something more enjoyable.  Firefly is the worst gaming company on the planet.  They refuse to enforce their own policy for account abuse, this game is overrun by players that use multiple accounts and as long and they are willing to spend money on premium tokens Firefly turns a blind eye.  Their servers are controlled by user groups that deploy alt accounts all over the map which makes it impossible to defend and control a territory unless you are willing to waste a lot of time and money as well.  This is not a good MMO because of the level of cheating allowed by Firefly because they see it as a revenue generator to allow cheating.  Find another game to spend your money on please; you will be much happier you did.  I canât put it anymore simply, this is a terrible game, donât waste your money on it and donât allow yourself to get pulled in, the Firefly admins play favorites to those that spend the most money and are willing to ban players that have any skills that threaten the status quo.  Seriously stay away from this gameâ¦..			"

												I've been playing that game for a little moe than 3 years now so I'm a veteran. I've been playing on 4 different servers since the beginning and I'm telling you honestly don't ever play this game.First of all it's dangerously addictive but on top of that it's just a bad game runned by people who have no interest at all in the health of their community. They are only motivated in creating more and more opportunity to fill their pocket by tempting players with agressive promotions.Even if it requires to create new servers with different gameplay and close others that they find no worthy enough to keep alive knowing that people haver invested themselves a lot and still play on it. We've come to a point where they have lost control of the essential basis of that game which is teamwork.By throwing at their members continuously new ways to start all over on a better server the team spirit is slowly fading out while people who have gone so far together just quit completely bored by way Firefly Studio threat their members. I'm one of them and I wish that this company can assume a bad comment about their game and that they wont delete it the second I post it.Others leave the game only because the game at all mostly bases on PvP as become more annoying than fun. This game is not free to play, it's a pay to win and cleary those who have the deepest pocket will keep winning over and over again. That's the way it is so don't waste your time installing that game or any other Firefly game.Their are tons ofgames better than this one where you can waste your time :)			"

												I had fun playing this game, they even conned me into spending money on it. Once I had, they locked and banned my account. I contacted their support and they only ever respond with the terms of service agreement. It explains nothing to help you understand your ban, and when you try to talk to someone real they give you the run around. I did never get this fixed, nor reimbursed, nor did they make any effort to help me. I highly suggest not spending money in the game.You Fight many people in this war game, and if your of your enemies happens to be a moderator. They will put you on a temp ban for 72 hours, then they commence to remove everything you worked for. Once you are able to log back into the game, you start with nothing. Moderators win every world for this very reason. Does not matter which server you play on, the same people come.			"

												I suppose I'll recommend this game if you aren't planning to play with friends/family/significant others using the same internet connection or don't mind paying real money to play with them. My boyfriend and I started playing two days ago with some friends. It was great! I needed some wood and he had a surplus so he traded me a few things. We're having fun, all is well. Today our free premium tokens expired. We are no longer permitted to trade with each other, send monks/troops to each other or anything else soley because we live together. I could deal with not being able to move my structures around and queue things - I can't deal with not being able to play with someone because I don't wish to spend money on this game.			"

												This game was fun for what it was, but after waking up to log in and find that my castle had been ransacked and my only village taken over by a player of higher level it just left a nasty feeling in my gut.Now if you were like me and lost your only village all is not lost you can setup a new village retain your rank and some other stats and are given some basic resources to start rebuilding and you are protected from attack for a couple of days so you can try again, but that doesn't seem that fun to me...All those hours of collecting resources, building improvements, new buildings, conducting new research so I have access to said improvements and buildings. I can't say this game is worth the time if you lose almost everything you have been working towards.If you like spending many hours working on something and then see it vanish by all means have at it. For now I am just going to shelve this one for now.Also they need more variety in units what they got seems to be a bit minimalist to me but eh to each their own.			"

												A clock watching game.That's pretty much what you'll spend all your time doing. It takes a lot of time and resources to do anything, and each time you do something it'll only cost more next time. Pretty obvious from the get-go that if you want anything interesting you have to pay. In all it's simply an endless grind. Farm stuff, build the castle, keep peasants happy and recruit them into soldiers, watch other dudes attack your castle, repair the castle, repeat for eternity. It's not a bad time waster, and it's too bad I haven't had a chance to really try the feudalism simulator they have going on; but I'd say your time and money is much better spent on the HD Stronghold and Crusader games.

Farm stuff, build the castle, keep peasants happy and recruit them into soldiers, watch other dudes attack your castle, repair the castle, repeat for eternity. It's not a bad time waster, and it's too bad I haven't had a chance to really try the feudalism simulator they have going on; but I'd say your time and money is much better spent on the HD Stronghold and Crusader games.

You will be crushed  in case you dont choose one of those options.Last word:Check it out for yourself, since its free and a very solid franchise			"

												I cannot recommend this game is all I can say. One of the worst p2w games ever made, at first I was like, yay looks nice and everything, like everyone at first. Then I realised I want to go to new world that was just created to be something there, I tried, but still people built their villages so fast that I couldnt believe it. Then I realized that you can buy â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crowns or whatever the currency is to buy premium and what not that gives you ability to build many buildings and stack up researches. I think you can only enjoy this when you start and get premium for two days when you complete tutorial. Thats it, stay away from this one and go play real stronghold with your friends.			"

You need supplies to fund your towns and expansions, Taxes and Defence of your Villages. This can be very Challenging if you dont pay to win but its not a game for the faint hearted. It can be slow, it can be annoying if your not a Patient strategist, If you are however. I would reccomend it			"

												For a brief window of time I helped form alliances, start wars and wipe people out. I was a liege lord with many vassals. All of this sounds really cool, until I realised to achieve this I had spent about Â£200. You will spend hours a day keeping your alliances in place and then as soon as you go away for a day find your villages missing. Oh you've been destroyed.On the plus side you are now free from the chains of P2W. Uninstall this videogame crack whilst you still can.			"

												The game as a whole can be fun but the gameplay itself is often very tedious and boring.  The best aspects of the game are the politcs: joining a guild, interacting with your allies and using your combined numbers to accomplish something.  Whether it be getting a certain person elected head of a county or conquering all the villages belonging to a certain House in a region its the politics where the game is interesting.But the actual game mechanics themselves are boring; often extremely boring.  Most of the time I spent playing I was actually surfing the internet and only occasionally checking in on what was happening.  Things can move very slowly.  Wars can be frustrating as well since the game lets you spend money to protect your castles from attack.  You'll often find yourself logging on after work or school to find half your villages have been conquered and they are immune to attack for several days so you have no way of getting them back.  And these are villages you've spent months building up only to have it all thrown away when you weren't even playing.			"

												The game is alright, I played it way before it even came to steam when it was just browser based. It's till stronghold for the most part but it's completely online. Sounds like cool fun right? How about no. This is strictly one of those broswer based Facebook style games in every sense of the word and has no business on steam. It's ""P2W"" and timer based like every other free-to-play RTS out there. Nothing ruins a game more than getting neck deep into it just to find out you HAVE to quit for 6 hours because there's nothing left to do. Seriously, it's going to take that long for some of your buildings to complete construction. If you like these kinds of games and find the majority of your free time syphoned by similar games on Facebook, go for it. If you're a serious Stronghold fan however, avoid this monstrosity at all costs.			"

												I don't like pay to play games generally, but I didn't find this as difficult to start as it could have been.   For me, the deal breaker is that there is no tactics used in the combat.   The ""Castles"" are essentially giant blocks of stone.   Every castle map is completely filled up with towers which are only one space away from each other.  It's a necessary way to build your castle since arrows and swords can break down your walls.I give this game a ""meh""			"

												SHK is not really a simulation nor a tactical challenge, for new players there can be fun grinding ability levels but this is ultimately  pointless as in the long run as no matter what you research or how many cards you buy you cannot protect your villages. The game world runs 24/7 which means that unless you do without sleep completely or get someone else to play your account  when you are offline (bannable offense) then all your work can be stolen or destroyed. Yes you can in turn steal or rebuild replacements but that is not what makes this game special.This game is special not because of the graphics/sound/game logic which are windows 95 era ,it is special because it is a mirror of all the worst possible human behaviour, motivations and emotions. All the offensive behaviour of the worst politicians and criminals, all the abusive and maladjusted behaviour of pychopaths is promoted and rewarded by this game.Truely once you have played this game for a few months then you are going to be drawn into things that would not only get you put in prison but also shuned by any civilised society if you tried them in real life. It is one thing to play games like GTA where you can abuse bots and act out being bad but in this game you will end up abusing real people, intimidation, verbal abuse, haressment all are standard techniques employed by the veterens (I say veterans  because they are mostly over 40 and are often retired and so need less sleep) to win each game. If you play for long enough then you are going to be wading in the slime of the dregs of society and hence become desensitized to abberant behaviour such that you are likely to have problems in real life.To top it off the support agents will know that once you have put a few hundred hours in that you are an addicted deviant and will treat you like a retard, the game is buggy and often fails to work as advertised but your chances of getting any money back are slim at best.Lastly during my few thousand hours of play a number of people really died or became seriously ill, I would say because of the stress related to going without sleep, healthy exercise and the constant high levels of negative emotions this game evokes.Personally I think this game should be made to carry a health warning but I would also say the company have even less morals than the players so I guess it balances out.

												This game isnât for everyone although I would recommend it with a few caveats.. You only have to look at the number of hours I have played this game to see I enjoy it (I have probably played just as many hours in the stand alone client as on steam!)However it is also evidence of the downside to this game, it has a tendency to take a hold of players that get very involved in the game. It can be hard to leave the game alone and you will find yourself thinking about the game when you perhaps should be focused on something more productive. This is only exacerbated by the persistent nature of the game and, for the most part, the awesome community that support this game. There is also a pay to win aspect to this game, as you might have noticed by the other reviews.  Some benefits are only available to those who invest not only time but money into the game., But you have to remember the game has to be supported and without money the developers canât do this. Hiding features behind a paywall though is never popular and it is something I can not defend. Automated trading and having a requirement to put money into the game in order to unlock more than a measly number of free in game stratagy cards are two of such features I would point out. However as long as you know this going into the game you shouldnât be disappointed. It may take you longer to achieve your goals in Stronghold Kingdoms if you play it entirely Free To Play, you may also have a hard time going up against people who play it Pay To Win (and know what theyâre doing) but thereâs no reason why you still canât have a lot of fun playing this game and meat a lot of cool and interesting people along the way.

												Okay, so SHK wanted players to give feedbacks and review of the game so here it goes. First off to those that does not know the game, it takes a long long long time for ages to pass on different worlds and they never seem to be ending soon so I will give some feedbacks on the future of the game and for future new ages(which desperatly needs to warp up and end really really soon.Edit: The end game is finally going to come (Not too soon but soon lol) so thats a plus at least for me. Why? Because the game will die out if there is no implementation of this said end game. Anywho, on to the review! :)Intro: As for the game itself, well reviewing this kind of game is going to be a tough one since its really different from any other game I had ever played. To keep it short, SHK is a game somewhat like trivian or tribal-wars which are real-time based (Build your kingdom type)strategy games. Of cause SHK is much more complex and beautifully complicated than any other MMO out there. Just know that these kind of games will suck in all of your time and all the beautifully built villages that you have put so much time and effort can easily be taken away over night. Yes that's right, over night! But that is not so much of a bad thing because thats what makes the game very interesting and complex. Yes you can lose your villages but the honor, gold, faith points and rank will remain the same even if you lose all your villages. Keep in mind these such points are the important part of the game, not villages, so that is a good thing that you dont lose your progress. Gameplay / Graphics As for the gameplay, this is a straight forward build your kingdom and expend it at all costs. It can be time consuming, very very much so. I had played this for over 3 years on and off and I can never get on top of the leaderboards yet. Also, there are groups(factions and houses) where you join and fight for that particullar group. These houses either ally themselves with one another or declare war on each other because the main goal of the game is to win the glory race. The gloary race can be won if a house can eliminate all other houses thus the last house is ultimately the winner of the race. You get big rewards if you win the race that can be used to give some perks on the world you are playing and on every other worlds.Graphics on this game is taken almost 100% taken out of the original ""Stronghold Crusader"" game that came out over a decade ago but thats not a bad thing either since that was one of the best games ever created, ever. They did improve on the quality of the game though so its really well done. This is a stretegy game not a 4K graphic driven game so graphics doesn't really matter. P2W(Pay 2 Win? Well, many of the reviews here are stating that it is a P2W game and I won't try to argue it because to an extent you can progress much faster with the cards in the game but it will only get you so far as to how much you are willing to spend on a free game and hornestly you really don't get much advantage over other. It is totally possible to get to the top without spending a single dime on this game. Just need a lot of hard work. --- I would say this is 10% P2W and 90% hardwork.Final Verdict: Yeah I would totally recommend trying to game out especailly if you are a big RTS-MMO fan and even if you are not its just fun to grow your village and take over other people and fight for glory. Just try to out, don't let these stupid one sentence ""BAD!"" ""P2W"" BS of a review get in your way of a great game. My score of this game is 7.5 or 8 out of 10.			"

												Brilliant MMO, I love the castle building and warfare and the way it has the characters from the other Stronghold games such as the Rat, Wolf, Pig and Snake. The researching and honour system is genius but I believe it could improve by adding a farming mode/Capture only world like in the original Stronghold games were the was a construction mode where you could build in peace I would love for that to be added also.The new Wolf AI world was very fun to play as there was a feeling of unity from the community that is rare in most games these days as everyone worked together to defeat the AI and take control of their world.Over-all it's a brilliant game and I reccomend it to everyone however I'd like my idea of the farm world/Construction World to be considered.Cheers, iAura			"

												Most of the complaints I see on here are from people crying out pay2win. What they don't understand is that the F2P model is meant to advertise and attract players to the game. Players who love civilization building, RTS, and MMO games will find it well worth the 4 dollars a month to sub. For players that are starting out fresh, world 9 is fairly new and the recommended server to play on. There are lots of players and factions that are willing to help you out, msg Lord Kondo in-game and i'll lend you my banners!			"

												I just don't see the point of this game, it's an incredibly slowed down multiplayer version of the original Stronghold, the graphics are pretty much the same as are most of the buildings/units.The main problem with the game is that microtransactions eventually become necessary just to have any chance against the players who were around for longer, and that it just didn't manage to hold my interest for very long as I can get a better experience by just playing the original Stronghold.

												The problem with playing this game on Steam is if you have a Client version and you want to play that on Steam rather than using the Client version, it is impossible because you have to create a separate account which would be against the rules made by Firefly even if you attempt to change it to Steam.  I would not recommend this game if you are playing with the Client version of the game since you would have to start over and playing off Steam would be using two accounts rather than one.  If they would allow you to move the account onto Steam without any problems of turning off your Client version and keep the Username of the Client on Steam, then I would recommend this game if people like playing this game off Steam rather than the Client version.

												First of all this Game is not for everyone unless you get in with a good house who fights if not most likely your house will be eliminated. I like it for the constant excitement that waking up in the morning I could be reset at anytime (being reset means all your villages have either been captured or destroyed) even with the strongest build we will still get in and take it over, waves and waves of troops timed attacks and your village is mine or mine is yours. it's Medieval village management and castle building.there are no vehicles except your horses and trading carts you start on a plot of land and start building you get villagers who do all the hard work of growing and collecting food and supplies like wood stone pitch & iron so you can build your castles. run the right tax amount they will stay put it to high they will leave so it's your own little kingdom so to speak and you manage it. there are research tasks you can do to make life a little easier like troop and peasants you can research everything make your scouts faster to pick up items on around your castles make your troops stonger. Now monks are the key to winning or losing a battle so you want those first because as time goes on and you research so many things it takes 16 to 20 hours to research one thing so you need to do the important ones first you just need to figure out what those are. same as the village buildings go the further up you are in rank the slower it becomes to build. now you can play this without ever spending any money I have played it for a long time without spending any money but I never got very far. you can only research 1 thing at a time not 5 and you can only build 1 thing at a time in your village without the use of a premium token, there are a few different ones you can spend your real money on a 30 Day  premium token will allow you to do so much 5 research tasks 5 village buildings in queue to build, it also allows you to trade while your offline. the premium token allows your scouts to seek out stashes while your offline you can also attack a chosen target when your logged out, you also get idle peasants into your army and this right here is so useful too because when you get too many of these they make your village popularity go down and this will result in them leaving also. another thing the premium token does is allow you to keep track of what has happened while your offline and why they don't do this for the people that don't play with cards is beyond me, So like if a player scouts your village you won't even know they are prepairing to attack you unless you run a premium token so in my opinion it is pay to play because if you don't pay you lose you can spend 5 bucks and get a premium token and some playing cards to help your villages. this game is a very political game I have seen players run 5 different accounts they could be your enemy and join your faction on another account just to see what your faction is up to who they are planning to attack it's a very hard game to start out fresh in not knowing who the real players of the game are. anyone who claims to be your friend on this game is lying because they are looking at angles to take you out if you don't belong to a house your a target, if your in a faction and not a house your still a target. So the A.I in this game is set up so the higher in rank you go the harder they hit you I have had an entire side wiped out of my castle and by doing this it will set you back a few days in build time but you get honor who the F cares about honor when your castle gets wiped out 2 times a day by the A.I but wait it's not over here comes another attack and another and another they don't start doing a lot of damage till you are a prince but they do even more damage when you become a crown prince. so now that you have been offline for a few days and people take notice that you have been attacked by all kinds of A.I they know your castle has been badly damaged and they take advantage and scout you they see the damage and take over your village.https://gyazo.com/bef6ef0755292602660b1b5013f2aece this is here  my castle completed.so this is a design I got off the internet this is what I have built but without the use of cards it took 71 Days to finish and all that time I was being attacked everyday unless your in a capitol parish and that person fights all the A.I forget about trying to build, like I said this game is not for everyone. I will update this as I go but for now getting into this game right now may be a waste of time because the end is coming. When you have a build like this it will survive a lot of attacks but it's hard to put everything back 


this is the newest design & survived 6 timed attacksÂ

												Could have been good for a free game, but it will wear at your patience faster than mine!It's finally got me - I cannot play this anymore, ain't nobody got time for that! Shame as this could have been a really good game. I have a lot of patience, even for really REALLY slow games like this one, but this has finally got me. You may find it entertaining and fun at first as I did, and the map is very good, but as it rapidly slows down, it becomes increasingly frustrating, and even multiple villages/worlds cannot keep you busy and entertained.If you want to feel pressured into spending money on a 'free' game to succeed, or want to end up staring blankly at your villagers making repetitive movements while you wait an hour to build each building, send out a scout or start each research, and have every intention of playing this daily (as your village gets wiped after a few days of non-play, and you will in the most part have to start over), then sure, I guess this is the game for you. If you can log on.I really wanted to love this game, I gave it a very good run.... but I've had enough, and I dont feel like waiting around on it this week :(			"

												People say pay to win, its not really. The only thing you REALLY need is the premium token, enabling building and research queues. This would only come to a few dollars a month. I was pretty patient with the game.Sadly, the game community is pretty stuck-up. The huge players that have been playing for a long time or have paid a lot of money think they run the place. The have their ""laws"" and will destroy you without notice if you ""disobey"" them. In all honesty, it would be more fun if this game was a free-for-all brawl, istead of being farming simulator.

												Most of the complaints I see on here are from people crying out pay2win. What they don't understand is that the F2P model is meant to advertise and attract players to the game. Players who love civilization building, RTS, and MMO games will find it well worth the 4 dollars a month to sub. For players that are starting out fresh, world 9 is fairly new and the recommended server to play on. There are lots of players and factions that are willing to help you out, msg Lord Kondo in-game and i'll lend you my banners!			"

												it is very unfair to new players whereas it allows veterans to monopolize parishes and gameplay it also takes way too long for research and new buildings with a few simple changes it would remove the stranglehold that a certain few elite veteran players have over the game			"

BITTER. in that time you have no chance in hell to get a defence that can stand against a HUGE army suddenly standing at your doorstep. When you die in this game, you start At the beginning again COMPLETELY, even all the things you have spent hours after hours researching are gone.. this is sad as i rather enjoy the early stronghold games.

You can PAY to farm, but all you will do is grow / level up faster.WAR... if you want any kind of chance to at least survive, much less thrive during a conflict, you have to pay, and pay a LOT.

You'll have fun for a few days, then, unless you spend hundreds or even a thousand dollars on extra cards + be online, on the game 24/7, you'll find yourself abused relentlessly and without a castle, starting over.

												As a casual player I cannot recommend this. I play it because I enjoy the castle building element. I've built up a large number of castles over the span of a year, but the truth is someone could fire off a couple cards and raze every single one of my castles in an hour, if they wanted to, and there's nothing I could do about it. (Edit: This happened)It's a timer-based persistent world game so it is closer to a browser game than your typical PC game. The castle building element is akin to a facebook game in complexity, the quest system is just ok, the combat is automatically resolved.I also have tons of cards which are the things you pay for, and I really don't see the use of any of them. This dated game just isn't very good. The only praise I have for it is that clan-based persistent worlds can have some fun player politics in them.			"

Then some little s**t attacks you and tries to force you to join their make believe group otherwise you will get destroyed even if you tell them you don't care about killing anyone and you just want to be left alone to enjoy the game. Needless to say, abandoned all my villages and unisntalled the game. Unless you want to pay to win and constantly check the stupid game, that'll help you, but as a free to play game, it's terrible.

												Could have been good for a free game, but it will wear at your patience faster than mine!It's finally got me - I cannot play this anymore, ain't nobody got time for that! Shame as this could have been a really good game. I have a lot of patience, even for really REALLY slow games like this one, but this has finally got me. You may find it entertaining and fun at first as I did, and the map is very good, but as it rapidly slows down, it becomes increasingly frustrating, and even multiple villages/worlds cannot keep you busy and entertained.If you want to feel pressured into spending money on a 'free' game to succeed, or want to end up staring blankly at your villagers making repetitive movements while you wait an hour to build each building, send out a scout or start each research, and have every intention of playing this daily (as your village gets wiped after a few days of non-play, and you will in the most part have to start over), then sure, I guess this is the game for you. If you can log on.I really wanted to love this game, I gave it a very good run.... but I've had enough, and I dont feel like waiting around on it this week :(			"

												Though the game itself is fun to play at first. It heavilly follows the pay to win model of gaming that doesn't work with the majority of people, who don't have money to spare. I went into the game expecting the average free to play game, of no initial cost, with a cash shop. They do have this, but the encourage you to spend money you may not have in order to do a ton of things.One of the major beefs I have, is it's Premium Service. They encourage you, everytime you log off, that if you don't have it to get it. And that makes sense to do something like that. But the concept of 'Commanding even when you are off' Breaks the balance of the game.Here is why:Say you have two players near each other in-game. One of them, who we will name James, has a weekly job and a family. He plays a few  games online during the weekend and days off. He also can't afford to buy Crowns. Now, we also have another player, we will name him Jack. Jack lives with his parents and goes to highschool. His father has a good job, and so pays Jack a large allowence that he can spend on anything. He spends it on Crowns every time. Say he also gets the Premium Service and sets everything to max.James, the man with a job, will have the things Jack, the teenager, at a much slower rate due to money spent on the game.And so, I declare Stronghold Kingdoms, as a Pay to Win game. Not a Free to Play game. For anyone interested, avoid.			"

												I think I must have just left this game open, I dunno how I hit 50 hours.  It takes forever to build anything.  Dozens of similar free flash games out there that just do this sort of game better and more engaging.  I guess this one was one of the first?  So there, it's got that going for it.			"

												Could have been good for a free game, but it will wear at your patience faster than mine!It's finally got me - I cannot play this anymore, ain't nobody got time for that! Shame as this could have been a really good game. I have a lot of patience, even for really REALLY slow games like this one, but this has finally got me. You may find it entertaining and fun at first as I did, and the map is very good, but as it rapidly slows down, it becomes increasingly frustrating, and even multiple villages/worlds cannot keep you busy and entertained.If you want to feel pressured into spending money on a 'free' game to succeed, or want to end up staring blankly at your villagers making repetitive movements while you wait an hour to build each building, send out a scout or start each research, and have every intention of playing this daily (as your village gets wiped after a few days of non-play, and you will in the most part have to start over), then sure, I guess this is the game for you. If you can log on.I really wanted to love this game, I gave it a very good run.... but I've had enough, and I dont feel like waiting around on it this week :(			"

												Played this game, and it was fun... for a few days because you get ""premium"" status for a few days. Reason being the premium status give you ""significant"" advantage. More detailed report of your castle and build/research que. Non-premiun do not have those. Played it for about 3 weeks and it was very clear it is pay to win.			"

												Well, I'm a new player... Needless to say im getting buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥by my stronger neighbors around me. Starting the game: It gives you a 2 day taste of the full premium experience... but only for 2 days... In these 2 days you can advance rather rapidly, building 7 buildings 1 after the other, and in general just feeling like the game is not broken. You also get a 2 day slot of ""no one can attack me"" which is great, I mean people would always then attack the newbie for easy resources. You research you expand very rapidly and then your protection is gone!Mid Game:This is when the game starts to fail... there is no limit for those players that are substantially stronger to just go and wipe out smaller players. This game is not new player friendly! Immediatly after ym protection is gone I get raided by my super powerful neighbor, he first sends 20 peasants. Nothing too bad right! Then he just swarmes me 3 times untill I fall and eviscerates what was once my wooden fortress. New players have no way to defend themselves once their premium trial is over and their ""spawn Protection"" is over. Features: I love the research system, makes you think ahead. As well as teh fortress system. I hate the preimium Pay2Win ability. The fact that higher ranking players can just swarm your village every 2 days to plunder you for your resources. They also don't need to micro as much as the newbies since they have 7 buildings building which takes up to 4 hours whereas the newbie has 1 and that takes 20 min tops. The game is jsut not newbie friendly, espeicially since its pay2win... someone suggested a one time payment method, I wish that was a thing sicne id rather pay 5 or 10 bucks for the game and have a balanced fair game... But no...The day microtransactions lose their ability to give players better weapons or in this case, just the full game, and lose their ability in general to give players an advantage is the day that MMO's might make soem sort of a comeback!

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												This game is simply AMAZING, although it is P2P (Pay to play), not that you can't play without paying but if you pay for crowns you can buy premium tokens and cards. Premium tokens are so so but cards are really really essential, you get free ones depending on your rank, but premium tokens are really good helpers. Another thing, this game is 24/7. You can't play every now and then. If you want to havea fuctionning gameplay, you have to play it at least 4+ hours a day.			"

												The game is excellent in all forms of kinds of war games and strategy games. The graphics are simple which helps in connecting and speed of the game, however the game is the most complex of all strategy games need much intelligence and skills of strategic games you will not regret playing so it requires a lot of intelligence to manage resources, armies, researches, cities and above all you need much effort to survive where wars and conflicts occur and the balance of diplomacy and sword are crucial. Take a wrong step in leadership and the cost can be horrible as the loss of your cities or your army or much more.			"

												highly adictive, i have twice as many hours on the server that are not registered on steam.if you have a lot of of free time and want a drug to take out of the real world this is the game for you.I kicked the habit like two years ago, just went back now to check out the new worlds but iÂ´ll not get sucked into that again.some people say itÂ´s pay to win, i dunno, by the time i was playing i got a lot of free crowns and cards from amazon, they had a reward for registering at the time. and i only made 2 minimum purchases to activate the quest meter to receive cards at maximum speed. But i havent even spent the crowns i bought, just a few(i still have 1k crowns sitting around), not even all of the ones i got for free from amazon, and I was one of the strongest players in world 4 two years ago.So I dont think itÂ´s pay to win, you need premium tokens ofc, but not all the time and you get many from quests and if amazon is still giving crowns you can get like a year of premium with those, unless you want to be the king, I assume then you would need to spend some cash, but I managed to run 8 parishes at once and became the governor of the province, started a faction, which i named 'The Night's whatch', and it got really strong, the house i belonged ruled over 2 of the 4 countries, I had like 50 vassals, all of that without spending crowns or barely spending. itÂ´s a lot to handle.Obs. i noticed now people have way more villages than it was possible when i played, so the numbers above may seem insignificant, but 2 years ago you could hardly get any more powerful than that.In short, great game, but be careful, cocaine may seem great at first too			"

Every building takes real time to build and it is ever increasing so I build a hut and then check back 2 days later to build a wood cutter shack and then check back 3 days later to build a farm then, check back 4 days later to discover that everything was destroyed by another player.  Awesome.  I get to start all over.  Ill stick with the RTS version.			"

												To make 1 thing clear real quick, don't let my number of hours fool you. The reason I have so many hours is because I used to keep the game running in the background while I slept or played other games. I have not actually put +2000 hours into this game.It's fun, but its pay to win. Otherwise you best stay away from other players. Takes months to build up 1 village to complete size, just so you can lose it overnight and wake up to seeing you need to start all over. Takes forever since anytime you place a building or research a class, your next building/class costs 2x more time (which leads to hours, then days and so on), and same with resources, that doubles, take that feature away, and the ""pay to win"" feature, and it'd be a great game. Make it to where you earn cards through quests, make your buildings take instead about 10 sec - 5 minutes to build (Depending on the building), and make premium the only thing you gotta pay for, and it'd be a great game. Otherwise, you'll find yourself bored of it in the first 10 minutes and a little let down when a village you worked so hard on is taken so easily. Also an offline mode would be nice, building your empire just dealing with AI castles and bandit camps and so on, or a co-op mode where you and a small faction of friends are doing so. I dunno. I do like the camera view a lot though, great looks. But although I do play this when I'm bored and have nothing else to do. I don't reccomend it. Get the other Stronghold games. Those are better.

												I wouldn't recommend this game for the simple reason that it is disgrace to the Stronghold name. I feel that it is a rip off of stronghold (The Original) just with the delayed wait times of a facebook game. There is no real strategy to it and is like every other war/simulation/town building game. After finding a game that me and my friends could all play due to our varying computer specs and social lives, to find out that this is just a horrible, horrific waste of space is just, Disgusting. I have had The original stronghold right up until Stronghold 3. If you want my advice, avoid this game because you will sink many hours of gameplay in it for little or no reward. Buy Stronghold 1 if you like the concept and the rather ""Low"" Graphical credentials, Otherwise stick to Number 2, The best stronghold game i have ever played and i have owned that game for around 7 years.How could a game like this get on steam? it is beyond me.

Whether you love this game or hate this game you have to admit its very addictive.... for any newcomers i would suggest read up everything you can before playing this... as although it may look basic there is a lot to learn about it... and the fewer mistakes you make earlier on in the game the better the experience will be ( yes i messed up many times for not reading )     This game is not a pay to win game... although it does drastically help with card packs premium tokens etc... and if your not at war with another player ( which is definetely not always the case ) then buying tokens just enhances the game and helps you on your way...makes it more fun....but you dont need to buy tokens... ive played over 1000 hours on this game (steam version 624 hours) and have hardly bought any tokens ( twice i spent maybe Â£6 that was it) and ive had plenty enjoyment from it.   Game is free so have a go :)			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is in my opinion the best city building stragey game i have ever played online and i have tried quite a few. this game is very unique in that you have AIs to attack and also they attack you such as all 4 of the AI castles from the stronghold line of games such as the rat which is the easiest to deal with up to the wolf which is hardest. Thier are also wolf lairs, bandit camps which you attack for quests or just honor. the game is based on an honor system u advace by gaining honor. THe game icorperates a research system you can do very little without researching to do it first from building diferent buildings to troop types and even religion. There is an extensive religious system where you use monks to do things like heal deseases and protect ur villages and things of that nature. The maps r devided into parishes, counties, statesand countries. these parishes require a person (called a steward) this person takes charge and builds builds in the parish that help the others who live in the parish this can range from use troops there to take out the AIs to building guilds which when upgraded give benifits to all citizens within that parish. You can join with other players in your area to form factions and house these factions and house go through what is known as a glory race in which they r trying to be the only one left at the end of the race winning house of this race at the end of an age get fabulous in game prizes. There are four ages each with it's own unique set of rules. There are also cards that allow u to do things in the game like make your troops faster, make free troops,  help production of goods, all kinds of diferent things. As I hope u can see from just vthis breif discription of the game that it has alot to offer you many hours of great enjoyable play time. I would very highly recomened this game to all stratagy city building game lovers even if you have never played a game like this I would encourage anyone who likes online gaming to give it  a try.SpitfireSam			"

												Stronghold KingdomsWhat should i say about this? Its a GREAT MMO. I could write a Book about it. Its just awesome with all the possibilitys, the most awesome feature is: The Players decide the Game. You can join a house/faction. And these factions are allied or at war with other factions its possible for you and your clan/faction to just conquer the world!You can even become a spy, join the enemy faction, work your way up (pretend to had a fight with your own faction) and destroy the enemy from the inner.The possibility are endless since the world is player driven!AND ANY BODY WHO TALKS ABOUT PAY 2 WIN: JUST STFU, IDIOTS! it is definitly NOT P2W! It doesnt really matter if you pay or not. Its just the usual: make things easier with real money. And whats the problem. the devs/publisher need to earn money. You think they are making games for free, idiots?!What you get for Money is a premium account so you can qeue buildings and research. good when you go to work or something.And you can buy card packs with RANDOM Cards. like your scouts reach the location sooner 2000 wood, and so on. Thats not gamebreaking, just a kickstart for newer settlements (you can have up to 20+).You even get cards without money, and the REAL good cards like, instant building or instant research (1 time use only!) are REALLY rare. since you open card packs like in yugioh or fifa ultimate team, you dont know what you get. most time you get cards that help you a little. so stfu idiots!

												This game starts to slowly suck you in.In the end you end up spending vast ammounts of time and money to recieve the extras needed to be successful.I'm sure many people resist the temptation much like myself however you soon realise that your level of success depends almost entirely on how much you are prepared to spend. Unfortunately for you; someone always seems prepared to spend more................it is a bottomless pit!Good game - great Idea - be prepared to spend a small fortune. "

												This game sucks a lot. The only reason I'm reviewing it is because Firefly sent me email with following subject: ""We need YOU to review Stronghold Kingdoms on Steam""There is only one metric of your success in this game. It is how much money you spend. You don't need to do anything else except pay 2 win. Oh btw and there is no real win anyways, since one game lasts for years and noone is playing games for years.So if you want to spends hundreds of dollars on ""free"" to play game which will never end - go ahead. Else just buy any other game and donate hundreds of dolars you'd spend on this game to a charity who tries to provide free salt with iodine to people in africa.			"

												Free to play, however; need big bucks to be compete! The game is too massive, takes too many hours to accomplish things... A complete time sink. Little sense or reason for how events turn out. In the end you have to punish your neighbors to even begin to prosper. Deep pockets do not guarantee anything other than tokens and cards...Spent $1,700 on this game and still was not competetive.			"

												I would recommend this game only to those who have patience and confience in themselves. Too many people blame this game for 'wasting' their time, which is quite untrue. If you feel you are wasting your time playing SHK it is probably because you are not playing properly. You must balance all aspects of the game and prioritize accordingly. One great quality about the game is that it is very unforgiving, which is why finding amazing and supportive teammates is so important. Once you sift through the players, you'll find a niche of awesome, helpful and resourceful gamers who want to kickâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥as a team. Be patient learning, ask players around you for advice and explore all options because it IS a big game and there are many ways to fall behind, so it is always a constant challenge and quite rewarding when you succeed! gl hf! :)Miss Jupiter			"

												People have been complaining about pay to win stuff here, but honestly, if you build your villages up you can start attacking treasure castles multiple times a day, and that earns you random levels on the treasure wheel, which rewards gold, card packs, and card points, you should be able to amass quite a few cards just spending a month or two on 100-400 day old server.  Then you can save all those cards, really, save them, never use em, and then wait for a new world to start, and you can blow all your cards in the first week and get the biggest jump possible, and then it wont matter how many cards people use later, you will have had an advantage from day 1, turn 1.

From buying apples to arming the rabble with pitchforks as well as cutting deals behind the curtains to get yourself one step closer to victory over your enemy. Just don't stab too many people in the back or you will find yourself at the end of a sharp sword. Stronghold Kingdoms is a must play I would say.			"

												I'm not proud of the fact that I ended up giving up over two thousand hours of my life to this piece of crap. It was terrible â¥â¥â¥â¥ing addiction that I'm glad I got over. I got the starter pack free with Stronghold HD and this rubbish has been stuck in my library ever since.The fact that they recycled a lot of the assets(graphics, music, sounds, etc.) in this game from the first Stronghold means I can never enjoy that amazing game again without being reminded of this.The gameplay is the typical ""strategy"" pay 2 win, wait-festâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥you'd expect from a browser F2P. The combat is composed of you throwing hundreds of units against your enemy's walls, with the only real control you have over your units being over their spawn location. And then you have to wait for them to casually stroll across the landscape/Irish Sea(the latter of takes literal days without paying for speed boosts) before the attack you planned finally comes to fruition. Even then, you have to send multiple simultaneous attacks in order to actually capture or completely destroy a village, because they can repair all the damage you dealt and protect their village from being attacked in the time it takes for you to send your next attack. Later on the wait times for villages can take entire weeks if you don't pay. Literal real time weeks. And castles(the defense portion of your village) will take an entire month to be fully built. I can not stress this enough: the one line of defence preventing other players from freely raiding and burning down your village whenever they feel like it takes an entire month to be built. And this is a game where you can lose all of that in the blink of an eye due to multiple attacks hitting your castle within the span of a few seconds.This is a game that requires you to be awake and playing the game for as much time as you possibly can. If you aren't online 24/7, then you are at serious risk of losing villages to attacks during the night.The ""community"" in this game is the worst. I'd imagine the only reason it hasn't accumulated as much infamy as most MOBAs or other notably toxic games is because it isn't nearly as popular as those games (thank god). The game technically has 'rules,' but everyone ignores them because the mods rarely do anything about the cheaters. People in my old faction(don't know or care what those are actually called) even bragged about having dozens of alt accounts! You know a game is screwed up when people are bragging about cheating. Even the mods are cheating! Some of them even abuse their mod status on top of the cheating. I've seen screenshots of conversations between mods and other players where the mods try and bait the other players into insulting them or raging, just so they have an excuse for a ban.The meta-game revolves around helping your house take huge tracts of land and keeping hold of them for a longâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥time. Your house earns points for this and the first house to recieve the goal number of points wins a prize. And after months of work, if your house wins, each member gets a bunch of comparatively meager prizes. The winning house also gets a post in the news section on the the world select screen declaring their victory which will get buried shortly afterwards by other houses' victories on other worlds.I am not sure why I found thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥even remotely fun.

												Alright, many people tend to become expert after a 'mere' 300 ours of gaming. I am approaching the 5,000 hours, so I have been around. And this is a game to pay to win, some people say? Not true. It's possible to buy cards that give advantages. But spending many hours online does get you free cards as well as a bonus. And when fighting a player, using cards does not give an overwhelming advantage. Attacking skills do, and building strong castles helps too. Lastly, some commentator says starting players are being attacked for they are very weak. Yes, starting players are weak, but for an experienced player to attack a starting player, there is a severe penalty for the experienced player. So starting players are not going to be attacked by the stronger players. So does paying help? A bit. But it can be countered by staying online a lot like I do. In fact to be online a lot has a greater effect than to pay your way. Paying players will receive some small advantages, but not enough to change the odds when they are stacked against them. Please, if you want to give your opinion, stay with the game long enough to give a good advice.  "

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a great game!  It is a game you keep coming back to play due to its immersive research tree and the fact that you get to build a kingdom...  Build your kingdom, advance in both research and rank, and take down your opponents with massive armies...  Whats not to love.			"

												Stronghold: Crusader was awesome so I figured this should be pretty cool as well. Nope, the game uses ""premium tokens"" to let you be able to have a building queue. A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUILDING QUEUE. It's nothing like the older games and terribly slow paced. TL;DR â¥â¥â¥â¥in'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥Game			"

												Amazing Game, you slowly get to rise up the ranks and become more powerful. You can join a faction and destroy others or go solo and get destroyed. Honest to god though, when people 1st join this game their 1st impression may be that it sucks. But, if you keep playing it you'll see that it's an amazing game.My Joke:My Lord, I'd wish to file a complaint at the fact that you keep sending 1 Man Attacks to enemy castles. I know you get a kick out of them using their monks but that isn't a reason to send a man to his death. Not to mention the fact that you decided to build golden statues of yourself everywhere completly neglecting our need for food and water.    Username-TheDarkLight			"

												This is perhaps the greatest free to play game on steam, perhaps even the internet. Many people say that it is pay to win, which I will have to disagree with. Although you have the option to purchase ""Cards"" which have numerous effects, the effects are extremely small (such as add 10-300 troops, which isn't alot considering you can have 40 villages in the game, equaling 20000 troops, so is 300 troops really worth it?). The stronger cards are somewhat good, but those are so rare that it is not very efficient. So this in my opinion is not a pay to win game, whoever said that, I am sorry, must be rather noob like to even come up with that excuse. Anyway, this is a great game and you can win even if you don't pay, you just have to play this game right.			"

												Even if you can get past the fact that players can essentially buy resources with real money in this sandbox PVP game, enjoy having to come back every couple hours to start the next construction because you can't queue anything as a free player. This is one of a brood of soulless, money-grubbing, copy-paste browser games that don't even attempt to hide how P2W they are. Hell, it might even be a plus for the strange individuals who spend hundreds or thousands of cash monies on such games. Everyone else should stay far, far away.			"

												Awesome game if you like to be in a clan/medieval fighting world, its not pay to win, without paying you can also get along at ease, try it out yourself.So if you like a community that is mostly active, really friendly, and sometimes hard to face, join this game. Vlad Tepech			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a passable game if you like building villages and castles, along with some strategic warfare.It is a multiplayer game which you play online against other people in real time.It is based upon a map of the world, which is divided up into kingdoms and provinces. You can choose an area for your base, and then build a castle. You can remain as an independent player, or join an alliance.However, you will discover that - if you really want to play the game properly (and not have your castle taken over or destroyed by enemies) - you have to play the game pretty much every day, which is a big ask.I enjoyed the building up aspects of Stronghold Kingdoms; the military aspects were OKish; but once I realised that the game is based upon the notion that you are committed to play the game every day, then I started to get over it pretty fast.By the way, the game has achievements, although they are not linked to Steam.Apparently, the game can be pay-to-win (you can buy extra abilities for short periods); however, I haven't noticed that aspect being too obvious (although it may not be too apparent, as you can win extra abilities, so you wouldn't know if your castle was being beseiged by someone who had paid for extras or not).Whilst I have logged a lot of hours on this game, the actual number of hours playing the game were a lot less than actually logged - as Stronghold Kingdoms is a small programme which can run in the background whilst you are doing other things on your computer (as buildings can take hours to construct, increasing each time you finish another building, I would swap to Stronghold Kingdoms every hour or two, click on a couple of items, and then swap back to whatever else I was doing on the computer).So, if there are wider statistics available on how many hours people have been playing Stronghold Kingdoms, those statistics may be a vast over-estimation of actual hours of game play.I can recommend this game for people who like strategy games, but only if they want to commit to playing almost every day for months on end.If you don't want that sort of commitment, then I recommend you don't play it.However, it's a free game, so no big loss if you play it for a few weeks, and then walk away from it.

If you had played the disc version of Stronghold 1 (1990 something) You probably got really excited to see that there is a new version of the old, awesome classic Stronghold. This is not what you think it is. This game is terrible. It is a total pay2win, the tutorial is bad, the controls are bad and its just simply not fun. Get this game to see for yourself if you wish, but I recommend you stay away from this game. 2/10			"

												A religious system that allows you to protect your villages from attacks by other players and AI. A political system that allows you to hold seats of goverment and command larger sized armies of those seats of power. A research tree that will take close to 2 years to complete all make up the depth this game has to offerWhen you maxed characters and run all the content that other MMO's offer in the first year, you will find that time in Stronghold Kingdoms is just scratching the surface. The server you play may be coming close to its conclusion of the 1st AGE after 1 year of play and rewarding the players who won that age but the game is far from over.There are 7 ages to the server and you carry everything you have attained into the following ages (gold, research , villages , faith points , honor). A server will on average take between 5 to 7 years to complete with great rewards in the end for those who played it throughWith the 100's of ways to play , you will be left wanting to do it all over again with what you learned. Most surprising is the number of women who play the game and I have known 3 who held the highest seats of power in the game, House Marshal. Leading 100's of players to age victoriesMy only complaint is the graphics are dated, but proof if you have a product with years of playability and a community where you meet players from all over the world forming life long friendships the player base will stay and grow.I look forward to the mobile release of this game			"

												The game has so much potential I love all firefly games esepcially stronghold crusader. But this one meh....... it's so much pay 2 win in this game. I don;t mind pay a monthly sub to get more que's for building and reasearch points I do not see that as pay 2 win tbh. But having people buying tons of cards just because their paycheck is higher then yours seems a bit unfair for game, in the real world it'd be ok. But in a game like this where your trying to escape reality it isn't much fun once you figure out that even in a game REAL MONEY RULES and not in game money.			"

												My favorite of all the MMOs I've tried. Consistently deep and fun, without ever feeling routine, bland, or mechanical. I don't know whether it's a pay-to-win game, as some claim, but it's certainly free to have a whole heap of fun. At its heart, though, the game is still an MMO and suffers from the relentless need to continuously push ahead â a few consecutive busy days in real life can be hard to overcome in the game world, a situation which doesn't match my lifestyle very well, I'm afraid. But if you enjoy MMOs, I highly recommend Stronghold Kingdoms. Shoot, you might even be able to talk me into getting back into it.			"

												I've been playing this game for over a year now and it is by far one of the best MMO War Games that I have played. With the monthly updates and near 100% uptime you never have to worry about this game crashing or bugging out. I love the card system and the ability to increase pretty much every aspect of the game with cards. From increasing the speed of your scouts and troops to the ammount of food you make in a day everything can be made better. Also One of the biggest selling points about this game that got me into it was the customizable Castles that you create 100% yourself. Other games dont allow you to do this which is what makes me like this game even more. Also seeing the scouts/merchants/armies/monks going across the map is pretty awesome. Being able to see just who is getting attacked and by how many armies is just awesome. Nothing better than seeing 10+ armies flying across the map to 1 village. Honestly, what got me to play this game in the first place was the fact that they had a USA map and that I could have a village in the actual state/county that I live in. No other game has their map based on Real Life locations that I am aware of which makes Stronghold Kingdom that much better. I strongly recommend this game for anyone who likes realtime war games.

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a Great game. There are a few things that could be better. the fact you have to pay to get premium tokens in order to build more buildings faster and get more cards sucks but people do it trust me. Id enjoy more maps and more game options like castel customization, village politics such as what you would do if you found a little boy stealing or if you found someone with special skill or someone in your village threatens you. more options for honor gain. Also i think research points shouldnt cost as much gold as it does after buying them only a few times, and you should gain more with higher lvls reached not just 3 everytime i lvl up in honour. Also a better way to veave threw inactives it sucks having inactive members in your parish that are no help i think you should be abke to report a player inactive that way the faster their village can be removed. thank you, yours truly  Blood_Hound_MP "

												Want to re-live those thrilling days of yesteryear when Lords and Ladies lived in castles and chivalry was a way of life? Stronghold Kingdoms is the game for you! It's a castle builder game... it's a build-and-grow your economy game...it's a wargame, all rolled into one! Join a faction to team your resources against invaders, or go it alone,  if you dare...You can build armies and be a marauding Prince, or build a religious conclave and spread the protection of the one true religion. Interactive choices means that every game is different...you decide how best to grow your medieval world!Perhaps the best feature, being an MMORPG, gives you an opportunity to interact with players from all over the  world, meeting new friends and cementing loyalties that can last for Ages. ---Guillaum--- "

												""This might be a game, but isn't meant to be played"" These words fit perfectly with this game, a huge Massively Multiplayer with a very profound game politics and mechanics that you won't find out in any Wikia, This game its actually very simple to play solo, but the Multiplayer aspect makes this game one of the hardest arround, you wouldn't be only making a huge castle and a nice village, taking resources from the map and attacking the IA, you'll have to join a faction, then a house, follow the rules and war statements, sometimes loosing all your villages and hard work in only a few hours, for reasons you don't understand, even voting yourself in some parish to complete a quest its enough reason to get 10 players start Ransacking you with out a warning.And still i love this game, it has a whole new depth level that you won't find in any other real time strategy in the world, you have to work out your diplomacy, make friends and enemies, this might be a war game but you have to play it smart, even if you spend a lot of money the boost it gives will become less important over time, its not a ""pay to win game"" if you play it for long enough to realise.

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a dangerous game.  It is at least for me, as it is highly addictive.  I feel compulsed to play everyday, as there is always more to achieve.  I have noted several reviews which complain about card play and buying cards.  I have gotten strong in the game by investing time, not money.  I did buy cards to move from three free cards a week to 14 cards a week.  But I am keeping most of my cards for a future game . . . (evil laugh).  I do find the premium token useful, mostly when I am building a new town.If you want to see come check me out in USA1.  For I am:Dan Longshanks			"

												Not that I installed steam, because I wanted to get the prizes from the giveaway, I always wanted to share my opinion on this game. IÂ´ve been playing this game since the Alpha and I was astonished how cool it was and still is. Yet, in World1, I needed a break, because it was too much time consuming. I came back 4 years after that and started World8 where I was very succesful, but then they announced there will be the Europe Map, something I wanted since the very beginning. Europe was a big disappointment for me because i wanted to be king of my home country, however there were so many Polish I had no chance to fight against them with just a few of my countrymen, so I quit it. I eventually got to be Crown Prince in World8, but that world was too competitive for me and after I finished the quests I wanted (I wanted to unlock all charges for the coat of arms designer), I quit the game and the whole summer it was left untouched. But I love that game so much, building villages is the greatest thing ever, fighting might get repetitive, research is slow, but cards are a great thing though and very helpful, quest make the game interesting and even though as a newcomer to a nAge4 world, you can rise up the ranks if you make the right friends. ItÂ´s the perfect game for strategist and lovers of the Stronghold franchise and because it brought me back to play it after 4 years (I kept thinking about the game the whole time!!) I have to say itÂ´s the game that fits my appetite most. :) Matthias Vitalis			"

												Once you get your head around the real-time play, Stronghold Kingdoms is an exciting, absorbing and really fun game for the dedicated player. You can choose to advance quickly or slowly (there are advantages and disadvantages to both) and you can build your empire to suit your own strategy. Once you join a faction, you can communicate and cooperate with other players in common goals. Or, you can play as a lone wolf, quietly inveigling yourself into positions of power (or weakness - be careful!)The responsibility is yours to keep your peasants fed and housed, your fields producing, your businesses trading at a profit and your county free of villains. If warring strategy suits you best, you can battle against the wolves, the bandits or the Enemy for starters. Beyond that, there's the wicked marauders who will try to overcome your best plans and beat you down. Be ready for them or pay the price!If your plans are successful and you grow in wealth and power, you can gain status as a sherrif or even a prince. You can muster multiple armies to defend your capital or extend your reach. During all this, you can chart a course of study and upgrades that will govern the way you earn victory. There's a lot to do in Stronghold Kingdoms and much to ponder on.Come and visit me in any of my parishes. My name's Betrisher and I'm a Lady of Galway. :)			"

												it's a build your castle, and fight to defend in present time vs real players game. Always something I've ever wanted, doesn't require money, and it has continuous game play that never ends (to my knowledge). You never have to worry about a server ended and all your villages going *poof.* The hard work and time spent pays off, and you have possible boosts that require money, but they are well worth it. It deals a great number of benefits, that seem to be worth your money.  Overall its a great game and worth the time, but you don't need to have that much time either. 9/10only thing i would change is to have a easier way to distribute, sell resources, build troops etc. from one screen. After you get so far into the game and have multiple villages it would help a lot!!! :)			"

												Hi.  My name is Amber_Rose, and I am a SHK addict.  (Say ""Hi Amber_Rose!"")  I've been playing for almost four years.  I do sometimes get irritated with the game, and it often seems like a full-time job, but I've never seriously considered leaving it.  Yes, it has flaws.  Yes, it requires a lot of dedication.  But it has aspects that draw you back to it.  It's highly complex and can take years to master.  It has quirks that you learn to work around.  But it also has a great group of dedicated players from all over the world, and the opportunity to get to know people in a remarkably personal way.  I've read a lot of complaints here about it being 'pay to play'.  But many of the best players I know spend very little (if anything) to play.  It's not a game for people who buy an Xbox game and expect to master it in a week.  It rewards you for sticking with it.  I've experienced great success in the game, and I've experienced monumental failures.  I've made serious enemies who have threatened to find me in real life, and I've made lifelong friends.  I've seen people disappear from the game for years only to suddenly return.  Every day brings  something new.  In some ways it's changed my life.  And my knowledge of the geography of Europe has improved tremendously!So if you're looking for some amusement on a boring day, don't consider this game.  But if you're someone who has the time and inclination to immerse themselves in a virtual world with like-minded people, by all means try it.			"

												I read the reviews before playing this game and have played 'free-to-play' games, before.  I just got done sinking 6 months of intensive time into this game; and then left it like so many others. Turns out that player turnaround is high - is it any wonder why? Firefly certainly doesn't seem to care as long as buckets of money are pouring in.In a nutshell, it is a very addictive game and it 'can' be fun - but veteran players can be very 'clickie'. Also, many people end up in a fat cloud of disappointment for a few different reasons despite their best efforts.For example: If you manage to be lucky enough to start fresh in a new world that has just opened (I got to participate in 2 of them; I found the already-established worlds to be - well, established); don't expect to be anything other than a farmer or a merchant unless you are a heavy 'carder' - someone who sinks lots of money into cards for the game.No, you don't need to sink a bunch of money into the game, yourself - but other players who are on power trips and apparently have nothing better to do with hundreds of dollars; can really put a kink into your game experience. Unless you are kissing their butts, of course. And in that case, you are often just a tool for them to use.And don't expect to be able to come into the game with new perspectives and ideas... You will promptly be put in your place real fast.Also, don't even bother trying out the PvE 'wolf world' until they get it out of Beta. They make you pay for that game and it is so out of balance, it is ridiculous - although the game moves faster and is the most fun world to play, in my opinion (if/when they get it reasonably playable -I may return to check it out if they ever do).For instance, in the PvE world; AI castles can move in and immediately land as a large castle with several hundred soldiers that can immediately be used against you. Wheras, YOU can only have an army of 500 - and only 400 of those can be on your castle at a time to defend it. Add multiple captain attacks coming at your villa at once, and you DEFINITELY need cards. You CANNOT play in the wolf world without them - and even then, don't expect to get very far very fast. Even with lots of help from other players.If you don't have a lot of money to sink into this game, but you have some... Do buy the 2 sets of crowns that they want you to buy to progress for about $5 each. That will bump you up to getting 14 cards a week to use or turn in for other cards that you need. You can stop there and not spend any more - you will also win extra cards & prizes, at times. Also, foraging will bring you lots of wheel spins in the PvE world if you really want to try that one out using as little money as possible.Do I recommend Stronghold Kingdoms? Only if you are a hardcore gamer who likes to be on a ts (teamspeak) team.			"

												This game may be in a basic platform and simplistic type of animation, but don't let that turn you away. This game is the ultimate in midieval strategy. It takes place in... well. wherever you really want it to. You place your kingdom, or have it placed randomly, it doesn't matter, however your placement can change who is your ally, and who's at your throat. As a general tip, you should choose a name that isn't offensive or brutal, otherwise that could influence people to attack you. This game is not exactly hostile, but if you make people angry, there can be great wars that could wipe you off the maps, so choose carefully your words, your contacts, and your alliances, along with your enemies!

												This game is a very fun game and it has its drawbacks. There are very few drawbacks the fact that it takes a long time to get things done but they try to reduce this by starting and kind of scaling up in time, but eventually things will take a very long time to get done but thats the kind of what you get with games like these. For the genre I think that SK is the best I have played because of some of its features, like the skill tree and its titlebased honor leveling system. The game is strategic also if you have a couple of friends playing with you it would be best because it would really help in getting up the ladder faster. I really like the quest system as well because the rewards are actually useful for the quest u complete like they are fair. 10/10 would play again.			"

You will need to be patient, this game is meant to look after it self while you enjoy searching for a faction and house to join. I have been lucky enough to find such and flourish without much complication and I have been given useful advice by everyone in my faction. You will be involved in wars, you will have times where you need to adjust your village for better purpose and you will most certainly loose soldiers. The combat is fun to watch and NPC castles can be a challenge to those that wish to test themselves.Overall it is a game that requires thought, patience and willingness to make alligences. A game for people who desire a chance to build an empire.Auroran			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is not for everyone. Some people love it and play it for years, and others get bored with it after a couple days if not even an hour. It will take up a lot of time, requiring you to play for countless hours to rank up, fight, and earn gold. It is very much a Pay to Win game. The people who spend the most money, usually end up winning. It takes some skill, but the benefits that can be earned through the cards system which you mostly buy with money can make up for a lack of it. I have played for over two years and have enjoyed it and hated it at the same time. It is addictive and will keep drawing you in. But there are many things about it that are not good. There are bugs and glitches that have never been fixed, it is too easy for one side to dominate and completey kill a server, and just the amount of time it takes up is insane(easily 7-8 hours a day). However this being said, I would recommend atleast trying it out. I have made some really good friends through the years playing this, and although there are many problems it can be fun to the right person.  -spudicus			"

												Compared to other games iv played this one is pretty decent, sure few people in it pay to win and it does help some but there is ways to play were its not needed to pay alot.Quests are pretty fun in it and plentiful and it is pretty fun making your own villages and castles.There is a few negatives on the game sadly as in all games. People are pretty rude at times, Harder to start if you land in a bad area. Takes alot of time to make a keep for your castle while its pretty easy and fast to destroy it...Other then that its a pretty decent game.Tamaracl~			"

I was shocked on how good the game was because usually free games aren't this addicting. Thank you and keep the updates coming. DovahPig			"

												This is greenwitch nice to meet you all. StrongHold Kingdoms is one of those games that will draw you in and keep your attention.  It is a war style game where you have to use stradgy as well as really work as a team. This game is about teamwork !I have met so many people on SHK I stopped playing for a few weeks here and there but not only the game brings me back but the people bring me back. This game gives you the chance to work in a war style setting and think about how to take over the map and work as a team to do so.			"

												*Deep Voice* Stronghold Kingdoms...A universe which allows you to humiliate an adversary and destroy their hard work and diminish their hard earned money. After sucking you in through their delightful and peaceful trailers, not all is what it seems. After you have logged in you must put out the flames of war upon your world, unite the good (or evil) factions and annihilate your enemies. If you are not one of those people prepare to face a might greater than the roman legions! Stronghold Kingdoms introduces are Card system, whereby you can magically form an army together in a matter of seconds; however this also works when the army is facing your, clearly well built wooden walls and stingy overpaid archers, as you can invoke a sally forth card to hire some overpaid, slightly overweight knights on horseback (obviously, i mean a knight without a horse???!) to obliterate...2...or 3 peasants, before they gracefully slump to the ground with 100+ arrows in their chest.The world of Stronghold Kingdoms is a chaotic hell hole that will suck every living moment from your soul, until your so hell bent on revenge that you will do whatever it takes to defeat your opponent. If all else fails you can march upon them with the might of the 300!!...peasants!Overall this game provides hours of endless torment and destruction of hope. Once all your hope is gone it continues to wear away at your gaming soul with a simple tech tree, that leaves the indecisive staring endlessly at that page until only bones remain (shouldve researched more APPLES!). The games time-based/Real time strategy element allows you to combine with others to completely obilterate their castles with armies of over 9000!!!!! (Only works once YOU have united the good of the world!), otherwise itll be a few hundred troops, then all you have to hope is that the player hasnt got hold of the ultimate weapon...Daddy's credit card...and then hell breaks loose...Play the game and find out if you are the chosen one that will unite the world and destroy evil people (that includes the rich).-Username: XanoXL			"

												Absolutely fun game!!! The strategy in this is somewhat like LOU but you get to design your castle which adds some extra spice. Plus, the captains can use abilities which creates a more complex level to attacking.But, there is no card limit per day so a wealthy person could do pretty much what he or she would like to towards a certain extent. growingshadow			"

												This game has a depth that most strategy games lack, that is the necessity to form relationships with other players in the game to achieve success. No single person can hope to win this game, but every house has an equal chance to dominate depending on the level of cooperation they achieve. It has a great pace for those who are willing to part with some money, but if u decide to go the no money route u can still achieve success, it just takes awhile longer. It has a nice mix of game features that can be done at your pace from scouting, warring, to just plain farming. Although its a war game, monk and farm based players are essential to the success of your house and ultimately your own success as well. I have played this game for over a year and still find it enjoyable to play. But dont just take my word for it, create your free account and join in the fun.

												A fun and easy game to get into, new players will soon find themselves immersed in a world far more complex than it's user-friendly interface would have them believe. Most tasks don't feel like chores, and completing any task or quest leaves one feeling rather accomplished.  Friends and allies are easy to find, and even if one invests minimal time into this game, they will find themselves rising through the ranks far faster than they may have anticipated.  There are challenges ahead, mostly earned by facing down other players, but it is easy enough to rise to the task.All players have within them a ruler struggling to break free.

												This game is absolutely stunning for strategy and intelligent quick thinking. Large scale wars, faction vs faction, House vs House. The thousands, the millions of players choosing to either share and get along in a lasting community, or to destroy anyone in their path. The game has it's ups and downs. Up: You can have 40 villages as of current! There are tons of ranks to work towards, and many many unlockables and boosts you can get for no charge, including researches (You may buy spare points with in-game gold), you can own tons of landmarks such as Counties, Parishes, Provinces, and even the Countries themselves! Downs: You're prone to destruction at a low level if you don't find yourself protected by a high standing Liege Lord. My Liege Lord is my grandfather, who currently holds a high position, in the top 500 players globally, with over 14 villages, he's a Crown Prince. I chose a small island community, which may have it's ups as far as being seclusive and peaceful goes, but the resources can be a bit slim until you are able to go over-seas.Will I reccomend the game? To be quite frank, â¥â¥â¥â¥ YEAH I WILL!!! Nothing can really amount to this game's content and abilities, without completely copying it's style.			"

(if you are into an in depth long term strategy MMO.)        I do wish they used a little more with the landscape like in the old ones.    Also,  the troops tend to do stupid things sometimes.    I wish you could put rally points for the troops to go to,  when they get there they could proceed to the next one. (maybe as an advanced option.)       Game is to reliant on Faith Points.   There is a domination world that removed them completely but it's not a long term game.       Over lots of fun in my opinion if you have the time and a little money. NastyTactics815			"

												Every once in a while a game comes around that's free to play and truly surpasses your expectations. Stronghold Kingdoms really is one of those games, for me. This game brings a competitve nature, in a very welcome and friendly environment. No special skills are needed, just a killer knack for stratagy! Bring your A-game and get ready to make alliances and crush your foes! If you are a fan of stratagy games you will love this game. Besides where is a downside to building up an impenetrable castle, a massive army and a rock solid village economy to make you the king/queen you deserve to be!			"

												Like many online browser games of the ""freemium"" genre, Stronghold Kingdoms greatly favors big real-money spenders and gives everyone else--from small money spenders to the free-to-play majority--the shaft. This is not a game for someone who isn't willing to exploit every little fiber of the system or the fact that one is playing with real people, and therefore the smart player who cannot afford to spend hundreds of dollars to keep up with the big spenders must essentially lie, cheat, and backstab the majority of the player's adversaries--and at the same time, the big spenders with their awfully game-breakingly large armies are liable to do the same to you! Even if you chose to be a peaceful bystander. On the technical side this game features doznes of technologies from four trees: Industry for resource production, Military for the army, Education for cultultural influence (which moves you ahead), and Farming for general agriculture. Their functions in the game are more or less obvious, but in order to use them effectively you must be willing to forgo wasting in-game currency on ""useless"" technology and find the best way to combine the usefulness of technologies.The military is very simple: Peasants who are easy to draft en masse (expect to use these little guys a lot early on, and expect the premium players to never use them until they're spent), archers whom are fragile but can easily snipe enemies at a distance (expect to see big complex castles hosting these in their towers, which are protected by statkes early on and moats later on), pikeman for a balanced assualt and defense (early on these guys are impossible to get without spending real money, meaning you will not be able to use them for nearly a month while players who pay large sums of money will almost certaainly send these guys in waves in the first week!), swordsman who are basically the ultimate offensive unit, and Captains who serve as city-takers and leaders.The castle construction part of the game is more complex and a bit fun when you're in-game rich enough to capitalize on the insane powers of tall towes and thick stone walls built in a maze with deliberate weaknesses in certain spots for the sole purpose of luring the attacking A.I. (even human enemies cannot control the battle itself, therefore the winner is essentially determined at the start) through your death maze with hailstorms of arrows!Although the beginning can be rough, if you survive, you might see what I mean in the above.However, this game is in real time, which means human enemies from the other end of the world hitting you in your sleep and real people waiting on you. If you cannot commit to serious play then don't play at all--""semi-actives"" are almost always ignored, bullied, pillaged and eventually conquered by the 16-hour players.Luckily the majority of the players don't like money-spenders unless they're in the same ""faction"" (i.e., a group of players who formed a veritable country with a government and political process and everything), and will therefore be willing to work with you in fighting the rich. Also note, the real fun comes from factions, as they have the real power (despite the fact Houses are meant to be groups of factions, they don't have any direct authority whereas faction leaders are practical dictators). In my experience the best role to play is that of a faction leader, but I highly recommend you find people to join you at least a month ahead of time. Otherwise you're putting faith in the random people you recruited in the local regions.  Also note being a dictator--or oligarch--requires you to invest much of your personal time and have extensive knowledge of the game (or at least a very good idea).From the follower perspective, the game is much harder as it's very difficult to find a decent faction to match your desires. And if you join then leave too many factions you will almost certainly develop a bad reputation and be shunned by many. Therefore you might want to consider taking up leadership--even if it's small and weak, it's better to be the sole owner of a small-time business than a shareholder in a coorperation because you will at least learn from your mistakes and from them, do better next time (under a different name and account ideally).In conclusion, this game is the epitome of Social Darwinism and it greatly favors people willing to shell anywhere from 30$ to 150$. With those who spent 150$ effectively buying out the game.I have found it a massochistic pleasure, the challenge is punishing but the rewards are great, I'd give it a score of and 80/100 compared to most browser games and a 60/100 for games in general. This game will tease you with it's fun times and really bite you in the butt with it's jerks and big spenders, therefore if you want to play, you better bring your poker face and conceal don't feel.Username: Alois Blucher			"

												First of all , im a Strategy game nut. Stronghold kingdoms is a good and fun game where there is alot I like about it and some things I do no like. I love the complex of what you can do and be in this game and the different strategys you can use to defeat your opponents such as taking his castles by force or beating your opponents in monking ( political power by votes etc) and even taking his weapons / food and resources. The one downfall I do not like about the game is how much cards can help you or aid you in winning over your opponent who has not buy cards. Than again this game is free so they gotta make there money somehow.As a little review of the game you basically start off with 1 village and begin making buildings and upgrading your castles to defend either against AI's or real players from either destroying your castle, pillaging , ransaking ( destroying your buildings you built inside the village ) or even destroying the castle all togethor. Also in the game there are what is called Parishs, and each village inside this parish gets to votes once per day electing one person to contol the parish as a steward of it. There is also even more seats that you can earn thru people voting for you to be the leader.You level so to the speak from Honour, Honour is used to lvl up thru the ranks earning your more villages , research points and the ability to attack your opponents. You can earn this thru buildings , Banqueting, defending your castle from troops or from attacking AI.There is so much more and I can go on and on but Overall its a fun and great game as i have over 700+ hrs played and strongly recommend it.NerdRageDan			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is  the most delightful free to play game. Free to plays are often really pay to wins that shamelessly harrass players into playing but Stronghold kingdoms is diffrent in that all its content is there for everyone and paying (which really feels like donateing) only gives you the advantage of assinging more than one task and stragy cards give only temporary but satisfying bonuses.

												So I'm an older gamer (31) and always enjoy a strategy game and this one can be very addictive.  Though there are players that drop money on cards for a bit of an edge you can still compete over time and enjoy player vs player combat and diplomacy.  It is also a good game if you have limited time these days for gaming, pop in, build a view building launch a few attacks and check later.  Either way, the game is fun and easy to play/catch on.  Enjoy!Stronghold Kingdoms player name-  Deazal			"

												I thought I'd write a review of this game since there seems to be a hell of alot of negative reviews about it, so I I'd try and share my experience of it so far.I started pretty late on, and as such had no idea what was going on. I'd never played any MMO game before as my laptop specs are retro to say the least. The tutorial was quite useful, letting you know the bare minimum to get your village started. The rewards and quests are nice, it breaks up the gameplay. I realise this was a recent addition, so I'm not sure if I'd stuck with it without the game giving regular feedback to tell me I was doing something right.I'm also puzzled at how people are giving negative reviews to a game that they spent two THOUSAND hours on. Some people spend less time with girl/boyfriends in their lifetime. I'm amazed at how it can take two thousand hours to find out you don't like a game.To some extent the online the experience will be affected by more experienced players. For instance, when I started, the players were really helpful to new players, communicating lots of tips to level up, and advice about castle/village layout and build order. It's not a game for lone wolves, which may deter new players, and you have to play regularly to get to the attacking/defending stage. And although you do have an advantage if you pay to buy cards, it's not a single player game, and you can always ask a higher ranked player for help and advice. At worst, they won't message you back, but most active players seem to welcome newcomers to the game.I'll continue to play as long as other people do.meu02136, currently in USA2			"

												First of all I would like to commend the developers of the game for this magnificent game. As keen player of strategy games I would like to make few comments:Pros:- Great graphics for online strategy game.- Great diversity for villages and resources that can be used.- Easy to work with environment.- Many factors to consider (some may consider that over comlication of the game but personally I like it as it makes the game more challenging).Cons:- The diversity of the units is somewhat limited which makes tactics quiet predicatable especially at servers with around 3-4 years of playing time.- More incentives are needed to encourage wars and make the game more lively as it is becoming less and less active to be honest. Yearly target or something similar can be implemented in the game to make the players more tempted to go to wars.- Research time should stop escalating and reach some sort of ceiling. 1 reseach/12 hour is reseaonable max timeTamimi1982			"

												This game has it's ups and downs.  Challenging, but rewarding.  Basically you'll start from scratch starting from a single village scouting for resources, creating weapons for your armies, adding new buildings to your villages, researching new technologies/upgrades and designing castles.  Eventually you'll have multiple villages and sizable armies where you will join with others to attack enemy factions.     If you can get into a friendly, helpful faction things can be easier for you.  Unfortunately, one of the biggest downfalls for SK is in order to compete with hardcore/longtime players you will have spend cash on this game.  Buying cards and tokens can get pricey so I'd recommend trying out SK for a week or three before throwing money at this game.  Even with a card edge don't be surprised on losing resources, villages, etc from a enemy faction or from some who is having a bad hair day.  I've seen strong and skillful players lose everything and have to start a new village from scratch.   This game is slow paced and you will need patience in order to get the most out of it.   If you like faster action paced games then SK might not be the  game for you.  If your into teamwork, slower paced thinking strategy with an added touch of cunning and skulduggery then this game might be for you.  The game does have it's positive points.  One of the more interesting aspects is the research tree.  The research tree is huge and it will take you many months to go through a sizable portion of it.  Careful research planning is vital if you want to survive in SK.  Another interesting aspect are monks.  If you don't like the direct frontal approach of fighting players monks give you a more subtle Machiavellian way of messing with enemy factions.  Despite it's problems I still enjoy playing this game and plan on playing in the near future.  I've had people ask me if they should try it.  My response is try it out for yourself.  You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.-Stonetailz			"

												very addicting, its free so what have you to lose other than countless hours of you life on here?pros- they have a max army per village you have, the reason thats a good thing is that it doesnt matter when you start, if you are fast and tactical you can fight anyonevery helpful communityif you dont like asking people for help, simply hit the questionmark that you can find on literally every screen and it takes you to the wiki of the game so theres no worries about not knowing what a certain building does or how to unlock buildings and unitsthey have cards that give you a little extra bonus but cost money to get the packs, however you can get up to a max of 2 of these cards for free a day, if you dont like what you got simply save up 5 of them and swap them for points and after awhile you can buy your card of choice without spending a pennycons-pay to win, ive seen one person single handedly take out an entire house (alliance) single handedly because they spent alot of money on the game, to get around that you have to keep your head low and not aggrivate people unless you dont mind losing your villas or have alot of cash to blow off to keep up with them... but, as i said earlier, the community is pretty chill, ive yet to get attacked for no reason, only during war time so you only have to worry about heavy spenders if you ware going to war with themall in all a great game to pass the time, takes time to build stuff so you can minimize the window and do something else as you wait out the build time, completely recommend itin game name fiz cola			"

As you grow within this game, you will not only become addicted, but you will also meet online friends, giving you the opportunity to actually lead real people in real time situations. The game play is slick, excellent opportunities to grow your village and support your fellow players through cards, however, you do not need to buy cards to keep up with others, so wont cost you a fortune to grow like other games.In all, this is a 10 out of 10 platform that you HAVE to try.

If you are a fan of high blood-pressure politics mixed with the type of dedication you like to see in the workplace or in school then this is the game for you.

												Stronghold Kingdoms is  the most delightful free to play game. Free to plays are often really pay to wins that shamelessly harrass players into playing but Stronghold kingdoms is diffrent in that all its content is there for everyone and paying (which really feels like donateing) only gives you the advantage of assinging more than one task and stragy cards give only temporary but satisfying bonuses.

												So I'm an older gamer (31) and always enjoy a strategy game and this one can be very addictive.  Though there are players that drop money on cards for a bit of an edge you can still compete over time and enjoy player vs player combat and diplomacy.  It is also a good game if you have limited time these days for gaming, pop in, build a view building launch a few attacks and check later.  Either way, the game is fun and easy to play/catch on.  Enjoy!Stronghold Kingdoms player name-  Deazal			"

												I thought I'd write a review of this game since there seems to be a hell of alot of negative reviews about it, so I I'd try and share my experience of it so far.I started pretty late on, and as such had no idea what was going on. I'd never played any MMO game before as my laptop specs are retro to say the least. The tutorial was quite useful, letting you know the bare minimum to get your village started. The rewards and quests are nice, it breaks up the gameplay. I realise this was a recent addition, so I'm not sure if I'd stuck with it without the game giving regular feedback to tell me I was doing something right.I'm also puzzled at how people are giving negative reviews to a game that they spent two THOUSAND hours on. Some people spend less time with girl/boyfriends in their lifetime. I'm amazed at how it can take two thousand hours to find out you don't like a game.To some extent the online the experience will be affected by more experienced players. For instance, when I started, the players were really helpful to new players, communicating lots of tips to level up, and advice about castle/village layout and build order. It's not a game for lone wolves, which may deter new players, and you have to play regularly to get to the attacking/defending stage. And although you do have an advantage if you pay to buy cards, it's not a single player game, and you can always ask a higher ranked player for help and advice. At worst, they won't message you back, but most active players seem to welcome newcomers to the game.I'll continue to play as long as other people do.meu02136, currently in USA2			"

												It's a great game, but you have to know that it takes time to be at the top. Buildings are built over hours rather than seconds, and you gain ranks over days and weeks rather than hours. The thing that this game lacks most is a dedicated chat window in the lower left corner. Without a chat window, alliances bond less and have more trouble communicating in game. With a chat window, this game would be everything my medievalist geek self could wish for. Byrtfirth			"

												This is definitely a game where the lone wolf dies and the pack survives.  You need to join together with other players using the faction and clan system.  It takes a lot of effort to build up your castles and villages to rival the best in your chosen Kingdom.   You can play without ever being attack by another player for many months if you mind your own business.   When war does inevitably arrive, you could lose everything, this adds a massive risk element to the game and really makes you defend your castles.  This is when you need your friends and allies you have acquired through the well developed chat and mail system that the game provides.Of course, when you have developed your castles and villages you can become an aggressive war maker.  You can wipe out villages and castles that may have taken weeks to develop in a matter of minutes.  The game heavily favours the defender over the attacker, but nothing is ever totally safe.     Even the strongest individual player can easily be destroyed by a combined effort from a faction or clan.If you do manage to rise to be a Sheriff, Governor or King you must remember  âSic transit gloria mundiâ.  Many other players want to rise to your position.Cripper2			"

												Great game. Played from almost the beginning and have seen many come and go, but there is  a solid core of players faithful to this game.With the many wars, alliances made and broken, villages destroyed, plundered or captured, there has not been a boring moment.  The key to playing this game, in my opinion, has to do with the relationships made with the other players. Faction and houses eventually fall apart. Ones who just up and qiut also happen. But anyone you have played with for a time will earn your respect, enemy or not, because they stick around through the good and bad times, a full or empty map.Any who just started playing, my advise is to quickly build such alliances, not with factions or houses, but with the players. I feel that is what makes this war game fun.Pyloth			"

												The game isn't for everyone. You will need a lot of free time as you will need to be on your computer a lot. It is also a pay-to-win game for most part. You can still be vital without money, but having money makes everything faster and more efficient. All in all, not a completely bad game because of the people you will meet around the world. It is a grind type of game.  "

												Wow so many harsh reviews.   I played the standalone client before the steam version so ignore timed played.Pros:A slow paced, strategy, non-fantasy, medieval, castle building game for working adults that don't have 24 hours a day to sit in their mom's basement and play all day.  If you have a FULL TIME job, you either need a game like this, or you have to lose something else like sleep, social life - screw that. Cons: Spending $7.00 a month gives you advantages, not overwhelming by any means, but noticable compared to F2P people.Pros (for in game):  Playing solo is almost always going to lead you to getting raided, your villages burned to the ground or captured. This is an MMO and without a guild/clan you will get smashed (I rate this under pros cause otherwise, why arern't you just playing a single player game..?)Cons (for in game):  As a casual playing full-time-working adult, the game seemed good for my varied and rare play times, but the people in your guilds/clans are ALWAYS hardcore 24/7 people and generally want you to be as well, almost forcing you to either be in a terrible, losing-the-war guild or to go solo (see above on solo)CARDS:  Although I have payed for about six months worth of this game to be a paid-member, I refuse to purchase their booster card packs.  The cards can do things like make your armies move faster, add flags to your capital (flags are building currency in your capitals), give you extra food, and things like that...   I have found NONE of the cards to be overwhelming to the point where the game forces you to have them.  This is where the chicken and the egg theroy starts with most people complaining about this game.  Some guilds/clans enforce you to have certain cards availible so when you attack or are being attacked you can play them, and use the cards text (whatever it may be) to your advantage. This is especially helpful against F2P players who most likely have no cards.  I played a map from the beginning to the end of AGE II and never had the cards that the guild/clan wanted me to have and it made ZERO difference.  I know, I know, not a team player.. blah blah - BUT, i'm saying I still had a fun time, still have fun memories of assualting an entire faction and winning (losing some too..) without spending a dime.    The subscription I choose to pay, ($7.00/month works out to +20 coins to spend on things and 30 days sub time) was because I was unable to play the game and micromanage things 24/7 so it really was there to help me work 40 hours a week and still stay somewhat competitive with my basement troll friends that don't have to pay rent!All in all, I'd give it a passing, 6/10, for the pass-the-time play and attempt at making a game that feels somewhat realistic, but i still feel a 6 is stretching it a bit because there arn't enough worlds openeing now, and joining one that is already near the end of an age is almost pointless. The best thing you can do it simply wait for a new non-domination realm to open and get your friends to jump in with you.  I promise you will have fun and remember, this isn't a PEW PEW PEW game.. it's not a twitch and win game, it's a long term strategy game that resembles Axis and Allies.  BTW, if you don't know what the Axis and Allies board game was, my god, look it up - it's better than some video games. "

												Great Game!  It is challenging on many different levels, and requires multi-strategy.  You dont just build your villages you build and maintain castles.  At the same time, you research, trade, and cultivate faith points to make sure you have enough to ID when needed, and to use them to fight.  Your villages can be destroyed with a well timed attack or multiple attacks timed up, so there is strong impetus to learn how to defend well.  By playing with a faction and ultimately a house, you strive for glory, learn how to fight as a team, and end up joining communities online of like minded people; so in effect it becomes a very social game.  One issue is that certain individuals (I wont name any Russians names) multi account, and because they spend alot of money firefly allows it, and they dominate certain servers, Europe server being one.  Overall though, very good game!  Brethranus (in game name)			"

												The best military strategy game, Requiring diplomacy, cooperation, and great patients.  Its a game you can play as you are doing other things and other games.  The time it takes to do anything in this game allows one to perform 30mins or so of interactions and to check back in hours later.  So even though it takes time to do anything in the game its not a major time drain.  Some of the best game mechanics in a city builder and strategy game I have ever seen.  With many paths to victory including, monking, supplier, or fighter depending on how you prioritize your research.  Highly recommend this game, and it is the longest running game I have ever played.			"

												First of all I would like to commend the developers of the game for this magnificent game. As keen player of strategy games I would like to make few comments:Pros:- Great graphics for online strategy game.- Great diversity for villages and resources that can be used.- Easy to work with environment.- Many factors to consider (some may consider that over comlication of the game but personally I like it as it makes the game more challenging).Cons:- The diversity of the units is somewhat limited which makes tactics quiet predicatable especially at servers with around 3-4 years of playing time.- More incentives are needed to encourage wars and make the game more lively as it is becoming less and less active to be honest. Yearly target or something similar can be implemented in the game to make the players more tempted to go to wars.- Research time should stop escalating and reach some sort of ceiling. 1 reseach/12 hour is reseaonable max timeTamimi1982			"

												NOTE: I had fun while I played, otherwise wouldn't play at all. Having in-game connections helped. I still recommend it for the sake of trying and knowing what is what, it's not for everyone. I didn't feel that I needed to Pay4Win to get a good game and be a good player. Sure, you won't get to the feet of those that love to spend their pennies, but not bad either.Aaaah...I remember playing this game not so long ago. Once I logged in I had the gut feeling that I was going in for a treat at first glance on the map. It looked peaceful at first but the objective in this was quite clear: TeamworkWarDominateRuleThe first thing I did was set me up good with the parish ruler and all the parish player. Help each other out, ask what were the objectives of that specific parish and keep in touch so to work together on setting up a good strong parish. In no time I'm recommended a faction since I had a good set of objectives and knew how to team around and keep in touch. A sense of loyality eventually grows, got to trust those more experienced and keep in touch with everyone (again) to dominate and secure all the parishes/counties belonging to your faction. Once secured we just got to keep the rule, enter a wee bit of peace time and in a flash trouble brews and once again, lose some win some (territories).Sounds quite exciting doesn't it? Seems like your thing? It was for me, too. The game's diplomacy is brutal and if you end up in a very active territory you should be ready to be farmed/conquered and do the same too. Unless you've got more military driven people to back you up, climbing the ranks as a peace keeper will be very very painful and very well a waste of time. You basically have to set up two main initial roles at least: Fighter or Support. I was a fighter and got to admit it was one of the best online fun (browse(kinda)) experiences I had. The communication, the fighting, the commerce, the conquering the thrill of getting payback and crushing opponents knowing I was making them angry in real life. But after 1 month and a half I had enough. This game requires a certain commitment and while I knew how to manage the time, this game isn't for the person that doesn't know how to manage time of online fun. Otherwise you'll look at the clock and your wife/husband/partner/errand fell asleep or was ditched waiting for you. Unless one does know how to manage time, this game will only suit retired people or very very bored people with much time to spare.I recommend the game because of its strategical competitivity and how it can all turn into a messy chaos with all backstabbing and having to rely on teamwork/diplomacy for survival. The collective ladder climb. If you're a competitive person that seeks some competition in the online gaming department this game is a great provider of such.Just be aware of the timing downside and be very manageable. Otherwise stay away.Cheers			"

												Great game! truely gives a taste of mid-evil civilization. However, once one house dominates they will dominate for YEARS! Some houses are so powerful that they've managed to take over every continent on the map. Plus that house will set the rules for everyone else to follow and if you dont follow them well you want be able to play on that world.			"

												this is the first good game i have played since evony/civony that you can capture and destroy other players cities, and i love that you can design your own defensive castle.things i wish were changed/added;1. ability to see how much excomm a city has from the map, i.e. a city you sent excomm to.2. when sending troops to a vassal, there needs to be an ""all"" button. the sliders get very tedious.3. the ability to set cities to auto-bless the parish it resides in, or a button with a dropdown box below it for parish selection that makes the max # of monks in a city and sends them to bless the selected parish all in one action.4.a monk ability that removes interdictionUSA1XxEinherjerxX			"

												One of the most pay to win games I've ever played. You can literately buy a defeat of an opponent by purchasing and using cards.   I guess the consensus is that people are fine with it, the community is fine with it and so, I am a minority. Pay to win, in this game, is welcomed by the community. Just a heads up. It is neither good nor bad, it just is - the way of the road.			"

												*Deep Voice* Stronghold Kingdoms...A universe which allows you to humiliate an adversary and destroy their hard work and diminish their hard earned money. After sucking you in through their delightful and peaceful trailers, not all is what it seems. After you have logged in you must put out the flames of war upon your world, unite the good (or evil) factions and annihilate your enemies. If you are not one of those people prepare to face a might greater than the roman legions! Stronghold Kingdoms introduces are Card system, whereby you can magically form an army together in a matter of seconds; however this also works when the army is facing your, clearly well built wooden walls and stingy overpaid archers, as you can invoke a sally forth card to hire some overpaid, slightly overweight knights on horseback (obviously, i mean a knight without a horse???!) to obliterate...2...or 3 peasants, before they gracefully slump to the ground with 100+ arrows in their chest.The world of Stronghold Kingdoms is a chaotic hell hole that will suck every living moment from your soul, until your so hell bent on revenge that you will do whatever it takes to defeat your opponent. If all else fails you can march upon them with the might of the 300!!...peasants!Overall this game provides hours of endless torment and destruction of hope. Once all your hope is gone it continues to wear away at your gaming soul with a simple tech tree, that leaves the indecisive staring endlessly at that page until only bones remain (shouldve researched more APPLES!). The games time-based/Real time strategy element allows you to combine with others to completely obilterate their castles with armies of over 9000!!!!! (Only works once YOU have united the good of the world!), otherwise itll be a few hundred troops, then all you have to hope is that the player hasnt got hold of the ultimate weapon...Daddy's credit card...and then hell breaks loose...Play the game and find out if you are the chosen one that will unite the world and destroy evil people (that includes the rich).-Username: XanoXL			"

												First and foremost, let me say that this is a game where you will need to pay to support the game at some point if you want to really get into what others can do. However, it is never necessary to just play and support teammates and your factions. You can get enough free cards with just a couple of minimal purchases to allow you to do a few interesting things such as intantly repopulate an army on occassion or keep your production levels running high in your villages.I first ran into Stronghold Kingdoms just after lauch. I had been a fan of the franchise for several years already. I had already played a few 'MMORTS' games already, though, and was a bit burned out on the type of gameplay necessary to keep from getting steamrolled, i.e. sleepless nights, missing work or school, constantly watching from your smartphone... well, you get the point. The change from the high competition to strong cooperation was such I actually felt let down and dropped the game after a few months. (I will note that I did not make a strong effort to find a faction or join a house in the glory race, and so I had missed out on a huge section of gameplay that would have kept me playing.0I recently picked up SHK again and started playing and noticed some of the changes that had been made. I played a few weeks and noticed some of the core things weren't really different, though. If you don't join up with a faction/house, things are pretty boring. I should note that is unless you just decide to be the thorn in everyone's side, and of course, that has its own levels of excitement. I joined a house on the latest server, USA 2, and things are promising to be interesting.The one big addition to the game I have really liked is the quests. For people completely new to the game, it gives some direction as to how to play and what to do. For all, it's extra rewards that help you get established in the game faster and something else to compete over. They start off easy and build up to the difficult or very time/resource intensive.My final complaint about the game is that the honor cost of attacking smaller players can still be prohibitive. This is what gives the game its more laid back style, but makes it difficult to deal with the annoying players that deliberately don't level up and constantly harrass with cheap troops just to annoy those around them.Overall, I give SHK a thumbs up as it can keep a properly-minded person entertained for hours and days at a time without requiring you to sit and stare at your avatar 100% of the time. For those easily addicted and like to micro-manage each minute: play at your risk.			"

												A good Free to wait instead of being able to skip things the premium tokens allow you to queue building things and research tasks making the microtransactions worth while but not overpowered. Graphicly the game is appealing but not too demanding with a bright mostly realistic style however the audio however can be irritating. The music is mostly monks hymns which I found annoying and I find it hard to belive anyone liked the soundtrack. On top of this a long and loud sound effect plays whenever you hover your mouse over a building however all these audio features can be disabled. The only real problem with this game is not being able to play other games at the same time such as an FPS as the game randomly stops your mouse from moving on whatever other game your playing which seems a shame since I would really enjoy leaving this on in the background to check on every now and then.-topone940			"

Trade goods and weapons to bolster your gold to pay for troops. Build and defend your castle against your enemies.  Seek out resources by going on scouting missions to find supplies for your people.Very good game and recommended for almost any play level and style.drlord_2000			"

												I thought I'd write a review of this game since there seems to be a hell of alot of negative reviews about it, so I I'd try and share my experience of it so far.I started pretty late on, and as such had no idea what was going on. I'd never played any MMO game before as my laptop specs are retro to say the least. The tutorial was quite useful, letting you know the bare minimum to get your village started. The rewards and quests are nice, it breaks up the gameplay. I realise this was a recent addition, so I'm not sure if I'd stuck with it without the game giving regular feedback to tell me I was doing something right.I'm also puzzled at how people are giving negative reviews to a game that they spent two THOUSAND hours on. Some people spend less time with girl/boyfriends in their lifetime. I'm amazed at how it can take two thousand hours to find out you don't like a game.To some extent the online the experience will be affected by more experienced players. For instance, when I started, the players were really helpful to new players, communicating lots of tips to level up, and advice about castle/village layout and build order. It's not a game for lone wolves, which may deter new players, and you have to play regularly to get to the attacking/defending stage. And although you do have an advantage if you pay to buy cards, it's not a single player game, and you can always ask a higher ranked player for help and advice. At worst, they won't message you back, but most active players seem to welcome newcomers to the game.I'll continue to play as long as other people do.meu02136, currently in USA2			"

												It's a great game, but you have to know that it takes time to be at the top. Buildings are built over hours rather than seconds, and you gain ranks over days and weeks rather than hours. The thing that this game lacks most is a dedicated chat window in the lower left corner. Without a chat window, alliances bond less and have more trouble communicating in game. With a chat window, this game would be everything my medievalist geek self could wish for. Byrtfirth			"

												This is definitely a game where the lone wolf dies and the pack survives.  You need to join together with other players using the faction and clan system.  It takes a lot of effort to build up your castles and villages to rival the best in your chosen Kingdom.   You can play without ever being attack by another player for many months if you mind your own business.   When war does inevitably arrive, you could lose everything, this adds a massive risk element to the game and really makes you defend your castles.  This is when you need your friends and allies you have acquired through the well developed chat and mail system that the game provides.Of course, when you have developed your castles and villages you can become an aggressive war maker.  You can wipe out villages and castles that may have taken weeks to develop in a matter of minutes.  The game heavily favours the defender over the attacker, but nothing is ever totally safe.     Even the strongest individual player can easily be destroyed by a combined effort from a faction or clan.If you do manage to rise to be a Sheriff, Governor or King you must remember  âSic transit gloria mundiâ.  Many other players want to rise to your position.Cripper2			"

												Stronghold or SHK as us addicts refer to it, is truly the most addictive game I have ever played in my life. I love the team work and politics of it all, and strategy involved when working with a faction and house. If you aren't in to massive multiplayer teamwork there are still ways to enjoy the game. We call them farmers, but there is a casual way to play SHK on your own. It can be a fun community to be apart of.Unfortunately there are some cheaters in there with alternate accounts, and there will be some people that just throw tons of money at the game to be successful. Its hard to compete with them one on one, but thats why its important to represent yourself well and become apart of a strong teamDer Barn-Jude			"

												Good game to have open in the background while you do other things/play other games - but be prepared to wait for buildings to be build, research tasks to be completed, and goods to be produced, especially as the game goes on (can be many hours). But the people are mostly friendly, and I find myself opening this game everytime I turn on my laptop. However, more experienced players can be a bit annoying as they have faster units and can monopolise on public resources, and progress can slow down the longer you play due to the wait times, unless you're willing to spend real money on cards and extra crowns to help you along.

Shortly after my diagnosis Stronghold Kingdoms was released and I have been playing every day since and somehow I have been cured of my diabetes. I am 100% sure this game has magical healing properties and I would highly recommend this game if you have cancer, aids, ebola or even a bad cold. It is also a really fun game if you are not even sick at all!Magnificrab			"

												One of the most addicting strategy games to ever grace the steam market. Engage in combat with other players and form alliances to make yourself and your friends stronger. Trade goods and weapons to bolster your gold to pay for troops. Build and defend your castle against your enemies.  Seek out resources by going on scouting missions to find supplies for your people.Very good game and recommended for almost any play level and style.drlord_2000			"

												A good Free to wait instead of being able to skip things the premium tokens allow you to queue building things and research tasks making the microtransactions worth while but not overpowered. Graphicly the game is appealing but not too demanding with a bright mostly realistic style however the audio however can be irritating. The music is mostly monks hymns which I found annoying and I find it hard to belive anyone liked the soundtrack. On top of this a long and loud sound effect plays whenever you hover your mouse over a building however all these audio features can be disabled. The only real problem with this game is not being able to play other games at the same time such as an FPS as the game randomly stops your mouse from moving on whatever other game your playing which seems a shame since I would really enjoy leaving this on in the background to check on every now and then.-topone940			"

												I do recommend this game because of how in depth and captivating the gameplay can become. Start from nothing and quickly gather resources, build your village, build a castle to protect your village, climb the ranks,  and research new techonolgy to strengthen your empire. Join a guild to help out other players just starting, defend eachother from enemy attacks, attack the enemy head on and so much more. The number of possible tactics and strategies are endless. I personally enjoy foraging everything in site by researching scouts, their speed, and their carriyng capacity to maximize their effectiveness. It's a middle ages game taken to new heights. Oh, and one last thing... IT'S FREE TO PLAY!!!Come join the fun and build your kingdom accross a variety of maps and worlds, THE FUN STARTS NOW!Enjoy your game!roboman54			"

It is relatively simple which is always a plus. You can choose to farm or fight or even both. You can learn to play people against each other being the rogue in the background. You can be the muscle for higher or strategic defender.Xylun			"

I don;t mind pay a monthly sub to get more que's for building and reasearch points I do not see that as pay 2 win tbh. But having people buying tons of cards just because their paycheck is higher then yours seems a bit unfair for game, in the real world it'd be ok. But in a game like this where your trying to escape reality it isn't much fun once you figure out that even in a game REAL MONEY RULES and not in game money.			"

Not exactly how I would have designed the game... overall i give it thumbs down now because i feel suckered out of my money for a game i thought was free.			"

												My favorite of all the MMOs I've tried. Consistently deep and fun, without ever feeling routine, bland, or mechanical. I don't know whether it's a pay-to-win game, as some claim, but it's certainly free to have a whole heap of fun. At its heart, though, the game is still an MMO and suffers from the relentless need to continuously push ahead â a few consecutive busy days in real life can be hard to overcome in the game world, a situation which doesn't match my lifestyle very well, I'm afraid. But if you enjoy MMOs, I highly recommend Stronghold Kingdoms. Shoot, you might even be able to talk me into getting back into it.			"

												I've been playing this game for over a year now and it is by far one of the best MMO War Games that I have played. With the monthly updates and near 100% uptime you never have to worry about this game crashing or bugging out. I love the card system and the ability to increase pretty much every aspect of the game with cards. From increasing the speed of your scouts and troops to the ammount of food you make in a day everything can be made better. Also One of the biggest selling points about this game that got me into it was the customizable Castles that you create 100% yourself. Other games dont allow you to do this which is what makes me like this game even more. Also seeing the scouts/merchants/armies/monks going across the map is pretty awesome. Being able to see just who is getting attacked and by how many armies is just awesome. Nothing better than seeing 10+ armies flying across the map to 1 village. Honestly, what got me to play this game in the first place was the fact that they had a USA map and that I could have a village in the actual state/county that I live in. No other game has their map based on Real Life locations that I am aware of which makes Stronghold Kingdom that much better. I strongly recommend this game for anyone who likes realtime war games.

												For a start, Iâm sure this is the first time Iâve had to make a download, with the majority of the genre being browser based for easy access by less savvy players (and the Facebook crowd, of course). Itâs also one of the first thatâs been so specific, American players wonât know how cool it is to be able to pick where you live from a map and find yourself building a village within a couple of miles of your actual home. Itâs a small thing, and it has no bearing on the game itself, but still it instantly invests you in your own stronghold because it almost feels like youâre playing a role in local history. From the calming music to the nice graphics and constant movement on screen, sometimes itâs enough to make you completely forget youâre playing an MMO Real Time Strategy game at all.Founding an EmpireI really canât stress enough how cool it is to be able to set up a village in your local area. The first screen youâll come across, depending on what server you choose, is a map of the UK and the option to choose where to found your new village. Split into counties, there are more than enough places to choose from and, upon selecting a county youâre finally taken to your village â a place that (if youâve chosen somewhere local) you might even recognise. All in all this process takes a few minutes and is far less involved than creating a character, although a lack of customizability is a little bit off-putting. Even my very least favourite MMORTS games have allowed you to pick your very own advisor (usually from a choice of beautiful busty babe or constipated knight, but the choice is there) and it seems odd not to be able to choose.

												I get pay to play, but this game either requires your constant attention or premium membership. Now this I could get past. What I COULDN'T get past was the fact I was minding my own business in a parish where they let the bandits and wolves get super out of hand, where I was the only new player. Then after struggling with the 900 gold a day tax rate and the popularity issue from said wolves and bandits, some guy way across the map raids my village and takes it. All because the other guy in the parish with 9 cities. TLDR; This game hates new people unless they pay a bunch of money. "

												This game is not free to play. It is free trial / demo. If you want to play the game at its fullest and be competitve with other human players you have to PAY REAL COLD HARD CASH and lots of it. It is a con to get people hooked and then hope they spend money. This game would be good and probably make more money if it was not a free to demo microtransaction con job. A version of this game with balance and a better market system and faster build times would be one of the better multiplayer strategy games online today. As is it sucks. Firefly has had great ideas but poor execution going back to the originals and it continues today. I want to play it but firefly will not let me. I want to give firefly money for a normal balanced version of the game but that does not exist. Other reviews I read seem to contain similar frustration with this title.			"

												I have lost as many hours as I have Kingdoms.Beware of card players in your area they will have rocket flying scouts soaking up all the resources in the area!If you want a game you need to mircomanage often then you are a Scouting type player.. spend all your inital tech points to push up Scouts .. speed, numbers, capacity. .. MAX the scouts out ASAP. If you want a game you check up every day or so.. spend tech on production.no matter which way you play I promise you will loose it all... with that said.you're either a victim and hate the game and every asshat around you ..or you're a fighter and have taken what you have managed to learn and start to rebuild.upon death you only loose your village, Tech is untouched. dont cry about 1 village you come to a point in the game where you have many 10+ and you delete entire villages by choice just to relocate for war or trade purposes. Im sure I am the cause of many players angry demise because they where there and I needed it. sorry..not sorry. "

												Spent way to much time on this on. Learned a ton about politics and war. I'm grateful for my time here, but that was years ago. Looking over the forums I find old friends and enemies have mostly left. The game is a shell of what it used to be and it's glory days have passed. If you are looking for something to do, give it a shot, but you must join a newer world. Old worlds are burnt through. Really age 1-2 are the only ones worth playing.			"

												To those who have given negative feed-back due to the ""pay to win"" aspect of this game....I empathise.  However, I never spent one penny on this game and was able to overcome that ""handicap"".  It is a strtegy game, it is a team game and it's a political game wether you like it or not.  If you're incompetent in those areas, you will fail regardless of how much you spend.  The game has the same limitations for all players.  I urge people to play, but NEVER spend money on it!  It's not exactly a fast paced game, so having patience will keep you from being burned to the ground instantly. It's free...so play it for free...just dont expect to conqour the world by your lonesome.			"

												This game will destroy your entire life. I studied every night for the perfect ATAR however i didn't realize the game had a mind of its own. Slowly my world revolves around how much gold i made. My ATAR became some number that was of no importance to me. Eventually i was conquered and after spending hundreds of dollars i gave up. Now here we are and i work as a custodian with an ATAR of 24. I COULD HAVE BEEN A BANKER!!!			"

												A religious system that allows you to protect your villages from attacks by other players and AI. A political system that allows you to hold seats of goverment and command larger sized armies of those seats of power. A research tree that will take close to 2 years to complete all make up the depth this game has to offerWhen you maxed characters and run all the content that other MMO's offer in the first year, you will find that time in Stronghold Kingdoms is just scratching the surface. The server you play may be coming close to its conclusion of the 1st AGE after 1 year of play and rewarding the players who won that age but the game is far from over.There are 7 ages to the server and you carry everything you have attained into the following ages (gold, research , villages , faith points , honor). A server will on average take between 5 to 7 years to complete with great rewards in the end for those who played it throughWith the 100's of ways to play , you will be left wanting to do it all over again with what you learned. Most surprising is the number of women who play the game and I have known 3 who held the highest seats of power in the game, House Marshal. Leading 100's of players to age victoriesMy only complaint is the graphics are dated, but proof if you have a product with years of playability and a community where you meet players from all over the world forming life long friendships the player base will stay and grow.I look forward to the mobile release of this game			"

												Many say this game is full of trolls and pay 2 win.... Well it kind of is. Some complain that weeks and months of progress was wiped out while they slept..... Yeah it happens. It is said that Stronghold Kingdoms has the most ruthless, paranoid player base of any game ever..... True, but you do meet the odd pretty chilled Lord or Lady.What the haters fail to mention is that the game is simply beautiful. Easy to learn with a good tutorial but near limitless little tricks and strategies to master.I have played much of this game and never once while playing with thousands of other players have I experienced any kind of bug.Pay 2 win is in someways a fair comment because there is the potential for someone to spend lots and lots of money to do virtually anything. The game is actually very good free 2 play, and spending cash is much less important than it seems when you understand the game more.This is a perpetual kingdom mmo. It is a game to play for the long haul. There are many decent online guides but I would say that none of them emphasise the importance of maximum defensive technology research as a priority. Grow fast. Do not grow faster than your castles. This is a great game to play with friends, and even if a solo gamer you will need to be somewhat social especially when new to the game. I have laughed harder at this game than any other, I have near cried on login, I have raged like a wounded bull at some percieved outrage. Part of me died playing this game.... The part that cares about villages.I highly recommend this game but it is not for the faint hearted or the impatient. This in my honest opinion is a filthy little game and one of the greatest games on computer or otherwise that humans have ever played.I give this game 7/8 Influential Monks. "

												I understand from some of the comments that it seems like a pay to play game but it's really not, even if you do pay when starting out it doesn't give you that much of a advantage than those who don't. This is really a game that takes time so you only have to deal with it for 15-20 mins a day			"

												My Stronghold Kingdoms username is: L0neRanger. Stronghold Kingdoms is a game made to last, jam-packed with content and endless entertainment. Its a real time waster, but well spent. What i look for in my games is something special about it, which stands out from the rest, this game meets that criteria. With my game hour count reaching 1,400 + and 3-4 worlds i play daily. Though, what makes this game great is the fact that its free, well partly...Free to purchase, incredible, i couldnt believe this was available for free. Though as i ventured deeper into stronghold gameplay, i realised the benefit dominance of cards and premium tokens. Of course not free this time. Players which throw cash away like water was flowing through a drain, guaranteed success, dominance in fighting - which gives non-cards (like moi) a hard time. I suggest you do a switcheroo, charge a price for the initial game, because its worth it. Then scrap payment of cards and prem tokens, or reduce it by a lot. This is the only real problem for me in this game.Everything else, top notch. I can think of minor improvements and additional add ons you can implement. But this realy doesnt effect my respect and appreciation for this masterpiece of entertainment. 10/10 .			"

												I have lost as many hours as I have Kingdoms.Beware of card players in your area they will have rocket flying scouts soaking up all the resources in the area!If you want a game you need to mircomanage often then you are a Scouting type player.. spend all your inital tech points to push up Scouts .. speed, numbers, capacity. .. MAX the scouts out ASAP. If you want a game you check up every day or so.. spend tech on production.no matter which way you play I promise you will loose it all... with that said.you're either a victim and hate the game and every asshat around you ..or you're a fighter and have taken what you have managed to learn and start to rebuild.upon death you only loose your village, Tech is untouched. dont cry about 1 village you come to a point in the game where you have many 10+ and you delete entire villages by choice just to relocate for war or trade purposes. Im sure I am the cause of many players angry demise because they where there and I needed it. sorry..not sorry. "

												I really like this game, it's fun and you can spend hours on it (Yes, I've spent more hours than what it says - I've downloaded it from the browser.)I'd rate the game 7/10, recommended if you have much spare time.Pros:You get to meet really nice people to talk with and chat.You can dominate a whole country, if you're good enough.You can spend hours with the game.Cons: When you get to building stuff, it takes longer time the more you build. I'm up to 1h 31m right now for just one building to be finished.You really can't control the happines that well, if you screw it up bigtime, you're most likely to be â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.			"

												Spent way to much time on this on. Learned a ton about politics and war. I'm grateful for my time here, but that was years ago. Looking over the forums I find old friends and enemies have mostly left. The game is a shell of what it used to be and it's glory days have passed. If you are looking for something to do, give it a shot, but you must join a newer world. Old worlds are burnt through. Really age 1-2 are the only ones worth playing.			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a fun game but at times suffers form a slow pace. at the moment the world i play on(world 7) is in peace times so its log on a few times a day set things to build check on my towns to make sure they are fine then log off. the plus points do the game would be how simple it is im a codeing student in college and this is a game you can easly run in the backgound while you are waiting on things to complie without it boging down your computer the commity in the game for the most part is nice i was helped out in my world form allmost the start and invited into a faction. on the other hand game seems to be anti solo i have seen players on my world wiped out simply for not haveing the protection of being in a faction. i would say if you are looking for a game you can play for hours on end this game is not for you once you reach rank 15+ in the game the pace slows down alot unless you are in war times but if you are looking for a nice backgound game that you can mulittask with this game des the trick really nice.(for the steam review giveaway my username is loadkill)			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms puts strategy and cunning to the test. You need a balance of strategy and diplomacy to excel to greater heights in this game. While some may be content to just sit back and be farmers, there are others who wish to seek their glory as knights. I enjoy being able to build my villages and castles as I see fit and the anticipation of if they will still be there the next time I log on. Having played all of the stand-alone versions, I found it interesting how this game was adapted for MMO. While I think it's interesting what changes occur in every new age, I still have yet to see (after 4+ years) a world that uses NO cards and truly sets player against player. Overall, I have found this game ""frustratingly entertaining"" and will stick around a bit longer to see what happens next.  Jesterking			"

												Hi.  My name is Amber_Rose, and I am a SHK addict.  (Say ""Hi Amber_Rose!"")  I've been playing for almost four years.  I do sometimes get irritated with the game, and it often seems like a full-time job, but I've never seriously considered leaving it.  Yes, it has flaws.  Yes, it requires a lot of dedication.  But it has aspects that draw you back to it.  It's highly complex and can take years to master.  It has quirks that you learn to work around.  But it also has a great group of dedicated players from all over the world, and the opportunity to get to know people in a remarkably personal way.  I've read a lot of complaints here about it being 'pay to play'.  But many of the best players I know spend very little (if anything) to play.  It's not a game for people who buy an Xbox game and expect to master it in a week.  It rewards you for sticking with it.  I've experienced great success in the game, and I've experienced monumental failures.  I've made serious enemies who have threatened to find me in real life, and I've made lifelong friends.  I've seen people disappear from the game for years only to suddenly return.  Every day brings  something new.  In some ways it's changed my life.  And my knowledge of the geography of Europe has improved tremendously!So if you're looking for some amusement on a boring day, don't consider this game.  But if you're someone who has the time and inclination to immerse themselves in a virtual world with like-minded people, by all means try it.			"

												I read the reviews before playing this game and have played 'free-to-play' games, before.  I just got done sinking 6 months of intensive time into this game; and then left it like so many others. Turns out that player turnaround is high - is it any wonder why? Firefly certainly doesn't seem to care as long as buckets of money are pouring in.In a nutshell, it is a very addictive game and it 'can' be fun - but veteran players can be very 'clickie'. Also, many people end up in a fat cloud of disappointment for a few different reasons despite their best efforts.For example: If you manage to be lucky enough to start fresh in a new world that has just opened (I got to participate in 2 of them; I found the already-established worlds to be - well, established); don't expect to be anything other than a farmer or a merchant unless you are a heavy 'carder' - someone who sinks lots of money into cards for the game.No, you don't need to sink a bunch of money into the game, yourself - but other players who are on power trips and apparently have nothing better to do with hundreds of dollars; can really put a kink into your game experience. Unless you are kissing their butts, of course. And in that case, you are often just a tool for them to use.And don't expect to be able to come into the game with new perspectives and ideas... You will promptly be put in your place real fast.Also, don't even bother trying out the PvE 'wolf world' until they get it out of Beta. They make you pay for that game and it is so out of balance, it is ridiculous - although the game moves faster and is the most fun world to play, in my opinion (if/when they get it reasonably playable -I may return to check it out if they ever do).For instance, in the PvE world; AI castles can move in and immediately land as a large castle with several hundred soldiers that can immediately be used against you. Wheras, YOU can only have an army of 500 - and only 400 of those can be on your castle at a time to defend it. Add multiple captain attacks coming at your villa at once, and you DEFINITELY need cards. You CANNOT play in the wolf world without them - and even then, don't expect to get very far very fast. Even with lots of help from other players.If you don't have a lot of money to sink into this game, but you have some... Do buy the 2 sets of crowns that they want you to buy to progress for about $5 each. That will bump you up to getting 14 cards a week to use or turn in for other cards that you need. You can stop there and not spend any more - you will also win extra cards & prizes, at times. Also, foraging will bring you lots of wheel spins in the PvE world if you really want to try that one out using as little money as possible.Do I recommend Stronghold Kingdoms? Only if you are a hardcore gamer who likes to be on a ts (teamspeak) team.			"

												it's a build your castle, and fight to defend in present time vs real players game. Always something I've ever wanted, doesn't require money, and it has continuous game play that never ends (to my knowledge). You never have to worry about a server ended and all your villages going *poof.* The hard work and time spent pays off, and you have possible boosts that require money, but they are well worth it. It deals a great number of benefits, that seem to be worth your money.  Overall its a great game and worth the time, but you don't need to have that much time either. 9/10only thing i would change is to have a easier way to distribute, sell resources, build troops etc. from one screen. After you get so far into the game and have multiple villages it would help a lot!!! :)			"

												Hi.  My name is Amber_Rose, and I am a SHK addict.  (Say ""Hi Amber_Rose!"")  I've been playing for almost four years.  I do sometimes get irritated with the game, and it often seems like a full-time job, but I've never seriously considered leaving it.  Yes, it has flaws.  Yes, it requires a lot of dedication.  But it has aspects that draw you back to it.  It's highly complex and can take years to master.  It has quirks that you learn to work around.  But it also has a great group of dedicated players from all over the world, and the opportunity to get to know people in a remarkably personal way.  I've read a lot of complaints here about it being 'pay to play'.  But many of the best players I know spend very little (if anything) to play.  It's not a game for people who buy an Xbox game and expect to master it in a week.  It rewards you for sticking with it.  I've experienced great success in the game, and I've experienced monumental failures.  I've made serious enemies who have threatened to find me in real life, and I've made lifelong friends.  I've seen people disappear from the game for years only to suddenly return.  Every day brings  something new.  In some ways it's changed my life.  And my knowledge of the geography of Europe has improved tremendously!So if you're looking for some amusement on a boring day, don't consider this game.  But if you're someone who has the time and inclination to immerse themselves in a virtual world with like-minded people, by all means try it.			"

Looking over the forums I find old friends and enemies have mostly left. The game is a shell of what it used to be and it's glory days have passed. If you are looking for something to do, give it a shot, but you must join a newer world. Old worlds are burnt through. Really age 1-2 are the only ones worth playing.			"

												Pretty good game for work or somewhere else that does not require a lot of attention. Basically you start with a town and build up your empire, fighting wolves and bandits, and claiming more land for your kingdom. Each action takes a set amount of real time so queue up your actions and just let it run in the background. Not bad if you are looking to kill time, but don't expect it to fill a void in your open gaming schedule.			"

												Personally, I disagree with everyone who says that you will be better if you pay for crowns and premium tokens. True, auto scouting and trading is very useful, but let's be honest, you can gain that gold with trading in half an hour, if you know how of course. I had only one premium and it was when I started playing, didn't even knew what I was doing at first place, but as the time passed, the game became very interesting. Farmville more complicated? lol, you don't know how to play SHK then ;)I got better because I was actually playing it, completing quests and communicating with other players in the world.And yes, this is actually multiplayer game and yes, you can actually be attacked by other players. What do you know, it's multiplayer game, real time strategy game, it's not like in single player game, you save it and continue from there. This game has a very complexed mechanics to understand, so if you are not willing to think a bit what to do, then play candy crush saga. Cards - those are helpful and I got those from completing quests, not buying them. And I don't use them at all, I just stockpile them just in case if needed.Highly recommended to play.			"

												sadly this game has gone downhill recently. I played this game before the steam version in beta and i did not play long when it went to steam. It used to be that if you wanted to be steward or king or anything in between, you could with good politics, strong allies and a solid strategy. If not then you could just fight NPCs and nobody would care as long as you werent randomly attacking people for no reason. Now, if you want any of that (especially the second option), you have to just get lucky. This game has also become extremely pay to win, and most of the time you will spend hours building up and some random kid will take your castle from you because he has hundreds of allies and 14 other castles so he knows you cant touch him. Its sad. Over all i say if this game looks interesting, try it, its free. if you get lucky and dont get into an area thats a bunch of douches then you will get lots of enjoyment from this game			"

												Great, game with massive potential but a serious flawed play to win system makes it almost unplayable,  most people leave the game quickly after realising how horribly broken it is. The churn of players must be truly massive. The game is run by no more than 5 players on each world. They spend tonnes of money in some cases thousands of dollars but ruin it for everyone one else.Players leave, the world get stale and they create a new world.Pay to win is  how the company makes their money but with no upper limit its an arms race most don't bother with and they drop out.  This is sad as the game has  great mechanics but these are broken by the pay  to win system making it the only game mechanic that matters.I believe this is a vulnerable business model for several reasons.1) More and more  pay to win games are coming out firefly are now  competing in a crowded market place. 2) The mobile market is taking more of this type of games market.3) The game hasn't  evolved at all since it's inception ( no insignificant features like paladin castles  don't count) players will  get bored and leave.4) Including the  significant ""big spenders"" not good having  a  significant chunk of your revenue at the whim of a few people. They loose interest  then what?I believe an alternate option could make the game more profitable, decrease churn and  be more fun.I suggest a limit to the amount of cards a player can play in a day.I am sure if you looked at the average churn rate, the average spend of those players before they where burnt, compare it with the average spend of your currentlow tier, mid tier and hight tier spenders you could work out a card limit that doesn't break the game and is more profitable then what you have got now.Do some projection on how long you have to keep players in the game  and/or reduction in churn rate you need  to recoup any loss from the difference between the max spend and the big spenders.The math wouldn't be that hard,This still gives the advantage to purchasing cards but does not break the game.The limit will make card  selection a tactic, what cards to use when.   Heavy spenders would still spend money to get either the ""good"" cards  or trade in for better cards. But they would have to choose when to use them.This would be an advantage but not as big as now getting to Prince  in 5 days, or instant spam armies, capture village build full castle, rinse repeat.They would not be able to bully the entire server which forces everyone to leave, and loss of income for firefly.It would be a safer more sustainable business model, it would also most likely accumulate over time. To have many people paying a little is better than a few paying a lot.Players not willing to even get involved in the Pay to win war would probably spend if they new that they had a chance of  competing and if this bullying was gone.This change would bring many players back to the game,I suggest you trial it as a world, just like the wolf world.It would be a great marketing event to  bring back old players.I mean seriously there would be approximately 2000 active players looking at the world figures.You boast 4 Million players signed up,  that means you have a  retention rate of about  0.05%  or about 1 in 2000.For a free game that's actually pretty damn good and actually quite addictive.This should tell you something is horribly wrong.

												Going against the tide somewhat here...but I do recommend SK as a playing experience if you enjoy builder games (like AoE) although everything the non-recommenders have said about pay-to-win and getting destroyed eventually is true.  And the latter happens even if you join a facttion/House.  But the gameplay and camraderie if you hook up are worth it and I actually reached Crown Prince without ever having spent any money.  But I have also been completely ransacked twice by other players for imagined infractions -- but the same vindictiveness and worse can be found on WoW or ESO.   Worth a try.			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms is a very unique MMO as it has the village building aspect like you would find in games like Banished, but with a fun twist with military and warfare.Chose to fight for domination for your house on many different servers ( Worlds ) or play peacefully and build up your villages.If you chose to make powerful allies or devious enemies, there will always be plenty of action in this game no matter what world you chose to play on.Along with building up your villages you get the opportunity to run for sheriffship of your county, being the Governor of your province, or even King of the country! So there is always lots of competition ingame.My stronghold username is samboi.			"

												Imagine, if you will, sitting and staring at a wall for a month and a half straight. It is a pretty wall, full of green gradients, little red circles with arrows on them, a bunch of names from places in England, and a few too many stone towers.All in some fruitless attempt to reach a #1 spot on a list of people throwing their life savings into this wall, all to get some fancy cards that make a bunch of imaginary wood appear in an imaginary stockpile.For some reason though, I couldn't leave. I kept returning every week, repairing city walls broken from AI sieges and drowning the happiness of a few thousand imaginary citizens under a wall of alcohol and maypoles.This is a month and a half of my life I will never get back. Do yourself a favor, and don't start. It will consume your life. The only solace that I have left is that I didn't spend any money across the two year vortex that was Stronghold Kingdoms, and I now know the southwest tip of England kind of looks like a boot.			"

												9/10Stronghold Kingdoms is an excellent game, especially for a free-to-play. The game gives you control of your own vilage right from the start. The technics of the game are perfect for the era of time that the game is set in. Building castles out of cheap but easy-to-build wood or expensive but sturdy stone is only one of the concepts of Stronghold Kingdoms that you have control of. More intricate and complex characteristics include setting tax rates within your village(which has both positive and negative effects that must be taken into consideration), training armies to annihilate your opponents, and joining a Faction within a House. Overall, Stronghold Kingdoms is a great MMO that you definitely want to check out. I'd recommend it to a friend, personally.			"

												This game is a brilliant game to sit down and play after a long day at work or school. You really feel like you are a Medival Lord ruling over your personal empire and helping your fellow players along the way. The game has a brilliant community feel to it, and it would be great to play with your friends. You could work together, help eachother and fight together. Here is a small summary of a few of the main game features:Your Village: When you spawn into the game for the first time you aquire your first village, this can be customized to your liking. Your villages can be captured and taken over by other players and you can add you your village total by capturing other villages.Your Castle: When you spawn into the game you have no castle, and you must build yourself one using stone or wood. This is your defence and without a good castle you will not be succesful.Trading: You can trade with Parishes, Counties, Provinces and Countries for gold. You can also trade with other players and give them some assistance.Attacking: When attacking you can Vandalise, Pillage, Ransack, Raze and Capture. When sending a attack on a player, you will lose some honour, however when attacking a AI castle (Wolf Lairs, Bandits Camp and Castles) you gain honour for each opponent you kill.Scouting: When scouting you can scout resources from the map and scout other players villages to learn there defences.Monking: Monks can be used to change the game and are probably your houses strongest and most effective weapon. They can be used to protect your villages, monk players into Parishes and much more.Research: Research is the most important part of the game. You may research new technologies or improve other ones by using the Research Points you gain by ranking up. Ranking Up: In the Stronghold Kingdoms game you can rank up along your fellow players. The 'expeirence' is called honour and it is used to rankup. The ranks go from 1 - 22 (Village Idiot - Prince). Each rank has multiple 'subranks' which must be completed to reach the next level.I strongly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys Medival MMO Games.  See you there,Gregory of Ireland			"

												A basic yet complex resource management and building game with a splash of the inevitable plotting and schemes that goes on with PvP (Player vs. Player). Time becomes the commodity here, as everything you do starts a clock counting down to its completion. Which basically means there isnt a whole lot to do in between the start and finish of something. The strategy involved in the game-play is quite deep and rewarding. Requires alot of time to get going, recommended for the patient, tactical and micromanaging aficionado.Rpg.			"

												You only get one bad day on here and it will be your last, the attitude is high on here with all the high levels, alone and grouping together, simple because you had one bad day and said one bad thing that day.I can not act all nice all the time, so I am a target. I even got other people wiped they say. I am not sure and I dont care all that much. They didnt care about me in anyway that I know of.They need to seperate the America's/English and the Europe/Russian in there own servers to make the game a great game experience. I am not dead, I am not wiped. I am smarter than that, I am on Vacation mode. Why? I need time so I can get Faith Points. The rest fell fast as they ran scared, but I was calm. War is going to come, but on my terms, when I am ready.I am fortunate, I did my research just right, all in the name of productive villages, then total defense. Now I need Faith Points to have any type of chance. Why the others failed.I may not succeed here, but I got game. I will keep everyone posted.			"

												I have played about 300 hrs of this game, It is not a lot, But it is enough to write a fair review.. Yes, It can be a bit slow at times and nothing can happen in a week. but then it can also be fast and everything can happen overnight!.   It is a game of patiance and long term goals.  I have played without spending money, managed to get up to 4 villages and felt adaquate. I wanted to see what spending some money would do to my game play. It helped a bit but It wasn't a Massive advantage. I however wish the building queue would not be premium only. I actually like that feature. I logged on 5-10 times a day whether I paid or not. What really makes this game great is joining a faction/house who are active and protect you and can make sure you are well taken care off... House 8 In world 7 is like that for me. It is teamwork and most are constantly on and it is the exact experiance I was looking for in this game, and in all my multi-player games!!!!!Dusten01			"

												If you are looking for a game where you discover, conquer, and fight against and with your bretheren, this is the game for you.Stronghold Kingdoms is all about building a mighty kingdom, fighting foes on your way and quest to be one of the top players, maybe in the whole world.Stronghold kingdoms MMORTS game, wich stands for; (Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game).Except growing and discover, the game is based on 7 eternal builds, architection, economical, military, mercantile, industrial and political build, if you are interested in such, this is the game for you.But watch out the game is not that easy that you may think, AI's and other players will try to attack you, and either raze you or capturing your village, you may find it hard to find against first, but you will learn in time how to play the dices.This game is for me meant to be played with friends, as it will be easier to help out eachother and grow along side with them.I rate this game 10/10, Firefly made a really good game, and we'll hope they will make it even better.I downloaded the game thru their personal website, and that's why i don't have many hours on the game thru steam, but still i have played it for almost 1 year and still in love with it.My name ingame is 9157file, have fun!

												`Faith must trample under foot all reason, sense, and understanding`. 7/10So, how much faith you got there left , Sire?! ...SK2 is  a medieval village management game and castle builder with  military and politics aspects, that are governed by religion. This is a very ""patient oriented"" MMO strategy game that brings a good impression of the medieval times (except the USA maps which are out of place a bit). It is a game that you will love and hate in the same time. The game has a lot of potential which is not yet exploited to the max, leaving it with flaws that some will consider to much to give it a thumbs up.In order to achieve a level of satisfaction in this game, you need to play it for a while, learn its ropes, and when a new world opens, begin your real journey. This game is not a single player crush em rampage style game, you need friends along and to become a better team you need to organize yourselves to communicate better and react faster. Along the way you will meet all kinds of players - liars, cheaters, traitors but also players who will help you at their own expense, teach you how to play, watch over your villages to protect them, enthusiastic newbies, grim veterans etc. From each one you can learn something and along the way you can try build up your team the best way possible. Then lead this group of players to victory using diplomacy and military skills. However, off the record, this game is not about getting there - being the last one standing, its more about the journey and the people you meet along. Friends and enemies alike, contribute to the heart and soul of SK2 and their desire to `colour` the map is the main fuel which this game runs on.PROS:- SK2 is the worldâs first slow paced castle building MMO, with the sounds and some of the gameplay giving you a unique medieval feel;- Nice overall community with interesting people from all the parts of the world;- A large European map with actual country borders and lots of player nationality driven intrigues that keep the game interesting;- You get a lot of satisfaction when your team manages to achieve something by working together;- If you are a builder type of person you will have alot of fun  trying to figure out the best castle design or the best building placement in villages;- This game really makes you think strategy. Its almost like a diplomacy simulator, you work with real people and you need to adress their needs in order to gain their trust. You can build a team of hundreds of players under the same flag.CONS:- Time demanding. You always need to check with the game during the day or risk loosing all your work in a few hours. So this game follows you in real life, you find yourself often doing something while wondering what is going on with your villages;- Players learned how to bend rules to advantage and as such there are players with multi accounts who make it very difficult for straight players to prosper;- The game interface is annoying at times.(Example: A player applies for your faction but you cannot click his name to see details about him, rather you have to close the window, open up another, then remember his name to search him... ). At times, to keep up, you will need a notebook to make addnotations.- Pay to win, sort of. BUT... the amount of money you put in this game its totally up to you. Sure you get some short term advantages,  but in the long run its the team effort that shapes the map. Being successful in this game demands time and teamplay coordonation more than real money imo.CONCLUSIONS This game has  good parts, it also has some bad parts...but it deserves a chance if you are into medieval stuff and prefer politics and management over real time strategy. My recommendation: this game is free to play, installs quickly, so give it a try and see for  yourself  if you like it or not!Sori			"

The game isn't hard to learn or understand. The comunity is alos great. One minor dislike about the game is the time you have to wait to build/construct, learn or getring resources.			"

												After one day of exciting gaming, it becomes tedious and at the end of the second day, there are so few things to do at this very very slowzzz..., that I have decided to leave the game. My âpremium try outâ ran out. Thatâs when I found out what a big advantage paying players has when they are asleep/at work/school; Auto trading, Auto scouting for important goods, Auto attacking, Auto recruiting and Vacation mode up to 15 days where no one can attack you. Mind you all disadvantages for free-players. Besides the premium, one can buy cards. To get cards one has to buy crowns. Crowns comes in packages from 3,56 euros to 114,99 euros and gives various big advantages in the gameplay. Besides these disadvantages as a free player, one can only work on one quest at a time, some take hours and even days. For instance as a new player, your scouts horse is so slow that you think it is dead, which makes it impossible to get to any of the hidden stashes before other players with speedy horses gets them. Another thing; In some EU countries it is illegal to get people use the feature âsend email to a friendâ to obtain certain goods. In my first two days I have encountered 2 highly important quests like that. I am really disappointed about this form of illegal activity in a free Steam game! But of course, both times I have sent mail to fictive persons! Now I just need to delete my account, for I am sure that is easy and possible (again according to law).I would like to buy a similar game, but when bought, one canât pay to win. Does a game like that exist?			"

Be sure to befriend those around you and help them as they help you. When war rolls around you'll be glad to have allies supporting you as much as they will enjoy you supporting them.			"

												I've played this game for a year now and still love it as much as ever. It's the type of game that allows you to learn as you go along, faction members help so much with information, strategy, materials etc and also give a great sense of team spirit. It's lovely to be able to chat with others in your faction and the game is easily left off and picked up at anytime. The quests and achievements give you something to work towards and the rewards are really helpful for completing them. I also find it great for multi-tasking, I can play and watch films at the same time. It's a very relaxing game (as long as no-one is trying to raze you :P)Mamakinz			"

												Can I exuse the faults this game has? Absolutely. The charm of the medieval stronghold legacy is present everywhere. The prospect of more maintains the sense of enjoyment. The joy of taking a completely unique route from your neighbours in your starting parish is exhilarating. One could build themselves a strong castle and defensive force, while another could focus on a trading monopoly. One builds churches and appoints monks for great honour, and another is keen to scout and raid bandit camps. The threats are always near. High taxes travel down the chain from top to bottom, causing discomfort amongst citizens. A rogue castle is built, and armies sent to assault towns. Yet kinder forces can watch the backs of younger players and ensure their success. All the while, powers greater in houses and factions are feuding for shires, counties, and the crowns of the kingdoms.The game of thrones even the most humbled of village idiots can eventually play a part in.Henry Scheldt			"

												For a free to play game this is probably one of the more strangely addicting I have played. Expecting something I would try for a few days and move on rapidly became one of my more played games on Steam. While the leveling system does get drawn out towards the middle of the line I still manage to get atleast one level up a day. How ever the research system is probably the least well liked in my opinion, with each leveling up giving you 3 points (or researches) per, and the gold cost of buying a extra one escalating with each purchase leaves one trying to sort out priorities more often then not. For the few minor issues I have with this game. Its still rather enjoyable and the premium tokens are a life saver to keep your scouts going even while your offline as well as trading with parish capitals and other players.I'd recommend this as one of the better F2P games.Kingdoms User Name: Nalthren			"

												I have played this game for a long time through other vendors then Steam.While this game itself can be boring at times, and is very orientated on micromanagment, you can play as a F2P player, it just takes a lot more work to be able to compete.The main reason I have stuck with the game for so long, is not the game itself, but the group of people I play with, and the freinds I have made within the game, that is what keep me play Stronghold.If you can get with a good group in this game, it really can be very fun.

												At first I saw much potential in Stronghold Kingdoms. I was really looking forward to playing something that was different from Travian. And at first I was right, I had a good time the first 3 months, I made lots of friends, even in enemy Houses, but then everything started to look so similar to Travian in so many ways that it was scary... One would think that the House 16, that controlled the most parts of the gaming world I play on would do so with grace, respect and act through honor and truth. Now I know the REAL truth, they are the worst bullies I've ever encountered and I've seen my share of bulliyng... from the recieving end. They act through deceit, lies and their sheer force of power both politically and military to get whatever they want, whenever they want. Sure... they'll be your friend, only to stab you in the back in the end.And I say this with all good intentions:For the love of god, DO NOT JOIN HOUSE 16! You are so much better than them and you deserve better! And should you want to play this game... PLAY IT RIGHT! STAND YOUR GROUND! BE THE GOOD GUY/GIRL! AND ABOVE ALL ELSE: DO NOT FALL FOR THE TEMPATIONS OF EVIL! "

												Calling this game pay to win is complete bullS**t sure paying gets you alot of cards that can do a lot for you with certain aspects of the game Farming goods, making quick cash, army travel speed ect ect... but in reality victory is only achieved by a strong group of loyal and highly organised players. Loyalty is a must for victory because the politics in this game is as ruthless as in the real world players will literally f**k you in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥to get ahead :)) so if your thinking of trying this game for the first time bring some friends who are loyal and join a newly opened world, most people are heplful ingame and will assit you in learning the basics. ( Also join the pve world Wolf server to gain a s**t load of card points to even the playing field with the big money players).Stronghold kingdoms is very addictive once you get the hang of things and very rewarding destroying enemy players i would highly recommend playing this game. 10/10			"

Im not even sure what to do or what was taking place which is a reason I was skeptic about reviewing this in the first place. If you do understand whats going on then it might be some fun but for pretty much everyone else this made no sense. Just a bunch of random icons that appear to do nothing but open up more windows on the game that makes less sense.			"

												Having played this game for over two years I've had my ups and downs, the game revolves around Glory Points - the more land you own the more Glory you collect, and those who obtain the most get several rewards such as Card Packs, Premium Tokens and Wheel Spins for being part of the winning House. Teamwork is key for success and leadership can make or break a House!There are no set objectives in the game, meaning all wars and peace negotiations must be created by the players. Villages and research are also varied aswell, there is no one clear way to success. In the end it will take a combination of different factors to find yourself in the Hall of Heroes. To help with research, building your village and ranking up you can purchase Crowns in-game. These can be used to spend on Tokens or Cards to que research and buildings, or to give production boosts.Overall a very good game as you can see amount of hours I have. I have played several Worlds where each one offers a new approach to Alliances and Wars, it is often a good idea to play alongside players from previous worlds as it will help alot.Best Regards,PsychoticUK			"

												After playing this game for just over a year, and somehow managing to clock up around 1500 hours game time total across both the Steam and Standalone clients, I think it's safe to say I have an addiction to this game. I would like to say the whole game is unique, but it's really not. It's a generic place a building in your city and wait X amount of hours for it to build, and you can pay to use some sort of bonus to speed it up, theres 1000 other games like that, so why is this one so good? For me, it's the sense of freedom. Firefly has set us up with the base game, and left everything else to the player. The politics, how the world progresses, the choice of how you want to play, is all down to the players. Each player can join a faction of allies, and that faction can join a House, a group of factions that vow to work together, these Houses can then become allies with other houses, or wage war in an attempt to gain more land, or to defend the land they already own. The only real problem with this game is how easily it is to think ""I'll buy some crowns, it's only Â£10"" and then another Â£10... and another.. and before you know it, you've spent far more than you intended. But Firefly has to make money some way :)IGN: Sir Hurp McDurp			"

												Despite the fact that it's a slow game, it's good for times you have nothing else to do. You just build/sell/rebuild/buy/recruit what you need and get out. The world itself won't stand still while you're gone. Things can and will happen to you and you need to fix things asap, otherwise you can get in a lot of trouble. It's fun to see things change and to adapt to them ingame.FullIce			"

												Have invested thousands of hours into this game off steam. Never once did pay and I understand why people would say it's pay to win. But realistically it isn't if your willing to work, and work as a group. Played over several servers and on most of them I was almost always with the same faction. For almost 5 years I managed to stay in a faction which was top across 3 servers and at one point had so much people applying for it that we needed 5 subfactions and started our own house. The game is fun and easy to get into if you put the effort in. I was keeping up with people who spent money simply because I had better stratagies than them. It's more than pay2win, it's about working with others to make all of you prosper and expand. Heck, at one point I was even the leader of 2 counties and a province because people had the confidence in me that I could work hard. What most who play seem to not understand is the underlying fact that above all else this game is about politics. Keep up with your groups/houses TeamSpeak, when you start a new server it doesn't hurt to send a quick message to the people around you saying Hi. I've learnt over the 5 years I played this that it's much better to have an ally than an enemy. 99% of the poeple who I ever encountered on the game were pleasant nice people. I mean, even the houses we were at war with we could have a good laugh with.However, I honestly do miss this game but I quiit long ago. It was far too addictive and I would find myself on it for hours each day. Eventually you will get bored of it (took me 5 years :D ), but you will have a brilliant time for the most of it and you'll honestly meet some cool people from it.			"

												Its a nice game.But,The game still has bugs. Like some time i can't log in to the game witch is telling me that steam need to be on online mode to play. The thing is i can't be more online than this. I can play everyother game except this one for no reason and i need to delete the game and reinstal it each time and this is annoying.Other than that its a pretty nice game reflecting the medieval world in all perspective. Yes there is a Pay to win aspect but people that got time for this game won't need it to rule all lands. Its more of a bonus than actual gear like in some game that would make you immortal. Ex.: You can put card down to make you army move faster for 12 hour, or you can play card that make a precise building free of time and ressource but nothing that is permenant.I will give a modest review of 7/10 because this game isn't made for everyone. I wouldn't recommend it to child since there is a politic aspect.			"

												Great game, didnt play a better MMORTS yet. Its usually hard for new players because they join ""old"" worlds (game realms) where they start from scratch and usually get obliterated fast. Best way to start in this game is wait for a new world to open. Fast forge strong alliances with neighbouring players and battle your way forward to glory or be crushed to the dust. P2W is unbalanced in the game but you can do just fine with premium that is 4Euro/Month. Without atleast premium the game is unplayable. Then its up to you if you want or dont want to spend another cash on cards and I must admit that the cards are HUGE advantage. Pros-MMORTS-Research trees (lots of possibilities)-Stronghold franchise-If you survive to rank 15 then the real fun starts-Awesome game model, fighting for the countries-Really complex game that you can spend thousands of hours and not get boredCons-Slow learning curve-Extremely punishing for mistakes you make or conflicts you create-Unbalanced P2W-Lack of new content			"

												In this review I will go over why I do not like the game, but also like the game at the same time and also when I would recommend this to someone else and when I wouldn't recommend it to them. As you can see by the amount of hours I have on the game I have played this game quite a bit and have additional hours on the standalone Stronghold Kingdoms Client that doesn't use Steam.I will not go over the whole concept of the game, but it's set in the medieval ages and and it is an RTS-MMO that is very slow and is meant to be played over a very long period of time including months, even years. You join with others to conquer the lands to achieve victory and get your name in the Hall of Heroes where it can be seen forever. Now onto the review.Free To PlayYes this game is quite a good F2P game as everything is unlocked for you and you can do anything that someone else that pays for the game can do. Granted that the premium token members do get a few extra features, but the features just enhance the game and are not needed. All players do get free cards every so often depending on how much they have completed the checklist for free cards, with a maximum of 14 free cards per week. Cards are just ""power-ups"", if you will, that you can put into effect anytime you want and give you a bonus of some sort whether it be increased attack speed, x3 production on farming, woodcutting etc.Now here is where the F2P aspect goes to Pay-to-win. Those cards that you get each week, you can just buy them and get way more cards than you'll ever get from the 14 cards per week. I also forgot to mention that you have to click to collect the cards you get free and the time for the next card doesn't stack up so you will only end up getting 10 cards a week unless you're on the game everytime you can collect your card. So in 1 month you will have about 40 cards or so on average from the free cards, well if someone pays $20 on the game then buys 30 random card packs then he just got 150 cards + the 40 from the month so he's already way ahead of the player that doesn't pay. I've seen players on the game spend way more than $20 too, some people spend hundreds of dollars on the game every month and if you're competing against them then good luck because experience says the carders will be the ones that win.PlayersOn here, if you join a big active house, you will meet a lot of people from many different countries and it's probably one of the coolest experiences you will have in terms of communicating with large groups of people. Compared to other MMO's, I find that this game exposes you more to being able to talk to new people since you will be in a giant team of people and will be spending lots of time with them. Communication is also a large part of successful houses, so a lot of times they want players to get on TeamSpeak or Ventrillo and voice chat with players, coordinate attacks, or listen to a house meeting. Yes some people on the game are rude, but most of the people you meet are very nice.Time ConsumptionI have never played a game that is this time consuming before, and in this game if you don't spend a whole lot of time with it, you will be surpassed and defeated quickly. On average I would spend 8 hours a day on this game and I would still find myself getting outranked quickly by the carders that probably spend more time on the game than I do since they've invested money in it. If you wish to be in an active house in this game and go to war a lot, then be prepared to spend at least 8-10 hours a day on the game or else you'll be losing villages very quick.Let it also be known that a lot of times you'll have waiting periods of where you're waiting on something to build or waiting to get peasants for troops. In those times, I just minimize the game and come back to it and this will apply a lot in the beginning when you're starting out.Houses (Kingdoms)A house on this game is essentially a kingdom which they all compete with each other to conquer the lands and win the glory race. There are 20 houses so almost everyone playing can join one. In the beginning of a server each house usually has their portion of land and its really cool to not know whose going to be attacking who. Unfortunately, near the end of the server people will all join 1 multi-house alliance and destroy anyone that opposes them making the server a farming server. This can be seen on many of the servers, you'll log on and see a map that is 1 color and has all the big players in 1 house together. Not all servers are like this, but it is a problem that I have seen before.RecommendationI would recommend this game to anyone that sees the good in the review above. If you have some extra cash to spend and are willing to devote a good portion of time each day to the game, I say go for it. If you join the right house, then that is just icing on the cake.I would NOT recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have a lot of time to play and doesn't want to spend money on the game. Not spending money means you'll probably be way behind the pack and will be seen as an easy target to enemy houses, especially if you don't get on a lot.My review above does mainly reflect the people that join houses, if you are a neutral and just want to farm then some of the above won't apply to you although many houses see neutrals as fair game so it possibly may even be more stressful to be neutral.

Posted: September 10, 2014
												What keeps these MMO games alive and prosperous are the players, it is not supposed to be a single player, and it would be quite dull if it was.Now players are kept in the game mainly through the social aspect of it, yes the nice features get you to try it but it is social aspect that keeps you going on..I've played several worlds, and out of them all Europe world is the biggest and most diverse battlefield. In it you see people clash because of glory, because of land gain, because of vanity, because of the diverse human nature..The players themselves have sort of hierarchy, from the casuals and farmers to the ones who spend massive amounts of time and money on the game. Now while it is appealing to have the long wars and big wars, for quite a lot of crowns is spend in them, it is the small players who give up for they cannot compete. and without them the hierarchy crumbles, when only the strongest remain, we pool ourselves into a single house and we ""win"", but we actually lost that joy of battle, and the one thing that kept this whole game fun.. the conflict..If someone buys a charter in your territory, pops politics card and swaps everything, and when you try to fight him back he has fully built castle, well you must understand how this makes a little man give up. And even tho the carder will fill your pockets, he will kill the average players in the process, and without them world will become a barren wasteland, one man per parish, all in one house. It will die off.What I recommend is: give the average and dedicated players a fighting chance against the big ones.Some ideas:1) Decay of goods in the parish- As prices inevitably go down in the parishes as the goods are being sold, it becomes harder and harder for an average guy to earn enough to compete in the wars, with let's say 10%  or 5% decay of goods in parishes weekly you'd see prices going back up. And since it is percentage based, it will make these evening better. Example: If there is only 5k apples in the parish, 5% decay means 250 will be gone. and would effectively bump up price by a half a gold or a gold 143 to 144 let's say. BUT if there is 150k apples, 5% decay will make 7500 apples gone and bump the price by a bigger margin, 73 to 82 let's say.. So the more goods there are the more it will be effected by decay, hence increase income, hence prolong the wars and give average guys fighting chance and would keep them in the game.2) Repeatable quest / Quest Chains- Quests get progressively harder, as they should, but it means there are no rewards for dedication and time spend if you just cannot complete those, especially in the times of war. If there are let's say, repeatable quests on daily or weekly basis, that would earn some rewards, ranging from small ones to big ones, we'd see more activity overall.Example: - Repel the wolves - kill 200 wolves (or 10 wolf lairs) => reward 2,000 gold or 300 faith- Repel the invader: Rat - Kill 5 rat castles => reward 10k gold or a random card pack or 500 faith- Repel the invader: Wolf - Kill 5 Wolf castles => reward 30k gold and 2k faith or a wheel spinAlso chain quests, for instance, if you construct the quests, 7 of them for instance, and put them in the separate tab, only ONE can be picked DAILY, and if you complete all 7 you get some reward or a bonus. Those quests could be:Destroying AI castles, Trade quests, Production quests, Monk based quests, Donations, Supplying quests, etc.. 7 of them. Player can pick one per day, and after 7 days they reset, regardless if he managed to complete all 7. But if he does complete all 7, you grant them a wheel spin, let's say.This would make players log into stronghold daily and give them something in return for the time put in.3) Make room for strategy, increase unit diversityAt the time being, as you well know, only solder units used in game are archers and pikes, swordsmen are not competitive any more, other then as moat digging crews but even  then you'd want pikes and battle cry, and it will be more efficient. Swordsmen just die to fast in the attack to make any difference, and they are rarely used in defense as you'd prefer pikes to hold off the enemy while automated defenses and archers fend the enemy off. I say change things around a bit.example: - give pikes bigger health pool, give them higher resistance against melee attacks, oil pots and spike traps. make them less resistant against the arrows.- give swordsmen lower health pool, give them less resistance against oil pots or spike traps, make them more resistant against arrows (they do have a big shield after all, in addition to suit of armor, that pikes don't have)Due to the targeting priority of ranged attacks Sally > Archers > Captains > Swordsmen > PikesArchers will go after swordsmen first, and even tho pikes would be more vulnerable against ranged attacks, you can still achieve good results if you apply strategy => send a mixture of swords and pikes, and while swordsmen ""absorb"" the enemy ranged attacks, pikes can eat oil pits and spike traps, etc..^This is just an idea, needs more work on itAdd new unit in defense!I've longed to see Crossbowmen added to the game. Make them similar to archers, lower range, higher damage, make people create their own strategies with them. Archers have range of 27 paces from the biggest tower (would be nice if we can get it confirmed), so make Crossbowmen have 18 - 22, and give them bit more of a punch, compared to archers. God knows defending castle is rather tricky, unless you card massively. Increase passive and well planned defenses' resilience against the attacks, crossbowmen, strategy designs, add rolling logs or allow pitch to be placed outside of the white line and to be set ablaze to burn the foes. Limit the number of squares you can put pitch on so players cannot cover all of it in pitch, but must use it strategically.. etc..Meanwhile, limit the amount of defensive cards you can play per let's say castle. You can only ever have 5 effects turned on, or 3 effects. So people get to choose the best card that suits their castle design, for instance:- Big oil pot / moat castles => people will pick oil pot card, moat card and last stand- Big massive stone castles => people will pick stronger stone structures, call to arms, ballista fire rate card^Still an idea that needs thinking about, could work on it, but this is raw idea.Make a difference between carded and strategic defense less distant. At this moment you get: Carded defense => can't touch thisNon carded defense => I got slapped so hard by 2 or 3 timed attacks that guy next to me in a parish lost two towers :)During wars if you're not awake to card defense, you need to sleep by the hour, and it is exhausting. That is why people give up on the game... Let well built castle with strategic defenses be conquerable but costly to take, let people go to beds without worry of what might happen if they oversleep. I don't mind losing a village, but I wanna know it was worth it if it was built well.------------------------------------These are just some of the ideas. Given time, and proper testing we could come up with more.If you liked any, well I am there to discuss or help, will include both in-game name at the end and email address------------------------------------What you liked about the game?I love the game, and I love it brings people closer to have fun, and I love it has so much room to evolve and to grow. I love that you brought on the Europe server, one of the greatest battlefields in SHK world, I love that it is fueled by glory, land grab, nationalistic pride, and bonds forged and broken and reforged again..What I disliked about the game?Oh, there is a lot.. but it can all change.My info: damjanjelic@hotmal.comIn-game name: The Dire Wolf "

												OK, first off, if you are looking for a game that offers real time strategy on a massive level where you face off with literally thousand of players (I am talking real people now), this is a game worth checking out. It's one thing to play a Real Time Strategy where you face off against multiple AI and/or with a few players, it is another thing entirely where you soley interact with people from all walks of life (remember, I am talking thousands of people) in a scope of a game that is the size of full countries and even continents. There is more to this game then constructing apple farms and land grabbing, a single poor decision can result in all of your villages being burned down by an entire House (a coalition of united factions) containing dozens if not hundreds of players, or just one lone player who did not care for you gold raiding his parish. The potential events are endless. Stronghold Kingdoms is a game where Diplomacy and warfare go hand in hand to a level that the most shrewd and cunning strategist can be undone by a unsuspecting foe. One single misstep could mean the difference between being a King of a whole Country commanding armies of fellow players in a war campaign, or finding your self surrounded by enemies by waking up one morning to learn all your villages have been pillaged, ransacked, and razed (all of which are game features by the way). As for who could be responsible for this? A old foe you scorn long ago, a recent rival who seeks to usurp the power base you have amassed, or possibly a well trusted ally who has stabbed you in the back. In truth this game needs a Game of Thrones expansion of sorts, it is THAT indepth with it's warfare campaigns and politcal intrigue. As mentioned, the potential events you can experince are endless and impossible to express properly in a game review.Now in terms of actual gameplay, it might not have the most top of the line graphics or all-star game engine at this time, but that is not the intended appeal for the game. The Gem this game offers is the scope and the depth expressed previously. With that stated, you basically have five modes of play that you will likely at some point or another partake in while playing Stronghold Kingdoms, these modes are ""Research"", ""Village Contruction and Managment"", ""Castle Construction and Management"", ""Player vs. Environment"" (things such as AI lairs that are run by a computer), and ""Player Vs. Player"". These main features have their own sub features but for someone totally new to this game who would be reading a Steam review, you don't need to concern yourself with sub groups at this time... besides there are already plenty of guides written covering such. In the end, these features while on the surface might appear fairly basic, can offer you literally hundreds upon hundreds of hours of enjoymeant with them alone. Not too bad of a deal with a game you only pay into at your hearts desire.....And with that mentioned, time to address the big fat pink elephant in the room with dollar sign tattooed all over it. Stronghold Kingdoms is very much a free to play game which does not prevent you from achieving anything in the game a ""subscriber"" or ""premium token owner"" can do aside from a few things such as moving village buildings around and having a simplistic trading feature telling you which goods sell for top gold in location ""A"" while said good sells for rock bottom price in location ""B"". Aside from that, a Free to Play player can do and achieve that of anyone. Period. HOWEVER! There is a ""Pay to Win feature"" now before you stop reading, pause, breath, and read a bit more to understand how the title is true but the definition is inaccurate. Stronghold Kingdoms is a game that is designed and true in everyway I have mentioned thus far, however there is one aspect I have not yet been able to touch on until this point. It's a game that is designed to have you keep returning to it in order to maintain not only your villages and castles, but the game it self. This is a game 110% designed around it having a strong and active population of players, without people playing it, there is nothing to do in it aside from picking apples and hunting helpless wolves in their lairs, who just want you to stop growing apples and spend more time breeding pigs! (not to much to ask, is it?). But seriously, it needs a active population, to help ensure this it has a gradual constructing-build-progression-system. Basic way to explain this is ""construct 1 village building takes 5 seconds to complete, the second takes 10 seconds, the 3rd takes 15 seconds...... the 80th a whole freakin' day and a half!"" this sort of system applies to things such as castle buidling and research but they work in seperate ways but to the same point. There are research option you have to increase castle build speed, village build speed, and research completion speed, again the three operate differently but the point of them is the same. Here is where the ""Pay to Win"" feature comes in, or as I like to call it ""Pay to speed this #$%^ up already!"" ... better known as ""Cards"". Cards come in a variety of things but the majority of them focus on speeding the processes of the game up dramatically so you can achieve your goals faster and move onto other goals. To describe a few, cards which instantly give you things such as resources (so you do not need to wait to produce or steal them.. oh yea, have I mentioned you can steal peoples stuff? Mmm, dat pillage.), army speed cards so rather waiting 5 hours to reach a target on the other side of the map you are there in say a hour and a half (provided you have the army speed research done), village and castle construction speed, etc. In a effect it is a time saver but the advantage of ""carding"" to speed the process of the game up can give one a distinct advantage over others who don't, thus the ""Pay To Win"" common phrase but it is simply ""Pay To Complete This $^&@ Today Junior!"" Only a few cards make a player have a distince advantage over another in terms of combat / warfare and those are cards such as X2 to wall strength, handy to have but not god mode by any level. A half skilled player who is persistent enough, does his planning properly, and has some patients can beat a heavy ""carded"" castle.If you are right now asking yourself ""Is it possible to obtain cards without paying into the game or at least where I always need to do it?"" The short answer to that question is... Yes! The game has over the years installed systems to give all players cards for free or for a short time investment. One common method is the ""collect Your Free Cards"" method, which is a option you see while looking at the campaign map on the near top left of your screen. Follow the steps listed to gain more free cards per week, maxing at 14 per week. Other systems are invite-a-friend, where you get crowns for a portion of anything your friends pay into the game if you invited them, treassure castles which gives wheel spins that have a chance of landing on card packs in a varity of quanities along with alot of other goodies, and quest rewards which either give wheel spins or just card packs out right.With all that covered, is it easier to achieve your goals with card packs while playing the game? Yes. Do you need to buy card packs? Not unless you see it worth it. Can you obtain them throughout playing the game without dropping alot of $ consistently? Yes.I would say that about covers my review for Stronghold Kingdoms, I could easily write and cover more about the game.... but while writing this, my House Marshal has finished debriefing me on my assignment to be dispatched with a buddy of mine to move far behind our enemy lines, go full swing viking rampage mode of pillage-ransack-razing the country side to instill fear while the bulk of our House holds the front lines from being over run by filthy Italians. I'll admit it, I am eager to enter Valhalla. Shadow_Ordo			"

												It is a great game! Ive read a lot of other reviews saying how this game is not recommended because it is pay to win. But they have missed a key point, its a free game. The creators need to make money off it some way. Now, i have just under 400 hours on this game and ive spent hardly anything on it. Im currently fighting a war in my houses honour in am having a lot of fun doing it. This game is slow paced making it a non-rage game for all the gamers out there who know what im talking about. There are a lot of friendly people on it that i have met making it one of the better communties out there in my opinion.  Give it a bash! Build your village up and have fun doing it! Hope this tad insight helps, I may have just rambled on! Kouya			"

												Great game, didnt play a better MMORTS yet. Its usually hard for new players because they join ""old"" worlds (game realms) where they start from scratch and usually get obliterated fast. Best way to start in this game is wait for a new world to open. Fast forge strong alliances with neighbouring players and battle your way forward to glory or be crushed to the dust. P2W is unbalanced in the game but you can do just fine with premium that is 4Euro/Month. Without atleast premium the game is unplayable. Then its up to you if you want or dont want to spend another cash on cards and I must admit that the cards are HUGE advantage. Pros-MMORTS-Research trees (lots of possibilities)-Stronghold franchise-If you survive to rank 15 then the real fun starts-Awesome game model, fighting for the countries-Really complex game that you can spend thousands of hours and not get boredCons-Slow learning curve-Extremely punishing for mistakes you make or conflicts you create-Unbalanced P2W-Lack of new content			"

												The game great game to play and is free to play. If you like war strategy games you may want to give this a try. They could make the game more interesting by allowing people to intercept armies on map. Also diplomacy between houses, you should make it so they have to make declaration of war on other houses before they can attack another house. It should be stopped from allowing the same person to run premium token to get around having multiple account bans. While there are undoubtedly people who legitimately use the tokens with family, there are probably just as many running more than 1 account for themselves.			"

First off, I think this game is great. Good aspest to it. Really is what the medieval times would be like if you were a lord or king, and its free-to-play! Free-to-play though is a bit a janky thing to say, while it IS free to play it is also a pay to win game (meaning you can pay a good amount of money to be better than everyone.) You can still play the game without buying any crowns (currency in-game to buy cards which give you bonuses and such) or buying premuim tokens (they let you do more stuff in game.) All you have to do is be very patient, very careful, and very. very conservative in what you do since the building and research times keep going up and the you have to have more and more supplies to build things to. One example of the pay to win is with one of my friends, Adam. Adam decided to buy a TON of cards one day because he thought it was fun. I, on the other hand, did not. After he opened all his card packs he had A LOT of bonuses such as; more troops, more peasants, supply cards, anything you can imagine thats with the game...he had it. Needless to say, he was ahead of me in every aspect of the game yet i was patient and while he wasted his cards and troops i reserved mine and kept the cards i got weekly. Eventually he asked for MY help with him getting supplies and such. So with all that information you should be able to understand that it's not just a pay-to-win game but it's also a game where you can be patient and conservative and still come out on top. If your'e reading this and are new to this game then get a village on world 8 on the Isle of Wight! :D   Btw, My name in the game is Biyt			"

And if you liked other stronghold games, you will most definitely love this one to.the only down side I can think of is  that you cant buy premium with card points (my opinion).RandabanV			"

												In a huge multi player fuedal landscape test your talents for diplomacy in making friends and enemies, constructing armies and castles, and unlocking evolving trees of developement in crafting, farming, military and other facets of Medieval life. Rising from a lowly bumpkin you could achieve princely status or even with the backing of a faction and allied houses become a sherriff or ultimate ruler of a kingdom. Strategy is key in surviving the months and years of real time  entertainment. This is not a game for trigger fingers but decision making and effective interaction with other players. Team work is the key. all that is missing are AI enemies to spawn for the monks to deal with. When will witches and pagans start spawning to give those of ""the cloth"" equal footing with knights taking down enemy keeps?WIGWULF			"

												Stronghold has a particular type of gameplay that is suited to city builders.  However, it has a battle element that supercedes the city building aspect.  No matter what you can build, someone else can destroy it.  Of course, you can be the destroyer too. It's not pay to play, but if you pay enough money, you can certainly get many advantages and be far ahead of anyone who didn't pay in terms of progression.  I wouldn't say pay to win necessarily, but it's close.I enjoy slow-playing this game, content with any losses that i might incur.  In practice, you can set yourself up just to do research and city building and by and large be left alone.  If that's what you want it's possible.  If you want a game that you can waste many hours on, with rapid tactics and counter tactics being the only thing between survival and losing all your cities, you can have that too.  There are a lot of ways to play, for just about every stripe of player.			"

												The best online multiplayer strategy game Ive played which is offered for completely free to play. Not too complex not to simple. Dont have to live at the PC for hours and hours like most other strategy games that involve castle defense. A more relaxed type of a game and I highly recomend. I have played other games like Caesary which was the other BEST game I played. But that was before I found SHK. It had too much stress and commitment to be given for a gamea nd I simply could not afford to waste time like that. Reached the maximum rank I could reach there and stopped playing cuz it was too much work.That is why Stronghold Kingdoms is the best game out there and everyone should try this. Been playing this for now almost two years, reached the max rank and still playing. Because its a relaxed and a fun game to spend time on. ~HIGHLY RECOMENDED for strategy gamers.~LONG live SHK			"

I no longer play the game as I was brutally betrayed by some of the players/factions in the game. I would recommend this game, but just be wary of who you trust.			"

												This game is a very fun and strategic game but takes awhile to build up and learn. If you don't like pay to win, then I would not recommend playing this game unless you can put up with other people being far ahead of you and far more powerful than you just because they bought card packs. The gameplay is pretty casual but has some intense moments where you're just waiting for the outcome of a siege or you are at the break of a faction war. Overall a good game aside from the over-powered cards you can obtain just by spending $50; but hey, its a free-to-play, so they have to earn money somehow. Im not very far into the game but I am looking forward to a long and exciting adventure on USA 2.			"

												Pros: Loads of fun, seing your little empire grows. Very social Game, without friends you're lost in this game. Grand strategy game. Loads of different tactics that you can apply and lead you to victory.Cons: Pay to win! A lot of the players are just scumbags, with no respect for players who just want to build. All they desire is destroy. Multi accounts! Most of the good players have mutli accounts. This is unfair.To sum it up: This is hihgly addictive and fun game. One great Idea that is poorly implemented. There are lots of aspects that just MUST change. Castles are unrealistic, they should make them be close to real ones. Pay-to-win advantage must be reduced. They should add more diplomacy relations levels. Now there are War, Ally, Neutral. Perhaps they should learn from all the Grand Strategy games out there and add Trade Agreement, Embargo, White Peace, Non-Aggerssion Pact, Alliance, Neutrality. They should perhaps add a change in the state according to alliances. May be even Glory Points rewards or penatlies respectively for supporting or denying support to an ally. Embargo state: If you're in war with someone you cannot trade in their lands, or if you're neutral you cannot trade, only with Trade agreement should you be able to trade with their parishes.Two big issues of this game: MONKS and ATTACKS:    - One MUST be able to perform Army-vs-Army Battles, hence be able to cross the path of a capture/raze attack before it reaches the castle. This will open the game to even bigger battles and more interesting strategies.    - Monks MUST, and I say MUST be eliminated from the game.			"

												Semi okay game.Purely mouse controlled witch will make your mouse finger / arm numb from time to time.The biggest turndown is the GM / staff, on EU1 server that are all german, and the germans playing are being vastly favored above others, and when you get into a war with German players, they will get you banned thru their GM contacts, this ruin the gameplay for many and make the game wery one sided, either you are german and win, or you are from anywhere else and then you lose.Corruption at its finest!Do not play this game! it will take your money, and you feel great, untill some german player deside to attack you, and then its gameover, if you resist him, he will eventually get you banned, and then take all your villages for himself.

												Let me tell you a story, One you wont forget.Once upon a time, their was a person named Nate. Nate was a ordinary person looking for a fun game to play. He then heard of Stronghold Kingdoms, a game that had everything he wanted; Wars, politics, cities and more. At first, Nate hadent trusted this new game and even disliked it. But that soon changed as he saw the real affects of the game. He soon lived in a place called ""World 4"". He met neighbors, friends, and allies. In this strong community, he thrived and blossomed into a huge empire. Prosperity was abundent and war was far from a possibility. But that all changed as a group of people called ""House 13"" moved in and stole land, cities, and wealth from the mighty empire. Wars raged as troops battled troops and cities burned to the ground. But House 13 was too strong, Nate was no match to a overpowed enemy. His empire dwindled until it was no more. However that wasnt the end to Nate. He traveled to a new realm called ""Europe 3"" and is attempting to recreate his once glorious empire. Will he be succsessful?  Maybe. But in the end Nate will never doubt the game Stronghold Kingdoms again.The End.Username: blueluke234			"

												This is an excellent game for those who are strategic, not afraid to spend time on it, and are willing to cooperate with others.Pros:Easy to play and there is a guide available to beginners at the official stronghold wiki for those want to learn more after the tutorial.Factions are like a community who help each other out and 95% of the players will not attack if you show a presence and respond to their emails asking if you are active.Attacking and defending are simple as placing troops and letting them go into action.Making money is not complicated at all nor is gaining honour.Cons:Everything is run on real world time so you have to spend a few months in the game in order to be able to do anything effectively.If you don't get a premium token badly planned villages will hamper growth and reduce efficiency.Castle designs make or break whether you survive an enemy attack from the A.I. or other players.If you don't find a faction to join once you gain power you may become a target from numerous factions as you have no allies to back you up.If you don't research important techs early on you will have a hard time expanding, gaining honour, and making money.If you are willing to spend time and buy a premium token occasionally you can make yourself into a powerhouse and someday lead your own faction,  become a house marshal, or even become king of the world literally. For new players be sure to read the guides that talk about early research that you should  do as it will help you out immensely.			"

												Nice Massive Multiplayer games, but need some balance between new player and old player because when new server are open, the old player always domination games because player use some card which they get from another server or buy. so my advice is disable to use card in new server (actually on 1st age). If player cant use card, game will be balance and fun... no fear-dion97			"

												I dont see what all of the negative review's are for, i got this game a while back (from their website not steam) and ive had nothing but fun from it. I would highly recomend it if you're into the stronghold series or just if your looking for an in depth fun medieval MMO. As to the comments that say its just a pay to win game, i disagree completely, as long as you have the force and diplomatic skill, you can get somewhere.-Lord Haywood			"

												People should stop â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about ""pay to win"" wahahahaahahah. God get a grip. If you are willing to play a game for nearly 2000 hours and still think it sucks coz u need to pay to get some actual fun out of the game, then maybe you should unpucker your areses a little and pay some money towards the devs who you've sapped 1000's of hours worth of server time! God gamers have become entitled asswhipes these days. I reccomend this game becuase it does what it says on the tin. It is a good city/kingdom rts game. Yes you have to put down some cash but if thats what people dislike about the game then take up another hobby where the people who entertain you havent got families to feed. 7/10Decent time waster but can become quite bothersome when certain people you call freinds seige your city when you are asleep. Not  mentioning any names *cough* Brad *cough* Get it if it's your bag, if not, then stop playing for the love of GOD!			"

PRO:+ Under the village tab, you will see your small village grow into a budding and bustling town as you construct buildings, + Politics with other players + The research possibilities+ The player community is very helpful+ Leveling up is a large part of the gameplay, as it unlocks new abilities in research, building, and player abilities. + The game continues while you are logged off. Your buildings continue to construct, your villages continue to produce resources, and if you pay for a game token with real money, you can automate some functions of the game as if you were playing. + Free to play+ MultiplayCONTRA:- The graphics are more functional than fancy- If you don't build your castle well enough and defend it, you lose your village   and start over again, sometimes you also need to pay in order to win. It depends where your location is.CONCLUSION:This grand strategy game will offer hours of fun, intense, rewarding strategy gameplay.			"

												Stronghold Kingdoms does deserve the honour of being the worldâs first castle building MMO and it does -despite its presentation- do it well. The gameâs depth and scope go beyond that of the regular Stronghold games and is guaranteed to keep your mind firmly lodged into medieval times for a long, long time. The game is a hybrid of a traditional tower defense games and a modern RTS. While the graphics might be a bit behind the times, the gameplay is engaging and full of the right amount of challenge. This title does a great job of appealing to both the casual and hardcore gamer market by mixing the elements of economics, politics, and war. I would highly suggest giving this game a try.			"

												Not a bad game but it gets boring after a little while.  One thing I didn't like was that you can't truly start over unless you swap worlds.   While the persitence is nice it makes it hard for new comers to really feel like they can be part of the society.  Lastly, while the worlds seem highly populated the game doesn't appear to be actively played.

												Its a great strategy game, but you need to play daily. Raise a city with hours of work, and watch it fall in a day. Thousands of people playing on one map, constant wars and the possibility of being king what else could you ask for. Just fun time consuming aand if your bored you can always play this. So if you like strategy and play intensie games this is a good one,  though onc4e you set up and get ranked high things slow down and it becomes a game that only requires 1 hour of gameplay daily unless there is war and that is a whole diffrent thing so get it play it for a week if yo don tlike it after that UNINSTALL.

												I've played the game now for a few months and after really reviewing the game I'd have to say it's becoming a real waste of time. I'll give you a few reasons but you should decide for yourself. 1.Building anything can take hours or even days to finish. You'll start out with ""Oh 15 sec to build a house, not bad"" to ""WTF 1 day 19 hours to build a house!"" Which will keep increasing in the amount of time to build anything the more you build. 2. The game is completely Pay to Win! You can buy cards that give you Troops,Builds,Special Perks. (So basically someone could drop $100 on the game and completed distory your well built villages and castles that will take you months to get fully built up.) 3. The Castle building options suck and the area they give you to build is extremely limited. (So is the villiage building) 4. When you attack someone you can lose (Honor) which you use to level up so that game punishes you for attacking players. 5. When you join the game you'll be tax to death by parish leaders building armys which will make your life a living nightmare epically with AI Castles blowing up yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that took days to fix up cause your low level. Ok, Think of this do you want to play a game where it takes months upon months to get anything real and when you reach that awesome point where you can finally do something have someone walk in with there house and stomp all your hard work in the dirt? If so welcome to stronghold kingdoms... a truely boring experience.			"

												Yes it is pay to win game and yes it is addictive. The key is to win boost ur scouts and merchants with the cards.Then u will gain exp and gold.If you don't want to pay to cards don't waste ur time to play this game.It is sad actually.Game mechanics and concept is easy to play and easy to understand. I read comment who played 2000 hours this game and he/she was right about this is a pay to win game.Players are greedy and trying to be Parish , if you don't vote for them , they are trying to attack you or threaten to u.

												I've played the game now for a few months and after really reviewing the game I'd have to say it's becoming a real waste of time. I'll give you a few reasons but you should decide for yourself. 1.Building anything can take hours or even days to finish. You'll start out with ""Oh 15 sec to build a house, not bad"" to ""WTF 1 day 19 hours to build a house!"" Which will keep increasing in the amount of time to build anything the more you build. 2. The game is completely Pay to Win! You can buy cards that give you Troops,Builds,Special Perks. (So basically someone could drop $100 on the game and completed distory your well built villages and castles that will take you months to get fully built up.) 3. The Castle building options suck and the area they give you to build is extremely limited. (So is the villiage building) 4. When you attack someone you can lose (Honor) which you use to level up so that game punishes you for attacking players. 5. When you join the game you'll be tax to death by parish leaders building armys which will make your life a living nightmare epically with AI Castles blowing up yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that took days to fix up cause your low level. Ok, Think of this do you want to play a game where it takes months upon months to get anything real and when you reach that awesome point where you can finally do something have someone walk in with there house and stomp all your hard work in the dirt? If so welcome to stronghold kingdoms... a truely boring experience.			"

												I really enjoyed the game but i would like to see a better tutorial or possibly, to keep it simple for players who have never played the disk version of the game, make it easier to get started. I have played the disk version for many hours and still had trouble getting started on this game. Other than that i really liked the game			"

												Although slow-paced, the game is nice. It does play a little heavily on the microtransactions to help speed things up. Premium is needed just to queue up researches and construction. On the plus side, you do occasionally receive premium bonuses from some quests, and the game's funny-money is quite cheap.The game requires patience and time. It's not easy to just sit there playing it all day. It works well as a casual game. To jump each day for like 15-30 minutes to get the essential stuff done, or maybe alt-tab while you watch a movie or play another game.So here's my synopsis.Pros:-Casual-Free-Interesting (and sometimes fun) concept-Has unique strategic elements-Rewarding if you can get friends inCons:-Maybe too slow-Requires money for a better experience (albeit cheaper than most Freemium games)-No decent spawn selection-Takes a lot of time to even make friends-Community is at war, making it harder for newer players to start out without asking for protection from their Parish leaderAll in all, I'd give it a 7/10.Remember though that this is my opinion, and your own opinion on it will vary from mine. Since it's free and a reasonably small download, give it a try to see how you like or dislike it. Don't knock it till you try it.			"

												Read Me. This game starts out slow reseach is everything.I am a very experianced player who cards very heavly in this game. I have 4 years play time and some of you may know me who currently play this game. My in game name is Boardwalk you can find me on Global 1 for now. I have played many maps over the years and destroyed many enemy and also have been destroyed its a war game.These are the two play styles people have in this game. Farmers and Fighters and you will know what you are if you play the game long enough to find out. You will see a village near you and for some reason you will just want to destroy it. That is how you will know if you are a fighter. As for a farmer they have a smooth way of avoiding confict at every turn with an excuse to stay friendly with everyone. Before you learn how to two shot a casltes most people will stay a farmer as a new player learning the ropes. You will fear to lose a village because you do not know how to take another one. You fear you will upset someone and get destroyed. In this game there is nothing to fear but fear itself as you can always respawn again. Fighters need to be trained or you will never destroy anyone. This game is allot of typing messages and how things read to some players can really alter your future for good or bad. Also big players do not go around destroying low lvl players for nothing and because it costs way to much honour. A prince to raze a knight with 1 villages is about 1 million honour. Costing both the prince and the knight allot.The people who buy cards are yes rather dominant but research is everything in this game meaning your researching tree needs to be full to really start to play the game and there are many tricks to be dominant on the map other then just cards. Acivity level just like any other game is just as important. Catching and shutting down attacks sometimes daily becomes the norm for a active warzone.Now the game offers a rare 50% sale of crowns the ingame currency I gain another 10% because of a card bundle I bought a while back. This means I gain 60% more crowns when I buy them myself I wait for that sale.You will go spend a few bucks to play a priemium token when no sale is going and waist that hard earned money on a game you will never really learn. Then you will be destroyed by a player like me and cry on this forum about how its a pay to win game only. You will never learn why you were destroyed and nightly you will cry out to the heavans about how you suck at most all video games and real life. You will cry out because you are poor in real life and in most games you play as well. That frustration builds up to the max when a red eyed player like me wipes you off the map like a nat. As in any game people cry when they get destroyed and this is where you will see them all coming first to post that bad experiance.What about the glory of the game most will never expericance? Like landing in a new land destroying everyone in it and taking out the old king and making it a place for yourself. A place you rule and everyone else looks to you for leadership. Smashing Russians and watching them burn. Timing in 15 attacks on someones 18th village to see it burn. Stopping 15 timed attacks with that wallet and a smile as you peer at your enemy as if a God of War. Consider these fun times before passing judgement on this game. Also consider playing other games of the same type that are well not as good I have played them all.Now if you want to pay to win and bend the will of everyone around you this is the game for you. If you like to devestate peoples hard work in one night by smashing them with that big wallet this is the game for you.I still enjoy to log into this game years after playing it has grown on me. Once you have mastered the game and are not broke in real life its really fun and still not easy. You poor non paying gamers look out for me if you decided to play I will be near you with a moutain of cards just waiting to wreck that trash castle you thought would hold up well just so I can read that post on here of how its pay to win. Makes my day really.			"

												An excellent strategy game if you don't mind the amount of time put in. Dynamics are good. Exquisit balance between diplomacy, economics, and warfare, which can be rare with these types of games. Not to mention free to play.			"

												It's a great game, but you have to be careful about maintaining your town(s). Your population is consistently growing and when the population grows large and the food can't compensate for the population inflation, people will begin to leave. You also have to be careful about invaders as they can come at any point, and you'll need to always defend your castle.I stopped playing for a while and it was a big mistake; my village was taken over and I had to restart back from the bottom.Luckily, you can keep your rank so you can still show that you've gotten decently far into the game, and that you're a force to be reckoned with.

												Most people dont understand that this game represent a new breed of gaming genre. The game is not an online multiplayer version of Stronghold Kingdoms standalone series.It can be described as ""persistant massive open team based multiplayer online real time strategy game"".""Persistant"" means that it is a game to  play for a very long time. Imagine some pet game where players needs to nurture an online animal, or some online never ending facebook/gadget games, or the famous farmville. Un-like the stand alone version of Stronghold Kingdom that has clear ending, some people play in a world for years.""Team based multiplayer"" means that the game winner is a team, not a person. The team here called faction with upto 40 members, and some 12 faction grouped into a house. There are 20 house in each worlds. This is interresting since some ""unworthy"" players might be included in the winning team. While good players, players who pay alot, and players who spent lots deal of time might stuck in a loosing team. Winning is not decided by how good you play the game, but by how good you build and manage alliances, or sometime, how good your faction leader and house marshal.""Open team"" means that you can change team at any time. This make the game full with backstabbing, political intrique, lies, and deception. It adds a unique political nature to the game that is not exist in any game, ever. People who like a game with lots of communication, politics, strategic relationship, and complex interaction will love being faction/house officers. Everyone could create their own faction and become faction general. Becoming an FG is a real test of your EQ. You might even use the game to enhance your EQ and other real live personal skills.SHK has quite complex resource management. You need to find a good quide to understand how to micromanage your resources. It also has some arcade combat action with limited tactical option. There are many worlds to play in, and you can play in as many worlds as you like. Every several month Firefly starts a new world where you could join the competition again from the start.There are many type of ingame cards that players can use to help them in the game.Its free to play the game, and you will get free cards from time to time. But if you like it you should pay at least 2x $5 to get a constant stream of 2 cards a day. I dont recommend to buy any other ingame / DLC (including the started pack) until you reach rank of Prince and decide that you like the game. Buy the starter pack and other stuff only after you feel comfortable with the game. Pay wont make you win, it only provide some advantage to enjoy the game and to reduce your online time.Players could choose to play for win or just playing for fun. To win you need to join or build a solid faction with 20 - 40 players. It wont be easy. Most people will find themself stuck in a not so effective faction that will be slaughtered by other faction. You can choos to be a neutral farmers who fight to keep your villages, Parish, and friends from greedy faction. You could become monk player who support your faction with monking ability. Or become a warrior who'd love to attack and bully other people. Some other dedicated themself to help others.The game is quite slow in progress. It utilize human nature to love something that you built / managed with plenty of time and efforts, to make people love their villages, return to maintain, and become very angry when others raze or capture it. You wont be so mad when your enemy raze your Starcraft II base that you build in 10 minutes. Try to have people capture your main SK village that you build from a scratch and nurture for months. You'll find a lot of dissapointed people in the forum or spend time to wrote bad recommendation review for this game, because they're so angry for loosing their villages.The nature of the game requires serious player to play alot. One needs regular daily online time. The reason is because SHK requires player to pay for all build/research queu. Otherwise you need to be online twice a day to start research, to build or to get free cards. So the game is not suitable for people who can play only weekly. Many people will find out this after several weeks and abandon their villages.To attract more players, SHK should provide queu for free: to build, research, and to get the regular card. Therefor the weekly players could also enjoy the game.Dont play this game if you:- Dont have daily online time (unless SHK provide free queu).- Dont like a ""persistant massive open team based multiplayer online real time strategy game"".- Dont like complex resource management.You'll enjoy the game if you:- Have spare time to be online daily without ruining your marriage or get fired.- Like to communicate, enjoy politics and strategic interraction with lots of people.- Spend time to understand the game mechanics.

Very large Tech Research tree letting you have many paths you can take to make your kingdom uniqueCons1. PAY TO WIN you have to buy cards that act as instant gains or Massive boosters to your resource gain and constuction.2. Building Qs and Research Qs are only for Premium members basicly its a subsciption without auto continue with your creditcard.3. Random Placment. Theres no way to spawn near or with Guildmates or Freinds who want to play as a solid group.4. Many Glitchs like death counts on your troops bugging out the population counter.5. Instant battles meaning you have no control of your troops like in real strat games. All you do is tell them to attack then they go there and its instantly over, Theres no battle to move troops around or select groups to attack specific area and or targets.

												I played SK for 2 years after release with my friends from another MMO game.  Then I took a break and tried it a little bit last month to see what has happened. I really do like this game. Particularly in factions and houses. I find it fun and authentic to what I envision a strategy game would look and feel like. Grdphic is pretty neat. I like the game concept... but the actual stages of developing one's character in the game are most interesting. I like how the developers are maturing the game with the new ages, with adding more content, taking care of fixing bugs. All these things are good and healthy advancement that I think will help maintain the current player base a lot longer.Stronghold Kingdoms is not just a game, it a way to spend your free time. It's a true saga, which in my case has continued for 5 years now. There's not a day I have spent in SK, which I would call empty because it gives me not just pleasure of playing but also many contacts with other players. At some point I was an addict, and played SK for many hours, sometimes even days, forgetting about real life. So, be careful, people, don't get addicted if you want to feel the true pleasure of dealing with SK.ivansmagic			"

												You are already a big fan of stronghold, and you want to play with thousands of other Stronghold-Fans?And you are good in being patient? :D (I play on ps3, and on my laptop stronghold kingdoms and never waste any time) :DThen you should try this game, and with âTRYâ I mean, really âTRYâ it ;) don't start this game, and spend only 5minutes with it and waste village places, write some people, join a faction or a house, that help you in your first steps, download team speak, talk with real people, and after around 2-5hours, you will see, itÂ´s a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome game!!!I really can say, Stronghold Kingdoms is one of my Favorite games, that thanks to FireFly Studios exist!Every day in this game is different, there are lots of opportunities, that every one, from the small village idiot, to the prince have to choose.In this game, THE PLAYER makes the story!If you want, you can threat your friends, and help the enemy, to become famous in the world on that you play, or you can be an evil tyrant, that raze the villages of his enemies without mercy, but also in the mission of the church it is allowed&#160;you to use monks, to make the medieval lifeÂ´s of the other ones easier, or more painful. And there are much more opportunities, that you have!I started to play this game, since the polish world 1 opened (world 3 would be nice, but please, not only Poland, white Russia, Ukraine, Czech and some other eastern countries would be nice there to) and I can't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stop playing it, after I give this game a chance, to let it affect me, and it was a good idea! *-*I started to play in h20, and I swear, it makes a lot of fun, in the long nights at this game, but with some time, it started in me with the feeling, that i have not enough power, and I start to want more, till I threaten them, and my name was a short time there famous on the path of polish h20 :)but now, I am only a faithful knight and play on europe3 and swiat1.Seriously, I would recommend this game to everyone, who likes medieval times, castle building and other similar games, and pleas. Try it out a bit, don't throw it away after some minutes, and really listen on me, and spend at least an hour :) you will not regret it ;)Conclusion:Fun: 10/10Atmosphere: 10/10Politics: 10/10 (if you have a good house)War: 10/10Community: 7/10 (from world to world different)Farming: 8/10 (better weather system would be awesome)Pay2win? If you pay, things are easier, but there are treasure castles, that help you out on a good way too, and you can farm premium and cards on other worlds ;)Hope I will find some new people there on the battlefields :DGreetings from: TheodinManus			"

												The game is good but try not to get too attached. It takes a long time to establish yourself so that you can earn enough gold so when you get wiped out you have a starting point. The only problem is there will always be the big shots who run all over the place and take what they want without a care in the world, with the deep pockets who can buy their way to the top. Like I said though the game is fun just dont get too attached when you wake up and everything has been taken from you!			"

												For my play style on RTS this is a very very slow paced game.  I am standing with it to see if things change for the better when I catch up to what, ""Should have been done to start"".   Though it is diverse in many aspects, the starting quest line dies off with letting you build one of this and that then. bam just stops.  leaving you with nothing to let you know how to build your army with the extensive tree of knowledge.I of course worked on my scouts first, then found out everything in town is going to take forever to build now.  Thinking gathering would actually net me more resources to get building.  But then i quickly learned that I can't build anything, because I don't know how and it will take forever to get on the track i should have been on to begin with.  So in a nut shell make the most of your starting time mass learning whatever you can that will let you build.  Otherwise all you can do is collect resources and sell them.   Watching your dots collect stuff and hopefully get enough honour to finally rank up to get those needed learning points.   It is a fun game however, some form of warning that buildings are learned would have been a huge help.  My normaly RTS strategy was definately fail to start , but may yet pay off in the end.  no more to say but happy building and great time sink.Being as I am new, I so far with its diversity give it a 7/10. thumpinz			"

												I have been playing for about 7 months.  I admit it I am adicted to the game.  The game play is smooth and as you level up the rewards get better and better.  Having said all of this to me the best part of the game is the friends I have made.  We have a really good time everyday sharing a few laughs.  While we talk about the game strategy a lot, most of the time we are talking about a lot of non game related items and having a lot of laughs.Godkingjohn			"

												SH is a refreshing change to the standard style of games available these days and is very addictive. The constant monitoring by the developers of feedback is also very refreshing as are the continual improvements to the games which is unlike other games where once you have completed them you either have to wait for the next installment to be issued or simply go back and start agin. I have played this game for three years now and more enjoyment has not diminished.A very life like game where players can use normal life skills, hats off to the develoers, well done.Greypower1			"

Building Qs and Research Qs are only for Premium members basicly its a subsciption without auto continue with your creditcard.3. Random Placment. Theres no way to spawn near or with Guildmates or Freinds who want to play as a solid group.4. Many Glitchs like death counts on your troops bugging out the population counter.5. Instant battles meaning you have no control of your troops like in real strat games. All you do is tell them to attack then they go there and its instantly over, Theres no battle to move troops around or select groups to attack specific area and or targets.

												I played SK for 2 years after release with my friends from another MMO game.  Then I took a break and tried it a little bit last month to see what has happened. I really do like this game. Particularly in factions and houses. I find it fun and authentic to what I envision a strategy game would look and feel like. Grdphic is pretty neat. I like the game concept... but the actual stages of developing one's character in the game are most interesting. I like how the developers are maturing the game with the new ages, with adding more content, taking care of fixing bugs. All these things are good and healthy advancement that I think will help maintain the current player base a lot longer.Stronghold Kingdoms is not just a game, it a way to spend your free time. It's a true saga, which in my case has continued for 5 years now. There's not a day I have spent in SK, which I would call empty because it gives me not just pleasure of playing but also many contacts with other players. At some point I was an addict, and played SK for many hours, sometimes even days, forgetting about real life. So, be careful, people, don't get addicted if you want to feel the true pleasure of dealing with SK.ivansmagic			"

												Most of you people saying this game is a P2W its obvious you just got stomped on because your an idiot andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥at the game who was doingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥or sayingâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥to someone. The whole point of the game is to team up and join factions make friends and defend your castle. If you team up with the wrong people that have enemies yeah they will attack you for no reason. Its just the game. If you team up with strong people who know the game right they will keep you stacked with recources keep you safe and stop you from getting taken over. This game is no where near pay to win. Yes it makes you stronger but whats the point if you have got an army and they have cards? No amount of cards could stop a faction from â¥â¥â¥â¥ing someone over. This game is fun i recommend it to people. It may be a slow pace but that just means you play other games while waiting. People who do not like this game are either very impatientâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥heads or annoying â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who died so quickly because of stupid decisions. Learn to play and you wont die so quickly and wont cry like a little girl :D			"

												After reading many reviews concerning my most favorite game, Stronghold Kingdoms, there are some things about the game I'd like to clarify. There are many players that keep trying to toss the game out as a Pay-To-Win game. I hate Pay-To-Win games, and if this was Pay-To-Win, I wouldn't be playing it as much as I do now. With or without real money, people in this game are going to be able to kick yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥when you first start out. The game is rough for somebody playing alone. However, when an already-experienced player brings in their to play with him, the game can be a ton of fun. Strength in numbers of manpower is much greater than the strength of buying cards and premium tokens. Do yourself a favor and don't not play the game just because other reviewers are saying they got wrecked by Pay-To-Wins, you get wrecked and wreck people back, it's a lot of fun if you like screwing other people over. It's what the game is about! Feel free to add me on Steam and join me on my World 3 so I can force-feed honor until you're level 16 with 3 villages on your first day of playing.			"

												You are already a big fan of stronghold, and you want to play with thousands of other Stronghold-Fans?And you are good in being patient? :D (I play on ps3, and on my laptop stronghold kingdoms and never waste any time) :DThen you should try this game, and with âTRYâ I mean, really âTRYâ it ;) don't start this game, and spend only 5minutes with it and waste village places, write some people, join a faction or a house, that help you in your first steps, download team speak, talk with real people, and after around 2-5hours, you will see, itÂ´s a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome game!!!I really can say, Stronghold Kingdoms is one of my Favorite games, that thanks to FireFly Studios exist!Every day in this game is different, there are lots of opportunities, that every one, from the small village idiot, to the prince have to choose.In this game, THE PLAYER makes the story!If you want, you can threat your friends, and help the enemy, to become famous in the world on that you play, or you can be an evil tyrant, that raze the villages of his enemies without mercy, but also in the mission of the church it is allowed&#160;you to use monks, to make the medieval lifeÂ´s of the other ones easier, or more painful. And there are much more opportunities, that you have!I started to play this game, since the polish world 1 opened (world 3 would be nice, but please, not only Poland, white Russia, Ukraine, Czech and some other eastern countries would be nice there to) and I can't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stop playing it, after I give this game a chance, to let it affect me, and it was a good idea! *-*I started to play in h20, and I swear, it makes a lot of fun, in the long nights at this game, but with some time, it started in me with the feeling, that i have not enough power, and I start to want more, till I threaten them, and my name was a short time there famous on the path of polish h20 :)but now, I am only a faithful knight and play on europe3 and swiat1.Seriously, I would recommend this game to everyone, who likes medieval times, castle building and other similar games, and pleas. Try it out a bit, don't throw it away after some minutes, and really listen on me, and spend at least an hour :) you will not regret it ;)Conclusion:Fun: 10/10Atmosphere: 10/10Politics: 10/10 (if you have a good house)War: 10/10Community: 7/10 (from world to world different)Farming: 8/10 (better weather system would be awesome)Pay2win? If you pay, things are easier, but there are treasure castles, that help you out on a good way too, and you can farm premium and cards on other worlds ;)Hope I will find some new people there on the battlefields :DGreetings from: TheodinManus			"

												The game is good but try not to get too attached. It takes a long time to establish yourself so that you can earn enough gold so when you get wiped out you have a starting point. The only problem is there will always be the big shots who run all over the place and take what they want without a care in the world, with the deep pockets who can buy their way to the top. Like I said though the game is fun just dont get too attached when you wake up and everything has been taken from you!			"

												Ya this is a very additive game *IF* you join a faction in a dominte house, get on TEAMSPEAK and are very active.When they introdused the USA1 map. (the first USA map) I played through the first Age. The game took over 300 days but in the end i was part of the highest scoring faction in the highest scoring house in the game, I count that as winning the game.THIS GAME ACTUALY HAS REAL LIFE POLITICES and it's Awesome but also a nightmare! So if you are not diplimatic you will have a harder time playing and posably screw over your team mates. Just remember that your reputaion matters, so play hounrable. Also heads up, at the end of the age it gets very very political and lets just say ...interesting. For example, our main enemy for 200+ days was sudenly our house mates and to make things worse the rivalry didn't actualy end.I would suggest this game to anyone that likes team games that take a lot of encramental actions and alot of time and desipline, but are extremely rewarding. If your dedicated you will go far. My team of corse made it to the Stronghold Kingdoms Hall of Heroes. You don't win by yourself in this game. Cheak it out on the main site under the faction name CY HAWKS in the USA1 Age 1 list, Killwize is there. I really wish they would have published the scores on there also so I could prove to you our teams awesomeness but I guess you'll just have to take my word for it.			"

												Stronghold kingdoms is a difficult game to explain at the outset, so I'll just go over the basics without going past a few paragraphs. It's a good game, though it requires a lot of patience, for reasons you can read below if you want. In sum, it's for a patient, deliberate type of gamer, and is certainly a rewarding experience. Onto the real meat:You'll see pretty much every negative review on this game say it's ""pay to win"", which shows that they took one look at the game, saw that they had to pay, and then quit. It's essentially a subscription-based model, where you pay for premium either by the week or the month, which makes progressing through the game much faster than if you were a free player. It rounds out to about $8 a month, plus some spare change left over to buy card packs. At the cost of a Netflix subscription (or a large case of soda), it's worth the money to spend just for the benefits that you get as a premium member. The only way for money to become a serious problem is if you're spending thousands of dollars on the game to progress at ludicrously fast speeds, at which point the player is a bigger problem that the game can handle.So now onto the review. The game is a medieval, strategy-based, simulation MMO where you build a kingdom, interact with other kingdoms, and do your best to balance the two without going overboard. It doesn't sum up the tense and thoughtful experience that you get with the game, nor will most of the promotional materials. It's a game about tactics, waiting, thinking, and looking into the future to see what you best actions will be a day or two from now. It's an accurate simulation of the politics and world-building of the middle ages all bottled up into a deliberately paced experience, one that's definitely worth trying out just to feel the experience.Naturally, time is an important factor in this game. To get anything done, you need to produce raw materials with your buildings. This includes resources, weapons, and gold - all of which you have to wait a while to get in large amounts. By ""a while"", it's more like hours until you have the opportunity to expand on a larger scale - waiting for your village to populate, your buildings to produce, and your merchants to trade with others. Much like an idle game, it's best to wait a long time between play sessions to get the most out of your game. Otherwise you'll be checking it all the time, obsessed over when you have the opportunity to start developing. Unlike an idle game, it's not just a matter of upgrading the most expensive thing you can afford and waiting for another day. Indeed, you spend a long time looking over all the options you have at your disposal until you realise you don't have anything left to do at the time.There is a level of depth and strategy in this game that is completely unique from most games that I've played. The game is simply about optimisation - you have to optimise your buildings, your research, your village placement, your military, and the production of materials to create all these. You also have to optimise the timeframe of when you create these events. This means you have to decide what to create, when to create it, how it will affect your village, your military, and your production, and you have to know if it'll create any difference in the short term to realise your long-term plans. It is a deep experience to go into, with the possibilities rolling in your mind the entire time you're looking at your village statistics. It's like upgrading your character in an RPG, feeling the same amount of pride you do in yourself as you do with your kingdom.Also, you don't need to worry too much about the community. Pretty much all of the players are friendly, looking out for their best interests instead of trying to ruin your day. Most battles are petty, with a small-time raider taking the resources of another village far away - even then only if they're an incredibly weak and defenseless target. If you're at the point where you can let anybody walk in and take your resources, then you let that happen to yourself. The only way for a decent player to have all their villages destroyed is toâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥off a large vassal without making any diplomacy, which is how all my villages were destroyed two years ago.In essence, it's a good game, whether or not you can pay the subscription fee. It gets much better and much faster if you can pay for it, and it is an investment I recommend. It isn't at all a distilled experience like you get with almost every other kingdom-building game on the market, and is a worthy video game in it's own right. It's a unique and engrossing game for sure, and it's one you can download in a few minutes and try out. You do get a two-day subscription to see if you like it, which is a nice feature, if a bit like bait. I really do like this game, even if all my playtime is off the Steam client.P.S. if you're curious, my handle is ""Enthers"". Please don't raid my apple farms.			"

												I can't explain why, but this seems to be my most played game. The game is all about patience, being smart with resources and technology and focusing on what's important first. After you've built the first couple of buildings you have to be extremely patient. I play a few times a day, doing different things to make sure my castle is the best it can be for the parish I'm in. I hardly know anyone but I could do, I got into a faction by asking around. They help you and you can help them. The good things about this game is that it's pretty much a free version of stronghold. While you can't do as much as the games, it is an amazing version of it. While it may seem daunting at first, it takes some time to learn how to be the most efficient, but it pays off. "

												Been playing for over 2 yrs now. If you want to play casually or more involved I recommend it for either. Despite many reviews you don't have to ""pay to win"" it just takes some patience, and although if you spend money you get more or faster results, it is definitely not a requirement. This game is best when you actually get involved with people in the world and once you're involved in a faction or house there is a lot more to do and it becomes more about planning amd strategy. If you don't have patience this game isn't for you...there is literally over a year of real-time research without paying to speed it up, so you're note going to be a powerhouse for a while, especially on a veteran world. The most annoying thing can be the in game politics with players who try to boss everyone around, or when you spend weeks building a village and it gets razed overnight.			"

												Great game. Interface is intuitive and friendly as are most players. If you land in an unfriendly parish, it's just a matter of abandoning your first village and starting over until you find a parish that you like. I definitely wouldn't recommend this game for folks who don't enjoy being part of a larger community and working with others. This game is specifically designed to require interactivity between players to reach higher levels.Some tiny DirectX bugs that are usually resolved by making sure that your computer is up to date...As for any 'freemium' complaints, money will only get you so far in this game if you play solo. There are actually only two $5 USD purchases that are needed to ramp up the free cards (that's right, free) bonus to maximum which is one free card every twelve hours. The rest of the game is about joining a team (faction) and working together.So, yes, if you're a self involved gimp who is certain that you are the centre of the universe don't play this game. I would hate to run into you in world.			"

												It;s a great game for leaders and tacticians. It really is a long process game of politics, war and money. It will have you playing for days if not months before it ends. And once it ends, it starts all of again. I personally recommend this game to all of my friends.EDIT/UPDATE: After sinking even more of my life into this game, and learning how to spell properly it appears (probably wrote that old review late at night) i can still say i ""recommend it"" I put those quotations there because really, i recommend it if you plan to spend at least some money. If not it's fun for a little while, but will eventually leave you upset, cold, and lonely as you watch as someone who spent a few dollars rolls over you and destroys everything without taking prisoners. It is a VERY good game. Horrible business model. So yes, I still ""recommend"" it.			"

												I think this game is clever.  I like the ranking, even with the levels increasing for each rank.  I like the way, 2 months later, I'm still learning.  There is a lot to learn, but it's fun while you're learning.  The fact that one can choose different paths is cool.  I thought I wanted to be a monker, but I like providing also, and I like fighting too, so I do all of it.  The best part is that you're not alone.  Belonging to a House and Faction is cool, and you get so much help.  I like the elections.  Stronghold is a multi-faceted game, very addictive.  I highly recommend it.I see a lot of people saying it's a pay to win game, but so far, I have not found that to be true.  Sure, some people pay and get things done faster, but they don't bother me.  Like they say in my faction, ""Stronghold is a marathon, not a sprint.""			"

												a few hours into the Game, PeacefulStan, settled in Eygpt, is a small, peaceful, religious town, focused on one thing, harmony. As I saw a troop of soilders march over to a wolf den near by, I message there lord and he immediately makes me his vassle! Supprised, I message him back, thanking and blessing him. After a few moments a large trade caravan shows up at my small, humble town. off loading 1,000's of stone wood and foods. My Lord is great, he keeps sending me things! 10/10 would be puppet state again.			"

												I am slowly starting to fall in love with this game. At first I was wary due to alot of comments and reviews claiming it to be a pay-to-win. I have found that although if you do decide to buy card packs and such it can be a little Overpowered, in reality almost nobody actually goes all in on the cards. It just isn't a day to day issue except in times of war. The overall mechanics and game design are thoroughly rewarding. The game scales better than almost anything I've seen so far. Also it is a very social game, bringing in a couple of friends brought a whole new level of satisfaction and cooperation to the game. I only have one request and it may prove too tall of an order for the devs: Is it possible to change the peasant mechanic to be finite and spawn in hovels based on ration rate? Then I would love to see the peasants moving from village to village based on happiness. So it would show migration in real time. I often log on and only see a few trade carts and scouts on the map from only one players village showing that this is the only other active player on right now...It would be server intensive, but it would bring an organic feel and map richness as well as making the game more realistic with a somewhat limited population based on regional development level. All in all, great game so far. I look forward to new content and getting to Crown Prince! Username-Brian of York			"

												Stronghold kingdoms is a difficult game to explain, but if you have ever played a village building game, it is similar to that except on steroids. It is similar to tribal wars, and other games like this but every aspect of the game is simply better. For some reason everyone thinks that the game is pay to win, but this game is not single player so as long as you have those who are contributing to keeping the game aloft by donating on your side you will be fine. Even then there are ways to beat those who buy lots of crowns without anybody in your house using crowns if you have a good enough strategy, but it will involve a lot of waiting and bleeding the enemy dry. Also, you can get cards even if you don't pay, especially now that there is an AI world which allows you to farm cards if you are dedicated enough. This game is not for those who like to be spoon fed results, but if you are patient and enjoy talking to other people and strategizing then this game is for you. "

Start off as a lowly peasant and work your way up to being master of a group of villages or even the King or Queen.Cross swords with your enemies, send wine to your friends so they can feast. Use the trade system to generate the gold to build an empire, it's all here.A game that is simple to begin but also requires good diplomacy and resource management, it's been a really good game to play when having a very changeable job.A really mature player-base makes for a thoroughly enjoyable game with good lasting power.

												This game is the most complete strategy medieval game, there you can rise your realm built in a real world map. You have a great enviroment that you can interact and control units all in real time. With a good level system where you can reach Crown Prince and after that join in the fight for all the thrones. The user interface is pretty friendly so anyone can learn fast how-to-do things like skills.  In Stronghold Kingdoms if you play wisely you get everything you want, the thing most important here is that this game IS NOT PAY-TO-WIN, i play this game since CBT and the game is getting better each time more. As i said, if you play wisely and patient, you can get anything. Join us, Stronghold the Game of Kingdoms.			"

												endrsgm -stronghold kingdoms is a nuanced game. anyone can jump in and play it without having any previous experience in either this game or even this genre of games. however, there is a steep learning curve to master this game.likes: the game is very social. you must develop and maintain alliances.the ability to focus build villages towards specific tasks is very cool. dislikes: the AI castles. way too much of the game time is spent worrying about the appearance of AI castles. a strictly player vs AI version of the game has been made and many players find it enjoyable. why not create a world that has NO AI enemies. it would be purely player vs player. honestly, i would be much more interested in this than playing against a computer. likes and dislikes aside, i find this to be one of the greatest games ive played and i recommend it highly to everyone.

												EASILY THE BEST MMORTS I HAVE EVER PLAYED! I have been hooked onto this game since I started the USA world, and let me tell you, I have made many friends among many kingdoms. I started out looking at the game not expecting much, but when you open your first village, you barely scratch the surface of this hidden gem. There are so many things to keep you busy, instead of just staring at the world map. It's not like one of those facebook games where you just sit there and be bored for the next 12 hours while something builds, there is always something going on that needs your attention. Whether it be scouting for resource stashes, sending mail to factions for diplomacy between other players, or even managing your parish, you will never be let down. It is a little slow to start, but once you get going, I guarantee you, you will not stop. On a side note, you really dont need to pay any money in order to do well in this game, and thats coming from someone who never bought the firefly crowns before. You can earn cards simply by playing and the game rewards you for the more hours you put in. Truly a diamond in the rough as the gameplay shines through being so complex but simple at the same time.IGN: LionhartPrideWorld: Europe 3			"

												This game is addictive, if you are not looking to invest solid time into a game then look elsewhere.  If you play the game right and honestly you will at some point be destroyed. At the point when you are destroyed do not quit, destruction is inevitable I was completely defeated along with the group I was in multiple times when I started the game and later on as well and honestly they were some great times.  Ever fought 200 vs 10? I have on stronghold kingdoms and it was great.  If you are looking to enjoy the game and get honest people to fight alongside you youâre going to need to get crushed a few times first as a noob and eventually, after you have learned the mechanics, as a veritable juggernaut.  You will wade through the masses together with your group and if you stay true to your group you will come out of it reset but stronger than ever before knowing exactly who your friends are, at any time you will have traitors and you will need to hunt them mercilessly, you will have lingering adversaries and you will need to carefully manage the political arena to turn people against them, rivalries will at points have to be cast aside for mutual survival, hold your vengeances deep but your common sense and your tactics deeper.For me winning is the most boring part, if your new join a small group donât head for a big house where you will be coddled or bored, in a small fighting group you may get stomped a few times but your skills and your airtight group will be worth it in the endshk username: nomatophobia "

												This is probably the premier game for replayability. I've logged well over 1 k hours on it. One of the best features is even when you are offline, you advance.   You can play the game alone or with friends.  Addicting, encompassing and entertaining!			"

												a few hours into the Game, PeacefulStan, settled in Eygpt, is a small, peaceful, religious town, focused on one thing, harmony. As I saw a troop of soilders march over to a wolf den near by, I message there lord and he immediately makes me his vassle! Supprised, I message him back, thanking and blessing him. After a few moments a large trade caravan shows up at my small, humble town. off loading 1,000's of stone wood and foods. My Lord is great, he keeps sending me things! 10/10 would be puppet state again.			"

												Played this game only for six months, did sink a few quid on it, but I really didn't need to. You get some decent free cards but really wasn't a pay to win game unless you were fighting really big wars. Me and my friend gradually took over two parishes in southern England after a few weeks of vote point building and collaborating with other non house/hight ranking people. We got the parishes under our control without even really being noticed by this guy. It was only after we tried to muscle in on a third parish; I received a message from him only saying ""bye"". I then noticed 3 icons moving towards my villages, and four over to my friends. He destroyed everything. We tried to send our troops to attack his villages in a pathetic attempt attempt to save ourselves. Or at least take a bit of him with us. Our troops were slaughtered in a tower grid of a village. His troops marched right through our 1 stone block walls and that was that really. We both stopped playing after that. I felt 1000 hours was enough.			"

												unless you love farmville, this game is terrible.it is nothing like the original stronghold games. at first it hooks you with the the original games' music and and visuals but very cleary you realize it is an empty lifeless shell what a great game it used to be.no real time strategy at all, all the fights are 100% automatic and you do not control any of your millitary units unless you use special cards during the battle.buildings take a very long time to construct and managing your population is not existant since they never come under danger and you dont need to bother about carefull plannig because the terrain never changes, distance from the stockpile doesn't matter, and you population only grows according to how many buildings you have.if you expected some MMO about the stronghold games, you will be severly disappointed			"

												This is an awesome game! It is a time-based game where you build buildings which take time to be built and research technologies that take time to research. You can increase your rank, you can fight AIs and other players, you can have factions. An awesome game, similar to the Stronghold series but time based, so it takes a long time. I would totally recommend this game!			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												fantastic game! Well, thats what i think anyway. Here are a few questions: do you like having fun? would you want to rule a town? would you like to build YOUR VERY OWN village and castle? If you answered yes to all of these, GET THIS GAME as it is perfect for you. If you answered no, give it a go, it might even become your new favourite game! I can tell you how much i like this game: I have played 19.5 hours of it and is the game ive played on second most!!!2 months later... Ok, i havent played this game for a month, and my village has been obliterated, it is actually not there any more, so i have to start again. This happened because of invaders that attacked my village. I got mad when this happened... very mad. I still think this is a really good game, but if you are going to hardly ever play this game ( by that i mean once a month or so ), then don't get it.			"

												I played all the strongholds growing up.  Im surprised i stayed away from this for so long.  Its oddly addicting to build up your village and level up.  It reminds me of the web browser text based games mixed with regular stronghold.  I honestly would of stayed away if it wasn't for the USA map.  Its a fun setting to be a medevil lord in the usa.   It has me pretty hooked to the point where i check in regulary, but its the type of game where if you can't get on for a few hours it won't hurt to bad. My only complaint is you don't get to have an actual ""lord"" on the map.  You get to make an avatar, but thats it.  I would love to see my lord be able to lead troops like a captain.  Other than that its worth checking out, its free after all.   Names Ethabrowne on usa2 if anyone needs help!Had to add some extra after playing for a bit.  Before i started playing i was worried because people said it was pay to win.  While cards can give you an advantage being active and building right, and getting to npc targets can make you accel over card users..  So being active rewards you.  Its addictive watching myself get stronger and outrank the vet players.  Even captured my first village from some menace, made the guy quit.  I won that day.			"

												To slow to do anything. 6 months of play and my research tree isnt even half full. traded a 500 point card got 25 f'ing points. noobs can pop in any time and take a spot you been working 3 months for. 3 weeks to build a castle of any sort. merchants and scouts go at a crawl speed even with their speed research fully finished wich ends up being just a waste of points and time. building time continues to get longer and longer untill it takes 24 full hours to create a woodcutters shack. research time continusly takes more and more time eventually taking 24 hours to get one research done. They did nothing more than take a good game stretch it out and f'ing ruin it by putting it online and saying free to play when this is clearly a pay to win game. Just  a bunch of suits tryin to keep up but if im going to spend money on a game its a one time purchase for full content. if im going to pay to play ill go back to warcraft cause no other game can even think about keeping up with blizzard.

												I guess since I've put in so many hours to this game, It is worth giving it a review. These kinds of games are kinda niche-y in play style. You either like it or you don't. However, if you are into this genre of strategy game then I think you should get this game. Something about being able to control building placement to optimize resource output is more fun than just clicking a static tile and telling it to upgrade. It opens up a lot more possibility for optimization and higher level gameplay than other similar titles where high level play simply involves having all of your city's buildings fully upgraded. Give it a try. Its Free after all, whats the worst that could happen? (And before you say, ""well a waste of download time"" the game is a pretty small download. Its really easy to set up and get going pretty quickly...so yea ...there is that.)			"

												The objective of Stronghold Kingdoms is to build your own town and castle, commerce and defence. At the beginning you choose your real-world country, county and town - the game takes place on a map of the real world, and you can defend the honor of your real-life hometown if you wish.The game starts off slowly as many strategy games do, with woodcutters bringing in wood and quarries bringing in stone. Soon you will be farming animals, trading with nearby towns and going to war with neighboring counties, with the aim to make your parish the greatest and also to make your city to the capital of the entire country.What makes Stronghold Kingdoms different to other strategy games, is that every action you do takes real time to complete. So you have to spend some money or it will take much time until you have built a town.The engine of Stronghold Kingdoms is old and the game starts very slowly, especially for those who are not going to open their wallet. But it deserves a try if you got patience and prefer management over real time strategy, or if you are just a fan of the Stronghold series.Sounds 6/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												TLDR: Stronghold Kingdoms is a fun and addicting Free 2 Play RTS that is as punishing as it is rewarding.Be warned, this game is really complicated and hard to learn so don't be afraid to ask for help, there is a starters tutorial in there that explains the very basics and i mean the VERY basics, all it tells you is how to build things in your village and castle and maybie a few other small things, there are a few quests that help you get the hang of the game though.In my opinion this game isn't all that P2W, at least from what i've seen. When you spend money on this game you can get either one of seven random card packs that gives you random cards five cards as the name suggests or premium which allows you to que up five buildings in your villages, aswell as five researches, when selling your goods it gives you the option to find the highest and lowest prices and the ability to add protection to your village up to 15 days, the last one I haven't figured out how to use. Aswell as a few automated things that IMO aren't too useful.When starting off I reccomend starting near a friend that knows how to play that can teach you some of the basics that the tutorial doesn't cover and help you get started.You start off with one village and some stone and wood and as you rank up you earn 3 research points for every rank, until a few classes up you have to go through sub-ranks, which are basically the same thing only not as special, and as you get stronger you can control more villages that you either steal from other players at a massive honour penalty or you buy a village from charters which are rare, especially when the server is in the later stages, the more villages you have the higher the penalty or cost, charters are also more expensive the further they are away from the village you have selected.When building structures in your village each structure type is more expensive than the last and each structure takes longer to build oh and research, oh the research. Researching things imo is the most unforgiving part of this game, once you research something once it's complete you've got it, you can't get it back or anything. In addition to earning three points each time you rank up you can buy research points for gold which, again gets more expensive the more points you buy but there are researches that reduces the time it takes to build things and research tasks and researches that make buying points cheaper but you get the cheaper points later in the game, there are also cards that complete researches and buildings, make buildings and researches complete faster and give free research points.Armies probably should of been explained better imo, you start off with armed peasants which cost just about nothing to create, archers which are the only general use ranged unit, pikemen which try to clean out castles, swordsmen which rush straight for the center and catapults which sit there and hit the target you order them to, although catapults do deal out some nasty friendly fire. One tip i have when deploying armies is upgrade the troops you're using as much as you can since every upgrade exept captains and catapults upgrades their health, the catapult upgrade makes them fire faster and the captain upgrades make captain armies move faster and let you have more captains per village, i also reccomend getting the speed upgrade and as you expand get the army allowance upgrade.There are four currencies, gold which is generally used for creating troops and some structures, faith which is used with monks, honour which is used to rank up and crowns which are the paycash. On top of the four currencies there are four raw resource types, eight banquet resource types, six food types and five weapon types which are required to build every troop but captains and armed peasants.In addition to your army you have three non-combat units that you can use, scouts, monks and traders. Scouts can be used to scout enemy AI places and player villages and forage for resources which can be useful when you need resources and are running low, traders as the name suggests trade with parish capitals or they can be used to give resources to other players, while i haven't used monks myself they can be used to change votes, cure disease, increasing and decreasing popularity of villages in the parish and preventing attacks, aswell as of course removing these powers and removes the powers of churches. Although when training these units be warned, they run off the same population limit as your army and aswell as your troops they require peasants to train, unlike captains and villages though the more monks you have the cheaper they are. You increase the amount of each unit by research although unlike scouts and monks, the traders cap get increased based on how many markets you have, the limit of which is 10, each market will allow up to 5 traders.If you start you can't stop, in alot of cases you won't want to stop. The game runs in real time so you might get attacked by either an AI or a random player while you're off. Don't say off for too long though because you will get booted from the server from *ahem* idleness. The idle threshold goes up the higher your rank is, up to 2 months or if you have a premium token that lasts longer than your rank's idle time then the game will wait for that to expire before you get booted.Again, if you need help or advice don't be afraid to go on the Steam community hub, the SK offical forums, the guides or if you're lucky ask a player via the in-game chat.If anyone's interested in teaming up, my name is Hinsonator in game.

												Had a previous review that was positive, but after playing again recently, I have decided to give any new players a fair warning. Here it goes...People will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you three ways into sunday if you so much as breath their air in. No joke. I had one small shanty town, and it was captured all because of it's location. I've had empires razed because of sending monks to parishes that had the Swine Flu or some otherâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Or the classical good time I got Mcâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed up because of having a offensive name for my villages (I named them after concentration camps during WW2.). So yeah, the game can be fun if you like making little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mad about you insulting their blood-line, but if you even BEGIN to take this game seriously... Player Beware.			"

												Interesting concept. There is not much interaction between players except for political aspect and a little bit of a battle. Generally allows you to play the way you want. Very interesting detailed environment.			"
