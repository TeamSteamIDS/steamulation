												BEFORE READING !This is not my fix solution, Thrawn wrote this, i'm just making sure it stays alive so everyone can fix it.http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983716155Cossacks 2 FixSo I have had a ton of trouble since buying this game on a whim. Didn't know anything about it. Suffice it to say, the Steam version does not work on all PC's. I've got a Gateway FX gaming laptop and can run any game on the market so my specs are fine. Here is my work around for Cossacks after much finagling. I hope this helps you guys.1. You need the C2_Patch_v1_2.exe (google that exact thing and download it)2. Download Universal Extractor (google it and download it3. Use Universal Extractor to extract the C2_Patch_v1_2.exe patch into any file you want on your desktop4. Copy and paste extracted patch into the root folder for Cossacks 2 c:/programfiles(x86)-Steam-steamapps-common-Cossacks II Napoleonic Wars5. Run game using startengine.exe button in root folderThis may be all you need to get it to work. However if you get the error'Engine.exe has detected, that video memory is not configured properly. Please restart computer and set AGP Aperture size-256 Mb or more in BIOS configuration program.""you need to do another couple of steps6. Download the c2-hoae-3d-patch.zip and copy and paste its contents into the same root folder the first patch went in and run the game using the startengine.exe buttonO.k. now the game works but I can't save a file (smh why would steam allow this to be sold when its so broken?)1. Go to the root folder. c:/programfiles(x86)-Steam-steamapps-common-Cossacks II Napoleonic Wars2. If there is no folder named 'Save' then create a folder named 'Save'3. If there is a folder named 'Save' open it and delete any folders inside it (possibly says 'camp' not sure)4. Remove the ""Read-only"" status from the Cossacks II Napoleonic Wars folder-Do this by right clicking on the folder, select properties, deselect 'read-only' and hit apply (may need to do this every time you play the game...I have for some reason.)This helped me for now. If I find other bugs and work around I'll post them here. But this is seriously pathetic and I'm filing a complaint to Steam. A game that does not work shouldn't be sold. Edit 1:The ""Too many handlers"" error seems to happen only on certain missions. My only work around is save often and beat mission as fast as possible to continue playing.Edit 2: (omfg)Some of the text in the game is German. Specifically building/unit names and descriptions while everything else is in English. To fix this1. Go to root folderc:/programfiles(x86)-Steam-steamapps-common-Cossacks II Napoleonic Wars2. Open 'Text"" folder3. Delete file mdlist(2).txt (make sure its the one that says (2))This fixed the problem for me. Apparently some German language files may find their way into your text folder through the screwy patch system. If this file does not exist you will have to just look through every file till you find the German stuff and delete it.  "

												So your thinking of buying Cossacks 2?Well do it. Sounds like Shia is writing this review but he wouldn't be wrong this game is awesome. The game is fun and user friendly and although dated I kinda still like the style. Now you may see many reviews saying stuff along the lines of ""the first one was better"" or ""down with the patriarchy"" ignore those. The only way to see whether or not you will like this game is to try it, go and pirate it and try the game out. Then, if you are a good person and like the game you can buy it.Anyway on to the actual review.The game itself is nice and has a bunch of different nations to chose from (being from the UK I play British) but there are many other good nations to chose from such as France, Poland, Austria, Spain, Rhineland, Russia and a bunch more! Each one has strengths and weaknesses, such as the British have great infantry and rifleman squads but lack great cavalry.The game-play plays out like any generic RTS, build a base and all that until you realise you cant get all the resources yourself...There are towns located across the maps that you must capture to gain the resources such as gold, food, iron and coal.Without these you will lose, for example with no coal you will not be able to shoot. At all. So its rather important that you keep a stockpile and don't shoot unless you need to. The towns also make the combat more centralised which can lead up to some cool big battles.The only gripe I have with this game is that the multiplayer is dead as it is an old game so unless you know some people who own it you will have to play single player which while fun for a while, you will bore after a while. There is also a very limited amount of maps, and they can get boring after a while, especially if you are playing with multiple players as they are even more limited.All in all I like this game and you should too (and if you don't its Obama's fault)			"

												Its like a Napoleon Total war with age of empires 2 graphics.I loved this game.The only problems are that you need to go to the game folder and create a folder inside it named: saves. To be able to save your game and play the campaign (atleast in win7).I liked the game but it crashes a lot and there is a patch to correct this that steam doesnt put here.Without this patch its really unplayable because of the freezes and crashes.

												Nostalgia brought me here, and nostalgia will stop me asking for a refund. This was a great game, this version is very buggy, but can be made marginly less buggy! Due to tips from users (bless you all), rather than the people I threw my money at. The game should not be for sale in this state. If I was a New player I would'nt bother.

												Compared to the original Cossacks, this is more of a battle game more than a build an empire game. In this version, you can only play against one big opponent and always on land. In the original version, you could have 7 different opponents, a navy, and just all around a better game. If you are looking for just big battles, this would be better. However, if you like the original, I would just stick with it.			"

												Despite all of this disappontment by small maps and less number of features, on which complains fans to, i am enjoyed by this game. It is real hardcore strategy where skirmish battle may continue for a two hours and more on easy mode. Because computer uses skilful tactics and advantages of landscape. Because you must think about resorces constantly: in any moment you may deplete gunpowder and your brave infantry will be beaten. Many fans moans about graphic, it look good for 2D nonetheless and game have perfect animations, especially of reloading infantry weapons - it is awesome			"

												About all the negative commentars, I would say one thing, thats right! THANK yOU STEAM FOR SUCH A GIFT... . It was a buggy game on a CD and on the Steam its the biggest crap. The game doesnt have the internet server anymore. Skirmish: the combination by Russian (I played)  vs England is broken. They are friendly, and you cannot attack them ._. Well at least the campagn doesnt work: first mission ok, second, The game says no ^^. The game crash, and after you try to get in again, your saves are all lost. Well 10 point for such a full game. No seriesly patch that online button  out, and dont give the players the game-codes, or even dont sell it^^.Game World (company) wanke.rs go and make another  version of the stalker, but please dont ever make some games like that!-1000/10 points!Disscusting piece of sh.it!

This is a very good game. You have to use your plans, everytime have a plan B! Fortificate every entrance into your village. There's not much to say. I like the game, the graphics are better than the photos you see on steam and the gameplay is great. I rate this game 7/10 because it's old and it has some bad AI problems. For real, some soldiers are completely r3tarded. They go across the map, all the way to the enemy vilage and they just sit there and look at passing enemy units.			"

I've tried various compatibility modes, various graphic settings, this game is just unplayable ""out of the box"" on Steam. I can't speak for a disc copy of the game, but unless you don't mind digging around the internet hunting down the patch that may or may not fix this, I'd avoid it.			"

												I buyed my first Cossacks 2 in the year 2007 on a CD and in the beginning I was very frustrated about the game and the playstyle, because I wasn`t able to get used to the tactics and gameplay. But later on I work harder on it, trying to lern the mechanics and see it makes fun and I keep winning !So this game is great for beginners too, the tutorials are very helpful, they tell the crucial basics of the game.In the last year my CD didn`t work anymore and it was very complicated to run this game on Win7 in the last time. After my upgrade to Win10 I decided to play Cossacks 2 again, and now my cracked version didn`t stark anymore. I bought the steam version, in the hope that it do wonders.... and it totally does it, Cossacks 2 Steam version works on my Win 10 ! I was totally facinated !In the end I can`t understand the many bad reviews of the game in my opinion. The old asses who only likes the old stuff, are just frustrated. If you thought of buying it, then JUST DO IT !!PS: Excause my english skills.			"

												It was one of my all time favourites.But Steam has released a buggy and non-playable for most game which is not worth any money at all.I recommend to wait for Cossacks 3 coming out in December.The 9 hours Ive spent in game, has been starting up again and again trying to work around the game breaking bugs. Among them:- Problem saving profiles- Freezing after 3 minutes in-game- Suddenly crashing, showing a bunch of peasants and losing the battle automaticlyNot worth your time or effort. I have been trying, REALLY trying to get this to work. I really want to play this so bad, but I can't. Thanks Steam for teasing me and making me pay you just for uploading a messed up file compilation. Seems they just took whatever files they could find on the CD and copy+pasted them to their server and expected money for it...			"

												I'm a huge fan of the orginal Cossacks.   I had to jump through many hoops to get this to run in my windows 7 64bit machine.   I got it running after changing my screen resolution to 1920 x 1080.     Game crashed on me anyways.   I bought the whole package for 20 bucks, now I have half a dozen games in my library that I can't run unless I change my screen resolution (and even then I'll expect  a crash).			"

												An old game, without a doubt, but a fun game. Similar in some ways to Total War, but uniquely different. The Steam version is a bit unstable but it's still playable. You may as well stick to the single-player since that's the best part of the game.If you are interested in this game, make sure you only get the base game for £4. When I was looking to buy there was another version for about triple the price, that only seemed to add garishly coloured new factions.			"
