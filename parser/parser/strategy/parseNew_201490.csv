												Do Not Buy, not the base game not the gold edition.Lets start from the top, airline tycoon 1 was a cult classic one among the best tycoon games, you are a airline owner and have to manage your airline on various mission along with 3 other competitors. The first game did this perfectly with great humor and a wonderful gameplay , incorporating REAL planes and what not , its a masterpiece.....So come to the present , Balive releases this horror as the sequel to the first game...by gods its horrible it totally ditched everything that made the first game great, Game runs on a rotten engine , doubt anyone would play it more than a hour, no Real plane names, No humor nothing just a bunch of guys with big Heads running around ackwardly.To Pour more salt to the injury-They implemented the suggestions made by the community as DLCs -They are done with the game just repackaged it as gold edition , just check the forums the game is still horrible-dont expect even cards for the game http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=20275-modding is bare minimum , a few exist but dont do much to improve the gameAvoid it , unless its on a massive sale if you want the real airline tycoon experience get the first game on steam.Sad to see us the fans of classic get such a horrible sequelNot so epic screenshots of the game...http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidsnakehpks/screenshots/?appid=201490&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=grid "

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.One Hour Reviews - Game 5Airline Tycoon 2Purchase Date: 9/11/2014Like a number of games in my Steam library, I came across Airline Tycoon 2 as part of a Humble Bundle.  I really like Humble Bundle because not only do I get to donate to a good cause, but sometimes in that bundle I'll come across a really good game that I never would have bought otherwise.Sadly, Airline Tycoon 2 is not one of those games.Right off the bat the game scored a negative when I realized I'd have to login to play this game.  Given that this is a completely single player game with no internet component whatsoever, I really don't see the point in forcing me to login.  The only thing that kept this from being more annoying is apparently I've played some other game from Kalypso, so it remembered my login from that.  So at least I didn't have to make another account.Airline Tycoon 2 tries to inject some humor by presenting you with various cariactures of people like Albert Einstein, who is exactly the person that comes to mind when I need an airline mechanic.  You know, cause he's smart.  This is the kind of humor you get to look forward to in Airline Tycoon 2.I played through the tutorial, which does a decent enough job of introducing you to the game concepts.  It sent me around the airport to talk to various people, so I could meet all of the goofy characters the game has to offer.  It doesn't sound so bad when I say it, but eventually you get tired of running around the airport to visit the mechanic or go to the personnel office to hire a pilot, or hightail it back to your office to plan an airline route.Imagine playing a city builder except every time you wanted to build a new building, you had to run over to the mayors office and talk to a caricature of the Godfather so you could tell him you want to zone a new block of houses.So once I talk to Albert Einstein to get my plane decked out, and talk to someone else to get my pilot and crew hired, and someone else to actually tell my crew which plane they are working on, after all that then I can find the manager, so I can rent a route to fly my plane on.  They should have put out a version of this game for the Wii that is compatible with the Wii Fit balance board.   After all that, I can head back to my office to plan my flights for the week.   It's a bit like setting up meetings in outlook where each route takes up a chunk of time for the day, so the idea is you slot in as many round trips as you can, with some occasional maintenance inbetween flights.  You can also set the ticket price on your flights.  As the day progresses you can check on your flights and get statistics on things like how satisfied your passengers were and how much money your flight made.The tutorial did fine at showing me around and introducing me to people I'd rather not talk to, but it doesn't really explain much about the actual strategy in the game.  For instance, there are a ton of different planes you can buy, and lots of ways to tailor how the plane looks, both exterior and interior.  But I have no idea if it's purely cosmetic or if these choices somehow impact customer satisfaction.That's really where I ended up at the end of my first hour, wondering how and if my choices affected anything.  In the end, I realized that there's really only one choice that matters, and that is the choice not to play this anymore.Overall Recommendation:  Pass			"

												Wow... I am so glad this game was nearly free from humble bundle... It was worth the laughs of everyone in the room with HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS and my bumbling reations before ragequitting in the tutorial!I honestly thought I was going be playing an Aerobiz type game and instead was greeted with one of the most confusing, USER-UNFRIENDLY game I have ever seen.If your tutorial alone causes confusion as to what to do next and then causes rage quits, THEN YOU HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE GAME!Also... WHY DO I HAVE TO REGISTER WITH SOME OTHER BS LAUNCHER TO PLAY A GAME I GOT ON STEAM!?!?The voiceovers are terrible, the art is terrible, the user interface is considered a form of torture in most the civlized world.I don't even think the people that made this know anything about airplanes... I don't even think they have ever flown on an airplane before!			"

												Really wanted to like this game.  Was looking for a fun business sim type game, but this wasn't it.You only ""work"" an 8 hour day, but schedule planes for 24 hours, so at the end of the day, you have to ""end"" even if you're not done with your day.  The game over complicates some things and other things it doesn't even give you an idea of how you're doing.  The banking system charges outrageous interest rates for loans.  The interiors of the aircraft are... unexplainable.  The cost of aircraft is weird, the aircraft are weird, hiring aircrews isn't completely understood.  There is a whole shady side to the game where you can cause problems on a competitor's airline, but it's not even clear what the point of that is.  Simply stated, there's no balance to the game, it's just a poorly designed and executed game that should not have been released.  Sorry, but I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I was really excited about the sequel of Airline Tycoon. So I've bought this game a long time ago. And I don't know where to start. The nice thing about the first Airline Tycoon was the nice balance between realism (stats) and fun (dialogs). You got real planes with real stats, the flight managing was fast and intuitive. But AT2 is the opposite of this. You have a little ammout of fictional planes (yes, they are customisable, that's a nice feature, but that's all). All of them are really ugly. Dialogs are boring and you can feel the failed attepts to make a joke.And that's not enough! Without both DLCs, you're gonna miss features from previous AT like shares, last-minutes, cargo and so on... What the hell is this logic? These features are something that made oroginal AT fun. Basic AT2 without DLCs is just boring and the DLCs are not worth the price, because it will make the game's value higher to get the features that should be in the base game already.And don't even ask about the performance. I'll tell you just two words - it's terrible.			"

												Sold as a simulation but has practically zero depth and you can easily go around the whole game in a few hours. There are only 4 airlines to choose from, which are rigid and uncustumizable. The aircraft customization options themselves are laughable; only 8 aircraft to choose from regardless of any realism (the concorde becomes a short haul, high passenger, profitable aircraft) with very limited options. The indoor cabin design is a joke: the developers wouldn't bother to make the different indoor environment for the different aircraft, so the inside of your jumbo jet is the same as that of your small propeller airliner. Furthermore you just choose preset items for the whole aircraft and can't for example have multiple class aircraft, but this doesnt change anything anyway since the price for all tickets is always the same. Also personel management is ridiculous: you hire people with the skills they come with and you can't train them further, so your only way to improve your staff is to fire them and get new ones. You can only assign one set of staff to an aircraft, so basically it's the same pilot flying that airplane 24/7 for a whole month. Call the worker's syndicate!!! For those of you who are politically minded it's also nice to notice here that the game is stereotipically sexist: all pilots are males and all flight attendants female.The main part of the game and where you will spend the most time with is the scheduling; it looks intricate at first, but after a few hours you find out it totally lacks any realism. The amount of passengers only depends on the demand and you can program your flights at basically any time of the day, hello 2AM departures! Basically your sucess at the game just depends on cramming the biggest number of route and charter flights in the schedule rather than making regular flights (the flight numbering system is automated and wonky).The user interface is atrocious in the whole game, you have to physically walk to different offices, with loading screens, to get going. While the idea is commendable, it will soon become a chore and you will soon give up booking charter flights just because they require constant walking outside your office (loading screen), to the elevator (loading screen) to the charter office so you can grab a few contracts, and then the same annoying way back so you can schedule them.The options are so limited and not user friendly at all, the tooltips are inconsistent and unclear over the board. The scheduling board is extremely poorly designed. It's hard to place the flights with precision, the ""repeat schedule"" option, which is meant to allow you to hold regular flight is the most user unfriendly ever and simply doesn't work. Any flights that take off before midnight and land after midnight will break this feature. Also you are forced to do some makeshift workarounds, like setting the schedule you want to repeat for tomorrow, then waiting a whole day before deciding to repeat it, because the game doesnt let you modify today's schedule, but it only allow you to copy today's schedule, not another days... so user unfriendly it's a crime. And did I mention the annoying ""clear flight schedule"" button located next to other buttons, which will wipe all the work you did without a confirmation screen?The game itself is also full of bugs. The schedule locks itself frequently for no reason, the text doesn't match your actual objective, you get teleported back to your office when looking at a competitor's aircraft, the tutorials (which are themselves rather useless) get stuck while in progress, so you have to repeat the same actions twice.The game does have a cute little design feel to it with some pretty cool airplane models (the airbus 380 with full ringed wings and 8 engines for example, or the cute curvy concorde), but this doesn't save it from the abysmal depth, or lack of depth, that it sinks into. Most people play simulation games because they enjoy some variety and custom options. In this game:* You cannot rename anything (airlines, aircraft, staff)* There is only 1 airport interior, all airports in the world are the same* There is only 1 aircraft interior* None of your choices has any real effect on the game anyway.* Regardless of which mission you are in, or sandbox mode, you start each day at 9AM with a speech from the airport director, the speech is always the same and he repeats it 3 times as well for each of your competitor airlines.Playing this feels about as fun as groundhog day happening to you...avoid!

												While I kind like the artstyle of this game (brings me back to the good old days of playing Theme Park World), it's sadly the only thing I liked about this game besides one other thing. I'm quite into sim games in general, but this game really did not cut it for me.In this game you play a cartoonish airline manager (there are a few to choose from, each with their own special trait like getting better deals at on-flight meals) and you have to be the most succesful one: aka be the most profitable. You buy planes for your fleet and customize to your liking, balancing airplane quality, fly range, maintenance and transport size. You can also buy plance from the scrapyard, which is a nice touch but I doubt beneficial due to very high maintenance and the planes often being too outdated (yes, planes technology evolves in this game). You have to get your crew together (balancing skills versus salary), arrange stuff for you planes, etc.But in the end there is one mayor issue: the game is TERRIBLY slow. You (and your competitors) advance at the speed of a snail... While this does resemble real life better, it sadly just isn't fun. This combined with a very steep learning curve as the tutorial just doesn't cut it, causing me to feed that I really have no idea what I'm doing nor what I ought to do. And that's bad for a sim game. You should have the feeling that your decision matters and you should get feedback on the consequences of you choices. But sadly, it takes too long to get that feedback and if easy to miss it as the gains are often very small.This game disappointed me. If your time is valuable to you, try some other game instead of this one. Or be willing to ask google to help you play this game, because without it you'll surely fail :(			"

												I really don't have much to add to the majority of other reviews posted--if you peruse them, you'll get a pretty solid and fair sense of the isues plaguing this game. Sadly, they've taken what was a great, fun concept in Airline Tycoon (I've sunk at least a good 50 hours into that), and not only bogged everything down (loading screens for almost every screen change--seriously?) but also made the interface obtuse and the connections between elements confusing... even the tutorial stopped me cold a couple of times.All of this topped off with DLC for elements that were in the first game, like stocks, last minute flights, etc.Avoid. Play the original... it still holds up even all these years later. This sequel is an embarrassment.			"

												Honestly I hate to boo a game but when I heard Airline tycoon I thought: I make up a airline and try to run it at a profit. However this game seems to be about micro-managment, if your looking for a tycoon game where you can set up and reap the rewards without micro management, crapy tutorials, complex gameplay that is not explained... look somewhere else. after pounding my head against the tutorial (and there is only 1) trying to figure out what I missed and beat the first level on easy I continually fail because the competition beats me to 80%. This game sounded good, and I bought it on sale, but it was a massive waste of money. Maybe if they patched in a proper tutorial to explain how to raise your various semi-hidden statistics it would be worth playing again but I'm not holding my breath. Don't waste your time, money, or your sanity.			"

												This game is, unfortunatly, far inferior to the much cheaper original, which was a simulation classic.Let's start with what this game does right. It presents a complex economic simulation, customizable planes, interesting charecters and interesting mechanics.So why did I rate this game negativly?The original game did all that, only better. The simulation  and mechanics were almost exactly the same, the original game's charecters and sense of humor are far superior, (Airline Tycoon 2's comedy falls completly flat) and in my opinion the ability to buy real-world planes in the original was better.The game suffers from graphics that lag greatly in the terminal, and look overly cartoony, and the music is terrble.Normally, I do not mind DLC, and I think it is worthwhile to support the developers if it is farily priced. However, this game's DLC feels like they took some of the most interesting parts of the orginal (Cargo and last minute contracts) and made you pay more for it.The BIGGEST PROBLEM with this game is the pacing. In the original Airline Tycoon you can easily make over 500,000 dollers from the begining of the game, and in a little over a week by your next plane, which makes it easier to buy the next plane. The pacing is helped by the fact you can skip the morning meeting, and there are no loading screens. On the other hand Airline Tycoon 2 is hampered by the fact that planes 3 or 4 times as expensive, and they make substantialy less money per day than in Airline tycoon deluxe. Compounded with the HORRIBLE LOADING TIMES, it can take HOURS to purchase another plane. This game moves at a glacial pace.CONCLUSION; If you want an tycoon game in which you manage an airline, DO NOT CHOSE AIRLINE TYCOON 2. You should go with the much cheaper, original Airline Tycoon deluxe!By the way, I know some people are concerned about giving their email adress to the launcher. I gave my email adress to them 3 or 4 years ago for tropico 4 and they maybe have sent my 2 or three emails since.			"

												So, I bought a humble bundle and it included Airline Tycoon 2.Before starting, I must admit I have only played the game for less than an hour or so, so my review might not do the game full justice. But here go’s anyway.From starting the game it is immediately obvious that they are going for the same look and feel such as classics like “Theme Hospital” or “Pizza Tycoon”. It however fails miserably. The graphics are cartoony and simple, which is fine. But do not seem to run very smooth, even though they are of low-quality.The interface is cluttered and cumbersome. You are actually required to walk from place to place getting a loading screen every time you pass a door. This started to annoy me relatively quickly, but let’s let that slide. To do almost anything you will have to talk to the correct character, of course all located in different rooms and none of which connect directly. Every character is an over the top caricature, unfortunately I just found them annoying in varying degrees.So how’s the gameplay. Once again, let me say I never got passed the tutorial, but for me, the main issues of running an airline got completely lost in the struggle to complete irrelevant details. Personally I was hoping for more of a “Transport Tycoon” approach.3/10+ High customisability- To painful interface to actually play- Falls flat on its face every time it tries to be funny- To many load screens			"

												I was so exited when I heard of the existence of this game. As a massive fan and continual player of Airline Tycoon, quite justly, I was expecting a game equal to or greater than the original. So disappointing to find this game has been mucked around with to such a degree that it is unplayable.Other than updated graphics, which the game likely benefits from, this software is nothing more than a flame for moths, Money Moths, the ones that live in your wallet. Shameful			"

 INTRO	Bought this game to experience the nostalgia of ""Airline Tycoon - First Class"", ended up to occasionally touch this game after couple of hours. PROS	 Newer 3D graphic engine compared its previous game New character selection New scenario CONS	 This game is same like its predecessor ""Airline Tycoon"", just with enhanced graphic engine and fantasy plot / scenario No more Airplane based on real passenger aircraft Campaign mode simply monotone, lacks of surprise element. Knowing this game is a sequel FPS have some jitter issue Not so friendly GUI, you may have some difficulties findings an option to quit, skip, or forward chat dialogue or even the task window itself. Overall Rating : 5/10	 "

												Let me start by saying that this product is not a game, it is an experience of human culture. It is not a very pleasant one, though. Airline Tycoon 2 is confusing at best. There are numerous unwarranted stereotypes portrayed in uncanny valley style graphics. I went far enough to see what the gameplay is like, and it is not enough to tempt any more time out of me. The game's font is almost unreadable even at the highest graphics setting. The gameplay doesn't make sense, either. I'm not saying it's particularly complicated (there honestly isn't that much going on) it's just not logical. I'm also pretty sure one of the store owners is implying you can solicit her for sexual activities. This game would most likely be more successful as a dating sim if they decided to expand it in that regard, but even then it wouldn't be worth the curiosity. TLDR: the game is scary in a bad way and not very interesting.			"

												As I remember playing some kind of airline business sim back in what I believe were the Sega Genesis days, I thought that this may have been some kind of a sequel, or at least something in the same vein.  I was wrong.I usually list off the pros and cons and give a brief description of the game when I review one, however, with this game it is not neccessary.  This is a bad game.  I can't think of a single redeeming quality and the entire game is on the 'con' side of the list.  If you insist on giving this game a chance, at least buy it when it's on a sale that hacks a massive chunk off of the asking price.You have been warned.			"

												The first Airline Tycoon was amazing, fun, interesting, just enough complex. Now we have Airline Tycoon 2, a complete waste of time and nerves. It's slow, too many loading screens, gfx are childish, things that should take you (and used to take) a few seconds to decided now take minutes and multiple actions and loading screens because the developers were clueless about the game.Avoid at all cost. Don't waste your money and time on a product like this.			"

												If you enjoyed Airline Tycoon 1 (like me) you WILL be dissapointed by this game.When I first played, my enthusiasm faded quite quickly. At first, I chalked it up to unfairly comparing this game to its predecessor so I gave it a chance.  After a few attempts and a few short sessions every couple weeks, culminating to approx 16 hours, I decided it's time to uninstall this piece of trash.Now that the personal anecdote is out of the way, here is where I think this game fails.I'm sure most people got turned off by the fact that you have to move around the airport to do things like in a point-and-click adventure game, instead of just looking at spreadsheets from like other ""tycoon"" games. The first game did that too, but in that one, the airport was a 2D enviornment and everything was easy to find, and it was easy to get to places quickly. Here, however, you move really slow in a full 3D enviornment that makes your video card chug away for no real reason.Which brings me to my next point, the graphics. Don't get me wrong, I know graphics don't make the game and I am not criticizing about the choice of style. I'm talking about the unessisary details in this game. When all you are really doing is scheduling flights for your planes do you really care about the ammount of bloom in the main terminal? You would if it's causing your middle-end hardware to lag.The thing this game has going for it (what the other game lacks) is custom designs of the plane's interiors, livery colors, decals. Unfortuantly all those areas are limited, you only have a few color choices, and half of them are the established color schemes of the featured (uncustomizable) airlines. Instead of buying real world planes like the Airbus A320 or the Boeing 737, you instead have to build planes from scratch from a limited set of parts. Another feature this game has is that you can view your plane in flight. All these things are pointless, unless you entertained by the sight of your butt-ugly plane in it's butt-ugly $-sign decals bob up and down in front of a sky backdrop.Newcomers to the series hate it for its limiting and unconvential style and fans of the first game hate it for dumbing it down. Spend your $20 elsewhere.EDIT: Airline Tycoon Deluxe is now available on Steam, I recomend you check that out.			"

												This game was nothing like old school sprite version i and allot of others felt in love to at the time. Going 3D isn't the problem, its the lack of acting and good looking remakes of the original characters. The game asks me to confirm for a second time on everything i do.  The Voice Acting is more annoying than funny, and the lack of a proper multiplayer we all loved to play isn't there anymore.  It got problems on windows 8 (not with 100% of the computers it seems), but windows 8 is officially not supported, as i got a response from that claiming that when i asked them about issues on the new released windows system.  I don't recommend this, its buggy, its crashed alot, and the voice acting is a total annoyance. "

The learning curve on this game is quite high and to be sucessful is more trial and error. Also having to ""walk"" your avatar when the clock is ticking to different departments gets tedious and quite boring. The game has it's moments but there is something to be said about too much micromanagment. If your one to love Excel spreadsheets and plan in the future a love of how to manage an airline then this is the game for you. Other then that nothing about this game especially screams fun.			"

If you spend actual real money on this abomination, you are a fool.  Better to take the cash you would have spent on this and flush it down the toilet.  Don't even accept it if it is free.  The tutorial gives less than bare minimum info on how the game works.  Once in game mode, you will find game mechanics tedious and boring.

												Well, i never thought it would be possible to mess up such a great premise as Airline Tycoon 1, but Kalypso did it again.The engine is horribly optimized so there is loadng screens on Everything. Going from one room to another? Loading Screen. Talking to someone? Loading Screen. Walking from one side of the Airport to another? Loading Screen!Opening your Inventory? LOADING SCREEN. Managing your routes? You guessed it, another loading screen.You spend more time staring at loading screens than actually playing the game.Not that its very playable, the font size is incredibly small, making me believe the game was obviously designed exclussively for someone with super-sight. Like Eagles, or Superman. I at least cannot read anything, and changing game files to fix the font size is not an option for everyone.The game is Slow, as in, it only requires one GB Ram to run, but it will still lag horrendously even on a PC running with 16 GB ram and a Titan X Graphics Card with i7 processor. That is to say, a game which looks worse than the original classic, runs worse on a modern day supercomputer than anything currently published by triple A producers Ubisoft and Activision.How. In. The. World. Did you manage to accomplish this, Kalypso?Just How?			"

Controls are bad, to manage your airplane you have to walk around the Airport, which takes ages. Performance is bad, your fps won't even get close to 30 whilst the graphic being strange as well. If you want a fun Simulation game, rather go for Transport Tycoon. Building and managing airplanes is way more fun there.			"

												Several years ago, I stumbled across Airline Tycoon and found it fantastic. Unfortunately as happens with sequels, things are added, tweaked, removed. In this instance, not for the better.By itself, the game is OK, but the UI is very unintuitive and annoyingly cumbersome. I know games have a learning curve, but I couldn't get through more than 20 minutes of the first campaign. I am a stickler for playing games that are not making angry, which this one did.There are probably redeeming qualities as I like most of the games Kalypso produces, but I couldn't find one.Would not recommend and probably not play again. 2/10 "

												I like this game generally. Its a fantastic concept. For those who are interested in Airline Management, it will be fun. Its a great time passer. The Graphics are good too.The sad thing about this game is that it had alot of potential to be fantasic. I think they should have included, or maybe if there is ever a Airline Tycoon 3, airports such as Amsterdam, Warsaw, Jakarta and Helsinki should have been included. Also maybe Tel Eviv, Riyadah, Melbourne, Brisbane and Suva. Also, I think it would be great if you were able to customize the logos, uniform and more indepth customization of aircraft. You should also be able to create your airline name and should be able to customize the characters, or create them. There should be more characters. Airline cleaners should be included in the game, and you should have some kind of control over the check in and ground staff too. Should be able to have control over the gate, and have more than one gate as there may be more than one aircraft departing from an airport from the same airline at a time. Office Branches would be good, unless you can already do that, I have not tried it. The routes should be more flexible and also be able to have layovers, connections ect as a flight from eg: New York to Perth Australia direct is unrealistic and stupid. I think the food catering aspect could be more detailed too.This game is loosly a good game, but it could be so much better. I really do hope there is a third sequel. "

												1/5. :(The game's introductory ""how to play Airline Tycoon 2"" learning scenario isn't as good as other major sim games. Once I finished the tutorial and headed out on my own, I was a little annoyed and frustrated: As far as sim games go, I'm used to more intuitive interfaces. Plus the ""Barbie"" aspect of painting my plane was dull. I expected far more colours, logos, etc.There's a reason I only clocked a total of 2 hours on this. If you learned to handle the flight scheduling interface, then you might enjoy it. I wasn't able to figure it out in the short and impatient hour that I gave it before abandoning it for Cities XL.

A bit more variety in the characters would be nice, as would some way to mod them too, but it was cheap, so you get what you pay for.			"

It's a boring and desperate attempt to recreate the glory of it's predecessor.I'd like to burn this from my steam library, and I'd rather have a toothless goat trying to bite off my private parts than playing this game ever again.Oh, and btw.- two of the Airlines/Managers from the first game as overprized dlc is quite a bad joke.

More airports (including the one five miles from my house in the suburbs of Seattle!), a deceptively deep plane customization system, and a good bit of the charm of the first game carried over in the cartoony graphics.Buuuut...there's simply not enough here to recommend it for the price they're asking, and the DLC is downright exploitive (no shock from publisher Kalypso, which pulls the same crap with every other game they publish---Tropico 4 and 5, looking at you.)  If you can get it on sale for dirt cheap (like, 80% off/under $4 US) cheap, then _maybe_, but really, even then there are just too many other, better games, including this game's own predecessor, available on Steam.It's a 5 on its own merits, with a two-point penalty for the poor value for the price.3/10			"

												The first ""Airline Tycoon"" was an amazing Sim that was captivating, being comical in it's presentation and serious in it's ambition. This game shares the title, and that is it. It's a boring and desperate attempt to recreate the glory of it's predecessor.I'd like to burn this from my steam library, and I'd rather have a toothless goat trying to bite off my private parts than playing this game ever again.Oh, and btw.- two of the Airlines/Managers from the first game as overprized dlc is quite a bad joke.

												There's a lot to like here for fans of the first game.  More airports (including the one five miles from my house in the suburbs of Seattle!), a deceptively deep plane customization system, and a good bit of the charm of the first game carried over in the cartoony graphics.Buuuut...there's simply not enough here to recommend it for the price they're asking, and the DLC is downright exploitive (no shock from publisher Kalypso, which pulls the same crap with every other game they publish---Tropico 4 and 5, looking at you.)  If you can get it on sale for dirt cheap (like, 80% off/under $4 US) cheap, then _maybe_, but really, even then there are just too many other, better games, including this game's own predecessor, available on Steam.It's a 5 on its own merits, with a two-point penalty for the poor value for the price.3/10			"

												So this was like $8 and is kind of a neat tycoon game, but you don't really do much in it.  I want a game like this where you also fly the planes or something.  I got to this game because FTL left me wanting a meta-game on top of it, and this just made me want to play something like FTL.  So what I'm saying is, this is a good point and click business management game, but there's not really any part where there's a game that you play.			"

												They manage to take a fairly dull and mostly awful game and then wrap it up in one of the worst user interfaces I've ever seen. Then they charge far too much for it.  It just isn't a great deal of fun. I would say if you're even remotely tempted, you should wait until the game is AT LEAST on an 80% special.			"

												To start, I haven't read any other reviews on this game. I have played it and tried hard to like it. I just can't. I wanted to enjoy playing Airline Tycoon 2 so much, but it was a swing and a miss. The Freemode is lackluster which is what you play after beating the rest a few times over. Free mode should offer a challenge that varies game by game based on the AI... The game is pretty much a rinse and repeat of 1 of 2 strategy choices.1) Buy a brand new, reliable plane, keep chugging along and slowly take over your enemies knowing you have your reliable horse to carry you along as you buy more of the same one. Slowly climbing the same ladder with no risk.2) Buy from the junk yard. Find incredible deals and eliminate everyone insta-fast with no real difficulty or risks.The game doesn't play out any differently. I wish there would be more to routes and business decisions. Being able to have a ton of departures from one airport in the exact same moment as well.... c'mon, really? Didn't they have that RIGHT in the first game with finite gate space?Imagine your airline starting at a very small FBO with small operations and as your airline grows, invest your revenue into your airport as well, slowly growing it up and butting up against more more competition, with decision making AI. That's what you'd hope for in the modern sequal to such a great game. Again, swing and total miss. It's the re-hash of the first game with elements removed. Cargo is a purchased add-on which does little more than offer a way for you to make money even faster.If you're looking for a fun, tycoon game that challenges you even a little bit to try new things, this isn't it. I'm hoping there is a 3, and I'm hoping they try, instead of beating a dead horse that by luck, spat up some money.			"

												As veteran player from the first game the first jolt is the horrendous character designs that make you think some coder thought it would be funny to leave Big Head mode on by default.The user interface can be used after enough reading of the tool tips and playing the tutorial (what passes as one) a few times, but it takes a level of patience that gets hard to justify after the first 15 min of gameplay.Planes or the lack there of are a particular sore spot with me as I was a massive fan of the HiTech AKA design your own plane feature from the original game. You can change out parts but its sometimes hard to tell if that super expensive new wing design is worth the price tag as you don't see much in the way of radical stat changes. Passenger capacity can be changed but even in the largest plane you'll feel like there should be more seats.All of this is topped off by the fact that the planes are not surprisingly hyper cartoony with closer relations to the Stay Puff marshmellow man of Ghostbusters fame, the Michelin man, or a Airbus Beluga. You stop caring early on about paint jobs and logos because of this.Another major gameplay issue is hiring staff feels like a massive chore rather then a quick formality as you have to assign  manually all your staff and if you want a fully staffed plane its at least a 2 day ordeal because only a handful of staff ever apply at one time.Moving around the airport is at least simular to the old game to a point but you'll be using the hot keys to skip all the walking in short order, as the layout of the airport can be hard to follow because for example the used plane dealer (junkyard in this case) is simply a tiny door in the back of the new plane retailers shop.The sole good things that I have found in this game are in making routes you can set aside time for maintenance and I found some of the characters at least somewhat entertaining namely the tutorial guy with some of this references and the Airport Manager who is literally the Godfather.Even with a steep Steam sale 80-90% off this game just isn't worth the time, money, or hard drive space especially when you can get the original game on Steam as well likely for less to boot.

												Never played the first one, but this is awful. It puts so much in the way of actually playing the game with an avatar you have to move around a building for a management game (and the hotkeys are hidden behind something you have to buy), none of the game mechanics make sense (staff fatigue, but you can't roster them, airplane parts are ALWAYS an upgrade on every stat if you buy the more expensive one). If you got it in a bundle, don't bother installing it, and definitely don't buy it.			"

The 3D world whilst may improve graphical appearance increases the time trying to find places (if you prefer not to use the Guide method). Uninstall is coming right up for this one unfortunately.

												As veteran player from the first game the first jolt is the horrendous character designs that make you think some coder thought it would be funny to leave Big Head mode on by default.The user interface can be used after enough reading of the tool tips and playing the tutorial (what passes as one) a few times, but it takes a level of patience that gets hard to justify after the first 15 min of gameplay.Planes or the lack there of are a particular sore spot with me as I was a massive fan of the HiTech AKA design your own plane feature from the original game. You can change out parts but its sometimes hard to tell if that super expensive new wing design is worth the price tag as you don't see much in the way of radical stat changes. Passenger capacity can be changed but even in the largest plane you'll feel like there should be more seats.All of this is topped off by the fact that the planes are not surprisingly hyper cartoony with closer relations to the Stay Puff marshmellow man of Ghostbusters fame, the Michelin man, or a Airbus Beluga. You stop caring early on about paint jobs and logos because of this.Another major gameplay issue is hiring staff feels like a massive chore rather then a quick formality as you have to assign  manually all your staff and if you want a fully staffed plane its at least a 2 day ordeal because only a handful of staff ever apply at one time.Moving around the airport is at least simular to the old game to a point but you'll be using the hot keys to skip all the walking in short order, as the layout of the airport can be hard to follow because for example the used plane dealer (junkyard in this case) is simply a tiny door in the back of the new plane retailers shop.The sole good things that I have found in this game are in making routes you can set aside time for maintenance and I found some of the characters at least somewhat entertaining namely the tutorial guy with some of this references and the Airport Manager who is literally the Godfather.Even with a steep Steam sale 80-90% off this game just isn't worth the time, money, or hard drive space especially when you can get the original game on Steam as well likely for less to boot.

												Terrible game, terrible, clunky UI. Awful characters with cringeworthy lines, dialoge, and voice acting. Pass on this garbage.			"

												It was funny for some hours. But the user interfaces are horrible, it's a click-orgy. And there is not much more than interfaces.			"

												Although I have not spent much time with the game, the first few missions were enough for me to realize that I will not enjoy this game.I am sure it has a target audience that it appeals to, and can see that some may enjoy its simplistic and cartoon-like nature.However the game seems to offer very limited content in terms of what you can do as an Airline Tycoon. The basics of the game boils down to choosing from pre-designed planes, fitting them with pre-designed interior, staffing them and then setting up flight schedules.The majority of the game is spent speeding up time waiting for your flights to occur and then assessing them afterwards. Although the game has potential, it does not have much depth or challenge. I got bored with it quite quickly.The general look and feel of the game might appeal to a younger audience, which can be tied in with its simplistic gameplay.Personally I think elements like managing the airport itself, designing runways, managing flights etc would have been more interesting.

												Summary : Terrible (0.36/5 STARS)Hello I am a review writer NoScopeConfirmed and heres my review of Airline Tycoon 2AIRLINE TYCOON 2 :A rather easy game to download, at 1.3 GB who knew a steam game could be that small in size.But heres why it is low rated stars, First of all the advertizing is false it suggests its a Fun and New game. That is just rubbish, This game is terrible all you ever do is spend years looking around for things to do, I was stuck on the first leval 50/80 % frankfurt thingy and i didnt know what it meant. This game is hard to understand and anything but fun. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEYPrice : NOT WORTH ITGame: BoringGraphics: Better then expected.Owner of game: People that own this game have made some successful games but this one is terrible.3rd Party: YES-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

												I have tried several times to get into this game. It's not intuitive at all. I thought it would be like Rollercoaster Tycoon, but alas, it was not. I spent most of the time trying to build airplane interiors since that was basically all that I could do until I saved up enough cash to add more routes... which took a painfully long time.			"

												All that needed to be done was to create a basic sim with an airline theme. Clean slate, simple menu. Instead, this game has a choice between objectives and freeform. I didn't bother with objectives. Freeform, however, is a misleading title for the game mode. It's anything but. The menus are clunky, the graphics are overly stylized, the voice acting is contrived, and the list goes on.I really can't think of anything positive to say about this game, other than being inexpensive.
