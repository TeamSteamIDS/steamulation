												Space Hulk is a game about how terrible it would be if you and all your friends were the size of refridgerators, and you all lived in a house made of hallways so you had to walk everywhere single file, and the house contained an unlimited amount of aliens that wanted to kill you.Space Hulk is a turn based strategy game that seems to be a pretty faithul digital recreation of the Games Workshop boardgame, transparency included (You can see the results of all dice rolls).  Throughout the game, you lead a squad (sometimes 2) of Blood Angel Terminators through a space hulk, which seems to be a ton of spaceships that have fused together in ridiculous ways.  You're given a different objectve in every mission and as you attempt to fulfill it, Tyranid Genestealers spawn from multiple spawn points in an attempt to overwhelm your squad. In order to complete your mission, you have to take and hold positions against the Genestealers and accomplish the objective, quietly hoping you never have to assault through them.At the beginning of each mission, you're given somewhere between 2-12 Terminators, each with their own equipment and abilities, and an objective to fulfill.  Each Terminator gets 4 action points at the start of a turn, and the whole squad shares a pool of 1-6 extra points called ""Command Points"", which allows Terminators to perform actions outside of their allotted 4 points.  You'll move your Terminators through the narrow corridors, carefully stacking them in formation, always being wary of lines of sight and lanes of approach to reach whatever your objective maybe.This is a game about positioning, planning, and risk management.  With the exception of a couple of missions, you'll never be able to kill all the genestealers, they simply keep coming and coming until you accomplish your objective and/or all of your troops are dead.  So, you have to establish a good defensive position, preferably with long lines of sight.  Overwatch is the most powerful ability in the game, and one that allows you to shoot at all approaching enemies as long as your bolter doesn't jam (On each shot, you roll two dice, and any time you roll doubles your bolter jams).  This allows you to dominate corridors, though a Genestealer can still slip past if your roll low enough consistently. Sometimes, the most tempting positions are ones that are only a few squares long, and you have to decide if the risk of only having a few squares to shoot at is worth sparing only one Terminator for that position.  If the overwatch fails, you could find yourself overrun.  Or, you can use 2 Terminators to guard 2 longer corridors, removing one from use in another portion of the map.It's a fun game, and the dependence on luck makes it incredibly tense.  Granted, you can mitigate risk, but you'll never be able to remove it completely.  My understanding of the game is that its relsease was filled with all sort of weird glitches and problems, but I haven't encountered a single one yet. I haven't had a chance to try mutliplayer yet, so I can't comment on that.If you're a fan of careful, deliberate, tense strategy, I highly recommend this.  I'm nearly done with the main campaign and enjoyed every minute of it, and I'm looking forward to moving on to the DLC.What I paid for it: 10 dollarsWhat I would pay for it: 25 dollars.For context, I know very little about WH40K and didn't even know the board game existed until playing this.  All of the above impressions were based on playing on Normal.			"

												First, let me make something very clear that every other review has probably done already: This is NOT like Xcom. This is, quite literally, a digital version of the classic board-game of the same name, which was made by the lovely chaps at Games Workshop ages ago. What does that mean for you?- It means NO customization. Units come equipped ""as is"". That's it.- ""Slower"" gameplay (Tactical Dreadnaught Armour is heavy). Game speed can be adjusted to make it play faster, however.-  An emphasis on what limited resource actions you have, and doing what you can with them. Thus adding to the general ""survival"" aspect of the game, which is very fun actually.- Unlike Xcom, this is a straight up, old-school ranged (marines) VS. melee (aliens) fight. You CAN go into melee and hope the Emperor grants you favor in such dire situations. However, your xenos enemies are masters of close combat and generally win the trade off, even against your own melee specialists. But again, it's quite fun to try and succeed at it.- No health bars. You either survive an attack, or you don't. This makes games faster and more direct, which is a good thing since health bars would make each game last longer than it should.- Unlike Xcom, you have very limited combat actions. No elevation bonus, can't climb ladders, etc.. Just you, the flat surface, and the xenos filth before you. Fire away and hope it works!All of this makes Space Hulk a very good game actually, just for different reasons. However, people jumping into this title thinking it's another Xcom clone will become sad pandas very quickly. This is NOT even close to Xcom's depth.However once more, people who want a ""simpler"" turn based game LIKE Xcom that they can just hop into, without all the freaking variables and near-endless, headache-inducing customization and combat will indeed enjoy this title. Always remember that this is essentially a digital version of the board game, and not much more at all. Simple as that. But it is beautiful in its simplicity, as you'll soon find.Honestly? A solid title. Full Control set out to make a PC version of the board game point-for-point, and succeeded near flawlessly. It's not Xcom, but it wasn't trying to be anyway. It's just itself. And that is indeed good enough. Maybe not for everyone, but then again Xcom isn't for everyone either.If you wish for a more Xcom-like version of this title, Space Hulk: Ascension is more like what we all kinda hoped for in the first place, and is currently available through Steam as well. However, it currently lacks multi-player.Overall: 4/5. Better graphics/models and voice acting would have been great for this little gem, but I'm not complaining.-Thanks for reading and I hope it helped you with your decision. :3~Mystyx~			"

												This isn't a game for everyone, and I'll tell you why: It's slow. It's dice-based. It's a bit rough around the edges. And it's a very tactical game. If you're looking for quick action with lots of violence, I suggest you check out Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine instead. Still reading? Good. This game is a recreation of the original board game, including all of the messy dice rolls. Genestealers are very, very powerful. Your bolter jams when you don't want it to. Close combat is probably going to kill you. If you're expecting real-time combat with refined battle mechanics, you won't find it here. This is the pure tabletop experience. The game is a little rough around the edges in places. The graphics can be a little weird, and there are a few problems with the ""undo"" button. If you are willing to look past these problems and are willing to put up with lots of dice rolling, then this game is an excellent choice.			"

												Ignore the Metacritic score. This game was released something like a week before it should have been, and by the end of that first week almost every major bug and UI issue had been resolved. If they had just taken the time to release this one week later it would have probably gained another 20 points just from the bugs being fixed.As for how the actual game is... It is literally the board game! Only you can own it for less than $100 and play it online with friends, or in Hotseat mode (which has been improved since launch also). It is such a shame the critical reception of this panned it so hard, because it is really a great little game. Anyone who enjoys board games and / or the claustrophobic setting of a bereft starship adrift in the cosmos, filled to the brim with an unrelenting race of alien murder machines, should buy this game.

												Even though I  am a dire-hard 40k fan, I have to say, this is prrrrrrobably not worth it's full current price. That's not to say the game is bad. But, like certain foods, it has to be consumed in a certain way. Namely, that way is to occasionally play a mission, but never more than one at a time. That is the optimum way to play this game in my opinion.Other than that, think of it as a sort of low-tech XCOM in terms of the combat. It's based on a system of action points for moving and shooting and overwatching and guarding. Generally a must have for any 40k fan as supporting 40k games can only encourage more of them, right? On the whole i'd give this game a 6.8. It's not unenjoyable, it's actually fairly enjoyable, but it's not a binge-play, you should only play one mission a day.			"

												First things first, it has to be said that there has been furor and controversy over this title, and I feel it important to state something clearly. This IS Space Hulk, if you played the board game years ago you will ADORE this game, it's a massive dose of nostalgia in modern format where the termies even fall over like you toppled the piece and the fact you can jam 3 times in a row, then get mauled to death even though you have a lightning claw is both perfectly feasible and horribly likely at the critical moment. That's honestly what MADE the original board game, and this has been kept as true to canon as possibly COULD be in a video game release.This is a title for all of you out there who had the board game and lost it, just want to play long distance with a friend (co-op now included btw, awesomesauce) or who those of you who have the board game already, 200,000 points of army for your favourite chapter and just about every game ever released with the 40K banner on it. Fanboys will want this, just because.However, I also feel a whole new generation of gamers out there, especially those of you who already dig the indie vibe and don't expect AAA UIs as long as the game itself plays well, are also in for a treat. This game, back in the day *points at apartment block and mutters something about fields* pretty much defined a generation of gamers, and we're the ones making the games you play now, so give a moment of your time and you will likely be pleasantly surprised by the tension, frustration and pure gaming experience this title has to offer.The game is limited, yes. Of course it is, because it IS a board game. To call this a legitimate criticism would be like saying an online game of monopoly should have more realistic money and offer experience upgrades to your character so as to improve your chances of landing on certain tiles....that wouldn't be monopoly then, would it, and complaints would arise I have no doubt. Don't expect a video game reimagining of a board game, if you want that then go for Space Hulk - Ascension instead, there you will find a PC game retelling of an old classic. If you like to immerse yourself in the classics themselves, then buy this game.			"

												A pure adaption of the boardgame classic, Space Hulk comes with all you may be used to playing with on the tabletop, with none of the setup troubles, boxing the tiles and pieces after a long and tense session. It comes with an online multiplayer mode, which allows you to take the missions to the internet and test your wit against friends too far away to come over to sit around the table with you!Full Control Studios are, without a doubt, fans of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, and Space Hulk in particular. Despite the bumpy launch the game had, their dedication to the project shows. Space Hulk is a turn-based strategy game involving two factions - the Space Marine Terminators and the alien Genestealers.Both sides play vastly differently - from the amount of actions a unit can take per turn, to how it achieves its goals. The Terminators are slow, hulking figures who rely on ranged weaponry, area denial and re-rolls to fight the Xenos, while the Genestealers are numerous, fast and require to close the distance to attack a Marine with their diamond-claws. They can easily outmaneuver the opponent, and receive reinforcements every turn.To make things worse, the number of dice a normal Marine rolls against the 'stealers, is limited to one, against the aliens' three, and the highest result wins the combat - and kills the enemy. There are no life points in this game - if a character gets wounded, he is considered dead for the rest of the game. To balance this out, the Space Marine player receives 1 to 6 Command Points per turn, determined by (virtual) dice. Those can be used to enact additional actions beyond the 4 allowed action points of a Terminator. Even though limited and unreliable, these points, if used well, will offer a lot of tactical flexibility to the player.The inherent strength of the Terminators lies in their weaponry - their Storm Bolters are deadly and their close combat specialists allow them to deny the Genestealers the highest of their rolls or to re-roll one of their own. The flamer can bathe a whole room or section in fire, easily burning the aliens to ashes if stepped in, denying whole parts of the map. However, its use is limited to 6 shots per mission! The assault cannon is equally limited to 20 shots, and acts like a much stronger Storm Bolter.Overwatch, costing 2 action points, will ensure that your Marines will also shoot on any enemy that crosses into line of sight, or moves within it, giving you an advantage over the enemy's fast tactics.The objectives are determined by the mission. They may range from simple kill count goals to evacuating a certain amount of squad members. All the main missions are adapted from the boardgame.Yes, Space Hulk had its share of problems at launch, and probably still has some of them, but more than a few can be attributed to just how close this video game adaption is to the boardgame it was meant to represent. Bugs and performance issues have been significantly reduced by now, the game runs smooth, and a new, albeit short, campaign has been added to the game for free.A criticism that was brought up a lot at launch was the ""sluggish"" movement of the player's Terminators. While personally I very much enjoyed the hulking Space Marines move through the corridors like that, I can understand that not everybody has the same attention span and some may like to move on more quickly (although, once an order is issued, you can move ahead and issue another to the next Terminator of your choosing - they will enact them simultaneously).Since then the developers have introduced a new setting to the options menu, allowing the player to toggle the animation speed, resulting in a good boost in unit movements.Another criticism leveled was the lack of satisfying squad customization - one I can understand, but not feel quite as strongly about.The characters in the game are directly inspired by the 3rd edition boardgame set, released in 2009, which I own. Having invested a lot of time in painting the miniatures of Sergeants Gideon and Lorenzo, Brothers Claudio, Zael, Omnio and all the rest, I can attest that the ingame models are very much like those little plastic figures. They are so faithfully modeled, I felt a bit sad that the boardgame miniatures are stuck with static (though dynamic) poses.Customizing a squad's loadout also would not work with the way the missions are written. The game presents you with a short mission context and your objectives, all presented via Terminator-like voice acting (though not of the high standard of Relic's Dawn of War II games, it is still suitably grim), a neatly animated map and iconography.What new players may not realize, however, is that the missions, have been written with certain restrictions and loadouts in mind. There are no differences between individual Terminators apart from their equipment - changing any one of the Power Fist + Storm Bolter Terminators to another Flamer, an Assault Cannon or close combat gear would undoubtedly unbalance the missions and remove a big part of the challenge.Space Hulk is a challenging game. Some people, myself included, would even go as far as to call it a strategic puzzle game. Knowing your pieces is vital to success, being aware of all entry points of the enemy's Genestealers is crucial. A wrong move can easily unravel your whole deployment, and turn your structured progress into a desperate run for the exit.The randomness of the dice adds a layer of unpredictability, but similar to Blood Bowl, minimizing the risks of the dice and thinking your moves through is the key to success. A dice roll may turn sour, but there are certain contingencies to make up for the randomness, if the player is smart enough to use them. In addition, the game itself takes care of all the manual tasks and notetaking of the tabletop version, keeping you informed of your resources at all times.The learning curve may be a bit steep for some players, I admit, but unlike the boardgame, the video game adaption offers three short tutorial missions, which should do a lot of good in making you aware of the key strokes of the game.Thankfully for new players, the 2 minute timer the Terminator player is subject to in the boardgame (unless the players decide not to use it to add even more pressure to the Space Marine's shoulders) is turned off by default and not enforced in singleplayer games. Purists can still play the game on hard difficulty and use the timer, but I am glad they made this optional.The level editor is still in the making, I'm afraid.If the current 18 missions (three tutorial missions, 12 for the classic Sin of Damnation Campaign and the 3 new missions on board of the Messenger of Purgatory) aren't enough to sate your appetite (which is unlikely, as missions are very replayable and usually not beaten on your first try), there are two new DLC Campaigns available right now (Sword of Halcyon and Defilement of Honour), both of which feature a set 5 missions each and are directly inspired from old first and second edition rules of the boardgame.Squad customization may or may not be added in the future, but first I assume there will be the teased and promised Chapter Packs, introducing more than just the Blood Angels to the game - all neatly modeled according to lore and current miniature kits. Full Control have also said that they would include those Chapter Packs with new, Chapter-unique (historical) campaigns and flavor. This is DLC I can get behind and will support.Considering that the first priority for Full Control was using the license to recreate the 3rd edition box set of Space Hulk, which was only produced in very limited quantities back then to begin with, I can acknowledge that they did an incredible job at capturing the game's aesthetic, tone, sound and, obviously, the rules.This is, without a doubt, Space Hulk.For the Emperor!

												I qualify this review in that I don't recommend it for the general masses. If you're a fan of the original Space Hulk board game or you're a fan of Warhammer 40k in general, then I would recommend buying it when it's on sale- $30 is far too much for what's offered here.Space Hulk is pretty much a 1:1 reproduction of the Space Hulk board game, but with a few extra bells and whistles attached. The animations are well done, the voice acting is adequate and the atmosphere of the game translates well. The campaign is interesting and offers a great number of varying objectives aside from 'kill all the Genestealers', but it would have been more interesting to offer a Genestealer campaign alongside the Space Marine campaign.My issues with it are that even with the varying objectives in the campaign, playing against the AI feels a little hollow as compared to the multiplayer experience. The AI can't substitute for a real opponent, as to be expected with board game translations, so it doesn't feel like the AI is really adapting to your strategies as much as an actual opponent would.Overall though my biggest issue is that this game has a $30 price tag. It is definitely not worth that; though they have a few campaigns to offer, it still doesn't feel like enough to justify the price tag. Plus, all of the maps look the same aside from layout; there's a lot of blank space, and it feels wasted as opposed to claustrophobic as the developers intended.			"

												Its not a terrible game, I got quite a few hours of enjoyment out of it, but it is horribly flawed as computer games go. I understand that is a straight conversion of a board game and it suffers from the limitations imposed by that. I played it right through to the end, and its the end that ultimately tips this over into a ""can't recommend"". Quick list of pros and cons:Pros: I enjoyed the tactical challenge of planning your best route to the objective,  working out where to place your terminators for maximum advantage and how to get to the objective asap without being eaten.There were some good missions fighting a tactical retreat to an extraction point. Flamer throwers - you only get six shots but they are a great tactical unit and actually kill what you aim at (most of the time).Cons:If you try to shoot something with the standard bolter you will almost certainly miss unless you are using a chaingun. You only get 4 actions points, you will probably miss every time because genestealers can... duck. I'm guessing the Terminators can't aim lower than a 90 degree angle in those mechanical suits or something. That doesn't explain their inability to hits doors though. Those doors are tricksy buggers.Chainguns are more likely to hit something, but you only get 10 shots and then you have to reload. If you reload there is a chance your terminator will explode. Yes really.  Wtf. These guys have been fighting for 9000 years and have not managed to design a gun that you can change ammo in without blowing up.Standard bolter guns don't need reloading. They jam instead. I think that they don't need reloading because the Terminator using it is always going to be dead before he runs out of bullets due to his face being eaten while he tries to clear the jam.Recognising that your standard Terminators can't shoot doors or anything lower than waist height, the braintanks invented a unit with spikey gloves. This guy presumably shot his instructor in basic training and was banned from using guns ever again. Genestealers are close combat enemies, they jump on you, they eat your face. Mr Spikey Gloves is just there to die, tactically speaking he can be thrown out to slow down a genestealer for 1 action point while it digests his nose.Your squad members have names, but there is no continuity between missions. If they die, they are still there in the next mission, or you might be told that people you carefully preserved were lost in the fight. There is no squad development, they never improve. I kept everyone alive (even Mr Spikey Gloves) through all the missions but the plot didn't recognise this.   The best missions were ones where you have to reach an objective and then fight a retreat to an extraction point. Too many missions were instantly complete when an objective was met. There was no incentive to plan beyond guy A getting to position X. The whole squad could be on the point of being eaten with zero probability of survival but as long as someone got to position X it was mission complete with 5 out of 5 survivors. Sometimes you had to complete a mission with at least 3 terminators getting to an extraction point, and the game would end as soon as 3 were safe. I want to try to rescue all 5, not have the game decide its mission over because  3 got out.There is no tension - I had Space Hulk on my old Amiga, it was a tense scary game, turning a corner was trouser changing event.  This game never takes you by surprise, every enemy is faithfully revealed on the map either as a unit or a blip that could be 1 - 3 units. You know where they are even if you can't kill them.The ending - this is what really tipped this over into a thumbs down. The end left a really sour taste in my mouth. I thought it was a bug. I finished the 3rd mission of the 3rd ""campaign"" and instead of the next mission or campaign unlocking, I could only go to the menu. I replayed the mission hoping it was a one off unlock bug, but no, everything still locked. Looked it up on google, and it turns out that was it, game over unless you buy the DLC. The game is SHORT. I played the game, restarting every mission where I lost a man. If I hadn't done that, and there was no reason to, I could have finished the game in a weekend easily. As far as level design goes, there is no excuse for the developers to put together such a short package. The designs are simple and a computer could happily randomly generate them. I can only think that the the voice over guy giving the mission briefing broke their budget.Space Hulk Ascension sounds like it deals with most of the above points, I'll probably buy that if it comes out cheap in a sale.

												Get Ascension.  Its this game with alot more options.  They made fools of the backers by releasing the true version of this game as a sequal, instead of updating this.  As a result all the backers got a stripped down version of the game and they wanted everyone to rebuy the same thing for the extra features.

												I really .. REALLY .. wanted to like this game. The original Space Hulk was the game that first brought me into the whole warhammer 40k world (that and the original role playing / skirmish rules). An insane future and hugely rich storyline.But this game unfortunatley does not build upon any of that wonderful background.It may be an honourable reworking of the original boardgame rules, but when you have so much more power and potential at your disposal simply trying to emulate a boardgame seems like a real waste of opportunity. Problems :The basic gui and interface is somewhat confuzing and I've often found myself wasting crucial movement / action points on needless turn arounds and minor positioning and placement. When it's really life and death between each round these positioning issues become very anoying. Some may say the game punishes you for being unattentive, but I kind of feel the game punishes you for not being pixel perfect in all your clicking.The ammo for heavy weapons also is never enough and often I've found myself much rather having a standard trooper with a storm bolter then an assault canon (since bolters don't run out of ammo).That said, bloody hell for all their high tech guns these guys use they sure friggen JAM a lot !!I've had some missions end in minutes because every gun jammed everytime it was used.I realise this is just rolling doubles, but I've played a lot of role playing games and rolled a LOT of dice in my time, and I don't ever recall rolling that many doubles !! Seriously programming guys, can you check your randomizers in your code 'cause I think you've forgotten to remove a rem statement or two.A one on one battle between a marine and a stealer pretty much results in the loss of your trooper. Having a guy survive an attack is exhilerating but often short lived as usually in the very next round their gun jams and they die anyway. I totally except this as the gene stealers are meant to be hugely deadly (read their description .. it's horrific), however their overall depiction in the game is more chibba-manga rather then 'holy crap this thing made my toughest guy crap his pants'.They need to be made bigger and scarier, as from the overall look of the graphics it looks more like the marines should be wiping the slate with the dudes rather then this being a knife edge battle. Maybe too much time was spent animating the marines and too little on the stealers. The space hulk graphics look great, but there is zero interaction with anything. This is an example of my 'missed opportunity' anoyance from above. Why not drop some fun extra's around the map and allow the marines to interact with the environment. As it stands the overall look at feel could be totally replaced by the tactical map as everything you see pretty much means nothing anyway. Lastly some of the missions could be aimed more on holding key points and just having fun blasting wave after wave of stealers rather then pushing forward constantly. A real strength in the game should be your marines, but you never really get a chance to use their abilities as your constantly on the backfoot no matter what. Why not drop in a couple fun rounds which just play on the 'theme' rather then being totally based on the 'strategy'.Good bits :Killing wave after wave of stealers during those few instances when the guns aren't jamming. That never gets old.Marines .. look .. AWESOMEWinning is rewarding.It should be made much clearer that your not only trying to beat the stealers but also fate itself as the dice play a critical part in the overall outcome of the game. Beating BOTH of these is awesome and keeps the game flowing.Overall I think the metacritic score is harsh, but it is also fair.This game will not appeal to everyone, and is actually a very stark introduction to the 40k universe.It should have been more accomodating to new players and contain more of the huge and awesome background of the 40k universe. This to me is a huge oversite. The gameplay is very linear yet still brutal against even minor positioning errors. In that light it's just not something I can see someone who isn't buried in the 40k world would be able to pick up and play.Recommended, but only to those who are familiar with the 40k world and who will appreciate the time and effort that's gone into this game. It's a game made for them. But for anyone else I can totally understand if they just don't 'get it'.			"

01. GENRE: A Strategy, Sci-fi, Boardgame adaptation.02. SETTING: A faithful recreation of the Games Workshop boardgame of the same name set in the Warhammer 40k universe.  Two mortal enemies fight to the death on maps that represent floating space hulks; Humanity's defenders - the Space Marines against the vicious alien horde - the Genestealer.03. STORY/BACKGROUND: In the far future Humanity has reached and conquered the stars.  An immortal god-like emperor rules over the vast expanse of human empire that fills the galaxy.  Alas there is no peace only war.  Numerous alien species fight against each other for dominance and survival.  Among these are the Genestealers, alien swarms that use the bodies of other species to procreate their numbers.  These parasites move from planet to planet on the captured spacesships of other races.  They spread their numbers by traversing the cosmos over 100s & 1000s of years until they are pulled in by the gravity-wells of unfortuate planets on the same flightpath.  These spaceships house tens of thousands of aliens.  Once detected a chapter of space marines are sent to combat the threat. Space Marines are the genetically enhanced super-soldiers of the emperor, who don the toughest ""Terminator"" armor and most destructive weapons known to man, in order to stand a chance against such overwhelming numbers.  They are the thin line that protects humanity.04. GAME MODES: The base game contains two singleplayer campaigns totalling 12 missions, each of which can be replayed in multiplayer.  Additional dlcs provide 5 mini-campaigns of 21 more missions.05. GAMEPLAY: Consists of tactical, squad, turn-based combat.  One or more squads of five space marines are deployed on missions to complete one or more objectives.  Action takes place using IGO-UGO alternating turns.  Players issue orders up to the actions points available for each unit.  Actions include: movement, shoot, melee attack, psyhic powers, placing marines in overwatch or defensive stance and interacting with doors or mission objects.   Missions are not linked so losing marines does not affect starting positions in the next mission.  (The spin-off sequel does that.)06. MECHANICS: All combat successes are determined by die rolls.  Squad leaders provide additional action points through a pool of Command Points which can be used to give any marines to augment their actions in a given turn.  Though generated at the start of every turn, if a squad leader is still alive they can attempt to re-roll how many command points available at the start of a turn.  Understanding Command Points is essential to beating the game as they are needed during the enemy's turn as marine weapons can jam as they are used.  If they do Genestealers can overwhelm the affected soldier and kill him easily.  Marines must be given the overwatch or defensive stance commands during the players turn in order to re-act during the A.Is turn.07. A.I: Overall the A.I performs adequately.  Though there does not need to be anything too clever to control the enemy aliens as they spawn from fixed locations. All the A.I has to do is close in for the kill and overwhelm the player.  However the challenge presented is manifest by the limitation on Space Marine movement and actions.  More often than not a marine not in overwatch, defensive stance or with a jammed weapon will die.08. GRAPHICS: Isometric Fixed/Rotateable 3D, with short action-oriented cutscenes.  Space Marine units are well modelled and distinct.  The maps and genestealers do look the same however.09. CONTROLS: Keyboard and/or mouse.  Good and functional.  All actions can be performed by point & click.10. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Suitable. Together the add to the overall ambience of the setting. Weapons fire and death cries (from both sides) add to the immersion.11. VOICE ACTING: The voice-overs provided for the space marines add to the immersion.  You can imagine mission briefings being given by a suitably stiff, no nonense genetically enhanced super-soldier from the future.  Voice excerpts of marines confirming your orders or during the heat of combat give that feeling that they are human and part of a team.12. DIFFICULTY: Game played on normal difficulty.  Overall the missions are fairly straightforward but making a mistake is unforgiving.  Harder mode does not allow saving, unless you quit the game & continue later during a turn.  Enemies spawns may have been larger or more frequent but I did not notice that much of a difference.  An easy option is available but I did not play this.13. PLAYTIME: The base game has around 20+ hours worth of gaming if you play through the main campaigns and the other dlc mini-campaigns.  This can be extended by replaying missions on other difficulties or in multiplayer.  Getting all the in game achievements took me 55hrs but it could take double that and more.14. PROBLEMS: No problems stability or otherwise were encountered during my playthrough.15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Most achievements are given for completing missions from the main campaigns. Some are given by completing combat feats using space marines armed with certain weapons.  All but one achievement can be gained through one playthrough of the main campaigns.  A few others may require playing through the campaign missions repeated or better still playing through the dlc missions.  If you fail to gain any achievements you can replay missions that you have beaten at any time.16. DLC: The DLC on release were expensive but on a sale should be a fairly resonable price.  The optional genestealer skins are not required, the Space Wolves chapter replaces the standard space marine units with different soldiers and models providing a totally different experience than in the base game.  This is optional but a must have if you wish to replay the game as much as possible.  The dlc campaigns however are a must if you want to play more of the same, if harder missions.17. APPEAL: Will appeal to fans of the franchise or original boardgame.  It will also appeal to strategy gamers or grognards who are looking for something a little different in tactical turn-based sub-genre.18. ENJOYMENT: Very enjoyable if you liked the Space Hulk boardgame given its such a faithful adaptation.  Also enjoyable if you dont mind a challenge and dont mind losing against a pretty competant A.I, or if you like short tactical games where the options are limited and missions fairly repetitive.19. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: Limited though with dlc less so.  Each mission has been designed to be replayable but fixed objectives and maps mean that only the genestealer spawns and attack routes may change.  Otherwise only in multiplayer where a human controls the genestealers can there be any replayability that isnt linked to the difficulty level. Space Wolves dlc allows replay of all campaigns with a differently styled and equipped group of soldiers.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Fair.  The base game is a fair price but given the DLCs are quite expensive I personally would opt for the complete collection or get all items on sale.  VERDICT:  Overall for a Full Control game its rather good.  Space Hulk is a simple game.  It is modelled afterall on a boardgame.   Yet the graphics and sound captures the setting perfectly and the spirit of the boardgame very well, at least from what I can remember of my few games playing it.  Missions and tactical options may be limited in scope but there is a very enjoyable if somewhat repetitive challenge to be gained from playing through all the missions and then changing to the a different set of soldiers.  A solid purchase for any strategy gamer or fan of Warhammer 40K.**The spin-off sequel: Space Hulk Acension does the above but with linked missions and RPG elements.			"

												I recently picked this up with it on sale and I couldn't be happier with itI was slightly put off by some of the reviews but if you go into the game bearing a few things in mind then you won't be disappointed. Things to bear in mind: - The game is slow, it is ponderous but you are playing as massive hulking terminators- Expect storm bolters to jam constantly- Always use overwatch Maybe I am slightly biased as I am Warhammer 40k fan anyway but I really enjoyed this gameNothing better than setting an assault cannon down the hall from a genestealer spawn and mowing them down one after another			"

												While I can respect them wanting to basicly build the board game as a program, something is lost in the translation.  The ""feel"" of playing a board game makes up for how slow and clunky it can be.  With this game, you just get the slow and clunky.  There is simply not enough to do each turn and if feels very restrictive.  The single space hallways also make tactics very limited.  With turn based games, tactics are everything.  If you are an enthusiest of the origional board game, you may still get a little enjoyment from this title.  However, if you are not, as a turn based strategy, X-com beats this hands down.  I have been playing games based in the 40k universe for near 20 years and was very exited to see this title, but in the end, it left me yawning.			"

												If there was a 'Maybe' option on recommendations, I would chose that instead of 'No'. Space Hulk is a faithful recreation of the board game for those who have played it.  If this is all you require for this to be a buy, then be my guest. The problem with this title is that it lacks for content. There is one small campaign included in the purchase, which will take you less than 20hrs to complete based on your skill level.  The frustration begins when you realise this campaign cuts short and you are welcome to BUY the complete campaign by dropping more money to the developer. To compound this, the multiplayer for this game is extremely clunky and unintuitive. It took me several games to figure out how the turn order would go (mainly because connections are poor and you or the other players will drop, not to mention people simply leave matches). This is all considering you might see 3 or possibly 4 games available on the multiplayer section at a given time.The only way I would recommend this game is if you are getting a personal friend to play with and can avoid the lack of content and deal with the frustrations of multiplayer.

												Genre - Games Workshop Board Game ConversionThis game stays true to the board game of the same name and ideal for those who know what Terminators and Genestealers are. This has positive and negative aspects though. You are going to need to be very careful and a mis-click can easily cost you the game. It is very unforgiving with melee combat being driven by luck and the odds are normally against you, also your guns have a habit of jamming on a far too regular basis. If you bear with it and keep your tactics spot on (assuming you have some luck as well) you will start to make progress and might actually enjoy it when it seems less masochistic to play. There are also a few achivements to make you relay levels.			"

												If you don't know the origins of this game, you might want to stay away.  This is quite literally a table top boardgame for the PC (or whatever platform you run on).  A VERY loyal and STRICT translation of the game mechanics.  Original Space Hulk (tabletop boardgame, not the EA one from '93) fans will find this quite refreshing.  This is not a progression game.  There is NO XP or progression.  If your marine dies, he is simply replaced in the next mission.  This is great to kill time, trip down memory lane, and still have fun.  This has all the feeling of the table top without the dry cardboard smell.  If you are not familiar with the Warhammer 40,000 universe or what it's about, this game will probably bore you.  If you like old fasioned turn-based tactical games with a little complexity, this is probably worth a look, especially if it's on sale.			"

												I am a massive fan of the Warhammer 40k universe. I bought this game over the mediocre pro reviews and general antipathy toward the game mainly because of a sale, my fanboy status, and because, as a strategy fan, I thought I might be able to get more out of the experience than the average gamer. Ummm... no.The developers obviously care about the source material and let that interest outstrip their collective ability to code. This game has been in the wild for months now and the general level of polish evident in the game is poor, even for an indie game. The many updates, apparently needed due to the rather shoddy state it was in at launch, dont seem to have done much to fix glaring issues such as marines shooting through walls and floors instead of at their targets, or obvious clipping issues as they move through the narrow corridors.Beyond the technical issues, this game shows a lack of flair or dynamism in the design work. The marines are plodding and slow to move. Their movement is apparently designed to mimic a board game piece, moving in halting steps and awkward about faces on a per point basis, all leading to an excruciatingly laconic ballet as a marine saunters to your chosen position, clipping through the edges of crossroads as they go. I can understand the attempt to faithfully recreate the board game, but the developers seem to have overlooked that board games make up for their static nature through tension generated by the close proximity, and occasional caustic banter, of friends. The video game scene works in a far more solitary fashion. Imagine watching your favorite board game play out by yourself, and you'll get a good idea of the feel of this game. The marines themselves feel weak, with inneffective weaponry that, although supposedly surviving for millenia and defeating the most horribly effective and despicable foes of the 41st millenium, jam and miss repeatedly for no good reason. This weakness is probably due to the need for balancing in the board game, but these are supposed to be the Emperor's finest; They feel, instead, like obsteperous 6 year olds with nerf guns and foam noodle swords. Finally, the maps are samey and run together after a while. All consist of narrow corridors lacking in any real character or distinguishing features, through which your marines lumber through and, all to often, die needlessly.Overall, then, a real shame. This game could have been a fun diversion but for the lack of technical polish, slavish adherence to an entertainment mediium that dosen't translate to video games well, and an inability to innovate.

												Meta-Score is overly harsh -this is a solid, enjoyable and nerdy strategy game. That is all. Any quibbles one may have with it are based on the fact that this is Space Hulk, the board game. It doesn't have cut-scenes, or any crazy new modes, or a story really, but it does have massive Marines in tiny corridors with truckloads of 'orrible aliens. Oh, and strategy. Bags of it. Planning, too...lots of thinking ahead, lots of careful evaluation of situations required. Hmm. If you don't mind this, you should buy Space Hulk.			"

												This is a faithful port of the Space Hulk 3rd Edition Boardgame. But nothing more.Recommended on sale as a pack with all DLC, but NOT worth the full price at all.+ Game ratings are low reflecting the numerous bugs on release, however now they have been fixed and the game is currently worth more than 50-60% ratings IMO.+ Gfx are pretty good.+ Decent tactical TBS gameplay.- There is nothing more than in the boardgame. Part of the attraction of the boardgame was painting the finely crafted miniatures.- As a video game it is a bit thin on content and gameplay- No RPG, nor units customization, nor campaign progress tracking.- The scrolling is slow, which is a problem when you play with the time limit option.- Main view and Strategic Map are not correlated, you can't use one to move the view on the other, which doesn't help navigating on large maps.- No map or unit editor, despite the promise. The game is badly crying for mods.- expensive considering the low replayability lack of variation or customization, and the fact that it take 10 hours to complete all the missions- The game is more or less deadLater the publisher, released Space Hulk: Ascension, which included plenty of RPG elements and customization possibilities as well as much more scenarios. However trying to make Ascension different enough from the first game. They changed the gameplay too much. As a result with have two games neither feeling completely satisfactory. In both cases they alienated part of the audience, which they also did for their Jagged Alliance Flashback.They clearly have technical skills. But somehow they failed on gameplay and marketing, creating high expectations but failing to fully deliver. The company is now sleeping, making no development, just seeling the games as they are.

												Short review:If you're really into Space Hulk/ Warhammer 40k, or have a friend you really want to play this with, you might as well get it no matter what.If not, imagine a tower defense, where your towers can move, but miss all the time and might blow up due to sheer bad luck and gameplay is generally slow. Still sounds fun to you? Well, if you're enough of a masochist, enjoy, otherwise, better keep away.The experience of the game:If you play any Warhammer as a tabletop game, with a friend, or fellow players in one room, every move, every single dice roll can build up sweet tension, your strategy vs. your opponents, your luck vs. theirs and every time one of you makes an awesome move or seems to beat the odds, it can be hillarious.The game might translate the mechanics perfectly, but no matter what, it can not translate this feeling and at least for me, this is doing a lot and seems to turn the whole game into an ok puzzle at best and a boring random number generator at worst.Sometimes there might be a positive feel to it, if you pull of a good move, strengthening your position, or barely getting out of a tight situation. But, most of the time there is no feeling of achievement, when just another one of the hundreds of generic enemies you encounter dies, nor if you complete a level, really. On the other hand it can be rather frustrating, if the randomness turns against you big time, like a single enemy running down a hallway, all overwatch shots missing, the bolter jamming 4 times in a row and then your unit is dead and the whole mission might fall appart. Bad luck, rinse and repeat?! Meh.In addition to that, both visuals and sounds are just bad. Again, if it's tabletop, your imagination might fill in cool effects and so far, no graphics engine can beat good imagination. But, if a program shows you, how your unit is shooting the wall, while an enemy in the hallway next to it falls in a weird splash of red, that might be funny the first time, but in the end is just, well, really bad. It's pretty much the same with moving animations, first time it might look funny when your terminator is awkwardly wiggling backwars around a corner, but at some point it's just awkward. Also, it's good that you can crank up the animation speed, otherwise i might've died of boredom just watching unit movement.So i prefer... playing anything else.			"

												A quite decent tactical game well worth a discounted price. It's not as good as some others (XCOM to give an example), but those who like tactical games should definitely give it a try. Although there basically is no variety in units, especially enemy units, some missions provide a very good challenge, but are not too frustrating if you take a minute or two to think and generally the game is fun, albeit a bit too slow.

												Some things to know about this game:- 12 missions, one maybe two ways to beat them- Dice rolls randomly determine misses or kills, no wounding possible- Extremely slow paced- Performance issues- No customization options- Buggy as hell- Nowhere near worth the $30 price tag, or even $10 on a sale- No character progression / depth. Character dies in one mission? Alive for the next.Easily one of the worst games I have ever played. If you want a good strategy game, buy X-Com. If you want to play the Space Hulk boardgame, play one of the many free fan-made versions online.This game has a 58 Metacritic score, meaning 22 official reviews (not from random people, but from organizations) averaged out to a 58 / 100 score. Do yourself a favor and never buy this game.The company is also a complete joke. I have made a warning thread to players, telling them not to buy the game for the reasons listed above. Once at launch and once a few months later at a sale. The head of the company actually banned me for it. Do not support this company by buying this awful game.			"

If you want something SPACE HULK but from an FPS perspective; Take a look at DEATH WING.This game is probably the biggest disappointment I have ever laid my hands on.This game does not do the board game justice. Your Marines are slow and clunky and the thrill of having your Marines miss their shots or have their gun jam right as a Gene Stealer is upon them is decimated.You will spend a majority of the time watching your Space Marines go CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK as they walk around in their Terminator Armour inside the insidious Space Hulk.As much as I would love to love this game (since I absolutely ADORE the board game) I cannot in good concious recommend this to anyone. They tried to recapture an icon of the Warhammer 40K universe and unfortunatly failed.			"

												If you are a fan of the Space Hulk Tabletop or the GW in franchise in general i can only recommend the game, it more or less captures the game experience (with some minor issues that were mentioned in the Total biscuit review - watch that first if you think about buying the game). But from a general point of view (a video gamer perspective so to say) Id say dont get it if its not on sale, because you are not getting enough out of your money. It would have been so great to have a scenario editor for the game, but due to the DLC-whoring you are stuck with a hand full levels that you can play through in a couple of hours with no real replay value (unless you play with some friends online - but then again: why not play the real deal?). And even if you get the DLCs (which are overprized and really not worth mentioning) you wont get more than one or two playthroughs out of them before you get bored again. The devs really missed an opportunity for long lasting enjoyment by not implementing an editor, and excluding the community. Another instance of an OK game that could have been great if it wasn`t for greed. :(			"

												Space Hulk is a pretty good game. Everyone who knows me that my two favorite universes are Lord of the Rings and Warhammer 40k, so I may be a little biased, but I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It's tactically interesting, and it plays well. However, one of its greatest strengths is that it FEELS like a Warhammer 40k game. The universe is, of course, based off of the tabletop miniatures games, and Space Hulk is one of the first Warhammer 40k games I've played that felt like I was playing the tabletop version. That's really rare. Other 40k games, such as Space Marine or Dawn of War, are great in their own right, but Space Hulk manages to capture that special nostalgia I get when playing the tabletop version and digitize it.That being said, Space Hulk is not a very long game. It took me about five hours to beat. The remaining twenty hours were spent grinding to get 40,000 kills. Yep, 40,000 kills is a /lot/. And the grinding SUCKED. Normally, this would be an instant disqualification from being recommended (40,000 kills?! COME ON!) but because I had lots of fun and enjoyed the atmosphere very much, I'll recommend the game -- with the caveat, however, that if you're achievement hunting, you're gonna have a bad time.

All the mechanics, rules and randomness are because its origins as a tabletop game.The graphics are really lackluster, the models are cool with a nice semblance to the minis but they got not much detail or texture or material work on them. The effects are nice with really over the top gory blood.The sound design is really good with crunchy blasts, a nice metallic echo to everything you do and a nasty shriek to the filty Genestealers. The music gives you a nice background never interfering.Give this one a chance if only to help The Emperor, Brother Librarian Calistarius needs to fulfill his destiny at the Second War for Armageddon...

												Truth be told, this is just a port of the good ol' board and models edition of Space Hulk. It's not too different, and I would dare say it's nothing special. But it's still worth a play I would say.My biggest complaint though is that I swear the rolls are fixed somehow. It might be my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥luck but melee combat in this game sucks if you're a Space Marine. Those Genestealers don't bloody care if you're outright well equipped to shank them in the face with your power sword, they always seem to win during my playthroughs.Infact, just don't bother with melee, always go for ranged kills. Even if you have a high chance of missing with the sodding xenos scum standing DIRECTLY IN YOUR FACE.♥♥♥♥ this game. It can really be evil sometimes. But I love it still. Guess I'm a masochist, or something.But yeah. I would say buy it if you're a fan of Warhammer 40000 and turn based strategy games in general. It's real fun, although very unforgiving sometimes. And other times... Egh. Those sodding Genestealers will run blindly at you regardless if it's the AI, so does it matter that much how hard you think?...Spoiler, it suprisingly does. I think.			"

												I like Space Hulk the board game and this is a mechanically true implementation of it.  As such, it will likely be most appealing to individuals immersed in the Warhammer 40K universe and who are familiar with the original game's mechanics.  SH uses the Third Edition ruleset and scenarios.The main weakness, for me, is the Genestealer A.I.  The computer is very easy to aggro and will always push ahead with its blips, rather than holding them back as lurkers ahead of the marines' line of advance.  This makes the original 3e campaign fairly easy to complete with careful play.  The DLC campaigns seem to recognize the A.I.'s weaknesses and work to compensate for it by forcing the marines to be more aggressive through time limits and other stressors.I found the game to be achingly slow on a non-gaming laptop, but it motors along at quite a nice pace on a dedicated platform.  I turned the animations up to the fastest setting and that was fine.  Sound effects are decent (storm bolters, in particular, pack a wallop).Pick it up on sale if you like the original board game and the price is right. "

												Really great game, but I can understand why most people wouldn't enjoy it so much. It is important to keep in mind that this is a board game with 6-sided dice rolls, moving along square spaces, and everything that entails. I must admit that after playing Dawn of War 2 and Space Marine, it was off-putting to see my space marines die after failing to block once in close combat, but that is how the boardgame worked.This game requires you to think tactically and act carefully, and once you get the hang of it, then you'll really be enjoying all of the different objectives you'll be tasked with in all of the missions. My only real problem with this game is that there is no music during the missions, and every space marine's voice is the same (even the sergeants with names). Because of the lack of anything sounding interesting for missions that can last for as long as a half-hour, I put my game into windowed mode and ran video podcasts in the background while I played.I'd say this is a great game for anyone new or experienced in the Warhammer 40k franchise.

												To start, this game is NOT a bad game. It is complex and has important aspects of strategy and prediction; however, there is soooo much luck involved. I get that it is meant to replicate the table top games with 'rolling dice' but I am not going to sit and re-do an entire level because I had a run of bad luck.The graphics and audio do the game justice, so if you are looking for a Psuedo-Chess strategy game, by all means; like I said, it is not a bad game. The luck based element is just too much, and the level progression seems unbalanced and eratic at times, with no real incentive to continue playing.			"

												I am a huge fan of the original Space Hulk from 1993 - it was great. I was hoping this was a modern remake - it is not. It is really a tactical, turn-based game where you try not to have too many Terminators die. I found the game fun and challenging initially, but after a while it just got tedious. As I have mentioned before, I almost always finish a game, and there are just a few where I have just said, ""Screw it,"" and deleted them prematurely. Space Hulk is one of those games.Graphics were decent, sound was decent - it is the repetitiveness that gets tedious.Rating: 3/5			"

												Really great game, but I can understand why most people wouldn't enjoy it so much. It is important to keep in mind that this is a board game with 6-sided dice rolls, moving along square spaces, and everything that entails. I must admit that after playing Dawn of War 2 and Space Marine, it was off-putting to see my space marines die after failing to block once in close combat, but that is how the boardgame worked.This game requires you to think tactically and act carefully, and once you get the hang of it, then you'll really be enjoying all of the different objectives you'll be tasked with in all of the missions. My only real problem with this game is that there is no music during the missions, and every space marine's voice is the same (even the sergeants with names). Because of the lack of anything sounding interesting for missions that can last for as long as a half-hour, I put my game into windowed mode and ran video podcasts in the background while I played.I'd say this is a great game for anyone new or experienced in the Warhammer 40k franchise.

												If you enjoyed the boardgame iterations of Space Hulk there is a whole lot to love about this game.If on the other hand  you were expecting XCOM meets 40k - you will almost certainly be disappointed (though the forthcoming Space Hulk Ascension will be more up your street I think.For what it set out to be this game is a triumph, and I salute the devs for staying true to the boardgame at the expense of being more broadly appealling to the video gaming customer base. A faithul recreation of the Space Hulk experience. The only thing that lets it down are the below average sfx and the pretty basic combat animations.			"

												It's an ok Space Hulk game, but... And it's a stinking but.The developers have talked about adding a level editor to the game. The team's website and the official Space Hulk site originally said that the level editor is already in the game. After I brought this up (over a year ago) they changed it to ""upcoming"". Now they're saying that because of Games Workshop they have troubles adding it. Sorry, but that's not going to cut what you have said in the past.Now when they're about to release an updated version of the game (you have to purchase it separately) I simply lack any faith they're going to add anything to this game any longer.

												The first videogame version of a boardgame that is actually slower to play than the boardgame itself (even setting the animation speed to very fast). The levels are not interesting at all and the gameplay rules are obscure most of the time. Graphics and setting are cool, but once again you can't establish an entire game on these two things totally ignoring the playability.			"

Enjoy the tension as small mistakes allow the Genestealer player to overrun your SPESS MEHREENS.

												This is a faithful recreation of the board game, and a solid single-player game. It's turn based, so you can take your time trying to optimise the tactics for your squad of marines. The turns are relatively quick and it's surprisingly addictive - ""just one more quick turn.""The main downside for me is the animation, particularly the Genestealer deaths, which are inexplicably terrible. This doesn't affect gameplay, so you can get used to it.			"

												The controls are inconsistent and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and success on any given map is dictated by whether or not your weapon jams after the first genestealer rushes you or the third one. Rather than having to figure out a tactical plan and then execute it, there's nothing to be ""solved,"" the plan is obvious from the first time you see the map and you just reload again and again hoping the dice work out this time. I recognize this is meant to be a simulation of a tabletop game but it's on a computer now so it's gonna get compared to other computer games. Resting everything on a d6 is fine for a tabletop game but it turns out computer games don't need to be constrained like that.After I got through the tutorial the other campaigns have maps that are bigger and so far some of them are more challenging. It's only crashed-to-desktop on me twice once I got it working. At that point (like a couple hours in) it feels worth it to fight the controls but I can't recommend a game that takes 2-3 hours to ""pick up"" while you reload over and over.- Initial install problem: I knew the bad reputation this thing had but I figured since it's hugely discounted it couldn't hurt to try it. It took two tries to actually install the game and then for the first 2 hours I couldn't even get it to launch, just says ""Oops! The game crashed"" and then whatever happened to the failed install immediately broke all the other unity games I had.Full Control needs to do a lot better with their other games before they get them on Steam.- Editing to respond to tendoncutter: This thing was a buggy crash-to-desktop ♥♥♥♥in nightmare from when it was first released, I avoided it up until now, and then I let a bunch of friends talk me into buying it during this sale. It actually crashed on Install and then I had to strip everything out and reinstall it so I could experience the joy of a game tripping over a ♥♥♥♥ing windows font it doesn't even use. I got it working a couple hours later after fixing a problem with the unity engine its built on *that only affects this version of unity 4*. I found the fix on a forum for a *different* unity-based game I don't even own. This game company doesn't have any troubleshooting stuff in their FAQ or anything anywhere it seems. They got back to me in email the next day but didn't know what to do. It says right in the log I sent them it's a font problem but they ""needed more data"" of course by then it was too late I'd already fixed it.			"

												I recommend both Space Hulk (SH) & Space Hulk Ascension (SHA) because they are different yet covering the same subject matter: Wh40k space hulks assaulted by Terminators. For me both games' exciting parts come in overwatch: will your weapon jam and leave you exposed to the superior melee skills of the genestealers? I am a turn-based board/table-top gamer at heart and I love game mechanics. The fear that my men will get slaughtered and hence the greater excitement comes from SH due to the fact that only command points can be used to unjam your weapons in overwatch. SHA is easier as weapon jams come from weapon over heating that you can mitigate: (1) by obtaining in game skills gained by experience points (2) by practicing 2 or 3 man fire & movement team tactics (3) by using movement zones to get to killing zones ... (4) by finding a weapon's cache with Storm Bolters that have an additional 5+ heat capacity before jamming (if you are lucky like me} .SH discussions about great suggested modifications to SH can be found, guess where? ... in SHA! And how do I know that, because I read the discussions silly and I play the games. As a person who has bought over 1200 games on Steam, and has bought more than 1200 not on Steam (I support game developers like I know you support fine art), and when have I been burned ??? When I don't do my home work ... when I don't read the forum discussions ... when I don't check out MetaCritic or do web searches for other reviews ... when I don't look for outside support and mod communities, ... and for me, most importantly the developers web sites and blogs.And guess what, depending on how you are bent ... you may find a personal gem that has a big o' red thumbs down on Steam with mostly negative reviews with maybe barely 30% percent positive reviews ... I know I have some ,,, and one of them is on sale with Steam keys but not on Steam ... check out out https://www.humblebundle.com/Final word (and as always a quote), if you are a shooter, platformer, action gamer both SH & SHA may not be your cup of tea. The best game of this type of genre is XCOM: Enemy Unknown using full game controller support right here on Steam or if you prefer on your X-Box ...Mulder: Scully, I was like you once. I didn't know who to trust. Then I... I chose another path... another life, another fate, where I found my sister. The end of my world was unrecognizable and upside down.

												This game is a very faithful adaptation of the board game.I have only noticed a couple of mechanics that are different:- command points cannot be used in the genestealer turn, except to unjam bolters, which happens automatically if you have the points to do it- genestealers can't be forced to lurk off the board, except in missions where it is a special mechanicThe rest seems totally right.  Just perfect for my goal of getting practise at the tabletop game.Minor quibbles- the rules aren't explained fully in the manual, such as how many dice to roll and hit targets- the Terminators are so very slow and stampy, but you can turn the animation speed right up and the result is quite amusing			"

												I played the original board game back in the day (late 1980s) - and it was one of the best board games ever devised. I played the previous Space hulk video games (Space Hulk on Amiga and Space Hulk vengence on PC/PS2?) and they too were excellent.I bought this Space Hulk video game (and I bought it on iOS for my iPad too) pretty much as soon as I saw it - and I rarely buy games not on sale.This version of Space Hulk was very close to the board game.  The initial build of the game was OK(ish) - good core gameplay, but quite a few flaws that needed to be (and were) sorted out with later patches. As this Space Hulk was so close to the board game, I was dissapointed that the original board game expansions (Deathwing and Genestealer) were never added to the base game as DLC, but you can't have everything I guess.The game mechanics are solid, there are a good set of scenarios linked into a story, the AI opponent is competent and - most importantly - the scenarios are well designed and balanced. If you play well you will win (probably, unless you have some very bad dice rolls). If you play badly you will lose (and lucky dice won't save you). Only downside is you can't play scenarios as the Tyranids against the computer's Terminators on solo.Personally, so far, I prefer this Space Hulk to Space Hulk:Ascention. I've played this Space Hulk through start to end on iPad, and again on PC, but I'm just not as keen on the added complexity/customisation element of Ascention.Overall its an excellent game, particularly at the price it often appears on sale.

Space Hulk is a good implementation of the same named board game, and if you like turn based strategy in the 40k universe and a more or less direct successor of the famous Chaos Gate with less options but at least the same tactical depth, I'm recommending Space Hulk for you.Anyway I would never ever pay more than 10 bucks for this game, so best keep an eye open for sales.

												I'm a W40K fan, having four armies. Space Marines, Tau, two Imperial Guard factions (Armageddon Steel Legion and the Death Korps of Krieg) and even more of the faction books. I came into this game wanting to love it. Unfortunately it turned out to be a frustrating mess in which it felt like I won more through luck than strategy, which meant even when I won it didn't feel like an accomplishment, and whenever I lost it was usually due to the game's randomness not playing in my favor.When I go to play a strategy game, I expect a reasonable challenge in which I win through craft, out-thinking my opponent, and as one might expect, through strategy and skill. This game is too simple to the point that once you've got the basics you know what you should do for every scenario, and even when you do just that, there's a good chance you'll lose anyway just because the computer decided that you'll miss 8 shots in a row, and decided arbitrarily to throw 8 'nids at you en masse.Now I'm not the end-all, beat-all game critic here, but I came into this game wanting to love it, and left sorely disappointed. This is a very sad day for the Imperium indeed.			"

												Unsatisfyingly random and arbitrary as a video game. Randomness works on the tabletop, in a social environment, but it really doesn’t work well in a video game paradigm. You do need to learn the game, and plan your moves carefully, but at the end of the day, even if you do everything perfectly, the random element dominates, and you’ll still die a lot. And because the game has a linear progression through it’s campaign, you’ll end up replaying missions over and over until you luck into success. If you’ve never played the board game, I honestly couldn’t recommend it. And in any case, you're better off playing the board game.Full review: http://games.on.net/2013/08/space-hulk-reviewed-its-like-somebody-made-the-space-hulk-board-game-into-a-video-game/ "

												What happens when you add dice to a game? You randomly win or lose through no skill or fault of your own.Now the art of playing these tabletop games is to tip the odds in your favor. Except in Space Hulk, you regularly can't. You have your Space Marine standing in a 1 square wide corridor you have to pass through. None of his battle brothers can fire past him. Attacking allows you to kill 1 or 2 enemies in front of you (if the dice like you) - any more and you're dead. Too bad, then, that they spawn in groups of 3.Overwatch to the rescue! Setting your Space Marines to overwatch, they can shoot any number of enemies (3, 6, 9 - don't care) during the enemy turn. So you spend your 4 AP moving 2 squares and going into Overwatch. Bam! Enemy group killed. Next turn. Bam! Enemy group killed. Next turn. ""My weapon has jammed"" - oops, bad dice roll, your Space Marine is dead.Maybe experienced DnD players can enjoy this kind of gameplay. I can't.			"

It can be nasty and unforgiving in the wrong places, but you can also dominate and slaughter if your luck holds too.Some nitpics:I'm not really sure its worth its price tag as games go however, but it comes up on sales fairly often and is worth it if you can get it for around 50%+ off.It has hard coded controls (like wasd for camera movement) and no hotkeys for actions, which would have been a nice addition so feels like it wasnt exactly designed with a typical PC user in mind.If you want heavily want a video game I cant recomend it, otherwise I'd fully recomend giving ti a try, especially if you like tactical games.

												I have had the pleasure of playing both Space Hulk for the PC as well as the board game that it was inspired by. The word ""inspired"" being less accurate than the word 'cloned'. This game is a direct, literal and yet somehow lacking version of the boardgame. Though it does give exactly what it promises, it ONLY gives what is promises and if you at all feel that it is lacking as a videogame then you would likely be better off playing something with more meat to it.I am a very large fan of the Warhammer franchise, both its fantasy and sci-fi variations and as such I have a tendancy of playing anything with the Warhammer stamp on it. This is the first time however that i can say with certianty that my time playing this particular Warhammer game was not well spent.Purchase only at discount if you are a fan such as I BUT ONLY IF you do not own the original unlike me. It is a much better experience if for no other reason than you can remake the board and the rules however you wish, which is more fun than what this game provides.			"

												Very true to the original boardgame.  It's a bit clunky in the animation and audio departments, but otherwise it's pretty fun once you get into it.  The game rules are simple to learn, but there's a lot of depth to the strategy.  I've definitely had a few games completely fall apart while others went just so, ending in perfect victories.  There were some significant bugs early on, but the developers are very involved with the Steam community and are releasing lots of patches based on feedback, so I'm hopeful this will continue to improve.  Got it as a birthday gift; otherwise, I'd probably pay $20 for it.			"

												Okay, so there are a couple things missing that would have made it an instant buy. 1. It's missing character customization, which while not necessary, would have been a big draw. 2. It's missing a good narative. They could have made the campaign feel more continuous by having some cutscenes or something, but instead the game feels very 'instanced', and you kinda have to figure out the story through the mission briefings/missions themselves.Now, aside from those things I think this is a good, smart game. It feels like the movie Aliens meets WH40K- you root for some of the biggest badasses in the universe to mulch some xeno filth and get out alive, but of course the aliens are smart, agile, and extremely deadly if they get close to the humies. So, the game retains the feeling of dread at finding out exactly how many genestealers are around the corner, and how likely you are to be pressed for AP/CP (the action points you use to command your units to do anything). The game is difficult, but never seems outright unfair. The Terminators and Genestealers feel suprisingly balanced considering one's ranged profficiency, and one's melee profficiency. Providing the map isn't nothing but corridors, the genestealers have plenty of chances to get the drop on you and eliminate your troops one by one. Genestealers actually have some interesting abilities. While their units don't have special attacks, or really any variation (except for the broodlords), they can choose to either be stealthy, or to play the waiting game and build up forces, or to just rush the Terminators every turn so they can't continue through the mission, and pray units get through to cut them in half. This is because the Genestealer player (or AI) can choose to put units at any number of spawn points, can choose whether or not to reveal units at certain times, and can make big moves each turn due to having more AP.Overall, I feel like the game is a good buy. The Terminators are weighty and have heavy firepower, which looks and sounds great. The Genestealers are appropriately creepy, but could probably have benefitted from some better move animations and dodge animations, but otherwise look like a fearsome foe. The game knows it's theme and keeps to it. Even though the game deals with a lot of hallways which could have been a lot more boring, they find ways to keep them interesting (flickering lights, gore, weird tech, ominous mists and steams, all the usual wrought metal and skulls you love from the Imperium, etc.). The gameplay is fun, with different objectives on each map for the Terminators (rescue, destruction, retrieval, escape, etc.) and so it stays fresh through the campaign.Finally, the shoulder cam is awesome, the emperor protects, and I rate this game an 7/10.DLC 1: Sword of Halcyon: Ok so for some reason I can't figure out how to write a separate review for the DLC packs, so I'll post them at the bottom of this review. The first DLC pack I played through was the Sword of Halcyon campaign. I played through singleplayer as the Blood Angels. In total the 5 missions took me about 5 hours to play through on Normal difficulty. The campaign has it's pros and cons. Essentially, the gist is that you are on the ship Sword of Halcyon which has just crashed into a space hulk in the warp, and you are responding to the influx of genestealers within the first hours after collision. What I find cool about this is that the main game took place 600 years after the space hulk Sin of Damnation was infested, and the terminators are slowly and methodically manuevering through that space hulk to their objectives. In this campaign, time is no luxury. Genestealers are quickly moving through the ship and your terminators are tasked with securing vital areas of the ship like the armories, bridge, and the inner sanctum of the ship full of holy relics, all in order to attempt a defense. It feels climatic because the briefings and missions run into each other in a logical, continuous way. In addition, the missions challenge the player by forcing them to keep pressing forward, with two missions actually tasking you with destroying or sealing off genestealer spawns, forcing you to run straight at the genestealers which can be nerve-wracking and potentially disasterous. This could be a really fun campaign to play in co-op or versus I think.Now, that's all well and good, but the campaign also has some weaknesses. Though each mission mixes up the squads, it only does so aesthetically with name and model changes. Aside from the first mission, each scenario has two squads of 5 terminators; 1 seargeant, 1 heavy flamer troop, and 3 regular storm bolter troops. This is a sore point for me because I kept waiting to see an assualt cannon troop or a Librarian, and it never happened. You'll get familiar with using those units, and that's not really a good thing. I would have rather had changing squads making me have to adjust and adapt more through the campaign. The two other main beefs I have involve the lack of broodlords and the usage of bulkhead doors. I really thought I should have fought a broodlord or two on the final mission; it just would have felt right and ramped up the challenge of the last mission. Bulkhead doors are only in one level, and the store page makes it sound like they'll be a key feature of the campaign, but they aren't. Bulkheads are a great concept hardly touched.Altogether, I grant the Sword of Halcyon DLC campaign a 6.5/10. Dissapointing, but still somewhat enjoyable, and not a waste of $5, especially if you have someone for MP.			"

												I am huge fan of space hulk.  I've played since the second edition of the board game and I also purchased the third edition of the board game.  Space hulk is a remarkable game clearly taking inspiration of the claustrophobic combat in Aliens, so when I heard it was being made as a PC game, for the third time, and that said new game would be more true to games like x-com I was very excited.  The developers this time opted to make an almost 100% faithful conversion of the board game into a PC game.  In this way Space Hulk delivered something that I've been waiting for over several decades.  Having purchasing this game however, it's hard to say that they have done a perfect conversion.  The single player works very well even if the AI is sometimes extremely stupid.  The main point is that after many patchs the single player game space hulk was everything I wanted and justifies a 5- 10$ purchase price.  As a multiplayer game this game is a buggy broken mess.  I have had multiple disconnects during the game and lag that is completely unjustifiable and intolerable in a turn based game.  The developers CLEARLY rushed this title and are also mainly concered with getting it out for iOS as fast as possible.  In all honesty, they should just delete the multiplayer option.  It doesn't work at all depsite any claims the developer may make.  I would say that if you enjoy turn based games and games workshop pick this title up, but don't pay over 10$.  Also avoid all the DLC.  The DLC has clearly been rushed out as a cash grab, the new missions are easy and uninteresting, and the addtional features it provides really add nothing to the overall game.			"

												Space hulk is a faithful adaptation of the board game space hulk.When a board game is a direct translation to a computer game it results in a mediocre game at best (well, imho). I feel Space Hulk escapes this, if only just.It's a simple and unforgiving tactical game. You control a bunch of terminators. They waddle from objective to objective.  You need to prevent them from dying. Hordes of tyranids try to kill you. Damn you Claudio.I'd only recommend this for Warhammer 40k fans or board-gaming fans.It's a definite must buy for anybody who enjoys / enjoyed the space hulk board games.			"

												In the future there is only WAR!  Welcome to the realm of Warhammer 40K.  Space Hulk was originally a board game based in this universe, and now it is getting a proper port-to-PC treatment thanks to developer Full Control. While it is not this IP’s first attempt to be brought to life via video game format, it is by far, hands down, the best effort any developer has ever put towards doing it justice.  Games Workshop is known world wide for it’s board, card, and miniature style games, so this really is a great IP for any developer to work with.With the soon to be released Space Wolves DLC, now is the perfect time to invest in this game.  I know the cost tends to throw some people off, but you have to keep in mind that this is a board game, and if you went to the store to buy the board game, you would spend $99.99 USD.  Then you would have to put together each model, paint each model, and then after you got all of that done, you would still have to find a buddy to come over to the house to play it with you!  Full Control enables you to play with anyone in the world at your own pace, without having to set the board up each time you want to play.  So if you think about it in that context, the $29.99 USD price is a bargain!30 Second Review + Ongoing and continued developer support.  Daily interaction with the player base.+ Easy to learn gameplay with a solid tutorial.+ Faithful adaptation from the board game to the PC.- No multiplayer lobby currently.  (They are working to change that.)- Easy AIClick this link to read more!http://everydaygamers.com/2014/03/03/review-space-hulk/ "

												I always found Warhammer 40k a bit on the grim-dark side - tales of heartless, merciless neo-fascist space-bullies killing bloodily and meaninglessly in the empty service of some kind of semi-homoerotic all-boys-boarding-school-type honours system. Do I get to become Dux if I win? Is that what happens?Space hulk, by comparison, while ostensibly set within the same universe, didn't have the same feel to it - it was more a aliens-vs-space marines one-on-one actual board game that you could play with your friends on an afternoon free, without having to, you know, Study it. Like it was some kind of Work or something...To an extent I feel this game is how Xcom: Enemy Unknown should've been - not, you know, just random and boringly pretty, which is what it was. One suspects that if Xcom had dedicated half the time it spent on it's graphical cutscenes to actually solidifying the gameplay aspect, they might've come out with a good game, and not the buggy, unfair one they did.To illustrate, I spent about 3 hours on the third mission I got assigned in Xcom, due to the game unexpectedly throwing a randomly-hard level at me, which took, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you-not, 20 iterations to complete, and then only because I figured out the singular path that wouldn't kill all my squadmates in five turns.By comparison, I have also spent about 3 hours on the third mission of Space Hulk, but I don't mind. Because I know, every time, it's not because the game gives me unending varieties of ways to complete the mission - or because the game is doing unexpectedly random things - it's because I'm not doing it right. You know this because the rulebook is thin, terse, and because it takes place in non-randomly-generated corridors, there are limited ways in which to complete a mission, and it becomes much more obvious which ones are actually smart, and which ones are dumb.I don't have to sit through a 3 minute cutscene every time I begin a mission, I don't have to watch a 'reveal' jumpscare video every time an alien pops up (there are in-game battle sequences but you can turn them off), I can just strategise, iterate and learn.That's the way it should be. However, there are some downsides. For some reasons, the graphics engine is woefully slow for what it's rendering. Not enough that it becomes annoying, just enough that I disrespect it. The graphics are okay, but not that great - which is fine. The control system is simple and easily understandable, but somewhat clunky to use - I'm not sure why this should be, but the mission overlays sometimes get in the way of just jumping in there.And lastly the gameplay difficulty level is somewhat balanced against you, to the extent that I'm considering dropping down to 'easy' - I don't remember the boardgame being this hard, perhaps it was. There will be many who like this.Lastly I just wanted to say ""thanks"" to the devs for actually including a save button. You know, a regular save button. A meaningful one. One where I save the game and the game is saved. I can go back to washing the dishes now. I can structure my games around my life, and not the other way around. How it should be.Best of luck to the devs, whose company has folded, but apparently without hardship. I hope to pick up their sequel some day.			"

												Space Hulk, by internet time standards an ancient boardgame, available as a turn based videogame on steam.Players are the space marines from Warhammer 40k and enter a space hulk full of genestealers(Aliens with really sharp claws). Simple premise, for a simple game. Space Hulk is easy to learn and has both co-op and versus multiplayer if you want to play it with friends. It does suffer from niche-itis, in that the space marines' oversized armour restricts their movement(This is a key part of the game, positioning them right so they aren't flanked), and the inherrent dice and chance based things as are common in many Warhammer boardgames are not something everyone enjoys playing with. These space marines will die if they get jumped by a genestealer, are slow to move, their guns may jam, and they may miss six times or even more in a row if you just don't have the luck. But that's part of the fun and gameplay, your goal is to get these marines to do a mission and preferably without them all getting slaughtered, as this is turn based and a most mechanics use chance you will find that tactics and positioning will allow you to win the day more often than just being lucky. Being lucky helps, of course, but if you position things to reduce how much chance is involved then it is only a small factor in leading your squad to victory. This is not too difficult in single player, but becomes a lot tougher when you go online and allow a player to control the genestealers.In the end, it's pretty good but it is slow, clearly based on a boardgame, and has chance based mechanics. If you do not mind this then it's a fun title to play some rounds with or against friends, complete the single player campaign and just generally enjoy. But if you're not into any of those then you may be better off getting something else			"

												I've been playing Space Hulk the board game since it was released. This is a great digital recreation of that board game. Bear that in mind when considering purchasing. If you are a 40K fan and hate Terminators, enjoy this game and watching them die. I prefer this to the old 3DO version. It is especially nice if you don't have anyone to play Space Hulk with. Needs Deathwing. (Just like second edition of 40K, learn to Overwatch.)			"

												From what I can tell, this is a direct port of the out of print board game, however I have never played the board game. I got this is a 6$ bundle, and that is a lot less than the 110$ asking price on ebay. Single Player: You play as a Space Marine Terminator sargent against Genestealer AI in a campaign identical to the board games. Each turn you command your terminators in a tight space, and its never seems like there is a best choice. It is honestly difficult to weight what choices to make each turn, and one bad move can end the game. After you move and order your terminators with a small amount of command points (4 per terminator and 1-6 extra command points depending on a dice roll) the Genestealers get a turn, and although they are weaker than terminators you are outnumbered, and even a seemingly good move can give the GeneStealers all they need to break you. This game is unforgiving. The AI is good most of the time, but sometime makes REALLY bad moves.Multiplayer: Same as the single player, but one player controlers to Genestealers. I have never played it with anyone but myself(had to test it) but it would be much harder than the single player as AI will never match the human mind.Summary: This is a really good buy for anyone that likes hard board games and a fan of Warhammer 40k. I always wanted the board game but the digital version is cheaper and has a single player mode. Cons:LUCK. its is really determined around luck. A bad dice roll can negate a good move, and a good dice roll can make a really stupid move look like tactical genious. 8/10			"

												Space Hulk is incredibly disappointing. As a fan of turn-based strategy games and the Space Hulk: Death Angel card game, I anticipated this title with what I thought were reasonable expectations, though this game did not come close to meeting them.The graphics and animation have no notable qualities. The game is ugly, sluggish and plays like an iPhone title. One can easily waste a turn making a misclick and watching their lumbering character turn to face the wall.The gameplay is pitiful in comparison to any recent turn-based strategy game. There is nothing to a lot of the maps other than setting up an overwatch, waiting for the genestealers to come to you and getting the requisite kills to complete the mission. The map layouts are simple and linear and would have been much better with an element of randomization like the card game mentioned above. That feature would have also added some replay value to this, which currently has none. There is no sense of exploration or cautious advance that XCOM: Enemy Unknown provides and no sense of personality or team relationships that is featured in Fire Emblem Awakening. There is also no character progression system that allows you to customize or favor individual units such as those systems offered in XCOM, Fire Emblem or Battle for Wesnoth.I would not recommend this game to anyone; all, including Space Hulk fans, would be much better served playing XCOM, Fire Emblem or Battle for Wesnoth and passing on this one.Luckily, I bought this game on a Steam sale and only committed $6.24. I do not even believe that payment was worthwhile as that small amount could have paid for a lunch. I cannot believe the list price of this game is $29.99. A $.99 price point seems right for what is offered, but even then, one’s time could be better spent in other endeavors.Unfortunately for the player, but I guess fortunately for the developer, a demo was not offered for Space Hulk. Playing a demo of this game would have allowed me to realize these issues and avoid the expenditure of any money on it.			"

												Great adaptation of the board game. Involves a lot of random rolls, but quite a bit more forgiving than table top version, since you can ""undo"" your last move even after the roll.In this version of the classic board game, player controls a squad of Space Marine Terminators of Blood Angels chapter, as they delve into the cavernous corridors of massive space hulk, infested with genestealer aliens. Each Terminator has 4 action points to spend on your turn, and literally every slightest move costs action points, including changing facing. Luckily, on every turn you get a common pool of a 1-6 command points that can be spend by your squad to do additional actions. Poor roll of command points can be rerolled once per round, as long as at least one squad sargenat is alive. Leaning to take maximum advantage of action economy is key to being good at this game.Just like any other game based on dice rolls, the random factor can feel punishing to beginners, but the game is quite easy overall, I think I managed to do most missions in a single attempt.Notable differences from table top is that you can't play as Genestealers in a single player campaign. Some weapons and powers work with slight differences (most notably flamer) and unfortunately video game did not include the new missions from third edition.Overall, it is a light and enjoayble board game adaptation, especially if you are a fan of table top space hulk and having trouble bringing this massive game to the table regularly.

												Have you ever felt like commanding a small squad of troops that sound like they are wearing refrigerators, then by all means buy this game.  Your warriors of the emperor die in battle against what look like horrible 1950's aliens again and again, yet strangely it's so wonderful to hear them shoot away.So, lets do it:Pros:Terminators.  If you know your 40K, you know they are awesome.First person view on the corner (can be toggled off if you don't care, but honestly I love it)SLLLLLOOOOOWWWWW walk, considering the weight of the units every step feels very purposeful.  If it bothers you, there is a toggle where you can turn off this feature and they walk pretty much like a character in CoD (Movement is pretty fast at that point).A good solid difficulty, worthy of Space Hulk (alot of 40K games give Space Marines way too much epicness... but this game makes you fear melee against genestealers)If you get the DLC you have 2 sides with quite a bit of variety in strategy.Cons:Your troops will annoyingly move in ways you don't intend.Overwatch is nice, but previous point makes the skill somewhat useless if you get unlucky with placement.Due to the randomness of dice roll based games, situations where you obviously have the advantage can still go wrong.  Not to knock the game per say, just a warning that there will be times where you think 'Oh there is no way that genestealer can run through 3 tiles of flame and melee my captain and win.' But it does.  And you cry.Would I recomend this game?  Yes.  I love 40K based games, and played Space Hulk on the Sega Saturn way back.  I will say this game is much better (god the melee in that game... was horrible...) but something needs to be said for a first person game in this universe.  This game is interesting, with quite a ton of frustration and elation... think darksouls the strategy game almost.  It is amazing.LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR!			"

												When I play this game against the computer, I'm constanly wishing that I was instead playing it on a table against a friend. Luck of the dice plays a huge role, and while that's perfectly fine if you're playing against a friend with some beer and pretzels, it's just no fun when you're sitting behind a desk playing against a computer.Mind you, I can't fault the developers. The game looks nice enough, I haven't encountered any bugs, and as far as I can tell it's a faithful conversion of the boardgame. I just don't think that this particular boardgame works without an actual board.			"

Oh and forget about customizing your Space Marines or Aliens, it will cost you $1.99 for 3 skins.  Why?  That should be free and built into the game.  Same thing if you want a different Chapter, it will cost you $$$ there too.  Once again, why?			"

												This remake of Space Hulk is a return to a video game implementation of the classic tabletop board game. Gone are the controllable first-person elements from Space Hulk: Vengeance Of The Blood Angels, which in themselves were an attempt at providing further immersion than the original Space Hulk video game (a blast from the past from 1993!) .Of course, the graphics quality has been gently ushered into the modern age. Copenhagen developmers Full Control Apps have done a quite decent job modelling environments and characters, and an excellent job of remaining completely faithful to the tabletop edition in terms of gameplay. The music and sound-effects are very atmospheric, and immersing yourself into the feel of Space Hulk (especially the first time in the dead of night with the lights off) is really fun. Franchise fans, will find the horrific aspects of this sort of video game is very appealing in experiential terms, and the immersion in a no-way-out survival horror is probably high on the list of reasons to play.Players can roam the hulk ""Sin Of Damnation"" (an expansion set for the board game) as either fearsome Genestealer Tyranids, or heroic Blood Angel Space Marines. The single-player campaign clads your squad of four in classic Warhammer: 40,000 Terminator Armor with all associated weaponry. They carry out your orders with appropriate battle cries of ""For the Emperor!"" and such-like. When squad members inevitably fall in close-combat with Genestealer, their death throes are accompanied with sentiments to the effect of ""Avenge me, my brothers!"". You will need to do a lot of avenging in the course of the campaign if you set the difficulty up high. Unfortunately, the game is also punishing in terms of performance. Though many actions of the AI are based on six-sided dice rolls of only a few dice, the psuedorandom number generator used might well  be using floating point variables of many significant figures, for the eternity it takes to decide upon death without recourse. However, if you roll bad dice in your turn resulting in any mistake including death, there's always the Undo button. If you're terribly frustrated with a particular mission (stupid chapter artifact, why can't these pansy marines pick up a dumb chalice?) you may find yourself in a situation where spamming Undo on your turn will be the only thing which seems to get you through a difficult spot other than reducing the difficulty setting. Considering the requirements of the game, framerates go low and slow (especially with higher numbers of pixels on larger displays). This can be remedied acceptable by reducing graphics quality to medium and changing other settings. There's no pressing need for high framerates, because this a clear turn-based strategy. But smooth-scrolling around the map is necessary to keep track of what's going on. Especially when dropship teleporters malfunction during deployment! A stranded, lone Terminator faced with corridors on several sides makes an easy target for voracious Genestealers. They run in packs, don't let them get close, or even ol'lightning claws can have regrets.The animations of Terminators heroically firing weapons gets repetitive before the end of the second map in single-player. This is quickly and easily solved by turning it off entirely in the options. The animations still play, but the camera doesn't zoom into each Terminator while firing. However, the animations still go on too long. When placing a Terminator with a Storm Bolter into Overwatch mode over a long corridor filled with Genestealers, it's time to go make coffee as literally hundreds of rounds are fired with no way to skip over the animation. It's worth marveling at this once or twice, but quickly becomes boring. The same can be said of the movement, although this can be sped up. However, at maximum speed, Genestealers are more frightening than necessary, and Terminators clump around with like humourously inarticulated style of LEGO-figurines, so fast is as fast as fast goes with that.Of course you can always play online, and the matchmaking server will set you up against any number of eager opponents ready to kick you around the board until you just can't take it any more. I'm sure it's a long-forgotten personal motto of Blood Angels chapter librarians that in order to know the sweet ambrosia of victory one must drink of defeat until the very last bitter dregs, or something to similar effect. Whatever the cost, the Blood Angels shall redeem themselves, as their hands are mere extensions of the Emperor's will, etc. etc. So to keep things interesting, new maps and characters and campaigns must be provided for these extensions of the Emperors will, or the warp will make devils of idle hands. Or something. In typically mercenary Games Workshop style, these sorts of expansions are sold at a premium as DLC for Space Hulk. Just like the board game, so while it's a depressing monetary vacuum for fans, that Games Workshop have licensed an all-consuming Eye Of Terror for bank accounts isn't surprising. Fellow chosen of the Imperium, we must turn back this tide of Chaos! We must invoke... the Emperor's discount! In all seriousness, AU$20 is expensive for what Space Hulk offers. AU$10 would have satisfied the Emperor's chosen far more. The current asking price of AU$5/each for DLC packs is far too much. The best advice here is to wait for the bundle sale before deployment. Like the migration of Tyranid hives, a percentage off will inevitably intersect our space.			"

Considering the requirements of the game, framerates go low and slow (especially with higher numbers of pixels on larger displays). This can be remedied acceptable by reducing graphics quality to medium and changing other settings. There's no pressing need for high framerates, because this a clear turn-based strategy. But smooth-scrolling around the map is necessary to keep track of what's going on. Especially when dropship teleporters malfunction during deployment! A stranded, lone Terminator faced with corridors on several sides makes an easy target for voracious Genestealers. They run in packs, don't let them get close, or even ol'lightning claws can have regrets.The animations of Terminators heroically firing weapons gets repetitive before the end of the second map in single-player. This is quickly and easily solved by turning it off entirely in the options. The animations still play, but the camera doesn't zoom into each Terminator while firing. However, the animations still go on too long. When placing a Terminator with a Storm Bolter into Overwatch mode over a long corridor filled with Genestealers, it's time to go make coffee as literally hundreds of rounds are fired with no way to skip over the animation. It's worth marveling at this once or twice, but quickly becomes boring. The same can be said of the movement, although this can be sped up. However, at maximum speed, Genestealers are more frightening than necessary, and Terminators clump around with like humourously inarticulated style of LEGO-figurines, so fast is as fast as fast goes with that.Of course you can always play online, and the matchmaking server will set you up against any number of eager opponents ready to kick you around the board until you just can't take it any more. I'm sure it's a long-forgotten personal motto of Blood Angels chapter librarians that in order to know the sweet ambrosia of victory one must drink of defeat until the very last bitter dregs, or something to similar effect. Whatever the cost, the Blood Angels shall redeem themselves, as their hands are mere extensions of the Emperor's will, etc. etc. So to keep things interesting, new maps and characters and campaigns must be provided for these extensions of the Emperors will, or the warp will make devils of idle hands. Or something. In typically mercenary Games Workshop style, these sorts of expansions are sold at a premium as DLC for Space Hulk. Just like the board game, so while it's a depressing monetary vacuum for fans, that Games Workshop have licensed an all-consuming Eye Of Terror for bank accounts isn't surprising. Fellow chosen of the Imperium, we must turn back this tide of Chaos! We must invoke... the Emperor's discount! In all seriousness, AU$20 is expensive for what Space Hulk offers. AU$10 would have satisfied the Emperor's chosen far more. The current asking price of AU$5/each for DLC packs is far too much. The best advice here is to wait for the bundle sale before deployment. Like the migration of Tyranid hives, a percentage off will inevitably intersect our space.			"

												Cost me only £4.99 in a sale and that was still £4.50 too much.  No way to equip your troops, so you end up having limited ammo guys and Melee users.Corridoors only 1 tile wide ALL the time.  Overwatch, Overwatch, Overwatch spam.It looks and sounds great for the most part, but its been out for a long time and still has multiple bugs.I apreciate its in the Warhammer universe and they have a ""ruleset"" but I think they need to look at the new XCom game to see how you aproach tactical squad based turn games on the PC.One of the dullest games I have ever played.

												I have always been a huge fan of Warhammer and all the games attatched to it. I have many fond memories of playing Space Hulk with my dad. This game was a huge nostalgia trip for me. It is a very faithful recreation of the game down to the most intricate detail. It's a lot of fun to own your friends over the internet.All this being said, it is very poorly optimized and the system requirements on the Steam store page are a flat out lie. This wouldn't even be an issue if you had the option to turn on and off individual graphics settings but the only options you get are automatic (low, high, ultra and so on). Needless to say, I would NOT have made this purchase if I knew I'd be playing most of the missions at 10 fps or so. If you have a newer video card none of this will effect you but Steam needs to get them to change the ""Recommended"" specs to something like GTX 200+ series instead of the advertised Geforce 9000 series.In short, it's a great game wothy of your time but perhaps not the asking price. If you love tactical, turn-based strategy and the artistic stylings of the Warhammer universe definately get this one on sale. Otherwise, it's not worth your time.			"

												I'm not having fun. This game is flawed.I really, really thought I would like this game. Doing dice rolls makes it so you play the level and fail until you get a lucky roll of the dice. At first I didn't think this would be the case, as you have to make decisions that reflect chances, but the first few levels are designed in a way that it's just dumb luck.I played for 70 minutes before I beat the second level. I beat the first in less than 10 minutes in a single try. The next 60 minutes I played and replayed the second level, fighting good dice rolls. One play through I attempted to break down the door 24 times (3 turns x 4, +6 extra x 2) before a Genestealer knocked it down for me. I killed that Genestealer, then my gun jammed. When I finally won, it took less than 3 minutes.I'm not having fun. This game is flawed.			"

												I am extremely unhappy that I purchased this game, and I got it on the Summer Mega-Sale. The combat is extremely slow, the movement is sluggish, and the only type of customization you can get is for your banner. No equipping marines, no decal changes, no ranks, and not even MUSIC for during the rounds. Not to mention how just plain boring the combat is. This is combat: You engage enemy. You both roll between 1-6. Enemy gets 3 roll attempts to try to beat yours, and if they do you die. No damage, just dead. The same goes with range combat: You roll between 1-6, and if you reach a #, based on the weapon, or above you insta kill the enemy.The ONLY thing that even SLIGHTLY makes me happy about the game, is the little camera in the upper right which shows ""First Person"" what your marine is looking at. Except, apparently, they don't LOOK at their enemy when shooting them. They ""Aim"" by staring off to the left at a wall, unable to even see the slightest bit of the enemy.  I would give this game a 0/10, with absolutely nothing fun about it what so ever. No good combat, no good music, the sound and ambience is terrible, no customization, no ANYTHING other then just roll the dice. If all you want to do is roll the dice to win, I'd recommend Life, Monopoly, or RISK. To put this in prospective... I would like to RETURN the game to them. I don't want my money back, I just want it off my steam game list. How this is still a $24.99 game is beyond me.			"

												I feel disappointed with this:Visuals:I found the visuals of the game to be very enjoyable and captures the atmosphere well of the brand.Animations:Some are great like the some the combat animations others feel a little stiff or unnatural, slow turning springs to mind diagonal movements and genestealer hitting units.Gameplay:What is there is okay, its not chaos gate for those who know what i am talking about. But its enjoyable if anything short in length spanning over 3 level tutorials. Before your are required to pull up your wallet again which brings me to next point.Overpricing:While the game has some good elements and have lots potential i feel the price way of the top for the amount of content, if its a case of the multiplayer elements or cross platforming taking up all the developers time or not, is really hard to tell but nevertheless the pricing of 22,99 euros at normal price without discounts i feel is to much for 3 playable campaign levels. It feels to me like the game is a microtransaction sink where after 3 levels you are left with microtransaction DLC for about 6 euros per mission.Multiplayer/cross platform:I for good reasons have not tested cross platform as i am pc user only and personally have not multiplayer tested it either since i am more a sort of single player kind of person. So to be fair i will leave that out my review so you will have to use your judgement here or look that up elsewhere.ALL IN ALL:For a lower price or adding the DLC levels in for about current price maybe i could support a recommend, but at this state i would only remotely recommend it at a really high end discount like the -75% at best.

												If you like Warhammer 40k there's no reason not to buy it.And if you know the Warhammer 40k tabletop, you know that the dice can be a real b*tch at some point of the game.Here it's the same - sometimes you roll like a god - next turn/mission you are a power-axe swinging terminator on guard and instantly die after the first attack.I now have played ~8h and only completed about 10 missions, as i had to restart some missions over and over again.And if you want all those achievements too... oooooh my... that will take ages.So if you're not one of those guys getting frustrated too easily - get it.The game is not that expensive and will take you for hours into dark hallways of a space hulk full of gene-stealers!Blood for the Bloodgod!Oh... wrong company ^_^			"

												A faithful adaptation of the famous tabletop game by Games Workshop. Being a fan of the original, I've enjoyed this remake since it does stick so close to the rules and gameplay of Space Hulk. This version is not, however, without issues.My biggest gripe is not with Space Hulk's gameplay, but with its poor optimization. A game like this simply shouldn't suffer performance issues when zooming way out of the gameboard, or during ""action cam"" moments. The framerate tends to bottom out in certain specific situations and, while it doesn't ruin the actual gameplay, it is extremely jarring when it happens.Disregarding the technical issues, Space Hulk still isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. Just like the original, the PC version of Space Hulk can be quite difficult to win, and tends to favor lucky die rolls over strategy. Even the most well-executed advance can be ruined by a series of inopportune bolter jams, or a catastrophic autocannon failure. It's simply the nature of the game. However, there's nothing unusual about a boardgame that relies heavily on random die rolls, so I don't fault Space Hulk for this.If you're a fan of the original Space Hulk, or if you enjoy these kinds of boardgames in general, then you'll likely enjoy this PC remake. But if you're the sort who can't stand to have victory snatched away from you by a random die roll, then Space Hulk may not be the game for you.			"

												Space Hulk ReviewOK, first a disclaimer, this is the first review I have written.  Not first video game review first review EVER.  So I haven't reviewed a fridge, a bacon sandwich or a book on the Easter bunny.To begin, some things I like about this gameThe tutorial.  Not only is any kind of tutorial great, especially for games like this.  But an actual good one? Priceless.  The tutorial in this game got me up to speed on how to play this game and introduced new mechanics well.Sound/Music.  Now I must confess I am a GW fan boy but in my opinion they got the sound effects in this just right.  The music is great to boot.Art direction.  Again I believe they have nailed it, Gothic Sci-fi, will skulls all-over.Things I'm not so keen onThe graphics.  This is a small issue but I just wish they were a bit more polished.  They are nice, just not amazing.The meat of it....BBQ Chicken, tastes great but can be messy.This is a turn based strategy game. In which you carefully move and manage a team of the finest Blood Angel Terminators, to circumvent and vanquish terrible Genestealers, and accomplish various objectives.It is set in the famous 40K setting from GW.  This is a grim future where humanity's once advanced technology is in decline, beset by foes on all sides, no hope, no final victory only a slow and painful decline.The section of the universe this game focuses on is groups of highly advance indomitable Space Marine Terminators undertaking boarding actions on vast Space hulks.  Fending off the lightning fast Genstealer menace (think xenomorph).Its very much an elite group of butt kicking stone blocks, versus overwhelming deadly, agile, supreme killers.Now as I have mentioned I am a huge fan of this Universe so I would whole heartedly recommend this game!Now from a point of view of someone who knows nothing about this 40k nonsense and doesn't know his Bolter from his Las pistol, this game is still worth a look in.  Some of may go over your head or seem a bit grim and weird, but I think a good time can still be had with this and you never know it might get you into the geeky miniature painting gaming stuff :)Buy this if you are a fan, give this a chance if your not and it happens to be on sale.

												How do I describe how awful this game is? Should I start with the ridiculous low percentage given for any firing done by terminators? Or how about the low survival rate for space marines in ♥♥♥♥ING TERMINATOR ARMOR, which should make them AT LEAST as good as genestealers, whereas in the game they are weak pathetic children in the ring against Mike Tyson. How about the wonky animations, or the inability to cancel actions or undo them on your turn in a game where each movement could be the difference between victory and defeat? These are just a few of the reasons that this game is GARBAGE, and I would recommend the board game version....oh wait, that♥♥♥♥♥♥costs $100 and up on ebay due to GW's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ limited release of the game. ♥♥♥♥ you space hulk, and ♥♥♥♥ games workshop.

Fix your bloody game!While the game is actually enjoyable (when it works) I can't condone the cost of the game and its dlc campaigns which I feel don't justify the cost versus the content. Not to mention they make you pay for an additional chapter, and the customisation of your banner and level of freedom you have is a joke.I got this game during the Steam summer sale (3 quid for 2 copies). Having played it, there is no way, in hell, with the lack of content present in this game, that it's worth 22,99 euros. No amount of reason or defense can condone such a price considering the extra cost added on top of that if you want the extra campaigns.			"

												When this game was first released it was a shambolic, buggy mess.  I have heard that many of the bugs have since been fixed, but it really isn't good enough to sell a game as a full price release offering just ten or so missions, which is not even fit for purpose.  I played for 7 hours and that was really enough for me.  The initial experience has probably soured my opinion of the game permanently.  There is some strategy and enjoyment here but the game is slow, repetitive and looks terrible.  Perhaps the greatest failing for me was the complete lack of customisation or any connection the player feels towards his marines.  You can't even choose the marine's loadouts or name them and they don't increase in ability in any way in between missions.  This means you have no attachment to any of the marines and don't care when they die.  All in all, not enough time was spent making this game and it lacks any real innovation or little touches that would have made it an enjoyable title and done the IP justice.			"

												This game is a faithful interpretation of the board game.If that is what you are looking for, you will be happy with the end result.The AI is acceptable, and the convenience of having the game handle dice rolls and special rules is really nice.For lovers of the board game, I'd recommend the following settings:1) set the animation speed to ""fast""2) turn off the extra combat animations (they are cinematic sequences that get a bit tedious)3) turn off the over-the-shoulder camera view (a neat feature, but it clogs up the screen)My ONLY complaints are (1) that you can ""undo"" combat dice rolls that occur on your own turn (breaking the value of some of the achievements) and (2) the inclusion of that RIDICULOUS ultra-grind achievement involving killing 40,000 genestealers (the completionist in me can't stand that kind of crap) "

												I really like the original Space Hulk board game. I really like the Warhamme 40 000 universe. I really like to kill the alien. Please note that my rant below concerns only the single player version of the game, I didn't want to waste further time testing the multiplayer part.This game is crap. Poor and repetitive sounds and clunky animation, only so-so graphics, unintuitive controls (hotkeys) and silly AI. Well, there's no reason whatsoever to play this if you have any other boardgame and an extra person available. With the computing power available nowadays, why didn't this game utilize the resources available? I thought this would be an evolution of the board game, but alas, that was not to be. It's exactly the same as the basic board game (without any of the expansions published to the earlier editions). The original board game was good because of the critical dice rolling and face-to-face gaming. This PC version removes those two aspects and there's not much left to enjoy. Get it if you get it at a ridiculous discount, you're willing to forgive a game anything as long as it's wh40k or if you really don't have anything or anyone else to play with than a simple AI. (if the latter, there's better games for that out there) "

												This game is pretty good, but way overpriced for what you get if you pay full price for it. This game is the Space Hulk board game transferred to PC, to the extent that as you play you can look at a box in the corner of the screen where it shows you the random number generator 'rolling dice' for every shooting attack or hand to hand combat attack. In all honesty this game isn't in the same class as the previous incarnation of Space hulk on the PC, especially the venerable 'Vengeance of the Blood Angels', which took the concept of Space Hulk and made something true to board game, but not a direct lift of it like this version. Having said that, if all you want is to be able to play the board game on our PC and watch Terminators and Genestealers fight it out, it's worth considering. It is a fun diversion and enjoyable while it lasts, though it's very much NOT worth the full RRP. I got this for just under £8 in the Steam sale and I'd say that around that price is right for it. £20 for a game you can blast through the main campaign of in little more than 10ish hours isn't worth it unless you are a diehard fan of the franchise.In short, if you can find it cheap, try it if you like TBS games or have fond memories of playing Space Hulk, if not, move along.

												I like this game but it isn't for everyone.  It is a slow-paced game based on an old board game, so yes it even uses an algorithim based on 6 sided dice.  If you are a hardcore Warhammer 40k fiend like me then go ahead and get this game.  It is fun and nostalgiac.  But wait till it goes on sale.  It is not worth $30 in any form or fashion.  I got it for $5 and then I bought the DLC which brought my total cost to about $24 for everything.  I have some buyers remorse.  The DLC should be about 50-75% cheaper as well.   Plus lets face it, Games Workshop has been cornholing us for years on thier games and miniatures.  They do not deserve the money anymore.   The only good thing they have left is the Black Library novels and the RPGs Deathwatch and Dark Heresy.   The universe is great for video games also if they can keep a good publishers and not eff up thier games like the did Space Marine multiplay....   SPace Marine is/was one of the best games EVER!  And BEAUTIFUL!  A truly wonderful 40k experience, but they hosed the multi-play and ruined the game and lost money...Sorry for the related tanget.    General audience = pass,  Hardcore 40k fan = try and get main game for less than $5 or the whole collection for less than $10-$12.			"

												Thought this was a really great game, only played the main one without the expansions so far (although I do have them) and despite what others said I don't think it's a short game & the bolters don't jam all the time. I found them to be very reliable.Terminators do die easily it combat though, but Genestealers are meant to be able to cut through their armour like paper so considering that they do survive more often that you'd think.From what I understand this is a straight conversion of the board game so all the 'rules' and game play come from that.

Sloooow animations abound and It feels like an amateurish attempt at a space hulk PC game. Actually I've played a lot of amateur games that are a lot more polished than this.All in all, needs a bucket load more polish. More than might ever be polished into it with updates unfortunately, wait for their next attempt altogether, if there is one. I got it at 66% off, 7 quid ish, and that was too much, wait for 3.74 in my opinion!			"

												Many of the early reviews about this game talked about the clunky movement of the Genestealers, but having just purchesed this game on my windows 10 laptop, my inital reaction is WOW.  Maybe they added a few patches when it first came out but I've had no trouble with any poor movements, the Genestealers move fast in normal mode, but you can speed movements up on both Genestealers and Marines. (Although if you are a fan of the board game I don't know why you would want to)This game is fantastic, and I can't beleive anyone who likes the board game would be dissapointed in this. The graphics, movements and action are fantastic (Espeically the Gat Gun cutting a genestealer in half), and it gives the same sense of dread as the board game, if not more so when you see the genestealers runnng along a nearby corridor.  The Space Marines look great and the head cam view from them in the top right corner gives the real sense of narrow dark corridors. The missions are a challenge in Normal Mode, god only knows what they'll be liked in Expert mode.Such a shame the company behind this game aren't going to be making anymore of the expansions for it. If you are tempted, I'd advise buying the bundle pack wth all expansions included.I'd give this game 10 out of 10			"

												Steam's binary recommendation system does not really help games like Space Hulk. I played the original board game and this is a very faithful replication of that experience, right down to the OMFG MY BOLTER JAMMED AGAIN ARE YOU KIDDING ME MY ENTIRE SQUAD IS NOW DEAD moments that made your entire strategy collapse thanks to the roll of some unfriendly dice. The gameplay, as most reviewers have stated, is also a bit slow. I do not believe many people who did not play the board game would enjoy this, and it's somewhat overpriced, so it's hard to recommend. If you can pick it up on sale and have a friend to play against (you cannot play on the same side), it's an option if you're into turn-based strategy games.			"

												Classic Board Gaming made easy!  I'm not sure why so many people are down on this game.  The board game is out-of-print and sells for over $300 dollars, and if you were to invest in it, what are the odds you'll find someone to actually play it with?  For a tenth of that, you can play on your own or join with other fans easily.  Plus extra content?  It's an easy sell.  I'd say the only complaint I have is that so few other races aren't represented.  Space Hulks effect the entire universe, and some races actually use them for their own purposes.  Future Add-Ons that feature defending the Hulk as Orcs or Chaos, or even cleansing it as Tau or Eldar would be so much fun since they have their own rules and squads.  It would make for a much more dynamic game with lots more replayability.  Either way, what you get is a lot of fun and worth it.			"

												I played the original board game of this once or twice back in the day, but I'll be honest with you...it was one of those games I found to be SO heavy in rules and the many little exceptions thereof, that I never really got my head around it enough to enjoy it.  Fortunately, with the advent of these nifty new thangs they have these days called ""video games"" - that is, ones more complicated than Space Invaders or whatever was around when the Space Hulk board game first reared its ugly mug - you only have to remember about HALF the rules, and the computer remembers the other half for you.  It even helpfully points out all the options you have for your next move, as opposed to ""tough♥♥♥♥♥♥for not remembering rule number 357 in the manual, that may just have saved your life back there"".  God bless video games for allowing people like me to unapologetically live out the rest of our days as the unrepentent dumb-arses we truly are.   So what of the merits of said video game, then?  Well, they say there's no accounting for taste, and the rather poor metascore of this amazingly well-designed turn-based strategy game would seem to lend some credence to that assertion.  Heck, I don't even LIKE turn-based strategy games that much, not least of all 'cause I'm such a tactless buffoon, and yet this one has proven thus far to be just challenging enough for me, while still eminently completable.  Thus far.  Admittedly I'm only about seven or eight missions in, and more than one of them has required multiple attempts to conquer, but if you're willing to gradually learn from your errors and accept that sheer dumb luck plays something of a part (though not TOO huge a part...careful forethought and planning will still mostly see you through), then you know what, you just may find this as addictive as I've found it so far.     It's very ""more-ish"" actually...the only reason I'm not gonna play another mission right now is that it's 5am in the morning and seeing since the last couple of missions took me an hour or so to complete, I should probably just finish this review and go to bed before the sun rises, like these ""normal"" people supposedly aspire to doing.  Good thing I don't currently have one of those evil ""job"" things to stop me from being so gosh-darned productive with my life...yes indeedy, GOD BLESS VIDEO GAMES.  And God bless Steam for giving me thousands of the cursed things to play before I finally lay down in a pauper's grave with ""Did nothing, achieved nothing"" as my epitaph.  But they'll be wrong, oh so wrong.  'Cause I've been a SPACE MARINE, ♥♥♥♥ you all.  A Space Marine who has led squads in successful missions against the wretched Genestealers.  Saint Pete'd better be takin' THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥into account when I'm linin' up for my place in Paradise, I tell ya...Verdict: 9.5/10.(Oh, and in the interests of a more ""balanced"" review, just a couple of quick criticisms...namely the almost complete absence of in-game music, and the somewhat overly expensive price tag, given ""what it is"".  But that's why Steam have about a dozen-plus sales a year...for cheap-arses like us, right?  I'll say it again...GOD BLESS STEAM.  Can I have some free stuff now, please?)			"

												I loved this game for what it was, a faithful no frills recreation of the Space Hulk board game, but some months back when the multiplayer was revamped it totally killed the game (at least for a player like me who doesn't have many IRL friends who are into this sort of thing). Before you could create an asynchronous game, log off, and wait for someone else to join at which point you'd  essentially be playing by mail. I was playing the game every day, often with the full alotment of five games going... and it was great, something I could log into when I got home, and before I went to bed  (and maybe a few more times depending on the circumstances) and play my turns.Then the devs introduced a lot of new features, but also changed the games lobby so that games had to be set up in real time... and well damn, I've logged on a few times since then, but never have I found someone setting up a game... and I haven't been able to play since.

This game is utter rubbish and a disgrace to the name of the game, it does not do the original game justice in any shape or form, it feels totally incomplete and buggy as all hell.Just do not give this company your money, do not praise bad creations.

												Had a few doubts about this one from reading the initial reviews, but I saw it in the Steam sale and thought ‘What the hell?’. And I'm glad that I did.The game is pretty much exactly like the Space Hulk board game that I remember playing when I was younger, except the dice roles are handled automatically (although you can see the dice rolls if you like). In the single player campaign, you play as the Blood Angel Space Marines whilst the genestealers are controlled by the computer AI. The game doesn't particularly add anything that wasn't in the board game, which could be considered a bit of a missed opportunity but fans of the board game will probably be pleased about this. Personally, I felt that the option to change your squad setup for each mission could have added some variety to the game, and could have increased the replayability.Overall, I enjoyed playing through the single player campaigns currently available, and would certainly recommend this to anybody who likes the board game or turn-based strategy in general. There is a mission editor planned, as well as additional DLC campaigns, which will help to provide additional content once you've polished off the main campaign. It also features multiplayer options, allowing you to play online against your friends.			"

												This Steam version of Space Hulk is missing critical rules from the 4th Edition of the actual board game.The absence of these rules does break the game a bit for the marines and in the end you are not getting the full version of the game if you buy this.What's missing:- jams don't clear like they're supposed to during the mission status phase. This means you have to waste 1 of the 4 action points you get per marine to clear the jam on the next round. Considering marines only get 4 action points per turn, always losing 1 when you jam (and you jam A LOT in this Steam version) is bogus and shouldn't happen. The rules were ommitted- overwatch is supposed to be a voluntary action, but the game won't ask you if you want  to do it. This is bad because it can generate unwanted jams.If 2 marines are on overwatch and the 1st marine that fires kills the target, the 2nd marine still fires at empty space and sometimes jams. Now you're wasting an action point next round to clear it (when it should have been cleared for free as per the rules)- marines are supposed to be able to use command points during the genestealer's turn if a marine sees a genestealer take an action in LOS. The game only uses CP for unjamming, and it doesn't even ask you if you want to unjam...it just does it automatically.This results in bad situations where a marine is in a tight space on overwatch, and a marine is covering a long hallway but the hallway marine spends the CP to unjam and when the tight space marine jams, there's no CP left.The player has no tactical say in what jams get unjammed with CPAdd to this horrible randomization of the dice, and you get a faulty, broken version of the 4th Edition that isn't complete and isn't worth playing because you aren't getting the full, complete rules.Stay away unless you don't care about hurting your chances to win as the marines.

												As a big 40k fan and passionate GW collector, I was excited when I heard about this title. The images and videos really looked amazing, they still do. However, everything you can do in this game... feels unfinished. The sounds, the visuals, unit movement, unit behaviour. Feels like they just used some very early prototypes of everything and released it.			"

												Well, despite the pretty terrible metacritic rating, this game is actually pretty decent.Clearly a lot of bug fixing has been done since the release as I have encountered no problems (other than frequent jams on overwatch :P)If you are looking for a very faithful recreation of the original board game, this is what you want.If you want to run around shooting things in direct control, then go buy Space marine instead.

												Space Hulk is one of those games that's always in my mental running for ""favorite board game of all time.""  It's a clean, simple design that still manages to be strategic, thematic, and atmospheric.  You don't often see all those qualities together in the same game, which makes it hard for me to not hold it with the reverence that I do.  Oh, and by the way, it's essentially the movie Aliens.  I'm not sure if we can be friends if you're not down with Aliens.  Yet I'm also a strong believer in there being something magical about playing board games face to face with friends.  I don't really do mulitplayer gaming digitally at all, since it fall short in comparison to having friends over for board games.So here's the deal with this Space Hulk game.  It's not worth $30.  If you're looking at the game right now and it's $30, don't buy it.  It's not up to that level and Full Control are out of their minds for thinking so.  That being said, this is a _GREAT_ game at $10.  It's Space Hulk, folks, no doubt about it.  There's a couple rules tweaks here and there (clearing a jam and how the flamer works for example), but this a very well done implimention of 3rd edition Space Hulk.  So what makes this not worth $30, particularly when it's a game that I at one point spent $100 on?  Polish.  The animations are servicable, but at times requires some imagination.  Yeah, imagination, let's go with that.  It's the kind of stuff I'd be completely okay with in a $5 game I got on my iPhone, but not in a $30 one I got on my PC.  There's a couple of other nagging things like scoping out the map being a little bit slow.  The default Terminator animations are PAINFULLY slow, but you can now adjust that.  Nothing deal breaking for sure, but things I would have felt more disappointed by had I paid full price.Bottom line is that if it's on sale, there's alot of fun that can be had here.  If you've never been fortunate to play the board game, this is a fine way to do so without selling a kidney.  It's one of the most influential board games ever published, especially in regards to video games, as you can see its DNA in games like Fallout and XCOM.Oh, and while it's not necessary to use the timer, I certainly wouldn't dismiss it either.

												If, like me, you loved the board game, then you will love this. Don't buy this expecting an all out action FPS. You wouldn't buy a game based on Scrabble then complain all it was was a Scrabble game. It is what it is a damn good representation of the board game without crawling about on your hands and knees and crushing the figures it took you 5 hours to paint with a brush with two hairs on it, whilst complaining that you're all waiting for John to take his turn but he's busy skinning up. Great game, great memories.			"

It is a great game if you don't expect it to ever lose the feel of being a board game. To improve the feeling, they added pict-recorder-feeds from the Terminators, a nice touch in my opinion. That being said, you WILL suffer, because you have to sacrifice some of your men, you WILL curse the dice when your weapon jams or explodes, you WILL yell at your fate, because you are missing that one action point that would turn this clumsy tin can of a Terminator around. But if you're still reading this, you probably will have a lot of fun playing it.			"

												This game is completely faithful to the GW boardgame. If you liked the original GW game, this computer adaptation is excellent. It's turn-based, so if you're looking for RTS or FPS, steer clear. Knowing the rules of the original game helps, but is not a must. Good game.			"

												Board game eh. Yes it is. Its very much luck based but thats part of the fun. Those who didnt experience the board game can experience a fantastic adventure here. Those who had played might get a bit upset as the computer rolls everything and streamlines everything so that things seem more fluid. Example is when you move a genestealer in the board game with a terminator in overwatch you have to roll reach move to see if its a kill, miss, or a jam. Its gets pretty heated on each move. This game steams it and does all of it at once. takes some of that suspense out of the way but it holds true to the original board game.			"

												So, this is the Boardgame converted to PC - and thats it.  Saves you needing to look for it on eBay, but apart from that there is no 'usage' of the electronic format - the indvidual Terminators look great, but the 'stealers queue up during the Marines turn...which means that the 'action shots' show a row of stealers standing still in a corridor, being gunned down...not very immersive.  In fact, the original Space Hulk game of about 20 years ago was far more dynamic, as it had a real time element - you could see the stealers bearing down on you as you shot at them.Pros: The boardgame on your PC - costs less than the boardgame - if you can even find a copy!Cons: It's the boardgame on PC - and that's it.Overall - if you played the boardgame and liked it, or want a boardgame on your machine - buy this - otherwise, ignore.

												Ever wonder what it would look like for genetically-engineered men in thousand-pound suits of armor to dance?  Well, now you don't have to.  In Space Hulk, you co-ordinate a team of space marines in precision maneuvers through the winding corridors of the eponymious hulks, battling hordes of Genestealers.  While the marines might not move with the grace (or speed) of ballerinas--their movements are more reminiscent of your grandma in her walker, actually--successful tactics require the same level of precise, well-coordinated movement.  Any break in formation, and the aliens will eat you alive.Of course, sometimes a bolter will jam and all of your patience and careful coordination will become so much meaninglessness as the little buggers break your now unprotected choke points and swarm right up your posterior.  But, hey, they say even the best laid plans never survive contact with the enemy, right?Despite the frustratingly random strokes of bad luck, Space Hulk still provides an entertaining experience for the tactically-inclined, though I recommend waiting for a sale before buying it.

												This is an excellent recreation of the board-game. It looks like the board-game, plays like the board-game and I've never eaten the board-game so the comparison now stops. This is not a""modern"" style computer game, so if you buy it expecting all the ""usual"" AAA features then you will be disappointed. No cut-scenes, no character progression, and the editor is still on its way.There were terrible bugs upon release (including a ""no possible win"" scenario). The devs responded with three patches in just over 2 days. (small patches so they could find any new problems easily. Good idea when you are releasing without time to do full testing). They were incredibly apologetic and, more importantly, very quick with the fixes. This gives me a lot of hope going forward. Co-op play and editor are promised as ""no more to pay"" add-ons.The multiplayer has a lot of woes, with the match-up system pairing you against people who are offline. If you know someones email address, you can ""pick"" them that way and be assured a match. I have played multi-player sucessfully & it could well be the best feature of the game, as nothing compares to a living, thinking opponent. Also, if I get beaten, its because they outplayed me, not that their twitch reflexes are better.To my friends, I think you would enjoy it if you already know what Space Hulk is. If you don't, then not so much. But drop me a line or give me a bell and I will happily elaborate.			"

												All very well put together board-game conversion. Control wise, the game stands head and shoulders above other current turn-based tactical games. It has a very clear event (dice) log and explains itself very well (except for exact line-of-sight rule). In addition to that, it has crisp controls including an undo button and decent pathing. The game (despite the slow and cumbersome nature of your troops) does not in any way waste your time. Enemy turns are lightning-fast, cutscenes can be completely turned off, animations sped up to ludicrous levels and you can command other units, while one is moving, something that I have been dearly missing from all turn-based games I have been playing recently.Gameplay wise, it is Space Hulk. Your team may very well die because you rolled too many doubles (both attack die showing the same number) in a turn. Overwatch is king. Assault cannons go boom. And genestealers always win in melee.			"

Just like the board-game, it is up to the player to ""imagine"" the Genestealers moving quickly across the walls of the Hulk and their opponents, the Space Marines firing continously at the Xenos.

That being said, you WILL suffer, because you have to sacrifice some of your men, you WILL curse the dice when your weapon jams or explodes, you WILL yell at your fate, because you are missing that one action point that would turn this clumsy tin can of a Terminator around. But if you're still reading this, you probably will have a lot of fun playing it.			"

												Had a few doubts about this one from reading the initial reviews, but I saw it in the Steam sale and thought ‘What the hell?’. And I'm glad that I did.The game is pretty much exactly like the Space Hulk board game that I remember playing when I was younger, except the dice roles are handled automatically (although you can see the dice rolls if you like). In the single player campaign, you play as the Blood Angel Space Marines whilst the genestealers are controlled by the computer AI. The game doesn't particularly add anything that wasn't in the board game, which could be considered a bit of a missed opportunity but fans of the board game will probably be pleased about this. Personally, I felt that the option to change your squad setup for each mission could have added some variety to the game, and could have increased the replayability.Overall, I enjoyed playing through the single player campaigns currently available, and would certainly recommend this to anybody who likes the board game or turn-based strategy in general. There is a mission editor planned, as well as additional DLC campaigns, which will help to provide additional content once you've polished off the main campaign. It also features multiplayer options, allowing you to play online against your friends.			"

												Space Hulk is one of those games that's always in my mental running for ""favorite board game of all time.""  It's a clean, simple design that still manages to be strategic, thematic, and atmospheric.  You don't often see all those qualities together in the same game, which makes it hard for me to not hold it with the reverence that I do.  Oh, and by the way, it's essentially the movie Aliens.  I'm not sure if we can be friends if you're not down with Aliens.  Yet I'm also a strong believer in there being something magical about playing board games face to face with friends.  I don't really do mulitplayer gaming digitally at all, since it fall short in comparison to having friends over for board games.So here's the deal with this Space Hulk game.  It's not worth $30.  If you're looking at the game right now and it's $30, don't buy it.  It's not up to that level and Full Control are out of their minds for thinking so.  That being said, this is a _GREAT_ game at $10.  It's Space Hulk, folks, no doubt about it.  There's a couple rules tweaks here and there (clearing a jam and how the flamer works for example), but this a very well done implimention of 3rd edition Space Hulk.  So what makes this not worth $30, particularly when it's a game that I at one point spent $100 on?  Polish.  The animations are servicable, but at times requires some imagination.  Yeah, imagination, let's go with that.  It's the kind of stuff I'd be completely okay with in a $5 game I got on my iPhone, but not in a $30 one I got on my PC.  There's a couple of other nagging things like scoping out the map being a little bit slow.  The default Terminator animations are PAINFULLY slow, but you can now adjust that.  Nothing deal breaking for sure, but things I would have felt more disappointed by had I paid full price.Bottom line is that if it's on sale, there's alot of fun that can be had here.  If you've never been fortunate to play the board game, this is a fine way to do so without selling a kidney.  It's one of the most influential board games ever published, especially in regards to video games, as you can see its DNA in games like Fallout and XCOM.Oh, and while it's not necessary to use the timer, I certainly wouldn't dismiss it either.

												Well, despite the pretty terrible metacritic rating, this game is actually pretty decent.Clearly a lot of bug fixing has been done since the release as I have encountered no problems (other than frequent jams on overwatch :P)If you are looking for a very faithful recreation of the original board game, this is what you want.If you want to run around shooting things in direct control, then go buy Space marine instead.

												This is the board game recreated on the PC. It is really fun, and if you know what this is you will love it. If you do not know what Space Hulk is, basically it is a turn based game where one team is the futuristic ""space-men"" and the other are ferocious aliens. The game simulates dice rolls, so this speeds up the process of playing the game, though, I know for many the fun is physically doing that. If you don't want to shell out 200+ bucks for the board game, like the fast automated dice rolls and would prefer the automatically setup maps etc then this is perfect! Seriously one of the most fun games I have. "

												Board game eh. Yes it is. Its very much luck based but thats part of the fun. Those who didnt experience the board game can experience a fantastic adventure here. Those who had played might get a bit upset as the computer rolls everything and streamlines everything so that things seem more fluid. Example is when you move a genestealer in the board game with a terminator in overwatch you have to roll reach move to see if its a kill, miss, or a jam. Its gets pretty heated on each move. This game steams it and does all of it at once. takes some of that suspense out of the way but it holds true to the original board game.			"

												Space Hulk the boardgame was brutal in every aspect - forcing you to be aware of moves and play conservatively enough to be on the good side of the dice gods. The conversion from board to video has not changed much of anything. It still stings to watch a good terminator die, and feels great to come out on top when you know your man should be dead. It is a good gateway to the grim-dark of the 40K universe - if you're alright with the knowledge that you're not going to win every game.			"

												My recommendation is only Valid to fans of Warhammer 40k & Squad Tactical Turned based games. First off I have to say that like many others I was hoping for a Warhammer 40k: Space Hulk done like the excellent Xcom reboot from 2012.  I had seen, but never played the original Space Hulk, and have never got into the table top original.After seeing it initially I thought oh, if it is like Incubation then I will still love it. It still did not have the variation that Incubation gave but I played through a few hours before having a copy purchased for me.  As such I can honestly say I knew what I was getting.  The Good:  To the best of my understanding it is a reasonably faithful recreation of the table top version and has the feel of a Warhammer game initially.The Bad:  It is a recreation of the table top game with tolerable graphics, bland sound, and no atmosphere in either.  the game play easily gets repetitive and most stages can be completed by holding corridors with ordinary bolter armed dreadnoughts on overwatch. It is the height of Rinse and Repeat.  You have no sense of involvement in the squads or their members, meaning i feel no personal loss when a team member goes down other than annoyance, The price is too high for the game and I feel it should have been in the $15 range.The Personal:  Having had it purchased knowing the faults you may wonder why. Well.....1.  Warhammer, duh!  A fan does it and just fills in the blanks in his mind.  I imagine the sounds that      are missing, I picture the graphics being better and my imagination puts me there.2.  Squad Tactical Turn based game.  I love them and so will forgive some.3.  Despite there being very little variation it still is interesting in the begining each each turn in      planning out deployments and deciding how to achieve the objective. after the first 5 minutes      though it is all auto pilot.4.  I grew up playing games on an Atari 2600, then Nintendo Famicom, Sega 16bit, and early PC      games like Wolfenstein and Blake Stone.  Graphics and sound are not the only things that attract      me I want solid game play mechanics and while simplistic this game feels solid in that aspect to      me.I give this a personal score of 6/10 and only because I am ignoring the (personally feel) high price.  If i had to calculate the pricing into my view of the score i would make it 4.5/10.			"

												Space Hulk is one of my favourite board games. This isn't quite good enough to replace it. Space Hulk is fast and tense, whereas this game is slower and, without those time constraints, easier. However it's also at least £100 cheaper and provides good value when compared to the board game.			"

												For someone who never played the original tabletop and is only recently being introduced to the 40k universe, I wholeheartedly recommend this title for any strategy fan. The die rolls and rulings are meticulously recreated from what I've been told and they are infuriating. The combat is fatalistic and unforgiving.The graphics are of a fine quality for a game of this type and the voiceover narration really gets me into the spirit. I'm still getting accustomed to the handling of this game and thus end up dying a lot due to miscalculations and mistakes. Avenge me, brothers.			"

												A nice remake of the original boardgame and the video game from 1993.  It's a true boardgame conversion, you can see the trusty D6 score displayed with the shooting starts. So no skillbased shooting and fancy moving around, it's as much down to luck as it is good placement of marines and the ability to use AP nd CP to full effect. So beneath the fancy exterior it's just a boardgame. So are you not a fan of the original Space Hulk game this is proberbly not for you. But as for us fans I think this is a good game, at least way better then the clunky old one from -93 or the fan based once I dared to try. If on sale, yes buy. Full price, not sure, unless a hard core fan.			"

												I really love this game. I have never played the boardgame version, as it is pretty pricey. I am glad I get to experience it for much cheaper on PC!Graphics are great, you get a real sense of the claustrophobic ship halls. The little first person view in the corners shows what your soldiers see and adds a lot to the atmosphere. This game is very challenging, but doesn't really seem unfair. Getting to your objective alive requires careful planning. There are a decent number of campaign levels, enough that you have fun but don't get bored.One of my favorite additions is hot seat multiplayer.

It could use a major helping of love for the user interface: overlays to help plan moves, the ability for teammates to ping the map when discussing strategy, an undo button for when a click doesn't do what you intended.As it is, the game isn't worth the $25, and the extra maps aren't worth $5, but if you can pick this up when it's on sale, you won't be as disappointed.

												It's a basic translation of the Space Hulk board turn-based game.

												First off, let me say that I am a 40K player and a fan of Space Hulk the board game. I am invested in the background.Here are my first impressions after about 6 hours of play. I will update this as I complete more of the game and the DLC.The game sets you up with a series of missions with very specific and very basic objectives and perameters. I feel like the missions are varied within the confines of the game they developed. Unfortunately, that means that I am typically slowly moving from point A to point B killing and meeting objectives along the way. Overall, this is a good adaptation of the board game and enjoyable to play. As a player, I enjoy the methodical setup of killing fields and ensuring that all of my marines exit the level safely, and that I have completed the special objective as per the steam achievements. There is so much that could be better though. Please let me outfit my terminators and develop them from mission to mission. Let me be more connected to the game in this way and it would increase my playtime.Graphically the game is fine. There are some animations that are silly, I have terminators shooting eachother with overlapping overwatch. The animations can often cut through the walls and through each other. This is a problem that should be fixed. I really like the camera view they offer to show what the terminators see. The atmosphere and levels are good.We can see what is going on behind the scenes with the dice rolls. I feel like I really understand what is expected of me to hit an enemy, and my chances in combat. I almost feel like I could recreate the board game from this virtual one, and that transparency is great. With it coming down to calculated probabilities and chances, the difficulty of this game is moderate/moderate-low for very strategic gamers. I am by no means awesome, and I can get through each level with losing no one when I put my mind to it. Everything is up to these calculated risks. This is where another gripe comes to mind with this game: the undo button.. I can undo and retry combat and get a different roll/result. If I were to abuse this, it would be game breaking.Speaking of game breaking - the game is very stable!So.... enjoy this game, and remember to overwatch! Leave a few command points to spare - these terminators have the worst storm bolters in the world!===== More to come "

												Space hulk has a great old school feel and is fairly simple in terms of the more modern games that are available on the market these days. However having played the board game with friends when i was younger, as well as remembering the original versions on PC this revamp has breathed new life into what was always a successful turn based strategy game based in the Warhammer 40K universe. It has been slated by many as not being very good, but i think thats a very quick to judge reaction and most likely becuase if playing on the higher skill levels it's a very challenging game.The single player campaigns are very scussessful and the game does a great job at setting the tension and challenge of pitting an elite fighting force of space marine terminators against overwhelming odds in the face of the sheer number of alien genestealers. as strategy games go this one has been a great one and is often challenging to the point of frustration, but i have enjoyed every minute. the revamp is also promoting the development of new content including other chapters and missions which i hope continue as it is making a classic game with a face lift even more playable and enjoyable.I am yet to try the multiplayer component but believe that placing two human players head to head will do nothing but extend it's playability. i'm about 10 missions in now and feel everyone has been fun to complete, and many have been replayed a number of times to try and meet the additional bonus mission criteria.In short if you are a fan of 40K this is a great game to have, if you like strategy or turn based strategy this is a great game to have, or if you like a challenging game this is a great game to have. Yes there are flasher more action packed games out there and some with better graphics. however that being said, the playability, style and action that people associate to the 40K universe and space hulk all lend themselves well to this modern revival. the terminators have the great bulky plodding feel that they should, the genestealers burst under hails of autocannon fire as you'd imagine them to, and facing down sometimes overwhelming numbers has the frustration i'm sure a space marine might feel fighting to the bitter end.Pros:Good game, easy to play and challenging to master, has a vintage feel with a modern take and is playable across platforms (i can play PC users from my ipad) and new DLC is now being producedCons:not many to mention being a fan of the game, and the 40K universe but part of me still longs for a graphics or models update, and the desire to be able to fully customise my own chapters in game.

												This game is not so good, sadly. I really love the W40k Universe and this game is quite ok on the art-design side. However there is not much of a game to it. You mainly position your troops and wait and watch them kill stuff. Furthermore the outcome of a combat action is very much dependent on luck. The last thing I want to say is that this game seems to be carelessly programmed in a way that if you issue a move command the game does not calculate the needed number of action points correctly. So you are usually better of walking step by step. It will save you a few AP.If you are no fan of Warhammer Games, this is no fun at all for you. If you are, well, I guess you'll have one hour of fun, but I recommend playing Space Hulk the Board Game with a friend.			"

												This game is as simple as coherent. Campaign is quite short (approximatley 10 hours) and has erratic difficulty. Can't tell much about multiplayer since it seem to be pretty dead and I wasnt able to get a match up yet. Surely not a flawless game in every aspect but if you generally like turn based strategy and WH40K you will propably have fun with it, even if you don't played the SpaceHulk-boardgame before.  If you see this game on sale for a low prize you won't regret buying it.			"

												This game is a 100% accurate recreation of the board game.It is a terrible video game. There are two reasons why. The first is that the movespeed of your Terminators is so slow it takes forever to complete your moves. The second is that it's impossible to turn off the really low quality close up kill cam shots which occur about every single time you kill something.This game is not something I can honestly recommend, as these two intrusions to game play completely destroy any atmosphere the game might generate.

												First off, let me say that I am a 40K player and a fan of Space Hulk the board game. I am invested in the background.Here are my first impressions after about 6 hours of play. I will update this as I complete more of the game and the DLC.The game sets you up with a series of missions with very specific and very basic objectives and perameters. I feel like the missions are varied within the confines of the game they developed. Unfortunately, that means that I am typically slowly moving from point A to point B killing and meeting objectives along the way. Overall, this is a good adaptation of the board game and enjoyable to play. As a player, I enjoy the methodical setup of killing fields and ensuring that all of my marines exit the level safely, and that I have completed the special objective as per the steam achievements. There is so much that could be better though. Please let me outfit my terminators and develop them from mission to mission. Let me be more connected to the game in this way and it would increase my playtime.Graphically the game is fine. There are some animations that are silly, I have terminators shooting eachother with overlapping overwatch. The animations can often cut through the walls and through each other. This is a problem that should be fixed. I really like the camera view they offer to show what the terminators see. The atmosphere and levels are good.We can see what is going on behind the scenes with the dice rolls. I feel like I really understand what is expected of me to hit an enemy, and my chances in combat. I almost feel like I could recreate the board game from this virtual one, and that transparency is great. With it coming down to calculated probabilities and chances, the difficulty of this game is moderate/moderate-low for very strategic gamers. I am by no means awesome, and I can get through each level with losing no one when I put my mind to it. Everything is up to these calculated risks. This is where another gripe comes to mind with this game: the undo button.. I can undo and retry combat and get a different roll/result. If I were to abuse this, it would be game breaking.Speaking of game breaking - the game is very stable!So.... enjoy this game, and remember to overwatch! Leave a few command points to spare - these terminators have the worst storm bolters in the world!===== More to come "

												Brought this after the 1.2 patch.  Came in thinking it would be a it rubbish but as i liked the old board game so much, thought it wouldn't hurt to give Steam even more money.As a single player digital version of the board game I actually really love it, the patch they introduced where you could speed up the movement is a definite winner otherwise it would have forced me do a squad broken all over the shop.Multiplayer is messed up.  It's OK if you have a friend to play with, but just getting a random game is annoying and frustrating.  What they need is a quick play button, where you can just select your preferred side and play any mission.  Right now you seem to have to pick the exact mission you wish to play and just hope some other dude is wanting to play that mission as well.You also have to create a separate account for the multiplayer, would have been alot easier just to use steamworks for that.  And setting this up and then trying to get a game with a friend can be bloody frustrating, but once finally jumped the hurdles to set it up, works pretty ok.The actual gameplay of the multiplayer, from what I've experience is rather laggy.  The reveal mechanic of the genestealer side takes a little getting used to and can be a bit annoying with the ever pervasive lag.That being said, the multiplayer games I did experience with a friend were Epic.  Hopefully they will brush up the MP and introduce improvements and if so then this game will be awesome.Right now, it's a great single player rendition of the board game, I can thoroughly recommend it for that.  The multiplayer needs some work but if you have a friend to play with then it's great.			"

												The puzzle aspect of this game is mildly interesting. The bland animations don't add much flavor. The controls are simple, but I often find myself accidentally moving the wrong guy and, you'll find, that you wish there was an ""undo"" button. What this game could use is a little more story element. The Terminators all have names, I don't see why they don't display a little more personality. This is a game where you might play a mission or two but will be too burned out to click ""accept mission"" a third time.			"

												I'm a newbie to the Space Hulk series, having only played a short section of the original DOS game. There are several great things about this game. Firstly it's based on a board game, a very tactical one at that. You have two completely different factions at war. The slow-moving gun-toting Terminators and the vicious Genestealers. The main campaign is composed of a series of missions, each one with different objectives. There are many classes of Terminators which serve to spice up the gameplay such as the melee-crazed ones and those with a flamethrower.The drawbacks are mainly with regards to animation, there are a few clipping issues and generally it doesn't hold up with games such as XCom or Fallout. Graphics are servicable but won't really require a lot of processing power, on the other hand of course it will run on decent laptops. I bought this while it was on a sale and if you like the concept, it may be worth picking up.			"

												Finally a turn based game which isn't about young girls and questionable legality!This is all about big, muscular, strong men with arms that make you feel safe and guns that make you feel scared. It's essentially my last speed dating experience (turns out the old English definition of ""happy and carefree"" has been dropped. Please consult the current definition before going to any kind of speed dating prefixed by that particular term).You play as big men with guns. Your enemies are big aliens with claws.

												Well to start with something meaningful I am a ultra veteran player of different dozens of Tabletops and RPG games and I loved SH and WH4Ok since the first edition manual of the table top. One of the most intriguing things of space hulk was the background and the sense of desperation and haste.It simply lack boths.I really have tryed hard to stand till the end, awaiting for the moment I will have said ""ok, ok now I see..."", but that moment never came.So disappointed. I wish I could have my money back.Also considering the developers had everything already prepared from other past games (like WH40K ones) campaigns already written, as well as an astounding background, and Games Workshop has already tested everything it could be possibly tested, why make people pay 30 dollars? For some awful computer version? If you like the genre, do not waste the money and wait in prayer for the oncoming Spacehulk Deathwinghttp://spacehulk-deathwing.com/ "

												Space Hulk was an interesting purchase for me. I enjoy the 40k universe quite a lot, and if you do as well, you will probably enjoy this game. Its clunky, has a few glitches, lacks customization of Terminator loadouts, costs a lot, isn't too long, and lacks a detailed story. But, I still liked it quite a lot. The game is not worth $30.00. buy it on sale if you are going to. The game has decent length and replayability, but unless you buy a copy for your friend, you won't have anybody to play with. the multiplayer UI is confusing and ineffecient, not to mention almost completely dead. The DLC for this game is more expensive than i'd like it to be. Buy Warhammer 40k storm of vengeance with this game while they are both on sale to get the best of your money. SoV comes with a free DLC package for Space Hulk and Space Hulk unlocks the terminator in SoV.Buy this on sale. if you can, find a personal friend to play with. Do that, and its a great game.			"

												My feeling is that many of the critical reviews I've seen for this game are overly harsh and somewhat miss the point of what this game is supposed to be.  Space Hulk sets out to be a faithful digital recreation of the board game and, at least in my opinion, delivers that experience in precisely the manner I had hoped and expected it would.  The full price set for this game is a bit steep for the amount of content delivered (and the DLC seems similarly overpriced for so few missions), but the game is far more enjoyable and a far better experience than the negative critic reviews would have you believe.  A great buy for fans of the board game or those who enjoy a good turn-based strategy game (especially at a sale price).			"

												This is Space Hulk, the board game, converted to PC.  Why people would review it down for that, I don' t know.  It's a turn-based, dice-luck strategy game with all the rules of the board game translated to their nearest possible equivalent.If you're silly enough to ""undo"" every dice roll just to win the game, I assume you're silly enough to re-roll every dice you ever cast in a real game, and I wouldn't want to play with you.Great fun, and very loyal to the original.  Own those long halls, keep the Genestealers back with psi-powers, cleanse your path with the flamethrower and make it out alive.  I just hope Games Workshop leases out the ""Advanced Space Crusade"" IP to these guys some day.			"

												Did somebody say ""hardcore strategy""? If they did, they were probably referring to this game. I haven't played the table-top original, but I can say that you need to really think when you play this Steam version of Space Hulk. I mean, REALLY think a few moves ahead as though you were playing Chess, because this has an unforgiving and challenging dice-roll system for combat that does not favour the player as in other Warhammer/Citadel franchise games (i.e. Dawn of War II). In terms of gameplay, it's a top-down turn-based layout that somewhat resembles a table-top game. Your units have a limited number of moves per turn including combat abilities. The menus and in-game controls are fairly intuitive, and there's an in-picture Terminator shoulder-cam that gives you a first person perspective of the map which is very cool (It's a bit like watching ""Aliens"" when the marines are exploring the abandoned complex). So, if you've an abundance of patience and want to test your strategic skill, play this game. ***			"

Which begs the question, why buy it at all?

The game lacks some elements I really need in squad-based tactical games : the ability to compose your team as you see fit and the ability to ""move / place around"" your mates in order to get better coverage or advantage. I too often saw me hindered because I needed one specific marine at a specific place, but cannot move him because he was blocked by another one.The game is probably not that bad, especially for the miniature player, but it is definitely not for me.

												As a new Warhammer 40,000 player I am enjoying everything 40K themed that I can get my hands on at present. From collecting and painting the miniatures reading the books (The Horus Hersey saga is just fantastic!) and playing the PC Games - Dawn of War was great btw . I didn't know anything about SpaceHulk, either the PC format of tabletop game until a few weeks back when Games Workshop had a new limited release of the coveted Tabletop version. After hearing about it I decided to go with the PC version as all my money is already going in to amassing a Dark Angel army to game with- I am a fan of stratagy games and this hasn't dissapointed. I am not sure it would have appealed to me quite as much if it was set in a different universe but having said that I am glad I gave it a bash as I am sick of FPS and MMORPG's after years of play. This is something different and it gets you thinking- well worth the money IMO especially as I grabbed it while Steam had it (and some it's DLC's ) on a great 70% off-er :)			"

There's really no PC game features beyond just the board game, even the missions are lifted straight out of the original game; there's no persistence in the campaign, and the UI is pretty finicky.If you are endlessly turgid over the board game and want to be able to play it online with random schmucks, it's great, but otherwise give this one a pass.

												I gave up early on when a single genestealer strolled through my sergeants overwatch, beat him at melee, strolled through the other guys overwatch, killed him as well and then killed the guy behind him while he was busy looking down another hallway, thus killing 3 of my 5 guys in one turn.This is very much a game of chance. You either kill or get killed, there's no in-between.And while you can save your progress, loading requires you to exit into the main menu first, which got tedious the first time I did it.The best way to win is to know every little strategy, which is pretty much reserved for the more hardcore fans of turn-based strategy. That said, it probably captures the spirit of the original Space Hulk game perfectly. Not that I'd know, so if you're into that, this is probably still for you.			"

												This looks like a faithful adaptation of a board game.  Unfortunately it's a rather light boardgame with little depth.  The graphics are pretty poor, even for a TBS game.  Animations don't sync well, for example there's a visible pop when a marine turns 180 degrees, which happens all the time.  Genestealers look like my old genestealer models ... which were the cheap plastic version.Except when deeply discounted here, the iOS version is much cheaper, and I'd feel better about playing such a shallow game on a tablet as opposed to when sitting down at a PC.  Sounds irrational when I type it out, but poking at a tablet is somethin I generally do while other things are going on, so a simple experience seems more appropriate.			"

												I probably should have done more research before quickly grabbing this game.It's very similar to XCOM enemy unknown, except...every level is just a bunch of narrow hallways, and everything can basically kill any of your guys in 1 hit. It's very slow paced, there doesn't seem to be that much strategy to it, besides setting your guys up to guard hallways and ""hoping"" you hit before the enemy can reach you.It also has a very BAD system of ""dice rolling"" which is basically the ""chance"" system in this game which is pretty stupid in my opinion. I guess they were trying to make this ""feel"" like a tabletop visual board game... it doesn't work that well.... and I'd much rather have a % shown of my likihood of success then ""you need to roll a 6+ to break down this door"" wtf? i'm not rolling any dice, there's no reason for that to be included in the game.I'm not going to say it's ""bad"" until i finish the game, I actually enjoy turn based strategy games like this, and will continue playing it however....I can not reccomend this game to others, simply because it's so far off from what a Warhammer game should be, and most will likely be extremely upset at how much it resembles a very confined slow version of XCOM rather than a action packed Warhammer experience.Edit: Just found out this game was actually a reproduction of the board game ""Space Hulk"" which is probably why I have such mixed feeling about this game.

This version is obviously much better but at times feels clunky. Once you figure out a level there is a pretty obvious best way to beat it which doesn't leave much replay value. It's also a bit annoying that melee combat is left entirely to chance, a feature I didn't like in the original game either because you basically always lose.It's entertaining once you figure out what you're doing.

												I'll make this short:The good stuff:+ the gameplay itself is good+ the graphics are more than adequate+ the sound effects are actually well-done; every weapon sounds as powerful as you'd expectBUT, and that's a big one:- the key binds are still not configurable, even after months of players begging for this feature.Seriously? This is 2014. A PC game with non-configurable controls, even if it is a turn-based tactics game, is a huge no-go.So unless - or rather until - this is fixed, I can not, in good conscience, recommend this game; not even at budget price.

												Space Hulk is an odd gaming experience. It's pretty much a pure port of the board game, which is probably the main issue I have with the PC game.I played the board game about 10 years ago and really enjoyed it, and this is a nice way to play the game if you don't have any humans nearby to play with. But, like chess or monopoly, the human interaction is part of the fun; playing against a computer is...well...souless.In my opinion, what this game needed was some RPG elements, like gaining experience points to upgrade your squad, or a more engaging storyline. Something to elevate it beyond the boardgame in a way that compensates for that lack of human interaction.As it is currently, there is no sense of attachment or engagement, which makes the level by level progression of the game feel a little unfulfilling.The game also feels a bit too unfair - the terminators cannot move very much in a turn, their bolters jam at every oportunity, you have a 1 in 4 chance of winning/surviving close combat, the bolter has a 35% chance of killing in the first shot, and the more reliable weapons have very limited ammo. As far as I can see, your only option is to constantly play defensively: placing your men in key positions and setting them to ""overwatch"" or ""guard""; which is difficult when playing an offensive mission.The odds are against you, you will lose often (even in the early missions) and it will start to become boring after a while since it is a machine beating you, and not your buddy who you can laugh with afterwards. You also can't switch and play as the Genestealers in the campaign, so you are stuck as the lumbering terminators with unreliable weapons.In short - if you want to play the Space Hulk board game alone, this is a good option. If you want a fulfilling gaming experience, move along. The regular price is a bit too much for what the game is. If you want to check it out, wait for a sale.			"

												Summary: Based on the best-selling board game and set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Space Hulk is a 3D digital turn based strategy game that recreates the classic claustrophobic board game experience for single player and, thanks to a recent update cross-platform play between PC, Mac and on iOS.Space Hulk is a pretty good adaptation of a great board game. Being a player of the tabletop games that this game is an expansion of, I felt that this game is worth the money, as aforementioned. I really liked the game mechanics, so I also enjoyed the single player campaign, even though it was quite short.I would give Space Hulk  :   8.5 / 10One of the few problems with the game in my opinion are that the quite good DLC's that you can buy cost $5 a piece, and you need to spend $20 to buy the full campaign and even more to get other Chapters, banners, weapons and maps. However, The developers are doing a great job at bringing updates, regularly adding content. They are also very active and responsive on the steam forums.If you liked this game, I would recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown "

												Space Hulk is a game that takes place in the Warhammer 40K Universe. Originally, Space Hulk was a board game that was released in the 80s and recieved very high critical acclaim. This success would later on adapt to Warhammer 40K, which has gained a massive following since its inception.The game has several different campaigns with two of them being DLC. The missions are varied enough from destroying a certain room with a heavy flamer unit, to escort type missions, to even simply destroying the enemy.The campaigns in Space Hulk follow the Blood Ravens, a chapter of the Space Marines, that are seeking revenge on the genestealers for acts against them nearly seven centuries ago. The genestealers are horrifying monsters with lightning fast movement and can tear through armor as though it were paper.Although not the best story I've seen in a strategy game, it is adequate enough considering that this game is an adaption of a board game from the 1980s.Visually, Space Hulk is appealing with its dark, mysterious setting. The Terminators look really cool and are modeled well as if they were Warhammer 40K action figurines themselves. The genestealers also look great and show inspiration from other works such as the Alien franchise. The maps are varied throughout the game and allow the player to play in several to different ways.The gameplay itself is easy to jump into and plays exactly (from what I've observed) the same as the board game counterpart. You won't even need to look at the rules for Space Hulk as it is easy to just hop in and start playing with your friends or against the computer AI.The problems. The game plays dreadfully slow even with the speed setting turned up all the way. Space Hulk only allows for most stages to have one or two ways of actually winning, often time with just placing units on overwatch, puppy guarding genestealer spawn points. The only unlockables in the game are used to customize your multiplayer banner, which you will sometimes recieve. It's a 25% chance really if you're playing on normal difficulty.Space Hulk's developers are very engaged with their community however and I'm sure that within the future, we will see a few changes to Space Hulk and it's gameplay mechanics.As a video game itself, Space Hulk might be something less than desirable from a strategy enthusiast. It's great adaption however of a classic board game and should be played like a board game. Not like the much more popular Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War series, which is an RTS, but a board game. I would wait for this one to go on sale for less than $20 and then grab it. The $30 isn't really justifiable.			"

												I enjoyed this game by taking it for what it is, a boardgame simulator. A turn based strategy game that takes the work out of using dice and looking for another person to play with; thats not to say that you can't play with a friend, but if you're the anti-social kind the computer will take care the second party for you.

												Excellent core system that's true to the board game, but the content is fairly light without investing heavily in DLC. If you can catch this week's humble bundle, do it. Eador and Stronghold: Crusades are definitely worth $2 each. Given its lack of content and variety, I wouldn't value this game at over $5, though a deep discount on the DLC makes them worth the purchase.			"

												I have LOVED the Warhammer: 40,000 series all my life and own all of the strategy games (still looking to pickup the Space Marine + laning spinoff). The squad based style of Space Hulk is very easy to pickup if you have played strategy/squad-based games before. The learning curve is very reasonable and there are a multitude of difficulties you can choose, however, the game can still be very difficult. The game is all about dice rolls, so if you like D&D-style pen&paper mechanics, this game is for you. That being said, it is very easy for your Terminators to be one-shot killed by the enemy in melee situations. Aesthetics are grim and repetitive at times, but still nice to look at. There is a cool function where a front-cam is applied to each of your squad members, and you can see what they see as they move.Overall, I would recommend this game.			"

												Pretty 'meh'Graphics are ok, but the mechanics are clunky: Flamer especially seems to have a random spread, rather than a defined 'shoot here to affect these tiles.'The 'hit=kill, miss=nothing' mechanism - although directly lifted from the board game - leads to some uninspired gameplay.Conclusion: Not bad for a little play, but don't pay full price for it.

												9.5/10This game did what it set out to do, and it did it beautifully. If you remember the first foray into the Warhammer universe...Space Hulk, the Board Game,Then you will love this game. Every rule, lovingly crafted into a beautifully modelled and animated game.This isn't a video game like you're used to, this is more of a board game meets computer-next-gen.I loved it. For video gamers, it's a pure solid TBS. A comprehensive manual within the game itself, explaining every rule and concept in the game. And finally, some added stuff, a few extra options, and upgradeable marines! It adds a slight RPG element. Difficulties to select your level of unforgivingness.Remember two things. Burst fire is useless (really, it is), and there is no undo button.Have fun!			"

												This game comes with 10 minutes of content. The number of missions included was 3 or 4. Either way it only took about 10 minutes to beat them. When I started to look for where the rest of the game was, its locked up in DLC, and then you can play some mutiplayer. Its another games workshop money grab, and not worth it at all. If you want a game with 25 dollars worth of content, go buy something else. I got it for 90% off, $2.50, and even at that rate I feel ripped off.			"

												i have never known a weapon to jam more then a storm bolter. 4 consecutive jams off one terminator in one round of overwhatch.all i can say is save all your ap and cp for your jams. I had high hopes for this game, but it's been let down by a rubbish d6 randomizerin no way worth full price, bareley worth the sale price. i hope the next patch sorts this out.			"

												I saw Space Hulk the boardgame for the first time  way back at GenCon in 1989 or so, and instantly fell in love with it.  This version is very faithful to the boardgame, which may or may not be to your liking.  There have been a few videogame renditions of Space Hulk, but this one is the best so far.  I do feel that XCom: Enemy Unknown is a better tactical wargame experience, but this game is just fine for what it is - fun, old-school boardgaming.  Have fun with it!			"

SH ascension has as much in common with the spacehulk boardgame as DOW has with the WH40K table top game - ie bugger all!this game is a cool laid back way to kill an hour playing old skool tactics, like the hot seat so you and a friend can play terminators and genestealers without having to pay 75£ PLUS  for the boardgame nowadays			"

												Brutally hard and yet there is something about it that keeps you coming back for more. When you complete the later missions you feel as if you truly earned the emperors respect because along the way you have to push forward against unimaginable odds, guard your key areas, and you WILL need to sacrifice many of your units just to get that one guy through that counts. I even sent a heavy flamer who ran out of ammo in the opposite direction as a decoy to lure the enemy away, he didn't get very far, but it was far enough that I could get the rest of the guys in a good position and win. That mission left me with 2 survivours out of 10 and 130+ of the enemy dead (If you've played this, you KNOW that's unheard of).Sure, it's not perfect, there are no cutscenes, and the narration gives you very little to run on in terms of story. It's also overly dependant on luck which means you can have the best strategy and still lose (which I hear they vixed in ascension?) but most of the time you can ""undo"" your last move that missed and try again to even the odds a little (I only figured this out on the last campaign, wish I had known earlier). I got the ultimate pack with all the content while on special so I'm not sure what is original or DLC but the full package has at least 20 hours of game here if you're man enough to stick with it. Some of the later missions (harbinger of torment for example) have an absolutely insane difficulty and a single mission can take you over 4 hours to get right. Thankfuly you can save any time you like but trust me, it doesnt help as much as you think it would, especially if there is a turn limit on the mission. Note: Ascension is not the same missions with a new engine, it's a totally different game with no links to this one. I'm currently waiting for it to come on special but you can be sure I'll pick it up when it does. If it's even half as good as this, I'll be happy, and it's supposed to be better and with a lot more missions!			"

												There's a better free game (Alien Assault) which, although 2D, does a better job at drawing you in. The developers of Space Hulk should play that and find out how this genre should be done.Space Hulk itself is OK. Glitches (bullets firing into the void instead of down corridors, sometimes camera panning going in weird directions) and funky controls (click/drag to change direction can be easily accidentally triggered, especially when trying to move 1 sq forward/back, and ridiculously sensitive camera controls) take away from the experience.The 3D graphics just aren't that good. The marines look OK, but the genestealers look like kids toys and the general quality is more 2003 than 2013. The graphics themselves make the game mechanics look stupid. Bullet trails passing through a corridor of enemies but only rolling against the first is an example.In AA your marines persist between missions, increasing in rank and receiving awards. The 2D graphics are much more to the point and easier to interact with. The UI is vastly more intuitive and quicker to work with. It's just a better game even though it has the same mechanics. Space Hulk is not worth the full price (£19.99 at time of review). Only consider buying it at a discount.			"

												Space Hulk , such a tremendous game within the tabletop wargamin society. The video game however? That is up for debate.As a person who has never played the table top version of this game, I'm somewhat on a mid point opinion about the video game itself. It being a Warhammer 40k game, sure made me interested to buy it. But the gameplay itself? The gameplay takes its roots from the table top version, as in, everything is decided by the dice roller. This offcourse can lead to massive ammounts of RAGE , when a unit of yours misses a door, in front of which it is standing of (literally, one tile away), more than one time, which can cause you to miss the entire turn for that unit, and any unit standing behind it (offcourse, when I say door, I mean on one of those mailfunctioning doors that need to be shot open, or knocked open). This can really screw up whatever strategy you might have come up with , which can increase the difficulty, or just make you have to replay the mission/game from the start.Concerning strategy, the game itself is placed within a Space Hulk (for those that do not know what that is, it's a massive, ancient, space ship, that is filled with tiny corridors (atleast for your Terminators (Space Marines with extremely special suits))). And this is the part what the game does really well, it really makes you feel claustrophobic. Terminators are slow, sluggish, bulky, and the corridors are really really small, wheareas genestealers are fast, agile, and come in large numbers. If you dont cover all accesses , you are going to get slaughtered in close combat. And loosing even a single Terminator can pretty much change the game outcome, whereas genestealers just keep coming and coming. But then again, if you zone in on the genestealer spawn zones, you are going to spend your game watching a cluster ♥♥♥♥, watching the same kill cam cinematic over and over. The graphics are not anything special, theyre really lame , especially if you compare it with DoW 2 graphics. Animations are simplistic, literally 2-3 animations that just keep going on, and on, and on. But, atleast the character details are done well, the Terminators especially. BUT, Voice acting is awfull. Just awfull. You will hear one voice, with the same tone, throughout the entire game. Hello? We used to play DoW 1 and 2, and them both had great voice acting, so why limit us with such horrible voice acting in Space Hulk? I would have done a better job with Audacity. And even the sound effects in this game are stuttering, buggy, and sometimes even missing out. But that will probably/hopefully be patched with time.SIngle Player will get repetitive, and booring, after a while. The multiplayer however, mixes things up, because youre going up against another player, and in my opinion, a players intelligence > an artificial intelligence. And, there is some customization to be done, to the banner especially. But then again, who cares about banners? In the end, this isnt a very good game. I'd give it a 6 out of 10, JUST because im a Warhammer 40k fan. I'd reccomend this game only to players who like the gameplay, and can cope with the lame graphics, effects, sounds, and pretty much everything else that isnt the gameplay itself. To everyone else, if youre looking for a similar game, go purchase XCOM: Enemy Unknown, or whatever the exact name was of that game that came out last year or so~To those (like me) who purchased this game, enjoy the game, and the multiplayer, for now, and hope for patches, and more content through the ingame(or well Steam) shop for DLC's, and/or expansions.

												I am unimpressed.  Yes, this is a faithful adaptation of the 1989 board game, right down to telling you exactly what the Space Marines and Genestealers rolled on their six-sided dice each turn.  And that's a problem.Movement grids, turns and six-sider-based combat mechanics are all  useful approaches to creating a game that can be run on the limited processing power available in a group of human players.  On a computer that could do so much more, it just seems rather pitiful.  The grid based movement and action point system make your tactical options very limited while the randomness of the six-sider engine ensures that even an optimal strategy can be overwhelmed in one or two turns of bad (simulated) rolls.  (And, conversely, sloppy strategy can still triumph, if the dice favour you.)In the original game, seeing your squad crushed without recourse because the dice simply turned against you was an accepted part of play.  Playing with a group, seeing a friend suddenly get demolished by a run of bad luck could be a source of hilarity.  But playing solo, in a computer game that didn't need to rely on something as crude as a handful of d6s, allowing victory or defeat to lie in the hands of virtualized plastic cubes seems inexcusably lazy.The setting is cool.  The graphics and sound are adequate.  But the mechanics of the board game needed a major overhaul to make the transition to a digital environment, and they didn't get it.			"

												Terrible game, and I love Warhammer 40k.  It appears they just made a different game to sell ""Space Hulk:Ascension""  instead of making this one worth playing.  The tiny corridors and single file game play suuuuuuuck.  Apparently in that new game by the same name they opened it up.  I can't help feeling this developer made a crap game and then rather than fixing it released a fixed version as a seperate game.   I will not be buying any of the Space Hulk franchise again.  For turn based combat games Divinity:Original Sin (twenty times better than Space Hulk) or even that Shadowrun (ten times better than Space Hulk) would be better places to spend money.  I didn't really mind how bad this game was until they released another one a year later and left this one feeling unfinished and more of a beta test than a full game.			"

												My experience with Space Hulk so far:- Beating helplessly on a closed door because Power Fists are really only as strong as a Guardsman's Lasgun.- Terminator Space Marines--the Emperor's Finest--are paper tigers prone to Cataclysmic Life Failure if a genestealer so much as breaks wind within hearing distance.- Storm Bolters jam with such alarming frequency that Overwatch becomes pointless.- Veteran Space Marines can't shoot or fight.- Imperial technology is in fact so terrible that it relies entirely on weighted dice rolls that love landing on 1.- Apparently the Blood Angels once committed their 1000 STRONG CHAPTER to a single Space Hulk and only 50 came back. If you want to play a less involved version of X-Com which takes out all those annoying customizations, research and possibility of victory factors, save your money and buy the Space Hulk board game. At least then your friends can share in terrible dice rolls and general pointlessness.			"

												Got this game first on the IPAD and then was waiting for the Ascension version to come out on the PC. After playing around with that a bit, I found that I liked Space Hulk quite a bit more. I know it’s not totally fair to compare since they are supposed to be 2 different games – but there are enough common elements in the visual components and game play mechanics to warrant comparison. For me, this is the more polished and refined of the 2 offerings. I sincerely hope they continue to actively develop and support this version and ignore the minority of naysayers that tend to just be loud / flaming - but not the voice of the majority (see the overall Review ratings here and on the Apple Store). Full Control – develop more for this game line and I will be a returning customer.  "

												Recommended for fans of the original boardgame.I hear they had a buggy launch, but the product out there now is solid.  It's very true to the original boardgame - which means it's brutal and a bit random.  You will get screwed by bad luck occasionally.  If you can't handle having to do a mission over, you may not like this game.  If you can't handle sacrificing half of your guys to run squealing for the objective and a ""technical"" win, this really may not be the game for you.  But if you like strategic play, and massively outnumbered marines holding out against insane odds - and most of all if you were a fan of the boardgame in the first place - this is it right here.(Why do Space Marines wear armour in a space hulk, anyways?  It's not like the stuff does any good against Genestealers...)			"

												I hate this game! So disappointed I've played Warhammer games for years and owned the original board game of Spacehulk. This new “game” was so boring and it really had no strategy or fun to it. Do yourself a massive favour buy xcom or the new total war game oh the walking dead 2 looks epic! This game makes the Sims look good. I'm going to go dig out my old chaos gate disc at lest the voice acting was better and I can forgive the graphics looking dated. But really though the game play if you could call it that sucks, the voice acting is terrible and the graphic/animation sucks. What’s with the really slow moving and why do all the melee attacks suck? Oh and if you miss just press undo until you roll higher (wish I had figured that out on the damn door). Oh and on the dice thing I spent 4 turns trying to break open the door on the second mission and so did the genestealer! I mean really! Open the door and met the other space marine that’s a pretty crap mission but you'll be glad to know when the door finally broke on the genestealer’s turn even though my guy was on over watch he missed and died. Thanks for that... This game is not made for gamers I want a refund!			"

												The interface for this game is pretty bad. Its often hard to tell which character you have selected, and once you click on a square to move them to, there is no way to cancel it, or even shift to another square of movement. There is no indication of which characters have already activated unless you click on them, which can result in accidental movement. The animations and sound effects are cheap and extremely limited and repetitious . The graphics feel really dated for a company like games workshop, who have a lot of money to make this look great. I guess they went with the budget plan instead. The game itself is pretty boring. The game basically breaks down to moving really really slowly down choked corridors and rolling 5+ over and over again. In the 2 hours I played I found no strategy whatsoever in the choices I was making, and the mechanics being really frustrating and limited. I have contemplated several times buying the board game, and am now really glad I never did. That would have been a $90 mistake. Glad I got this version on the cheap to warn me off. If you want a good turn based stategy on PC go play X-Com. And if you want a good turn based stategy on the tabletop, the Gears of War boardgame blows this garbage out of the water.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game unless you enjoyed the board game version of it.I understand that the passionates for the board games rate this one pretty good. I played space crusade on board some time ago and I was expecting something like that, that could entertain me as a tactic strategy gamer. Despite being a DoW fanboy I found this game more focused on luck than on skill.The corridors have one man wide, which could be as in the original, but cripples the chance of positioning an to cover your troops with other troops (like in chess), and this is needed because the weapons stuck 1/6 of the time. If that happend, when a genstealer manages to reach a regular troops, they are mostly dead. They could parry a hit or two, but the genstealers have a big amount of points to spend them on mele attacks. Your comander could survive a couple of hits, but its mostly dead the next turn also.I find it unforgiving because a tiny error in positioning can make you restart the level, but unlike XCom, I find this game cruel because everything can go wrong despite being doing a flawless strategy. That being said, I particularly don't enjoy the games where the hp of my troops are in binary (alive and death), so I enjoyed more Talisman, Bloodbowl (despite knowing barely the rules also) and Aarklash legacy (this one is not from GW but the french company rackham, which owns Confrontation) than this game. And about a tactic turn based game, XCom is as unforgiving as this one, but you have more tools to avoid being brutally murdered.More things about the game: You can customize the look of your chapter through unlocking new stuff everytime you beat a mission. I also read in the reviews that the game looks unfinished, so clarify that a couple of weeks before the launch of the game I saw a video where they confess that they didn't finish the animations yet. OST is good, but the sounds may sound repetitive. The menus are fluent and cool. The intros for the missions are pretty apealing, because you can see the terrain you are going to fight in, with a voice talking about why you need to do that mission and marking you the important points. Brilliant inmersion wise.			"

												With my computer's specifications exceding the reccomendation and blasting the minimum out of the water, it's a shame this game runs in single digits on the least-intensive graphics settings. It's pretty yes, but not pretty enough to justify the terrible framerate. It is most likely a case of very poor optimization. This is especially evident because the main menu screen runs beautifly. If only the rest of the game were like that.			"

												I was excited to get this, but I honestly cannot recommend it.  The controls are clunky and frustrating, and it feels like there is actual latency in the single player game that makes it worse.  Occasionally you will try to control a different guy, only to have the game not recognise that you clicked on someone else, sending the one you just positioned to the other end of the room, burning all your command points, and killing everyone.

												It's a faithful port of the Space Hulk boardgame.  Not the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop strategy game - just plain ol' Space Hulk.If you're not familiar with Space Hulk...  It was a spin-off from Warhammer 40,000.  It featured Space Marine Terminators making their way through cramped corridors and fighting Tyranid Genestealers.  Heavily turn-based.  Very slow-paced.  Not a whole lot in the line of character development or depth.  Think of it kind of like a 40k version of chessThe videogame does a good job of porting that to the computer, while updating the visuals to match what we've become accustomed to with recent Warhammer 40,000 releases.It's still a slow-paced game.  Still heavily turn-based.  There's not much you customization or character development.  There isn't a whole lot of storyline.  You've got Terminators plodding through cramped corridors and killing Genestealers - just like the boardgame.If you've enjoyed the boardgame and you're looking for something you can play solo, you'll probably be pretty happy with Space Hulk.If you've been enjoying the other Warhammer 40,000 offerings on Steam and you're looking for your next hit, you'll probably be disappointed with Space Hulk.

												Space Hulk is a faintly glimmering gem among all other turn-based strategy games. Truly, this game is worth anyone's time for at least one mission (hopefully not the Suicide Mission). First, heed my warning all who dare to step into the bloodied arena that is ""Space Hulk."" This game is unforgiving, cold, and calculating. It will judge every decision you make and then show you the error of your ways, in the warm splash of your marine's blood. This is not a game to be toyed with, it is to be respected and revered for its nature. If you, the player, might have a slight tendency to give-up easily, then I warn you this one and only time, and that is to watch someone else play it. Don't let your brain seape through your noggin while you scream in agony as the Gene-splicers overwhelm you with their tenacity. Trust me, I know.To sum it up, this game is death in digital form. Only the few who pass its trials may overcome it and become its master.Now, onto reality, shall we?Space Hulk is a turn-based strategy game based on the notorious table-top game self-titled ""Space Hulk."" Take note that I have never played Space Hulk and most likely won't in the near future. Although, if the prices are right, I would love to sit down and try a game with a friend if permitting. There is only one faction to play in Single Player (although I think mods and DLC's may expand that horizon), and that is the Space Marines. Vise versa, in multiplayer, two players can pick between the protagonistic Terminators or the antagonistic ""Gene-stealers."" Gene stealers were the original Tyranid threat and are pretty terrifying to say the least. Its not their looks, its their tenacity and ability to overwhelm you at every turn. I won't get into great detail about the game, but its based on movement and action. You, the player, get a specific amount of action points alloted every round to every individual marine (4 per character, depending on the type of marine). Command points are granted based on things you do and can help further an action if need be, but would only be wise to use in an emergency. Every time you advance a marine, you use one action point for every square you advance him. Every time he turns, it is one point and so on and so forth. Its strategy lies in making sure you have enough points and resources (uses of flame-throwing technology for specific types of marines) to survive the game and complete the objective. You, the player, are given an objective (and possibly a set of minimum requirements) every mission. Such objectives might include annihilating every gene-stealer in a givern round or destroying a command room with a flame-thrower marine (Suicide Mission) without losing all of your marines. These objectives vary and can add some definite flavor to a given circumstance such as having one marine left and having to kill only three more gene-stealers coming at you from two different hallways. There are random instances where a bolter might jam-up or you miss your shots, generally, if an enemy is in the same hallway and your marine is staring down that hallway, it will see it and most likely hit it. Think of this game as a very limited and tightly spaced (CQB=Close Quarters Combat) X-COM game. You can of course replay missions and I think you may be able to set up your own using some crafty coding possibly (unsure). Oh, I almost forgot to mention, you can customize your banner with achievements. There are always DLC coming out and there is a lot of content (you will be stuck at times, so don't worry if you do not have enough to do). With the new Terminator ""Space Hulk"" game coming out featuring the infamous ""Deathwing"" squad, you can grab this game and busy yourself with Gene-stealing killing happiness (with a hint of frustration)FINAL VERDICT (My own opinion)Gameplay - 9.3/10Sounds (Music, Voice Acting, Etc.) - 7/10Lasting Value - 8/10Thank you for your time, and have a wonderful day.

												fighting refridgerator simulator from the 41st century.does exactly what the board game does and most of the design aspects as a pc game (UI, options, server browser) are done left-handedly and it shows.as for the gameplay, there is a reason space hulk as a board game has the appeal it has and one round of co-op in this soon shows why.so as a momentary fun you can get few hours out of it, but given the ridiculous price compared to the left-handed execution this can only be recommended if on 75% or more discount.

												Back in the 90's there was a really cool turn based 40k game called ""Warhammer 4000 Chaos Gate"".  That was the turn based game they should have made.  Man, if you missed out on that game it was the best.  Space Hulk feels like a cheap knock off.			"

												I grew up playing the original Space Hulk game.  I wanted to love this one also.  It wasnt horrible, but it wasnt great.  I found the DLC extremely boring.   The missions felt the same and didnt have the urgency to finish before getting wiped out.  If you love space hulk, I would get the game but not expect to put in hundreds of hours.  If you dont know much about space hulk, as much as i hate to say, I wouldnt bother.			"

												As others have implied in their reviews, this is really a 'hmmm maybe if it's on sale' title. Even then it's unpleasant to find that there's very little gameplay to be had before you're asked to shell out for more content. Not cool. The game itself I like - it's faithful to the board game and I'm forgiving of some of the little animation glitches and rawness here and there because of this - but they should have put a whole lot more into it before shoving in the paid-for content. Definitely wouldn't pay full price for this - if you don't already own it then Xcom Enemy Unknown would be a much better investment.			"

												Bear in mind that this is not a triple-A title; is it the most polished game in the world? Perhaps not. Are the graphics going to blow you away ... probably not. Is the voice acting limited? Yup. Now, would I recommend it? Weirdly, for under £20, yes.This is simply a faithful recreation of the Space Hulk board game, right down to the ""oh, you have got to be kidding me"" dice rolls, narrow corridors and Storm Bolters that seem to jam more often than a jam sandwich with added jam and a side-order of jam (1 in 6 odds btw); it can be frustrating and fun in equal measure at times. However, if you ever played the original board game, and enjoyed it (which I did), this is a worthwhile little game.If not, and you feel like trying a fairly slow, turn-based tactical game set in the Warkammer 40k universe, give it a go - but possibly wait until it's on a Steam sale, this game is not to everyone's taste.

												This game I had hopes for, however it really isn't very good. The graphics are quite awesome and I love little things like the HUD of each troop as they walk through a genestealer infested ship and creates quite an atmostphere. However the menus are sub-par and when clicking on the help icon all it did was point out what the controls were below so if you forget important things, like handing a item to another team member or something then you're boned.It's meant to be based on the board game, but I've never played the board game and even then I've been told it's also very cut down compared to the boardgame.

I played Space Hulk on the Commodore Amiga and I liked it for it's play style: I would plan my movement and actions of my Terminators and the AI would plan for the Genestealers...but we both executed our moves at the same time and  I could actually control any one of my terminators!

Yeah, to me, this game doesn't have none of that. Can't fault the devs, they made SH beautiful and not one crash. For anyone who loves the board game, you may love it. For anyone who played SH on the Amiga, pray that one of the dev's come across it and copies it's gameplay.I would give it a ""C"" for atmosphere and gameplay.

												Slow and boringThis is a digital version of the Games Workshop board game of the same name.  You play as a chapter of Blood Angel Space Marines trying to retake a city sized ship form Tyranids (think zerg or xenomorph).  the game is broken up into various scenarios and has you sending in a squad of space marines into narrow hallways to acomplish various objectives (like kill a certain tyranid or save somebody or hold an area for set nubers of turns)  the game is turn based with you spending action points to move and fight each turn.  depending on the scenario you can choose the types of marines and there equipment at the start of the level.This all sounds well in good but in pratice all your doing is slowlying moving a group of guys that look like refrigerators with legs down tight hallways and slowly trading blows with generic looking bug aliens.  wether you succed or die in combat is determened by an off screen dice roll so you'll move a guy up to a bug.  they's slash you'll shoot (unless you have a sword or hammer) and one of you will fall down. thats most of the game and its as boring as it sounds.If your a 40k fan then i recommend the dawn of war games, if you want a squad based sci-fi tactics game i recommend shadow runner returns (or pratically anything else)  The only thing this game has going for it is that is way cheaper than the actual board game.

												This game is much like many of the other Warhammer 40,000 games, it's made for the fans. Now I'm not saying you won't get into it if you don't arise to the sound of basalisks booming everyday just you can get more immursed if you know more about the blood angles.The graphics are rather sub-par for the price I think, But the gameplay and interface are perfect and not over done which is nice for a change.The cutomiztion I was expecting isn't here but I can understand why. But I do wish that you could change out loadouts etc instead of being pre-defined.			"

												Great Game. But like most reviews I found it was too stuck in the past trying to make the board game 3D, instead of making a great game modeled after a great boardgame. The dice rolls are unforgiving even when you have a solid battle plan. One jammed bolter and you quickly fall to pieces. Even the Melee Units are not good at melee.If you love the warhammer universe pick this up you will enjoy it. If you are a fan of old school turn based games you will also love it. Dont expect it to be action packed but it will exercise your brain.			"

												I was a bit disapointed by this entry, seeing it's one of the Warhammer 40k series I though it would just as enjoyable as ''Space marines'', ''Dawn of war 1-2'' and some of the older entries...I was really hyped when I heard about this game thinking it would be as fun, full of gore and well.. all the dreams to a fellow space marine fan. I played through the first part of the campain with the genestealers... not all that fun really...Maybe I just need to spend more time with this baby... but for now I don't really recommend this game, but if you want to give it a go then by all means ''JUST DO IT!''

												Space Hulk features sluggish gameplay, IOS/Android like outlook and teeth-shattering difficulty (or I just suck). Anyway, this is one of those games which don't need fancy graphics or sound. It just needs teeth-shattering difficulty, big space marines, blasters, flamethrowers, genestealers and everything else it already includes.  It's pure Warhammer 40k experience for what I know that universum. I haven't played original board game. I'm pretty noob on Warhammer generally. Studied a bit and played other titles of Warhammer series. I enjoy this game, atleast as long as I have my keyboard in front of me and screen is functioning normally. Good thing I have decent nerves :) For sale price this is very good for your money. Xcom like gameplay with challenge.			"

												This game is more or less exactly like the board game. Same mechanics, not anything else. No persistent campaign characters, no unit veterancy, no choosing squad loadouts. Just Space Hulk. Whether that is any good depends on whether you like Space Hulk or not.  With its simple campaign it doesn't compare well with X-Com, and it doesn't want to, so don't come expecting that. If you arent familiar with the board game, then you would feel like could probably spend your money just as well elsewhere, but if you buy this you will find some very neat mechanics and streamlined gameplay. Playing vs a human opponent with the space marine turn timer is the best way to do it, as the timer and encroaching horde of aliens makes for great tension. As for the single player, it isn't too difficult, and the AI is forgiving. It seems more geared to keeping you interested than winning, as it will gleefully send single aliens to their death for no benefit, so if you dont mess up your overwatch, only some REALLY bad luck will lose you the game. Thanks to recent patches this game is, as far as I have seen, as bug free as any game gets. They also now have an animation speed slider so if you find the animations a bit slow then you can speed that right up.  The dev seems to keep the game fairly well supported so far. Overall probably not something for everyone, but if you are a 40K fan, enjoy board games, or turn-based strategy then this game is worth a look.			"

And here you are spared all the work to set it up on your dinnertable to be able to play it, just turn on your Comp. and voila, have a go at it.This game getting a Metacritic of 58/100 is badly underrated. Rather turn it around and give it 85/100 because that is what it deserves.If you never played Space Hulk, but do like/fancy turnbased strategy games this might be something for you. It deserves to be checked out.Get your Space Marine Terminators ready and kick some Xenos butt.			"

												This game doesn't know what it wants to be. Tactical RTS, shoot-em-up or puzzle. Corridor builds make it pretty straight forward, and usually allowing only one way to play the level, which doesn't leave anything to replayability in the campaign. Just click, like you were meant to click, or you will die. The random things though, can always kill you, meaning that no matter the skill - you can still loose due to the weapons jamming or just missing stuff, or winding up dead with your melee character that just rolls a bad number. Movement tends to get used to as well. Only thing this game gives, is some nice Warhammer setting. Though it has buggs, like sometimes sound of autocannon not playing or shooting wrong direction (visually). Overall, I'd give it about 6/10. If you are a fan of the universe - 7/10, and 8/10 if you are a fanatic. Because the title rides on the story and setting. I reviewed the SP part only, so if you are looking for competetive multiplayer, it might be better. Seeing as human player is always the best opponent, and this game might be mainly tailored for that after all?			"

												Let's start with the good news:Space Hulk is using the original Warhammer 40K rules, so a true Warhammer 40K fan should be satisfied.I would not recommend this game anyways. - You ask: Why?Because of the rest of the game:- Because of the dicing system in Warhammer 40K it is pure luck if you hit an enemy or not. It doesn't matter if you are a great player or a good tactitian. You don't have any influence anyways!- As in the tabletop game, your Terminator dies on the first hit.- As in the tabletop game, your Terminators don't get any experience. So they are just as good (or bad) as usual. They simply just don't improve.- There is just one type of enemy. That is very boring.- There is no long term motivation in improving your troops or your weapons, getting special abilities or something like that.To conclude: The game is not worth playing! I would not even play it if I would get the game as a present, because it is not worth the time playing it! It ist not even worth writing a review, I just want you to keep you from spending your money and time on crap! "

												Weapon-Jamming & Can't-hit♥♥♥♥♥♥Simulator: Straight Hallway, no enemy fire  and the so called ""Space-Marines: Mankinds strongest Warriors"" get incredible 31% hit-chance (on every distance: 1 or 10 tiles pff what's the difference?)  and even then their weapons can still jam, even that regulary ,that my whole squad was sitting there and every single Bolter was jammed. So the summary is: Space-Marines have a much better PR-Division than actually fighting-power (when you can't hit your enemy it doesn't really make a difference if you can kill him in one hit) and mankinds weapons-manufacturer doesn't know what he is doing, welp humanity is doomed.Oh and much of this is random: Weaponjamming? Random. Hit-Chance? Random. Where are your enemies coming from? Also random. How many moves you get per turn? Partially random. And at the end of each mission you don't think: ""Man I had a good tactic to win this."" you think: ""Thank God, that the bolters didn't jam ,that the marines hit their targets and the enemies didn't have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ positioning. Because all of this happening together was very unlikely.""Oh I almost forgot: the Terminator armor is only there to make you look cool and your movement-speed slow. Because if only one attack goes through your marine is dead...Edit: I tested the ""easy"" difficulty and it isn't as random as ""normal"" ,mainly because there are no weapon-jams. So all in all the biggest problem is the jamming because it ends the ""Overwatch-function"" (Attacking everything that is right in front of you with unlimited attacks). It is mainly used for locking down corridors and the jamming makes you randomly fail at that. And when the game throws a ton of enemies after you, one corridor that randomly isn't locked down anymore can kill your whole team.			"

The previous Space Hulk was a lot more fun than this, I get the impression the high price is merely due to GW licensing than any real effort put into the game.

												Space Hulk is a video game adaptation of the classic board game, specifically the 3rd edition 2009 release. The game itself is a turn-based strategy game where the Space Marines fight against the horde of alien Genestealers to complete various objectives.Alright, let's get to the point: is the game worth getting?A: maybeIt's a game that caters to an existing audience that may not be suitable to other fans of the genre, as the adaptation strictly adheres to the boardgame.

												Chaos gate was a great game. Maybe even one of my favorites. I thought this would be similar, but you only fight down narrow hallways instead of an open battle field. How does an chaingun miss in a hallway, but an enemy unit kills you in one attack? The tactics are limited and repetitive. I was sadly disappointed, the revamped chaos gate is available on other sites, steam still doesn't have it.			"

												Sucks. No game of table top space hulk was ever this hard. The genestealers roll a six 90% of the time so close combat is nearly guaranteed death. Terminators jam and miss so often they may as well be unarmed if you arent on overwatch. And the random spawn means that frequently you will be fighting more genestealers than were even included in the boxed game. 2/10 for decent artwork and sound effects. Gameplay is purely based on luck. Dont buy even if its on sale.			"

												tl;dr: If you like warhammer or strategy; don't even think about buying it, even if it is so ridiculously cheap. Go get a soda instead.Review:Honestly... I have been craving space hulk since it came out, thinking OMFG this is nice.The story of the game is pretty lacking, but then again so was the original board game. What ticks me off, is the chance to hit, the lack of strategy, the horrible control method and the fact that in the tutorial my guys die in 1 hit from the enemy, and the specific mission no matter how i tried, they were gonna take a hit.There is most likely a way to finish it, but it gives you two space marines versus atleast 15 randomly generated and positioned tyrranids. The first guy is placed behind a broken door and if I destroy the door in order to move i'll be much closer to atleast one of the xenos beasts, and even if i manage to take out the first 3 or 4 the 5th is going to take me out.  So i decided not to destroy the door. Figured, let the tyrranids do it and then i'll be waiting there with my massive gun.My guy missed the tyrranid with a freaking storm bolter on a distance less than 2 meters away, tyrranid steps in and one hits my terminator. I tried this mission 3 or 4 times and then i just gave up. There were no other alternatives to what i did, there was just too much random chance in the matter.Strategy != random chance. you may have some random elements or procedurally generated content to make the game renewable and interesting.. But in this game it is really all about getting lucky. conclusion: not interesting and just horribly made.			"

Captains Log, 05.10.2016Setting sail for uncharted waters! Destination: Space Hulk. Tight Corridors, Tight Space Marines, Tight Atmosphere! Tight dice rolls. Tight dying to RNG. Tightness in Space?! First look at the game:  also available as VOD on twitch[www.twitch.tv]Space Hulk is exactly what its name suggest – it’s a conversion of the board game that came out in 1989, was released as PC game in 1993 and finally got more love in 2014:The Intro alone was enough for me to get pulled back into the atmosphere of the old board game. It continued with voiced mission briefings, nicely explained missions and a good tutorial.The Tutorial mission containing 3 sub-missions that ease you into the games simple mechanics did a solid job.The first sub mission of the next assignment though….made me realize that this game is based nearly solely on luck of the dice roll. That does not feel as good as back then with the board game.You manage your awesome Squad of Space Marines with different weapons, skills and that is all perfect. Just the luck…that does not work.I won´t elaborate too much on the gameplay, since the amount of the luck required renders that gameplay pretty much irrelevant in terms of comparing it to other PC games. Compared to other board games, it is not as bad but still feels kind of hard to digest. That is a very subjective view on this game. Just adding that to be clear. It may be that this chimera of board- and videogame is not better than the boardgame. Or the target audience is different from what I am looking for. Look and feel and sound:Space Hulk has many interesting features, like a shoulder camera that shows the point of view of the selected Marine. A very nice touch! You can also play different chapters, which adds to variety. Most importantly: It is close to the boardgame. Added are a fitting soundtrack and a nice tense atmosphere. The game wins on this side as you can see. Sadly, it is not enough to warrant a recommendation.Captains Orders:I will not recommend to buy this game except you are nostalgic about it and can play it as what it is: a mediocre boardgame adaption of a nice that relies on its atmosphere and the Warhammer 40k franchise a lot to score points with the player.Verdict:Has to walk the plank!  It is just not cutting it in comparison to other PC games. I will keep it as a relaxing timewaster for in-between, but that is just me. Every non-warhammer 40k enthusiast should skip it.For more Reviews visit  CaptNemo's Log[captainnemoweb.wordpress.com]For Gameplay Videos and live streaming visit CaptN3mo's twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] "

												Although certainly not worth full retail price, Space Hulk is an extremely enjoyable game of tactics that aims to directly replicate the board game. With combat that resembles a more claustrophobic XCOM, you will find yourself leading a squadron (or two) of Space Marine Terminators, some of the heaviest infantry units in the Galaxy, through narrow tyranid infested corridors. Every movement may compromize the safety of your squad and will be done so tactfully. I got this game for under $2 and it was a great investment, I wish I would have purchased the DLC while it was also on sale. This game is far from a full $30 package and Games Workshop is absurd to charge such a price for it (averaging around $50 with all DLC at retail value), but if you're a Warhammer 40k or XCOM fan and find this game on sale for under $5, it's certainly worth a spin.

												The game looks to be quite fun but it has a few minor flaws that make it almost unplayable. One of them is the fact that you can only undo your last action. This means that every time you make a mistake that involves more than one action, you have to reload the game. The second flaw makes the first one even worse... there is no way to load a saved game while in-game. You have to quit the game and go to the main menu. So this makes playing the game extremely cumbersome and teiuous. This is made even worse by the fact that most close up fights have a higher than 50% chance of being lost. So you have to keep reloading the game very often. I tried googling if it had quick save/load but sadly it doesn't.			"

												Disappointing and boring, it plays out like something somebody would make for a degree. It recreates the board game faithfully and nothing more but sans the atmosphere, fun... and general any othe reason you would want to play the tabletop Space Hulk.Don't spend money on this,  play X-Com and be satisfied in a million more ways.

												The game is simply lacking any engagement for me. Animations seem sluggish and poor, action is slow and unfulfilling. It seems like a very direct port of the ""Space Hulk"" board game from back in the day, which is not necessarily a bad thing, however it is not a great video game in my eyes. "

Mmmm, if you REALLY love 40k, got wet dreams about spacemarines and totalitarian brotherhood then yes but if you're more into good pc games then watch out.			"

												This game is stupidly difficult, FAR more difficult than the board game it's based on.On normal difficultty, expect to restart any given mission about 25+ times before making it, -if- you're extremely lucky. Your tactics make absolutely no difference to your success.mty rating:  1/10			"

												Well, I read bad reviews for this game before I bought it, but the game and all the DLC was like $5 so I thought, ""why not?"". Trust me, this could be free and it still wouldn't justify installing it on your PC.  It's too bad really; I have fond memories of playing the original Space Hulk on the Commodore Amiga, but that was a totally different game. Never have I seen such a convoluted mess trying to play a game; the ""Action Points"" system is totally whacked, the animations are goofy-looking and worst of all, the controls are terrible. Yeah, a turn-based strategy game with controls so awkward you make the wrong moves and you can't take them back.      So, really, don't bother. Let the genestealers have the Space Hulk.			"

												A loyal and accurate adaption of the 3rd Edition (from memory) rules version of the Space Hulk boardgame, with only minor rules adjustment to allow for better playability on a PC platform.The Metacritic score does not do this game justice, simply as the negative, and even many of the mixed reviews, unfairly criticise Space Hulk for not being a faster and more 'arcadey' turn-based strategy, along the lines of XCom : Enemy Unknown/Within. This was never the intention, instead, Full Control's faithful recreation of the classic boardgame is in fact one of Space Hulk's greatest strengths to a true Space Hulk fan.Genestealers, the environments, and each individual terminator, are rendered in intricate detail, right down to Terminators being adorned with swinging scolls and battle honours, along with realistic lighting and shading effects on terrain and units. Both Terminators and Genestealers are fully animated and life-like in their movements, and these animations are accompanied by fantastic audio and a fitting sound track.A faithful and beautifully designed recreation of the original Space Hulk. I'd recommend it to any true fan.			"

												Call me old fashioned, but I like turn-based strategies. It is the feeling of ""stopped time"" that is so appealing to me. That I have the whole of eternity (or until my laptop battery dies) to decide the fate of my soldiers for the next turn. I prefer this to RTS because, frankly I do not like the save/load system that tries to compensate for some of the tactical/strategic mistakes one might make due to rash actions and/or lack of a proper plan. And also, it is the nervous tingling you get when watching the enemy turn unfold, this lack of control for a moment that creates excitement should your plan be successful or despair as you see your best strategy go to waste by a simple stroke of bad luck. In any good game, there must be a few factors that are uncontrollable, this is what makes it interesting after all. Turn-based strategies are great in this aspect, they give you full authority for a moment, just to take it away in the next, delivering it in to the hands of chance and enemy tactical sense. This is, after all, why chess has made it this far.Perhaps this is why I like ""Space Hulk"". No matter what table top fanboys might say - this game is deeply entertaining, true to the roots of best turn-based strategies like ""Incubation: Time is Running Out"", but it is criminally short. For a genre that is in agony (thanks to the latest XCOM, there is a faint hope of ressurection), this is like a bandage applied to an open wound.The price is just right and do not listen to anyone who complains about it, this is way better than spending some US $200 on a Space Hulk starter kit from Games Workshop. Actually, I do not get people who play TT in digital age, or people who buy miniature plastic models for hundreds of dollars when 3D Printing and clay is practically widespread, I'm sorry. And this is despite the fact that I myself am guilty of buying things from GW in the past, but as it turns out, digital versions are much more entertaining and they are much (MUCH) cheaper too.A little more missions and wargear would have been nice. Actually, a lot more. Also, different chapter model and colour sets and perhaps more diversity in objectives. As for TT fanboys hating on it, if I was the developer, I would make two game modes, ""TT faithful"" and ""Video Game oriented"" (you might say /tg/ and /vg/ respectively) to keep everyone happy. It's easy anyway, just cut most of the content in the first one.			"

												Space Hulk and the ""sequel"" are the same game. All of the improvements that consumers complained about in the first game, which after two years STILL doesn't have the map editor that was promised, were put into the ""sequel"". Anyone that supported this game in early access has been ripped-off. Damage Control studios is in it for the cash folks, nothing more. Any studio that pulls bait and switch tactics like this should be out of business. Too bad everyone (including me), was decieved. Knowing what they did, they ""hired"" a professional troll to quash the truth in the forums when it appeared. I was banned twice, last time being a permanent ban, for speaking these truths. Buy Door Kickers instead.			"

												--- Review by Four Paws Sly ---First Hour - Lots of fun! Having owned pretty much every version of Space Hulk over the years, i'm glad to see its a faithful reproduction of the board game. Managed to complete the tutorial missions during the first hour without any difficulty (having played the board game lots probably helped), but it served its purpose to get me into the game once more after having not played it for years. Had just enough time in the first hour to play the first and well known, Suicide Mission - completed it but lost one team member due to overenthusiastic flaming! Oh well. (Just missed the achievement!)Overall, i'm looking forward to playing this game more and gunning down xenos from one end of the space hulk to the other.Fifth Hour - Making steady progress through the first supplied campaign - on the fourth mission. Loving the sound of the assault cannon, very thematic. Generally enjoying the ambience of the game as mentioned earlier, the game feels claustrophobic and very much like the board game I knew and loved. The game has some fun achievements to try and earn if that's your bag.I like the slow clunky movements the tactical dreadnought armour makes - but if you find it too slow, you can always speed up the animations. Also had a few instances where I misclicked the wrong move - the undo feature on the interface is very useful in that regard.Also enjoying the ability to view the tactical map (reminds me of the board game even more) and rotate/zoom the view to catch all sorts of interesting angles. Overall, still very much enjoying it.Tenth Hour - Still finding it enjoyable and about halfway through the first campaign, mining it for achievements, getting one of them took a little while and multiple replays - but yes. Not much else to say. Saw the assault cannon blow up in game by rolling a triple on the dice following a reload. Sad times. Gameplay - 7 / 10If you liked the board game (not Death Angel, which is way different) - you'll probably like this game. If you haven't played Space Hulk before and are interested in a slow paced strategy / puzzle game pitting man against ferocious alien - its worth a try.Music / Sound - 7 / 10 Music is very orchestral and keeps in the theme with the Warhammer 40,000 universe, as do the speeches the marines quote as the move or gun down the enemy. Listening to the Genestealers scream as they get gunned down is very reminiscient of Aliens. Difficulty - 7 / 10If you're a veteran of strategy games, this one is reasonably challenging but there are harder games out there. I'm currently playing it on Hard (which gives you timed turns and limited command points) and finding it enjoyable without too much struggle.Longevity - 7 / 10As mentioned above, by the tenth hour - I am halfway through the campaign but i've replayed a few levels to get the achievements which means you could probably be this far in perhaps 6 hours or less if achievements don't interest you. Based on my progress, I reckon the game will offer you perhaps 18-20 hours of gaming, not including DLC or replays for achievements.Overall - First Hour 8/10.Fifth Hour 8/10Tenth Hour - 7/10			"

I don't have any DLC yet but after original campaign I'm almost sure to take it also.			"

												I LOVE this game.  Its pretty much only going to appeal to either a hardcore TBS fanatic or a hardcore Warhammer 40k fanatic...or both.  But I really enjoy it, I have found pretty decent replayability as well.  I was worried about that at first but It seems my worries were put to rest as soon as i ran through the game a second time and found that nearly each stage was a completely different experience than the first run through.  Im not too sure about the multiplayer as I have yet to get a match beyond the lobby going.  But the AI seems good enough a half dozen play throughs at least and the DLC was pretty good too.  Highly recommend this one to hardcore TBS fans that have never tried it.  9/10			"

												Generally: Very good climatic game. Rules are taken from its precursor, board game. Good turn-based strategy, which gives long play and a lot of fun. About 6-7 DLCs, but onyl 4 are with missions. Other are skins and additional team.Team planning/arming: Generally, it's based on preset settings of squads. No possible to rearm or reconfigure teams. No editor for missions. This is minus of this game. There is no progress for characters also. It means, each mission you start with the same preset characters and weapons. There is DLC called ""Wolves chapter"" which gives other one team, more prepared for close combat. And it gives more fun of playing, even if you finish campaing. But still, no possible to adjust or rearm team.Missions: Be prepared for more costs if you want to get more missions. Basic campaign got 12 missions. DLCs cost much, and gives you about 3-5 missions. To recompensate it I can tell than missions last long time, about hour sometines. And to finish it you have to play many times to find out good way how to make it.Bugs: But this game is fixed often and refined to the top. A lot of bugs/issues which you will find in forum, was already fixed. I didn't experience any problems. AI: There is only sometimes AI ""hanging"", by stopping units in some corner, piling up and waiting. But this is not often, and happens in some missions in some cases only. The game very depends on AI pressure. So if there are not units running on you or spawning on your path, game from hard tension massacre changes for a walk. So, in some missions you struggle for survive but in some you have a heavy armored terminators just walking from entry to exit through whole map, maybe killing something on pass, but then you even do not notice a threat.Long play: Prepare youself for long and hard play. Even in normal level, it is hard to finish base campaing. It took for me about two weeks to make it. One missions can last from 20 minutes to more than 1 hour.Rules/chances: This game is based on dice rolls. It means all the time you can calculate your probability of kill/miss. Even if it looks like ""chess"" play, due to fixed number of action points, it has got command points and some random behaviour of opponent. It gives you mission not exact the same all time. However, playing a mission is kind of following general stratecic plan which is based on calculations. So it's ""chess"" plus some luck.Cheats: You don't need any cheats in the game. This game got already cheat inside. By making ""undo"" on you action you can repeat last dice roll. In example, you move and shoot. When you miss, you can ""undo"" and repeat it untill you will not get it success. Real good players do not make it. Me also. And it pist me off that this possibility is, because it's not quite fair and good. It induces you, so sometimes you will want to use it. It is up to you. Play normal and ""fair"", or repeat every move many times.Graphics: It is not the main case for such kind of game. Some predefined scenes for action like shoot/kill/die are shown where character is doing something. More its like top view of map. It is nice that this top view is not exactly ortogonal, but king of twisted which gives more expression on it. You can't rorate it freely rather than that, you can turn by full 90 degrees.Climate: It is dark and deep climatic game, where you can feel terror and panic struggle for survive. Some actions require to sacrifice someone on mission. But even then you can try to save the character in very drastic situation. So this is fun. "

												Having tried the tabletop game Space Hulk once, and loving it, I decided to buy the electronic version when it went on sale. I can say that it was money well spent. Space Hulk is all the fun of the tabletop game, plus more, as the visuals are gruesomely satisfying and the gameplay is very tactical and well laid-out. The controls are easy to learn, and the game provides hours and hours and hours of fun.One feature I'm very happy it includes is that it can not only be played multiplayer online with other friends who have the game, but it includes a ""hotseat"" mode, where everyone can use the same computer to play out their turns. And in multiplayer, you have a chance to see things from the ""other side of the hulk"", or putting it simply, you can play as the Genestealers!! I am also pleased to see that DLC has been released to allow people to play through even more missions and add a little customization to their game with new ""skins"" for the marines and Genestealers. A feature I haven't seen in the game that would be nice, is the creation of custom map layouts and missions to play with friends.Other than that, I couldn't ask for more out of this game!			"

												I am a fan of the board game - I own the last published version (anniversary edition) and I had been waiting for a video game adaptation for decades.  When it came to Steam, I didn't hesitate.  But for non-hardcore fans, there are a few things you should be aware of about this version.  First, it's short.  The last patch added new campaigns, but it can all be finished in about  10 hours.  There's not a lot of replay value.  Second, there's no level editor (at least not at the time of this review).  That would make a difference - the board game is all about creating new scenarios/campaigns to play with friends.  For twitch gamers, take note this is turned base.  There are persistent bugs, like the ability to undue a failed attack and try again, that still need to be patched.  And if you know the boardgame, well don't expect the same flexibility with the rules engine in the software.  Goals and actions are limited.  AI seems basic (hunt and seek) - even just the addition of AI flanking would have made for a more rewarding challenge.Don't get me wrong - I recommend this, at least when Steam does a price drop on it.   The sound is phenomenal, the bass is massive reverb (rapid firing a machine gun against a swarm of Genestealers will definitely move something on your desk),  the atmosphere is really well established.  It's just that it could have been so much more, and leave you wanting rather than satisfied.However, it is fairly true to the gameplay			"

The game requires strategy and will challenge you. The bad? You get 2 campaigns for the asking price, and the rest of them are being sold in a micro-transaction store. 80% of the game available at release is being held back to gouge you. Buy it if they offer it as a complete pack, but the way they marketed this one is just insulting. That's all I've got to say about that.			"

												In the Grim dark future there is only jammed storm bolters. The emperor has forsaken you, the machine spirits will not answer your prayers. Within this dark corridor on this jumbled broken mass of wrecked starships, the product of ten millennia of war, there is barely the room to turn around. You can hear the bark of your battle brothers storm bolters before they click silent, misfiring once again, then you hear the screams. They are all around you, coming through every hole and down every corridor. It is too many, they are too fast. Perhaps with your brothers at your back, maybe if you see them comming there is a chance. You have already killed so many, stained so much plasteel with xenos blood, but how much longer before your storm bolter too finally goes silent? What help can your brothers lend when the enemy is upon you? You will die here.And when you awake you will find the same dark halls filled with the echos of xenos footsteps coming for you. Once again you will wander through this unforgiving labyrinth looking for an escape you never find. Perhaps this time, you are so close now.			"

												A largely-faithful recreation of the boardgame, and as such it plays like a boardgame. Your squad(s) and their loadouts are preselected based on the mission, and gameplay is centered around managing Action Points and a variable pool of Command Points, with additional resource management required when dealing with assault cannons and heavy flamers (both of which have limited ammunition). If the odds are in your favor you can park Sargeant Gideon and his impressively large hammer in a chokepoint and watch as he stomps 14 Genestealers in a single game. If the odds are not in your favor you'll watch him go down to the first melee attack launched against him.If you are looking for a fully featured 40K experience this is not it and it is not meant to be. On the other hand if you're a fan of the Space Hulk boardgame, or of boardgames in general, then this game is certainly worth giving a whirl.			"

												If you enjoy the Warhammer world then you will enjoy this game. I bought it for my son who promptly decided he liked Dawn of War better, so after spending $30.00 for it I played it and found that I enjoyed this game. Save alot so you can save every Space Marine and earn those achievements! Plan on every board taking up to 45 min, it is a turn based game.			"

												This game is cool and all, but I seriously don't understand why they had to send the bulkiest Space Marines into the space hulk. They are so big, they clip through the walls sometimes! Their feet on the metal is louder than 60 babies crying and they move as slow as sloth with no legs (you can increase the animation speed, but still) They say their armour is the toughest, but they can get killed in one swipe from the Genestealer? So what is the point? It would be much better to send in Space Marine scouts and sneak around trying not to be noticed...Well anyway, it's a great strategy game and I believe it's pretty accurate to the board game (which I myself haven't played, but one of my friends has)It's worth getting during the sale!!

												For those who enjoyed (and are able to remember) the board game when it came out, this will renew that delight.  Same game and rules, but you have moving graphics instead of figurines. I think the interiors are simple but well done, and the cut scenes aren't too shabby or annoying.Drawbacks for those who've played the boardgame - it's the same scenarios as well (initially).  So, if you worked out how to beat the scenarios on the boardgame, you might yourself wishing for more - although I believe the later scenarios in this game were not in the boardgame.Recommended just for the nostalgia, if nothing else.

												While i do recommend this game, it's purely because of the boardgame's design - these people had ONE JOB (designing graphics that don't suck balls) and they somehow managed to not only not do that, but also managed to ♥♥♥♥ up stuff that had been handed to them by GW. The first time you see a genestealer die in a strange puff of red cardboard and go ""what the fu..."" is pretty much the experience you'll be having for the rest of the game.			"

												Space Hulk sticks to it's board game origins pretty strictly. This will either be it's appeal or its downfall to you depending how you like the rules and dice roll actions for attack and defend (Has both saved me when facing insane odds but cost me in what should have been a walkover). As a fan of warhammer 40000 I quite like it. It was pretty buggy upon release buts it's since been patched to a proper standard and a free campaign was added as part of it (which is decent of the devs to be fair). Solid 7 out of 10, if it's on sale then it's well worth it.			"

												This is a pretty decent representation of the original from Games Workshop and if you play(ed) that then you will enjoy what is on offer here.  It limitations come from sticking to the source game religiously. Anyone who was expecting something a little more Xcom will be disappointed  (it was never was going to that  given the devs funding limits, source game and so forth.)  For me at the moment its a little over priced and if you are unsure I would  perhaps wait for a  sale but if you are into the source game it will probably be worth a gamble.  (Once the level editor is released then that will help on the value side of things).  Overall I have enjoyed the little bit I have played so far and while it does have some rough edges its still an ok if not spectacular game.			"

												This game is a very close recreation of the Space Hulk board game.  If you enjoy the board game (or could not find a copy of the 3rd edition version) this is an excellent purchase that I fully recommend.If you have not played Space Hulk, but like Warhammer 40K, I also recommend this game for the atmosphere.  So far the game seems to capture the feel of 40K pretty well.  It is kind of like the Dawn of War series in that regard, but focused solely on Terminators and Genestealers.  Hopefully they will expand the game in the future using other units and/or races from 40K (which were given some rules in old White Dwarf articles.)If you don't know about warhammer 40K or Space Hulk, this is still a very good squad based game.  It is turn based, which until recently had been hard to find.  While I believe something like XCOM is a better turn based squad game, this one is also quite good, but limited compared to that game.  There in not advancement, force management, or other features.  This is pure turn based mission execution.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a turn based squad game.  However, Warhammer 40K fans and those that know and love the Space Hulk board game will be the most impressed with it.			"

I've read reviews about people complaining that there isn't any progression or customizing available.  Well there wasn't in the board game so don't expect there to be in this.  If you want the board game, then this is for you.  If you think you're going to get a game that reflects the current trend in the gaming industry standards, then you're gonna have a bad time.			"

												Maybe it's just me, but we've come a long way in a very short amount of time when it comes to video game technology. It seems that a game as simple as Space Hulk could very, VERY easily do with some fine turning and general polish. The gameplay itself gets repetitive pretty fast, and I don't really have the sense of impending doom that I had playing the physical version this is based upon. I hoped it would be Space Hulk like I loved and rememberd. The agony and pain are there, but for all the wrong reasons.			"

It's slow paced though you can fast it up in the menu. I said it's slow but believe me: it's intense!! :)The dice rule, ofc. You can try same fights twice and get whole different results.It's a must for anyone who really likes Warhammer 40k and enjoys turn based strategy. The others? Might get disappointed with the lack of enemy variety and other stuff like character or story advancement.			"

												SPACE HULK is a turn-based strategy game set in the rich universe of Warhammer 40K.  It is based on Game Workshop's 1989 2 player board game of the same name.  Taking place aboard a derelict spacecraft, it nicely captures the feel and distictive look of WH:40K's gothic design.  Space Marines from the Blood Angel chapter, decked out in their fiercest Terminator armour, are in a life or death struggle with nasty Tyranid Genestealers within the massive ship's cramped corridors.  ""No man that died in the Emperor's service died in vain.""That's a quote from one of the Warhammer 40K rulebooks.  It is something to keep in mind while you play this game because you WILL die ... a lot!    SPACE HULK is difficult to the point of being punishing.  All games that use the random chance of dice, both traditional board games and their video adaptations, can be frustrating at times.  All of us have been in a situation where we desperately NEED that high role to defend our turf or take down a foe, only to be stunned by horrid ""snake-eyes"" staring back at us.  It happens.  Few games I have played, however, make you pay so dearly for that ONE awful roll.   Whole missions can be botched and hours of carefully planned gameplay wasted with an unfortunate result of the die.   Even the most well thought out strategy is no real defence.  Your fate is in the hands of a, what seems like, diabolical random number generator.All that being said, for fans of WH:40K, this game is a must have.  For those who are unfamilliar with Games Workshop's intimidatingly sprawling universe, it is a perfect introduction.  I do though, for everyone who plays it, recommend you warn anyone in your household about  the frantic, sudden screams of ""Oh, COME on!"", ""Goddamit!"" and ""WTF!?!"" that will soon be coming from your general direction.

												Ok, so I'll start out by saying that I am a fan of the whole Warhammer 40k universe. I can't say that I am a veteran, as most of my experience is limited to reading 40k wiki articles and playing the Dawn of War games, but I have found this game quite enjoyable. That being said, the game is still best bought on sale. The game only comes with 15 missions and some will take an hour or more to beat. Multiplayer is limited (some maps are heavily unbalanced because your are playing the missions for single player). They seem to keep pumping out content, which is good and I certianly don't regret buying during the winter sale.There are some issues (some of the missions are impossible if the genestealers swarm hard from certain approaches at the start of the game), but for the most part each mission is interesting and fun. Yes, sometimes you have to sacrifice marines to achieve the mission, but I guess the same is true for the board game and real combat.Basic rundown of the mechanics of the game: (1) Space marines die in close quarters, hallways are your friend in conjunction with overwatch. Keep as much of a hallway between you and the first point your marine can see the beastie and he will cut them down...usually (jams and the mission where you don't have sustained fire can cause even the best positioned marine to die) (2) The game has (for most missions) an endless supply of genestealers, so you must achieve the objective while being constantly harassed by genestealer that seem to favor spawning where the biggest clump of your marines(though this is not a law, sometimes a lone marine will be swarmed). (3) Actions and movements are based on AP that your marines get at the begining of battle (4 for each marine, genestealers get 6) and are used for everything from moving, shooting, opening doors, and entering blessed overwatch. You also get a randomly generated number of CP that can be used for anything AP are use for and probably most critically, unjaming weapons during the genestealer's turn (where they are hopefully being mowed down by overwatch.If you give the game a chance and you like 40k it will be worth your time playing.Cleanse the xenos. Burn the witch. Purge the heretic.			"

												The negative reviews across the net appear to be out of date.  This rendition of Space Hulk is surprisingly challenging, but quite smooth in gameplay.  Although the squads are not evenly balanced, (melee god sgt and auto cannon vs balanced sgt and flamer) it doesn't distract from the fun.  My only gripe is that loading a saved game isn't intuitive and can't be done while playing a scenario.  That should be a fix.  However, it looks like GW is finally supporting its non-essential games (Blood Bowl, Space Hulk) and I hope that this means that we'll be seeing more creativity and production out of them than we have in the past.

												Great and accurate adaptation of the board game. I love the models and the environment. A few more combat animations would have been nice, but it is not a big deal. The actor that reads the mission briefings certainly sounds like an Astartes company captain!			"

												This is a pretty decent representation of the original from Games Workshop and if you play(ed) that then you will enjoy what is on offer here.  It limitations come from sticking to the source game religiously. Anyone who was expecting something a little more Xcom will be disappointed  (it was never was going to that  given the devs funding limits, source game and so forth.)  For me at the moment its a little over priced and if you are unsure I would  perhaps wait for a  sale but if you are into the source game it will probably be worth a gamble.  (Once the level editor is released then that will help on the value side of things).  Overall I have enjoyed the little bit I have played so far and while it does have some rough edges its still an ok if not spectacular game.			"

												This game is screaming out for muliplayer CO-OP mode.  The campaigns are very atmospheric first time through.  Not much fun in repeat visits, once you've cracked a campaign theres not much satisfaction going back through it again.  Multiplayer is ok but each map seems to have a distinct advantage to one side or the other.  Its good not to have a timer for each turn so you can spend a bit of time typing banter into chat.   Theres no skill tree or advancement or even equipment choice for your marines, they come as they are.  But that makes for very balanced and challenging combat.  It can be frustrating when you know your doing all the right things but the dice just won't give you a break.  But you can't odds bad luck as the bookies say.   All in all its well worth the money, just shame its over so soon.			"

												As a teen 20 years ago I discovered 40k, and soon after discovered Space Hulk I have many fond memories of playing, weather it was in the backyard shed cutting class at school with a couple buddies or just hangin out. Space hulk was one of the games we actually played a lot instead of just painting and dreaming about playing. Back then We would talk about how cool a futuristic video game versoin would be. The versions from that era never really satisfied as they weren't really the game. They were much like the game but maybe more first person action oriented like the 3DO and Playstation versoins. or the horrible graphics Amiga before that. I played them all but now I've played that game I always wanted. that Computer remake that is simply the board game remade with online and multiplayer support, it will even have a level editor. It's just what I really wanted from a Space Hulk game, everything works and will only get better as the dev team continues to work on it. The dificulty and tatics are just like I remember them, The animations need some work but the graphics are solid and look good. The controls and hud have everthing you need easily accessible. The menu's are quick and responsive and the sound is good. I would recommend Space Hulk to anyone who loved the boardgame and also anyone who enjoys brutally hard, slower paced, strategic and tatical gameplay.			"

												I only played the standard game, i didnt buy any DLC so please keep this in mind.I also never played the board game.So, i think this game is good, not awsome but good for a pure video game player like me. Its probably 10x better if you buy this game because you love the board game though.The strategy is there and important, you have to think twice before you move any characters and each mistake is paid for a high price.Graphics are not bad, i didnt like much the sounds effects from the guns though.One thing i didnt understand though is why do we have melee characters in this game. Since theyre weak against the genestealers you cant use them to block a path at all, so most of times they were only annoying, using some space i could use for real soldiers.Despite those flaws wich prevent this game to be a ""great "" game, i had fun playing it. Wait for  sales and get it. "

												Brilliant version of the board game. I played the original PC version of Space Hulk in the early 90s and thought it was good. I have also enjoyed playing the space hulk games on PSX and Saturn in addition to the board game. This game is a cracking conversion and I'm pleased I got it as such a great price during the sale and I'm also pleased I ignored the metascore which I consider to be very misleading. If you like squad-level, turn based strategy games give it a go. If you like Warhammer/Space Hulk table-top games, you'll love it.			"

												It's a carbon copy of the Games Workshop board game. They advertised it as such, and made no attempt to mislead. In that respect, this is a pretty good game. The campaign and maps, and squads are exactly the same as the board game that GW re-released a few years ago. having it in a digital formatt allows me to play it with friends where I normally couldn't. Like the ones that have moved. It's D6 based, enemies spawn in the same fashion as they do in the board game... This is an exact digital copy. Yes, I've said that previously. I'm stressing that point because almost all the negative reviews seem to have missed that entirely.This is targeted at fans of the Games Worshop line up. Not necessarily fans of the video games made under their license. If you liked the board game, you'll like this. If you like turn based strategy, you may also like this. If your a fan of the Warhammer 40k table top game, you may find this amusing as well.You prolly wont enjoy this if... You like fast paced, twitch reflex games. Are only getting it because it has the GW logo. Getting it because your only experience with Warhammer 40k is the video games(that isn't a bash). This is not a 40k video game like Dawn of War, or Space Marine. This is closer to Blood Bowl, which is also a digital remake of a GW board game.7.5/10 as a turnbased, squad strategy.10/10 if you're a fan of the board game.			"

												In the Grim dark future there is only jammed storm bolters. The emperor has forsaken you, the machine spirits will not answer your prayers. Within this dark corridor on this jumbled broken mass of wrecked starships, the product of ten millennia of war, there is barely the room to turn around. You can hear the bark of your battle brothers storm bolters before they click silent, misfiring once again, then you hear the screams. They are all around you, coming through every hole and down every corridor. It is too many, they are too fast. Perhaps with your brothers at your back, maybe if you see them comming there is a chance. You have already killed so many, stained so much plasteel with xenos blood, but how much longer before your storm bolter too finally goes silent? What help can your brothers lend when the enemy is upon you? You will die here.And when you awake you will find the same dark halls filled with the echos of xenos footsteps coming for you. Once again you will wander through this unforgiving labyrinth looking for an escape you never find. Perhaps this time, you are so close now.			"

The game features the original missions and alot of other missions that each have their own challenge. The game gets gradually more difficult as you progress, making you strategize, as it can change to good or bad in an instance.The game is based upon dice rols and can go either way.The grapichs are decent, they arent any high budget grapichs, but they are good enough. The animation can be a bit stiff and look odd sometimes, but nothing that really ruins the game.the sounds are pretty good and does their job.So yeah....i like it			"

In conclusion, its what is says on the (hypothetical) box. Its space hulk transfered to steam. Nothing special, but it can be laugh with friends- and certainly worth it if its on sale.			"

If you ever said ""Man, rougelikes are just too easy and not frustrating enough"", then you will love this game. this is not a game for the weak people.

This game has no mercy. It is not an easy to get into game. It does a good job being true to the space hulk boardgame, which is sooo mean, that it makes monopoly look like hungry hungry hippos. the downside, is that they ransom off all the nice stuff as dlc. The vanilla game is just like the board game, blood angles and genestealers. But you do not really need the dlc, unless you play as one of the other space marine chapters, or like yellow tyranids.

												This is a great, great game.. albeit that you have to like the genre.I've played several games that claimed to be ""spacehulk"", but this one? this has the right to be called ""spacehulk"".Its truely as close as you can get to the original boardgame, turnbased, 100% strategic.Obviously it was originally a 2 (or 3 in some cases) player game, but this one does have singleplayer mode that actually is fun to play.Badass spacemarines vs masses of genestealers, who will prevail in the end?If you've played the boardgame, and liked it, then dont hesitate to buy this game.If you dont know it, but always wonderd where the warhammer universe is (partly) rooted? then buy this game :PIf you dont know it, but do like turnbased strategy games? well.. buy it! :Pits unlike anything else you got in your game library.Last note, the original boardgame had 100's of quests and storylines, original stories made by the developers themselves, for the game (back then) that means there is a ton of optional dlc in the future (i hope!)Anyway, i give this game 9 out 10 for the way it kept to the original boardgame, not giving in to spice it up for modern fps style, the true sense of strategy is still here as it should be :D			"

												I'm a huge fan of tabletop games, although never got into Warhammer 40k in particular (I was more into Legions of Steel, which has much in common with the Space Hulk board game as it turns out).  I first played the PC version of Space Hulk back in the mid-90s, and it immediately addicted me with its puzzle-like levels and brutal, unforgiving gameplay.  I originally grabbed this title purely due to my desire for an update.  It was a bit buggy at release; however, it's been cleaned up dramatically and is now quite solid IMO.It does take a while to get used to the way you have to deploy and move your squad.  Some complaints you'll see about randomness is likely the result of someone not getting this completely under their belt.  I can also see people's point about wanting some kind of development over time for your squad members, but I'll admit I prefer the more puzzle-like format of the missions keeping you focused on your objective, and sometimes Terminators will fall in pursuit of it.  If there was xp-based leveing up of your squad, many people will just save-scum to ensure progression rather than focus on the puzzle at hand.If you're a fan of turn-based squad combat or table-top wargames, and crave some challenge, I would imagine Space Hulk would fit the bill for you nicely.

												This game is so much better than the Metascore would indicate. I think a lot of the negativity is due to the numerous bugs that were in the game when launched. They seemed to have fixed/improved all the major issues. That said, it is one of the best games I have played on Steam since Portal 2. I preface this by saying that I was a huge fan of the original board game and prefer turn-based strategy to real-time.  The early missions are pretty simplistic with limited options for your crew. But get deeper into the missions--especially with the DLC missions, and you're in for a treat. The sense of claustrophobia and panic when things go wrong is very well conveyed. The addition of psychics, chain guns and the Wolf marines really adds a lot of different strategies and to the overall awesomeness of the game. The game itself has a great look generally, although the cut-scene animations where you waste the genestealers look pretty cheesy. The game is reasonably priced as are the DLC missions.  Highly recommended to fans of the board game or Warhammer 40K fanboys.			"

												Space Hulk is based on a Table Top game based in the Warhammer universe.  This game is a pretty direct translation of those game rules.  Firing, defending, melee attacking are all based on dice roll values.  It should be noted that this game was inspired by ""Aliens"" with you being in control of a small group of elite soldier trying to survive in the face of a vicious overwhelming enemy.  And after playing it, that is exactly what it felt like.You are put in control of the Space Marine's elite soldiers named the Terminators, and your mission is to board a derelict space hulk (Ginormous Space Marine vessel) and complete objectives within the ship using your small team of Terminators, all the while, monstrous aliens named Tyranids are trying to wipe out your squad be swarming them (much like the zerg).This is a turnbased Strategy game where you move your guys on your turn, then the enemy moves their guys on their turn.  Your Terminators have a set amount of action points individually, and then at the beginning of the round you get a random amount of community action points that anyone can use (1-6 points).  The level begins with you placing your Terminators in their starting zone in the order that you want.  After that you decide how you are going to move them, where they will hold defensively, etc etc.  When it is the enemies turn, they will spawn units in set locations on the map, but they will randomly decide which of those locations they will spawn the enemies.  Do they feel like using all of their units on two spots? Or will they spread them out among the 6 they have at their disposal?Every decision you make will have an affect on the outcome of the mission, even squad placement at the beginning of the level.  One of the main reasons for this is because the corridors are only wide enough for one person.  Once that person is in the front, you cannot shoot through him or manouver around him.  Your guy at the front run out of ammo?  Well, unless there is a big junction in the area, he will probably end up dying since he can't fire on incoming enemies.  This really makes you think about how you move and where you place your Terminators in conjunction with how do you use their role properly (Flamethrower can hose down an entire corridor with fire for one turn, effectively cutting the enemy off from that route...or your normal assault rifle people can go on over watch to fire upon the enemy on the enemies movement turn, utilizing chokepoints to stay in control of the battlefield.)  One wrong move, one vital loss, can turn your plan inside out as the enemy surrounds your Terminators rendering chokepoints useless.The game itself is pretty well done.  I haven't run into many bugs, and none that were experience ruining/gamebreaking, just a couple of visual bugs which is pretty normal for any game.  One of the small gripes I have with the game is, in certain situations (only one situation I can think of ATM), you can't trust the movement AI to move your men the way you want, making you spend more action points than you needed to.  It's ok though, after you play for an hour or so, you realize where it gets confused and you just have to micromanage a small amount during those times.  Even if you forget or mess up, you can undo your last action.  One other small grip is the mouse control.  Left mouse click is used for everything, meaning selection AND movement.  Accidentally click a square instead of a person?  Welp, your current selection will start moving.  They could have avoided this by making left click selection and right click movement.  Not a big problem, I've only accidentally done that twice and both times I was able to hit undo, so no harm no foul.The gamelength is somewhat average. There is 2 chapters available, one being an introduction and tutorial with no length, and the more meaty chapter consisting of about 8-10 levels.  I have only completed about 5-6 levels so far and have spent about 30 minutes to an hour per level.  There are other Chapters available for download via DLC for about 5 dollars a chapter.Multiplayer is available, although I have not played it.  And unfortunately, there is no map editor for the community to use its imagination and make cool new maps, which is unfortunate because that is one of the big advantages of playing the tabletop: Making your own stories. (and lets be honest, dedicated fans have and always will make the best maps for any game...it would not be that hard to include a map editor for how simple it is to develop maps for this.  Straight corridors, doors, junctions, tiny rooms, all tile based...simplistic pieces put together to make a more complex challenge)I don't like to add some kind of random number to games, I will just say that if you like Warhammer 40k lore/universe and you like games like X-COM, chances are you will like this game.  If you like turnbased strategy games in general, you'd probably enjoy this game.  You can probably complete it on your first run through in around 6-10 hours.  I personally feel somewhat satisfied, but wishing that it had maybe at least 1 more chapter.  To me it is worth the price, but just barely.  No map creator makes it harder to recommend, but non-the-less, I still recommend it.			"

												What a truly atrocious game. This game is retched. It's nigh unplayable....What's interesting here is that we have a game that really *shouldn't* be this bad. I mean if you look at all the different aspects of the game, they are all good. BUT when it comes to games, you NEED to have one factor above the others or it brings the whole thing down to the lowest common denominator. And that's what's happened in Space Hulk. They've got 95% of a great game here, they just ♥♥♥♥ed up the most important 5%. The control.I mean, why the f**k did they even bother? Imagine I cooked you a beautiful cake. It's got icing. It's a large portion. It looks beautiful, and to top it all off, it's low in calories. Great right? Well, what If I poured a big load of salt in it? It turns out that it's worthless right? The most important thing about food is that 1) You can eat it, and it 2) tastes good. Well, guess the duck what? Games aren't that different. If you want a good game the two most important things you need are 1) you can PLAY IT and 2) It's FUN.And that's the problem! Space Hulk just isn't playable. They poured a big, big, big, big, big, big bag of salt into the games controls. I know for a fact that the game should be fun. The game is based on a very popular board game that is *VERY* fun. So I know that the underlying mechanics of the game would be fun, they've just been implemented poorly. To go back to our food analogy, let's pretend I have baked a new cake. Not only does this one not have an♥♥♥♥♥load of salt, but the cake tastes absolutely amazing. Now, I'm going to offer you a slice of this fantastic tasting cake. Only, the thing is, I'm not going to give you a fork and I'm not going to give you a plate. Nope, you'll have to eat it off the floor, and for every bite you take, I'm going to burn you with a lit cigarette.And that's what it's like playing Space Hulk.			"

												Maybe it's just me, but we've come a long way in a very short amount of time when it comes to video game technology. It seems that a game as simple as Space Hulk could very, VERY easily do with some fine turning and general polish. The gameplay itself gets repetitive pretty fast, and I don't really have the sense of impending doom that I had playing the physical version this is based upon. I hoped it would be Space Hulk like I loved and rememberd. The agony and pain are there, but for all the wrong reasons.			"

												Space Hulk is a straight conversion of the board game and thus bring the flaws with it.  I'm OK with that because I played Space Hulk as a kid and it was a nobrainer to buy this for the nostalgia. A bit of duel edged sword for the dev as if they'd messed with it, that would have brought down some hurt as well. So buy Space Hulk for the nostalgia and Ascension to get some tweaks to make it more computer gamey.			"

												Brilliant version of the board game. I played the original PC version of Space Hulk in the early 90s and thought it was good. I have also enjoyed playing the space hulk games on PSX and Saturn in addition to the board game. This game is a cracking conversion and I'm pleased I got it as such a great price during the sale and I'm also pleased I ignored the metascore which I consider to be very misleading. If you like squad-level, turn based strategy games give it a go. If you like Warhammer/Space Hulk table-top games, you'll love it.			"

												Space Hulk is a very good turn based representation of the Games Workshop board game.  The graphics are good and Full Control added animation speed up options for those too impatient to wait for their terminators to move.  They have been pretty good pushing out patches for fixes and recently rolled out cross platform operation with the iPad.  I personally have not had any major glitch issues with the game.  The current multiplayer role is only PvP with coop supposedly on the way.  The missions follow that same liner theme as the original board game with short intros.  Campaigns last about 6 missions.  If your idea of fun is mindlessly mashing buttons and hopping around to beat levels as fast as possible, you may want to make a different choice.			"

												Supposedly, the Imperium sends Terminators to delve deep into the twisted masses of derelicts known as Space Hulks because only they are strong enough to face the horrors within. Given the life expectancy of Terminators in this game, regular Space Marines must spontaneously combust the moment they breath space hulk air. This game is an extremely faithful recreation of the original board game. Don't go into this expecting an epic story (For the record, the story: Space Hulk filled with bad things. Here are many guns. Go kill now.), an action-packed thrill-a-minute roller coaster, or a graphical tour-de-force. Sometimes a mission will be failed because the dice hate you and your Seargeant can't hit the broad side of a genestealer and your guns jam after every shot. Sometimes you'll realize too late that the guy with the flamethrower is at the back of the troop column marching single file through the dark corridors. And sometimes you'll win.Either way, go into this game with the right expectations and you'll be well rewarded. For instance, remember that, like the board game it's based on, Space Hulk is best taken in two to three hours sessions, not marathons.			"

												As a teen 20 years ago I discovered 40k, and soon after discovered Space Hulk I have many fond memories of playing, weather it was in the backyard shed cutting class at school with a couple buddies or just hangin out. Space hulk was one of the games we actually played a lot instead of just painting and dreaming about playing. Back then We would talk about how cool a futuristic video game versoin would be. The versions from that era never really satisfied as they weren't really the game. They were much like the game but maybe more first person action oriented like the 3DO and Playstation versoins. or the horrible graphics Amiga before that. I played them all but now I've played that game I always wanted. that Computer remake that is simply the board game remade with online and multiplayer support, it will even have a level editor. It's just what I really wanted from a Space Hulk game, everything works and will only get better as the dev team continues to work on it. The dificulty and tatics are just like I remember them, The animations need some work but the graphics are solid and look good. The controls and hud have everthing you need easily accessible. The menu's are quick and responsive and the sound is good. I would recommend Space Hulk to anyone who loved the boardgame and also anyone who enjoys brutally hard, slower paced, strategic and tatical gameplay.			"

Since theyre weak against the genestealers you cant use them to block a path at all, so most of times they were only annoying, using some space i could use for real soldiers.Despite those flaws wich prevent this game to be a ""great "" game, i had fun playing it.

												I'm a longtime fan of Space Hulk (my dad raised me on the board game), so this was a must have for me. Couldn't really recommend it beyond that, though. I grabbed it on sale at $4.99 - probably wouldn't have, otherwise, despite my fandom. If you're reading this outside of sale season, just be patient and wait for it to drop like I did. The visuals are dated and the animations are repetitive, and I would have liked to see more cinematics, but that's not a huge turn-off, considering the price. This is, simply put, an extremely faithful digital reproduction of the classic board game. The AI is on point, but the difficulty ramp is fraking steep and the random number generator produces 1s at what seems to be a statistically anomolous rate. If I had d6s roll the way they do in this game I'd have thrown them away by now. Anyway, fun way to get my fix when I can't con my friends into playing the board game, and if you're a Space Hulk or tabletop 40k fan, go ahead and pick it up. If you're looking for something faster-paced in the 40k universe I'd recommend Dawn of War 1 and 2 (if you're looking for RTS) or Space Marine if you're more the shooty type.			"

												This game is a very close recreation of the Space Hulk board game.  If you enjoy the board game (or could not find a copy of the 3rd edition version) this is an excellent purchase that I fully recommend.If you have not played Space Hulk, but like Warhammer 40K, I also recommend this game for the atmosphere.  So far the game seems to capture the feel of 40K pretty well.  It is kind of like the Dawn of War series in that regard, but focused solely on Terminators and Genestealers.  Hopefully they will expand the game in the future using other units and/or races from 40K (which were given some rules in old White Dwarf articles.)If you don't know about warhammer 40K or Space Hulk, this is still a very good squad based game.  It is turn based, which until recently had been hard to find.  While I believe something like XCOM is a better turn based squad game, this one is also quite good, but limited compared to that game.  There in not advancement, force management, or other features.  This is pure turn based mission execution.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a turn based squad game.  However, Warhammer 40K fans and those that know and love the Space Hulk board game will be the most impressed with it.			"

												Space Hulk is a simple, challenging tactical boardgame.  Once you learn to use overwatch, it's not hard to beat, but additional challenges for achievements and keeping all your men alive through a mission make the game much more difficult.  There's not a great deal of story or lore involved; it doesn't tell you much about the 40k world, but if you're looking for a simple challenge in turn-based tactics, this is a good game to sink time into.

												A largely-faithful recreation of the boardgame, and as such it plays like a boardgame. Your squad(s) and their loadouts are preselected based on the mission, and gameplay is centered around managing Action Points and a variable pool of Command Points, with additional resource management required when dealing with assault cannons and heavy flamers (both of which have limited ammunition). If the odds are in your favor you can park Sargeant Gideon and his impressively large hammer in a chokepoint and watch as he stomps 14 Genestealers in a single game. If the odds are not in your favor you'll watch him go down to the first melee attack launched against him.If you are looking for a fully featured 40K experience this is not it and it is not meant to be. On the other hand if you're a fan of the Space Hulk boardgame, or of boardgames in general, then this game is certainly worth giving a whirl.			"

												This game is cool and all, but I seriously don't understand why they had to send the bulkiest Space Marines into the space hulk. They are so big, they clip through the walls sometimes! Their feet on the metal is louder than 60 babies crying and they move as slow as sloth with no legs (you can increase the animation speed, but still) They say their armour is the toughest, but they can get killed in one swipe from the Genestealer? So what is the point? It would be much better to send in Space Marine scouts and sneak around trying not to be noticed...Well anyway, it's a great strategy game and I believe it's pretty accurate to the board game (which I myself haven't played, but one of my friends has)It's worth getting during the sale!!

												They could've done so much more with this IP. Decades worth of material for reference, and modern squad-based games to take note from (XCOM) but this game ultimately falls short. The characters move far too slow, the missions are too similiar, there is nowhere near enough choice of weaponry or armour (I would've liked to see Dawn of War 2-style ultimate Warhammer hero customisation) and the difficulty balance is all over the place. The developers obviously tried to stay as close as possible to the original board game, and that is very admirable of them. But it didn't transfer well to computers. A giant shame.			"

												Ok, so I'll start out by saying that I am a fan of the whole Warhammer 40k universe. I can't say that I am a veteran, as most of my experience is limited to reading 40k wiki articles and playing the Dawn of War games, but I have found this game quite enjoyable. That being said, the game is still best bought on sale. The game only comes with 15 missions and some will take an hour or more to beat. Multiplayer is limited (some maps are heavily unbalanced because your are playing the missions for single player). They seem to keep pumping out content, which is good and I certianly don't regret buying during the winter sale.There are some issues (some of the missions are impossible if the genestealers swarm hard from certain approaches at the start of the game), but for the most part each mission is interesting and fun. Yes, sometimes you have to sacrifice marines to achieve the mission, but I guess the same is true for the board game and real combat.Basic rundown of the mechanics of the game: (1) Space marines die in close quarters, hallways are your friend in conjunction with overwatch. Keep as much of a hallway between you and the first point your marine can see the beastie and he will cut them down...usually (jams and the mission where you don't have sustained fire can cause even the best positioned marine to die) (2) The game has (for most missions) an endless supply of genestealers, so you must achieve the objective while being constantly harassed by genestealer that seem to favor spawning where the biggest clump of your marines(though this is not a law, sometimes a lone marine will be swarmed). (3) Actions and movements are based on AP that your marines get at the begining of battle (4 for each marine, genestealers get 6) and are used for everything from moving, shooting, opening doors, and entering blessed overwatch. You also get a randomly generated number of CP that can be used for anything AP are use for and probably most critically, unjaming weapons during the genestealer's turn (where they are hopefully being mowed down by overwatch.If you give the game a chance and you like 40k it will be worth your time playing.Cleanse the xenos. Burn the witch. Purge the heretic.			"

												I have the first version, unpatched. So bear in mind it might become better. I like the assault cannon, but that's about it. Now, I love the Warhammer 40K franchise, but this is my least favorite of them all. Even worse than the stale mate Dark Crusade and Soulstorm. There is something infuriatingly SLOW about the whole thing and you wait a lot to see enemies move, and even the initial deployment of the squad is unnecessarily slow and has this ugly delay where the app-like alert lingers way too long. Geez, can I just get to the action already!? There's not even an option to set a faster speed. Worst of all you can play for a really long time and then lose horribly in just a few turns, so you're just not up for endless SLOWMO again and again and again. Also, even for a simple game like this, the interface is annoying. It's a precision game, and it's such a disaster to accidentally move a character, but it easily happens, especially since there appears to be no easy (mouse) way to get out of the ""move mode"". Would it really have hurt to let the right mouse button work like an escape. If, like me, you own all of the Warhamme 40K games, you'll think this is a ""must have"". Sadly, it's not.  In my cycle these developers would be in trouble.			"

												I don't know what kind of horrid bugs this game had when it came out, but I don't think they are there anymore. You can safely ignore the metacritic score, if you ever paid attention to it, for this reason. The game is fully functional at this point.This game is very similar to the XCOM games, except that the game is set in the War40k universe. You command a small squad or squads to wander the decaying halls of a space hulk. Your enemy is the Tyranid race, specifically Genestealers. The area is really cramped, and you are forced to send your squad through the halls one at a time, covering the flanks and rear. The mood is very tense, and you can be sure that you are not at all safe. You will probably die a lot until you figure out how to optimally position your squad. The UI is really simple and clean, so that will not be an issue. You gun will jam frequently due to the fact that enemies have a tendency to start pouring out of nowhere en masse whenever they feel like it. This will leave you vulnerable, unless you learn to prepare. Any enemy coming within melee range has about a 60% chance of killing you.  Basically, this is a Space Hulk game. If you know what that is, you know everything there is to know about this game. It's a digital recreation of the game with voice acting, which is alright. The game's standard price is a little bit high.			"

												This game is a very close recreation of the Space Hulk board game.  If you enjoy the board game (or could not find a copy of the 3rd edition version) this is an excellent purchase that I fully recommend.If you have not played Space Hulk, but like Warhammer 40K, I also recommend this game for the atmosphere.  So far the game seems to capture the feel of 40K pretty well.  It is kind of like the Dawn of War series in that regard, but focused solely on Terminators and Genestealers.  Hopefully they will expand the game in the future using other units and/or races from 40K (which were given some rules in old White Dwarf articles.)If you don't know about warhammer 40K or Space Hulk, this is still a very good squad based game.  It is turn based, which until recently had been hard to find.  While I believe something like XCOM is a better turn based squad game, this one is also quite good, but limited compared to that game.  There in not advancement, force management, or other features.  This is pure turn based mission execution.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a turn based squad game.  However, Warhammer 40K fans and those that know and love the Space Hulk board game will be the most impressed with it.			"

												The negative reviews across the net appear to be out of date.  This rendition of Space Hulk is surprisingly challenging, but quite smooth in gameplay.  Although the squads are not evenly balanced, (melee god sgt and auto cannon vs balanced sgt and flamer) it doesn't distract from the fun.  My only gripe is that loading a saved game isn't intuitive and can't be done while playing a scenario.  That should be a fix.  However, it looks like GW is finally supporting its non-essential games (Blood Bowl, Space Hulk) and I hope that this means that we'll be seeing more creativity and production out of them than we have in the past.

												Like Space Hulk?  Then get this game.  It's Space Hulk.  A new minor changes aside, it's the exact board game you know and love, made into a faithful computer game equivalent.  The main complaints I've seen regarding the game are some of the items from the board game that don't translate as well to computer form.  Despite added animations, it's a fairly staic game, although the lighting and sounds add some atmosphere.  The movement is clunky (what do you expect they're Terminators!) and they prbably ould have put an option in to speed up the animation.  They only (admittedly minor) grip I have regarding the way they did the rules is that it wll automatically spend your action points on unjamming your guns, even if you'd rather spend them another way.  This may get patched out at some point, but I haven't seen that yet.  So finally, if you enjoy Space Hulk, or even just 40k, get the game.  It's worth it.			"

												Decent conversion of an awesome board game into a PC game, but a bit pricey for what you get. The graphics and animations are sub-par for the PC platform and the game really needs the co-op mode we've been promised (in progress, we hope) and more campaigns/maps (hoping the community steps in here). As a digital version of Space Hulk with the option of playing against the AI it works fine, just like Blood Bowl did.Edit (to celebrate the Space Wolf DLC): With continuing support and decent DLC, the game is slowly evolving from ""fair enough"" to ""pretty good"". The AI isn't clever but you can certainly lose if you're unlucky or careless. While it's still not flawless and still lacks co-op and level editors, it's becoming a better buy all the time.			"

												Let me just start out by saying that this game definitely isn't for everyone. It's for people who like the board game, or want to try it out and don't want to drop $250 on a physical copy off eBay.  If you have no idea how Space hulk works, you probably shouldn't even bother. You'll just be frustrated by the randomness of the whole thing.That said, I really enjoy it. I didn't at first, however. If you have no idea of what you do in Space Hulk, the game will feel impossible as a single Genestealer completely rips apart half your squad in one turn. Space Hulk is a dice game, where luck is a major factor. Where in the actual game, missing 5 shots in a row as your friend slowly advances a Genestealer would be just hilarious, in the video game it just becoems frustrating. Or if your weapon jams 4 times in a row.Animations are slow for the Terminators. So you're probably best disabling the timer, as slow animaation aren't something you have to deal with in the actual game. you can speed them up, but they just look silly. The first-person shoulder cam is cinematic, but isn't used often enough, and needs an option to be bigger. Graphics-wise, it's nothing too impressive. The astetics are perfect, you really feel like you're trundling through the tight corridors of a space hulk. Sounds are good, but possibly repetative over time. I'm mostly listening to something else when I play, so I don't notice.There are a few differenced from the board game. They don't really hurt the game, in my opinion though. They just help ease some of the frustrations.TL;DR, If you like the board game, or like the Warhammer 40k universe, and don't mind the random element, you will probably enjoy this.  Otherwise, you may want to stay away.			"

												This feels like a board game. Which is great if you're looking for that quick fix. It's all about the dice roll though and when you have a bad luck streak it can wreck a mission completely. It however stays true to the original board game and has an interesting solo campaign that can be challenging. Overall recommendation worthy, especially if its on sale and you can find a partner to play against.			"

												This is a faithful recreation of the board game, more specifically the newer re-release (which I may or may not have on my shelf), to a fault.  The underlying mechanics use simulated D6 rolls and the mission maps for the main campaign are even ripped straight from the manual.  Hard to say if it was GW or the devs, but there was some missed room for improvement and refinement of the formula.There are no hybrids or patriarchs as in the original, instead we have the broodlords form the newer version.  It reduces the variety for anyone wanting to play genesteelers, but I suppose it makes it easier to balance.  Ultimately, there isn't too much room for strategy on the geensteeler side, which is why it's fitting the campaign plays from the Terminator's perspective.If you enjoy the boardgame or have nostalgia for the original, there's something here to enjoy.  But if you don't know what Space Hulk or Warhammer 40K are, I'm not sure I can really recomend this.			"

												Great nostalgia trip/time sink for 40k afficionados and tabletop fans.  Lack of variety of enemies is a little disappointing, but the missions are varied enough that the game remains challenging and interesting, with some very intense scrapes if you push for some of the achievements.Its a little disappointing that you only get to use terminators, as they start to feel very plain, especially against the very scary genestealers - you almost forget what killing machines they actually are in the broader 40k conext.  I'd love for Full Control to get a chance to remake space crusade, so that we could use a wider variety of units - scouts and space marines as well as terminators against the likes of the orks, eldar and chaos as well.I hope there is a long tail of content for this game, more campaigns and hopefully a map editor and painter tools for custom campaigns.  Space Hulk is a strong base to start from, and I'm sure there are plenty of diehard fans out there willing to fork out for more adventures with the emperor's finest.7/10, solid.			"

												For those who enjoyed (and are able to remember) the board game when it came out, this will renew that delight.  Same game and rules, but you have moving graphics instead of figurines. I think the interiors are simple but well done, and the cut scenes aren't too shabby or annoying.Drawbacks for those who've played the boardgame - it's the same scenarios as well (initially).  So, if you worked out how to beat the scenarios on the boardgame, you might yourself wishing for more - although I believe the later scenarios in this game were not in the boardgame.Recommended just for the nostalgia, if nothing else.

												As a fan of the original Board game, This game ended up being nothing less then what I expected. But, not a great deal more either.  I had a bunch of friends in High School who got really into W40K and so I bought a few models myself.  While I loved building my armies, I could never get into the game, It was far too complicated and time consuming. However, the tight claustrophobic, squad based battles of space hulk were loads of fun to me.If you are looking for a game oozing with atmosphere, while being as simplistic and easy to understand, then this game is for you.  If you want pages of charts and stats, and a steep learning curve that take months or years to master then poke on over to something else.  While the game has many weapons and abilities to aid your strategies, it is still at it's heart a board game, meant to be easily understood, and enjoyed in quick bites.			"

Nothing is more fun in the game than seeing a terminator on over watch tear through ten or more 'stealers.  Nothing stinks worse than making a tactical error that results in not only your ""safe"" terminator being killed but the rest of your squad as well since they were depending on him to protect them.

												I like both Space Hulk video games.  Each have their own little bits and pieces that make the game shine out a bit.  The old one had the first person shooter (kind of) and presented another aspect of the game rather than just strategy.  This new one lacks that part, but seems to be a bit more challenging with its strategy.  I generally don't compare graphics as that is ""all natural"" to have better graphics than yester-year.I wish they did have something that would allow you to grow your fellow terminators however.  A leveling system for each terminator would be great to have so it doesn't seem so ""same same"" and ruin the replay value of the game......			"

												You have to understand that this is meant to be a replica of a physical  boardgame. If you come in expecting a fully fleshed out, original stratagy game like X-Com but with a 40K theme then you'll be sadly disapointed. However, as a boardgame replica it does a very good job.The graphics are rather un-polished and the animation speed is a bit slow on the defiault setting (you can change this in the options menu) but it does what it's suposed to. Persoanlly I don't think it's worth the $30 asking price, but if you can grab it on sale and are a fan of the physical game then it's probably worh it. I cant stress this enough: If you've never heard of spacehulk beofre now this game will probably not be for you! You will probably hate it if that's the case, so be warned! If however you are a fan of the original and don't mind the steep price for what it is then you may very well enjoy it.My largest complaints are the steep price tag and the DLC which seems a little too costly as well. It's an unpolished experiance but can still be an enjoyable one for the right audience.To sum it up, do some research before buying to make sure it's your type of game.			"

But I really enjoy it, I have found pretty decent replayability as well.  I was worried about that at first but It seems my worries were put to rest as soon as i ran through the game a second time and found that nearly each stage was a completely different experience than the first run through.  Im not too sure about the multiplayer as I have yet to get a match beyond the lobby going.  But the AI seems good enough a half dozen play throughs at least and the DLC was pretty good too.  Highly recommend this one to hardcore TBS fans that have never tried it.  9/10			"

												If there was a stronger story to tie the campaign together this would have been a lot of fun, but that isn't the case, so the missions tend to be a little dry. The slow pacing of the boardgame adds tension, but as all the Video Game has rule enforcement done by the computer, the speed of the gameplay seems really slow and even dull on the PC. But that being said if you are a space hulk fan or just want some slow tactical gameplay, and this is on sale, you might as well give this classic a go.			"

												It's...the board game. Not much more and not much less. Not to say this is necessarily a bad thing, it's a fun game for people who enjoy turn based board games with lots of dice rolling and strategy. However this isn't a video game adaptation of the board game, it's literally a ""port"" of the game straight onto the PC. This isn't a 40k XCOM. It feels a bit unpolished, and there are definitely some annoyances to work around. But if you played and enjoyed the board game, or enjoy other games of this nature, it's worth buying (not for full price though, I'd recommend at least a 50% sale). There are a few annoyances but it's a very faithful port of the original board game.			"

												""Space Hulk"" is computer version of the tactical board game - nothing more, nothing less. It is based on 3rd Edition of rules (down to the names and equipment of the marines) and includes all the missions from the original mission book and well as three bonus assigments plus three tutorial ones. You can buy additional campaigns, but I haven't tried them yet. As funny as it sounds, this is the first turn-based adaptation, as both 1993 'Space Hulk' and 1995 'Space Hulk: Vengeance of Blood Angels' were played in real-time with limited active pause.The game itself in of a 'simple to learn, hard to master' variety. Forces and are pre-determined for every mission and there is no real possibility of customising them in any way. Array of actions is also very limited - it is a game of strategic positioning and area coverage with a liberal amount of random element (combat is resolved by simulated dice roll). So, moving, turning and shooting in cramped spaces with 4-5 action points per unit, where most actions use up one AP). You get the idea. The game may seem slow and limited but even a slightest error migh lead to demise. Especially when you turn the turn time limit.  You might feel claustrophobic at first but this is the idea of game - not choosing from many tactical opportunities, but using the their limited array to a maximum. All thing considered, not unlike chess. A nice change from numerous  hectic tactical games.The game includes a multiplayer mode with a hot-seat option is a nice addition. Now you can play a Space Hulk game with a live opponent without buying the board game (tkat is more expensive) or even getting together to play a mission or two. Addition of co-op mode is a nice touch too (it reminds me a bit of 'Death Angel' card game by FFG).I feel obliged to warn people not interested in Warhammer 40000 universe though, because for causal gamers this game might prove too challenging and monotonous, while seasoned armchair generals might yearn for more complexity. You might also be put off by the very limited surroundings - all missions use virtually the same few map elements, only the floorplans change. But if you missed good old times of 'Laser Squad' you might give 'Space Hulk' a try.Graphics and sound are nothing to write home about but do not offend either. The game is a good piece of craftsmanship, the models and surroundings definitely keep the Warhammer 40000 atmosphere. camera window adds to it but after a while starts to annoy (you can turn it off though). Music and battle sounds are of similar kind.Is it worth it? Well, as an alternative to boardgame - definitely yes, as even at full price it is way cheaper than the fully tangible version. As a standalone game - it depends. You get 15 missions, and 4 additional campaigns with 5 mission each (5 EUR / 3 GBP / 7 USD) a piece. So, full collection might be a bit pricey, so I recommend waiting for a discount.			"

The game requires strategy and will challenge you. The bad? You get 2 campaigns for the asking price, and the rest of them are being sold in a micro-transaction store. 80% of the game available at release is being held back to gouge you. Buy it if they offer it as a complete pack, but the way they marketed this one is just insulting. That's all I've got to say about that.			"

												It's...the board game. Not much more and not much less. Not to say this is necessarily a bad thing, it's a fun game for people who enjoy turn based board games with lots of dice rolling and strategy. However this isn't a video game adaptation of the board game, it's literally a ""port"" of the game straight onto the PC. This isn't a 40k XCOM. It feels a bit unpolished, and there are definitely some annoyances to work around. But if you played and enjoyed the board game, or enjoy other games of this nature, it's worth buying (not for full price though, I'd recommend at least a 50% sale). There are a few annoyances but it's a very faithful port of the original board game.			"

												""Space Hulk"" is computer version of the tactical board game - nothing more, nothing less. It is based on 3rd Edition of rules (down to the names and equipment of the marines) and includes all the missions from the original mission book and well as three bonus assigments plus three tutorial ones. You can buy additional campaigns, but I haven't tried them yet. As funny as it sounds, this is the first turn-based adaptation, as both 1993 'Space Hulk' and 1995 'Space Hulk: Vengeance of Blood Angels' were played in real-time with limited active pause.The game itself in of a 'simple to learn, hard to master' variety. Forces and are pre-determined for every mission and there is no real possibility of customising them in any way. Array of actions is also very limited - it is a game of strategic positioning and area coverage with a liberal amount of random element (combat is resolved by simulated dice roll). So, moving, turning and shooting in cramped spaces with 4-5 action points per unit, where most actions use up one AP). You get the idea. The game may seem slow and limited but even a slightest error migh lead to demise. Especially when you turn the turn time limit.  You might feel claustrophobic at first but this is the idea of game - not choosing from many tactical opportunities, but using the their limited array to a maximum. All thing considered, not unlike chess. A nice change from numerous  hectic tactical games.The game includes a multiplayer mode with a hot-seat option is a nice addition. Now you can play a Space Hulk game with a live opponent without buying the board game (tkat is more expensive) or even getting together to play a mission or two. Addition of co-op mode is a nice touch too (it reminds me a bit of 'Death Angel' card game by FFG).I feel obliged to warn people not interested in Warhammer 40000 universe though, because for causal gamers this game might prove too challenging and monotonous, while seasoned armchair generals might yearn for more complexity. You might also be put off by the very limited surroundings - all missions use virtually the same few map elements, only the floorplans change. But if you missed good old times of 'Laser Squad' you might give 'Space Hulk' a try.Graphics and sound are nothing to write home about but do not offend either. The game is a good piece of craftsmanship, the models and surroundings definitely keep the Warhammer 40000 atmosphere. camera window adds to it but after a while starts to annoy (you can turn it off though). Music and battle sounds are of similar kind.Is it worth it? Well, as an alternative to boardgame - definitely yes, as even at full price it is way cheaper than the fully tangible version. As a standalone game - it depends. You get 15 missions, and 4 additional campaigns with 5 mission each (5 EUR / 3 GBP / 7 USD) a piece. So, full collection might be a bit pricey, so I recommend waiting for a discount.			"

												this game sucks, the statistics for successfully killing enemys is horribly against your favor. the only to kill the enemy is to hit the undo button after each move until your guy doesnt miss. the game is highly repetitive and the enemys are all the same (genestealers) some alien like enemy.

												What can I say about this game after only a few minutes of playing it? Most of all: read all the extensive reviews posted before - they are accurate.What I really can't bear with is the sluggish movement of my units. I am aware that this is a recreation of a board game - but why do my Terminators move around like lead-filled, stomping elephants?Still I can recommend it to anyone into the Warhammer 40k universe...

												Overall I like the game a lot, considering I got the base game for $2.50 on sale. No complaints there. I don't feel it is worth original price. I'm torn between a thumbs up and thumbs down because of the price of the DLC. I mean, really, five dollars for five missions? One is five for three missions with some added items. So to sum up......I guess thumbs up for the game itself but thumbs down for the price of the DLC. There just isn't enough substance(especially if you paid full price for the base game) to warrant that amount of additional money. Recommended on basis of base game only and bought at significant discount.			"

												A slow and unforgiving TBS game in an era full of anything but. This is a faithful recreation of the Space Hulk boardgame, NOT and adaptation. The game isn't innovative and it doesn't take any ""daring leaps"". It is Space Hulk, nothing more nothing less. It definitely scratched my 40K itch and I'm loving every second of it. Would recomend getting it on sale unless you're a tabletop fan and therefore are willing to drop as much money on 40K as possible.			"

												If you like the boardgame version of Space Hulk, this is an amazingly cheap alternative (if you don't own it), or a cheap digital compliment if you do. The two primary diffferences between the board game and this digital itiration are that the basic campaign is slightly different from the missions included in 3rd edition, and the Tyranids do not have their own separate win conditions in multiplayer. Aside from that, it stays very faithful to GW's fan favorite stand alone boardgame.			"

												Excellent port of the board game no one will play with me anymore!  Just bear in mind: it doesn't stand up to more modern types of survival games, being that it is a direct translation of a board game made in 1989.  Video gamers might want to stick to XCOM and it's ilk.  If you're looking for an authentic Games Workshop board game experience without the setup or need for hardcore tabletop gamers like yourself, then get this.Though a fantastic port, it could've used a bit more spit and polish.  Be patient/use Google as you figure out the best way to get your terminators to do precisely what you want. And, whatever you do, don't forget to max the play speed in the settings menu!  Sheesh!

												Just bought the game for $7.49 at the current Humble Bundle sale and for that price, this game is alright (but not worth $30 imo).It plays very much like the board game, so if your expectations are in line with that... then maybe you'll be OK.  Graphics are functional at best.  AI could be better... it is often not aggressive enough, attacks aren't co-ordinated, and it doesn't use the most optimal spawn points.I enjoyed the game for one playthrough and played a couple of games online (which works well, but lacks players).  Played the Space Hulk board game long, long ago, so part of my recommendation is based on nostalgia.  I think the Metacritic score was a bit harsh.			"

But here is something you will encounter if you will buy and play it.+ Warhammer 40K setting. Coridors, a bit of dungeon crawler feeling without rpg. Good atmosphere if you will put yourself in and try your best. Space marines have shoulder cams so you can see the action from their poit of view.+ High difficulty if you want to follow board game rules (but you can make it even harder for yourself with time limits), expect loses and count with moves where you will wilingly sacrifice your soldiers to complete the mission.+ Good production values, graphic, sounds and naration is well done.+- Randomnes in everything. Its the same with board game where you throw dices for all actions.- Focused mainly at WH40K fans.- Lack of story.			"

												This is a strict and faithful adaptation of the famous Space Hulk board game. This game has very little in terms of bells and whistles - character animations are clunky, basic, and repetitive, music is almost non-existent, and sound effects are cookie-cutter. Overall, I'd say it is a good effort and that Full Control achieved their goal of adapting the board game, but I feel that they priced it outside of its percieved level of quality. I really can't recommend this above the $15 price point.			"

												By the Emperor this game is good!The game play acts very similar to the board game that was produced of the same name although it will seem like the game is bias in making the Tyranids more powerful. I would heavily recommend this to anyone who was a fan of the old Spacehulk games or for any loyalist of the Imperium of Man. I would also recommend this if you have friends who you can play against in online matches as the recreation of missions is both fun and easy to go through.And remember IDLENESS SPREADS HERESY! "

												If you love Warhammer 40k you may like this, or (obviously) if you like the Space Hulk board game.  I got caught up in the hype of a good review and I decided to buy this.  It is *NOT* what I expected at all and really, really not worth 30 bucks.  I should have done some research before I grabbed this one.  Lesson learned - one good review does NOT a good game make.  It is one of the most basic, and boring, strategy games I have ever played.  Sure, the armor is cool - but if you get hit one time... you die.  Your big, tough terminators may as well be wearing a speedo (A space speedo, ok?  You know what I mean... sheesh.).  Save your dough and go buy something good like Orcs must Die! 2 or Eador: Masters of the Broken World or, hell, Plants versus Zombies.  (Speaking of zombies - check out Dead State and State of Decay!)			"

												Love it.I simply love this game. To sum up my surprise with how good it is, I generally hate turn based games. However, I love the look and feel of Warhammer 40K so I decided to finally splurge on some of the games, and I don't regret it. This is my favourite so far. If I ever find this board game, I am 100% buying it, because it is just pure fun and enjoyment. The lurking around, the strategy, the being cornered by a line of Genestealers and mowing them down with a flamethrower, its all there and it's fantastic. I bought 4 copies of this game for my friends and I and do not regret it. It can be intense, hilarious, and downright unfair, but it's fun the whole ride. This game has a lot of great aspects to it, especially the visuals. The way your Terminator walks around, the environment, the lighting, all of it is great. The color scheme as well adds to th overall experience of th egame, with some nice contrasting colors that pop out. The sounds in the game are great as well, with very nice voices for the terminators and weapons, just the sound in general is good.Level design is great as well if you ask me. Every room/area has its own advantages and purpose, and this can b egreatly utilized to the player's advantage. It makes the strategy a bit easier to grasp and gives you the chance for redemption in every new area.The only downsides to the game are a few bugs, the not-so-uncommon bad roll of the dice (which for me personally is a pro as it is hilarious) and some odd choices for the animations. The only consistent bug I have found in the game is that occasionally a unit will be selected, then stay selected even when you finish using all their points. this is more common in Genestealers, as I will ""END UNIT"" and it will continue to stay selected and I will be unable to choose another unit. This has been solved when I select the unit as though I am intending to turn him to another direction, then wildly spinning and a new unit is selected. I can only describe this as annoying as it generally appens to only one unit, but it has happened in 2/5 games I have played online, so it could become a very infuriating bug in the future. The animations are only considered odd to me for the Genestealers. Some of their movement is odd, mainly bevause they always act as though nothing is around them until attacking. This is a minor complaint as the quality of the animations are good, it's just odd looking at a horde of Genestealers staring down a Terminator and acting as though they are doing nothing, licking the air endlessly and generally being in their own little world.Lastly is the dice rolls. Being a board game running off of a dice rolling system, you're gonna have some bad streaks. This however, has never infuriated me in any game I've played so far, as I and my friends find it hilarious. A large, probably 1-2 ton Terminator the size of the hallways he occupies is standing directly in front of a Genestealer. The Terminator attacks with his chaingun. He shoots dozens, even hundreds of bullets and misses, and it is hilarious. The idea of someone being that dense, so unable to fight yet being in the situation, is just the funniest thing to me. This is even funnier when considering you only have to be hit once to die, so say that rule is true, he only has to hit the Genestealer once, but no, he misses all of them. Oh, but he can cross-map snipe with the chaingun and never miss a shot. It's just when his life depends on it he can't fight. This may be a very infuriating thing to some players, which is why it could be seen as a con, but I find it hilarious and adding to the fun of the game. Overall, I'd say this is a strong yes. It has gotten me into a genre that I previously thought I couldn't enjoy, given me and my friends something to laugh about, and offers a fun singleplayer campaign with cool levels. It's a great game, and I'd highly recommend it.Just be warned, some of these games can last over an hour, possibly even two, but it's still TONS of fun!			"

												A true PC version of the TTG, complete with dice rolls.+Lots of maps, even more if you get the DLC.  Your troops are somewhat disposable (they will be back for the next mission) making those heroic charges / sacrifices more tolerable.-No character progression.  I would like more difficulty levels (some levels are easy when set to ""hard"" difficulty).  The AI isn't terribly clever.  You can't change your squad composition or terminator loadout.I think it's fun.  It runs well, no bugs or crashes.  It is slow TBS goodness like the TTG.			"
