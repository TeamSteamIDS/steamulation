												If you've played Panzer General before and you liked it, then that's all you need to know. This is basically a direct copy-update of the game.What you REALLY want though, is the Grand Campaign. That alone is worth the full price twice over, it's literally what it says on the tin. A grand campaign from 39-45 and it is much better paced than the stand alone game. It's also very good at representing what went on in the war and provides a nice learning curve. You'll stomp through Poland with ease, bounce up through Norway, smash the French as if they weren't there (after some minor resistance from the Belgians) and you'll feel epic as a General after having all those conquests. More so when you raid the Balkans.Then you go off against Russia, and it's easy, you smash them, underequipped, out of supply, un prepared. And you're laughing, over your German beer and with your fraulein sitting in your lap, you're one of the best army generals in the Nazi Regime.Then reality hits. The Russians mobilise, they get their airforce at you, their tanks roll towards you and the legions and legions of infantry just won't stop. Your puny Panzers' shells can't even stand up to their tanks, your anti-tanks get steamrolled, and its here, right on the battlefield in mother Russia that you'll find out whether your skills as a General are up to scratch. By the end of it, Poland and France will seem like a distant memory.Reckon you're up to the challenge? Prove it! This game will push you to the limit.			"

												This is one of those games I wish I could give a neutral rating to but since I can't, I'm giving it a thumbs down. This game has great ratings, so you can read many other reviews on why PC is a good game. It does many things right - a neat branching scenario structure, solid foundation and some good voice overs to introduce the scenarios. For me, thats not enough and thus I'm going to explain why I don't think it's good enough to get a thumbs up.Simply put, PC is a remake of the old Panzer General games. And after playing this for 20 hours and playing those, I still think they're better games for one main reason: the Panzer Corps scenarios are usually very flawed.  Panzer Corps makes the mistake of having too many units on too small of a map. There is little to no room for manuever. Thus the game is more puzzle-based than it is tactical. It's just a matter of figuring out that at ""x"" chokepoint I need 3 infantry, 1 arty and a tank to bust through. Once I know that, it's a matter of going to the next chokepoint. The time frames are always very tight, which rewards perfect unit usage and not necessarily good tactics. Seriously, whether you win or lose in any given map is often decided by your first half dozen combat results - if they're very favorable you're golden. If not, you're probably totally screwed.There are two types of battles - you're on the offense and you're on the defense. If you're on the offense, the AI is going to just sit back and let you come to them. There's no ebb and flow here - it's all a matter of finding the ""right"" way to knock down yet another brick wall. After playing a number of these scenarios, I felt like the Allies trying to fight through the German hedgerows - frustratingly slow, brute-force combat tactics because you can't manuever. It gets old, fast. If you're on defense, you can expect overwhelming odds since the AI isn't as effective as a human. So those scenarios are gamed up to present a challenge in numbers since the AI can't do it otherwise. They were, in a nutshell, disappointing. There are other issues as well. I find the map to be muddled and not attractive. It's a wargame, I know, and it doesn't need to be beautiful. But I'd personally rather have counters than the muddled color scheme presented here. The branching campaign is pretty neat but has some real issues - for instance, if do well enough as Germany and you're going to presented with an almost unwinable scenario in the USA. Do slightly worse and delay the US invasion by two years and you'll have a far more winnable scenario. That's just bad design. Sea power has almost no part in the game as well, so it's all ground and air combat. Combined arms need not apply in most scenarios. But it all goes back to scenario design - too many units, too small maps, no manuever and thus no imagination. I found them constricting. So why would I advocate paying for Panzer Corps (and don't get me started on the absurd DLC prices) when the old Panzer General II does it better? I can't. I'd rather play PG than PC and therefore PC gets the thumbs down. For those who are interested in the genre, I recommend Order of Battle: Pacific. It's a very similar game with larger maps, more fluid combat, combined arms and the maps aren't as muddled. To me it's a far superior game and easily worth the price difference.			"

												Overall: 9/10Some 700 (seven hundred, holy.....!) hours later, and after over 220 scenarios I believe I am entitled to write a review of Panzer Corps, Panzer General's successor.When I played the original Panzer General, back in '94, I remember the ashtrays quickly filling up as I kept on playing with a friend (swapping chairs when it was the other's turn). It was the first time I enjoyed a wargame on a computer, while my first grognard experience happened some ten years before when I was ""inducted"" through Avalon Hill's Third Reich boardgame. So, yes, I like my wargames.Since this is a videoGAME review, I will try and wear the gamer's hat, rather than the hardcore grognard's helmet.This review is based on a playthrough of the Grand Campaign, Afrika Corps and Allied Corps, so all the ""DLCs"", the full enchilada.Pros:- While the replayability is quite low, if it takes 650 hours to play through: even at full price, the cost opportunity is pretty good like 10 cents an hour.- Each scenario is different and there's never a dull moment.- The game is easy to learn and quite hard to master.- The number of units (and the very different way to employ each and every one of them) as well as the historical research to build the scenarios is quite impressive.- The game is virtually bug free. This should be a given, but it's worth mentioning considering the amount of junk that is unleashed on customers these days (Football Manager 2014, Rome Total War 2, and so forth).- It runs smoothly on pretty much every rig / OS / graphic card.- Far from being flashy, the graphics do their job.- The addition of heros makes the experience more personal.- The heavily scripted AI does its job at keeping you challenged.Cons:- Increasing difficulty beyond General level, rather than giving you more challenges, just increases the number of enemies  / or their equipment quality (to very ahistorical levels).- The basic game feels like a demo compared to the Grand Campaign. definitely get all the DLCs.- The hero traits are too random (ok, this is the grognard talking, but, seriously, Artillery units with ""spotting"" traits and Air units with ""movement"" benefits are really useless / non-sensical).So, whether you are a gamer with a casual interest in World War 2 tactics or a tough wargamer who looks for something more relaxing, this game is damn near perfect.

A Panzer Corps ReviewAs a wargamer and a WW2 enthusiast I might not be that objective when I'm saying that this game's pretty damn good! At the same time however, the hours spent (not only on this but other wargames as well) trying to beat the campaign on Field Marshal, testing my skills with people on multiplayer, exploring the game on many levels, do grant me a well thought out opinion of this game, I hope :POn with a brief presentation of the game!Panzer Corps Wehrmacht (PC) is a light, turn based (Igo-Ugo) strategy game and a reimplementation of the old school Panzer General (PG). If you liked PG you'll almost definitely enjoy PC and the opposite of course. The idea is simple. You start the second world war commanding part of the German army, starting from the invasion of Poland and decide its fate with possibilities ranging, depending on your performance, from its historical demise to a *minor spoiler* glorious blitzkrieg through the entire US.The fun of the game derives through its tactical simplicity though it leaves a lot of room for depth—for those willing to look for it.All you have to do is move and fire your units in any order you desire. Simple enough, huh?Sure, but in order to master the game, you have to grasp many subtle mechanisms. Panzer Corps features: a variety of terrain with unique characteristics, unit suppression, an interesting initiative system, unit retreat/surrender, a weather system, supply (albeit in an unrealistic form due to the lack of supply lines), entrenchment, zone of control, strategic redeployment and many more interesting elements.Furthermore the game comes with many units that, besides chrome, offer many tactical opportunities. Will you plow the battlefield with slow moving King Tigers or blitz with Panther tanks? Will you dominate the skies with a combined fighters/dive bombers force or follow a fighter-bomber doctrine? Due to the many different unit types offered, the efficiency of combined arms really shines.Another aspect of Panzer Corps is its subtle yet engaging strategic element.You are given command of a core force that you control through the entire game, in contrast to a couple of secondary/temporary units that are provided for a single scenario. This core force can be expanded by buying/upgrading units between or during the scenarios but, friendly note, don't try to figure the scale; units may represent divisions, corps, or even armies, depending on the scope of the scenario. In addition, every unit gains experience through combat and the dilemma of how to replace loses, through regular (inexperienced and cheap) or elite (battle-hardened and expensive) replacements, arises. This of course means I have to explain prestige as well...Prestige (the game currency) depends on your performance on the scenario. That is the capture of objectives (primary/secondary) and the battle outcome (normal/decisive victory or defeat). A decisive victory may have to come many times through attrition which may cost in the long-run. Even more choices!However not everything's great...To begin with, the A.I. is relatively uninspired. It doesn't act terribly ahistorically or plain silly (besides two rare situations) but the difficulty of most scenarios comes through the numerical advantage of the enemy. Then we have the repetitive objectives, at least in Wehrmacht, ""Capture all cities in X turns"". A few people nag about the lack of replay value as well but I beg to differ. Besides the branching campaign and the multiplayer scenarios (can be played both online and hotseat) there are a lot mods at your disposal for free!Another thing that bugged me is the fact that, although there is an option of a detailed battle sheet both before and after each combat, the game lacks detail both in the tutorial and the manual. This leaves those eager to dig deeper no option other than to go through many forum posts. For example artillery has a rate of fire stat that isn't mentioned anywhere in the game! Every basic piece of information is covered however and the interface, in most cases, is intuitive and elegant.Finally, the realism issue arises. Due to its abstract nature this game is far from a simulation at a strategic level. The lack of many important details make it unrealistic at a tactical level as well. At its heart however every decision the player makes is realistic, in a sense that the same dilemmas arose to WW2 generals as well. Somehow, through the careful deduction from realism, this game manages to remain true, as much as a light wargame can, to the nature of the war.All in all, Panzer Corps is a strategy game I would recommend to everyone; both the uninitiated who wants to discover the joys of wargaming and the grognard who wishes for a less complex game.Rating: 9/10 "

												Panzer Corps is a modern version of Panzer General, and I have to say that it's been improved in every way. Although it's new to Steam it was originally released back in 2011 and I've been playing it for over two years, so don't let my Steam game time fool you.GAME MECHANICSOne of the best things about this game is that it uses what I think of as ""chess-like"" or ""rock/paper/stone"" mechanics. While there are many hundreds of different units in the game, they're all grouped into specific types (infantry/tank/recon etc.). There are 9 different types of land and air units, each of which has distinct characteristics (just as different chess pieces move differently). Using those characteristics to their best advantage is key to success in the game, especially in combination with other units.For example, infantry are best for attacking a city, but the city may be defended by an artillery unit behind it which gets a free attack against the infantry. So you could send a tank around the city to take out the artillery, but it's protected by an anti-tank gun. So then you send a tactical bomber in to bomb the artillery, but guess what, it's protected by an anti-aircraft gun! A successful assault against a city therefore, can often be a ""chess-like"" puzzle to solve. It's not just the strength of the units that counts, but the type of unit. Combined arms warfare is a must.GRAPHICSAlthough it still uses the classic 2D interface, the unit models are now displayed with a semi-3D look rather than side-on as in the original. They're higher res and detailed enough to make the many different unit types easily recognisable. The map graphics are still pretty basic compared to modern games but are a lot more detailed and pleasing to the eye than the very plain original. There are now two levels of zoom as well as the strategic map.SCALEThe game is operational in scale, rather than tactical (individual battles) or strategic (whole war), and the actual scale is variable depending on what's being represented. So a scenario may cover the invasion of the whole of Norway, or just the island of Malta. In spite of the big difference, it works well. Tanks and infantry have to be adjacent to attack, while artillery can typically fire 2 to 3 hexes. Planes have a large movement area and need to be refuelled so can't stay in the air indefinitely.SCENARIOSThe 26 scenarios cover the main battles throughout the course of World War Two in Europe. They can be played standalone as either side or as a complete campaign from the German perspective, allowing your core force to gain experience and upgrade throughout the war.The scenarios themselves cover mostly the same battles as in the original Panzer General but they've been redesigned, often at a different scale, so the maps are not identical.UNITSThere are many more unit types available in this version, including some very rare units not often seen in WWII games, giving considerably more tactical diversity. The AI has also been improved. New terrain types have been added, for example railways, which allow quick transportation between cities once you control them, which adds an interesting extra dimension to the transportation possibilities.COMBAT CHANGESThe combat mechanics are basically the same as the original, but have been tweaked to be more user-friendly. For example, whereas a unit had to both move and fire before selecting another unit, now movement and firing can be done at different times during the turn. For example, previously if you moved a unit then selected another unit before firing the first one, it would lose the ability to fire. Now it doesn't, so you can move unit 1, then move unit 2, then attack with unit 1. This gives you a lot more flexibility in how you organise your combined attacks.Also, artillery can now be fired after moving. Perhaps not so realistic, but a lot easier to manage. Previously, when advancing, the artillery was always playing catch-up and often took a long time to get into position before you could actually use it. Now, you can move a melee unit forward, advance an artillery unit into the hex it just vacated, fire with the artillery, then attack with the melee unit once the defenders have been suppressed. Much more convenient! Additionally, many artillery units now have a longer range, 3 hexes instead of 2, making it even more useful.CONCLUSIONSAs a long time wargamer (starting with Panzer Blitz in 1979), I'd have to say that this is possibly the best ALL-ROUND wargame I've ever played. It's a lot more polished and bug free than most other turn based wargames, it has enough depth and strategy to satisfy experienced wargamers, yet it's still accessible enough for newbies to the genre to enjoy, which is quite a brilliant balancing act.It's definitely not a grognard's game, it doesn't contain complex spreadsheets and have hundreds of units to move every turn, but that's a good thing IMO. I've played overly complex strategy games in the past and quite frankly, the depth of detail can become tedious and take much of the fun out of the game. This game has relatively small numbers of units in each scenario and is quick to play. It has a very high fun factor that more serious games lack, whilst still containing plenty of strategic depth and a lot of detail and accuracy for the history buffs.CIV V SIMILARITYIt's been admitted by Firaxis that the new combat system in Civilization V was partly based on Panzer General. Therefore all those Civ 5 fans who enjoy the new 1 unit per hex combat system would probably find this game very appealing, since there are a lot of similarities there. The big difference is that Firaxis over-simplified the combat system, whereas in Panzer Corps it's more detailed and realistic (and thus more enjoyable if you're purely in the mood for combat rather than developing an entire civilisation).VERDICTI highly recommended this game for all turn based strategy fans, especially those interested in historical recreations of actual battles in World War II.

Modern-day overhaul and expansion of a classic wargameThis review is of the base game only, without any of the dlc/expansion packsI still remember as if it were yesterday the feeling of excitement when first playing the classic wargame Panzer General over 20 years ago on my first ever Windows desktop. The idea of a war game on a pc was quite new back then – previously, war games were played at a table, on a cardboard map, using countless units (or counters) to be placed and moved over the map's hexagons according to a set of rules which was often so complex that one needed a couple of days to read, study and memorize them before you could actually start playing.Panzer General, released in 1994 by Strategic Simulations, changed all that for me, and for several years the turn-based wargame became my favorite genre on the pc: the games didn't need the graphical horse power of the earliest 3D-games and their expensive dedicated cards, since the focus rested almost exclusively on the strategic, operational or tactical gameplay. While the genre stayed quite popular (although in its own niche) throughout the 90's, I lost interest after a couple of years, with so many graphically more pleasant titles grabbing my attention. And truth to be told: the iconic Panzer General series didn't seem to have got a proper continuation after 2000, so I let it go.That is untill I stumbled upon a copy of this game in a sale, only a month or so ago. Panzer Corps: Wehrmacht was first released in 2011 by Slitherine (who do a mighty good job to keep the turn-based wargame alive and kicking), having been developed by The Lordz Games Studio. I didn't expect that this kind of game, essentially representing an historical armed conflict in a highly abstract way, would still be able to grab my attention as thoroughly and as intensely as it did. Don't make any mistake: Panzer Corps is a classical turn-based wargame in every possible sense. It doesn't try to be up-to-date by having fancy graphics, nor does it intend to appeal to the masses by making the genre less intricate (some would call it difficult to grasp). On the contrary: this game takes the original Panzer General as its starting point and pays openly hommage to it by using identical game mechanics and even progression as the main campaign unfolds.And it is exactly in that progression where one of these games main strengths lies. Panzer Corps: Wehrmacht, in its base form as released in 2011, contains 26 scenario's or combat maps, most of them (but not all!) based upon an historical campaign during the Second World War. Most of these are well-known, such as the German invasions of Poland, the Low Countries & France or the Soviet-Union or the desperate efforts by the German Wehrmacht to withstand the tide of ever growing enemy operations towards the Reich. These scenario's can be played on their own (either as the Germans or from an allied perspective), but in truth the game begs to be played in the campaign-mode, where every single scenario leads to a next one in a quite widely branching campaign. This campaign has always to be played from a German perspective, and the progress you make though the campaign (which route you can take), depends on your results in any given scenario. Do particularily well in the Low Countries and France, and you might even get an early opportunity to invade England – yes, there are several ""what if"" scenario's as well!But the fun goes much further – and deeper – than that. You start the first scenario with a rather small group of ""core units"": several basic infantry & artillery units, some poorly equipped early Panzers and a couple of Messerschmitt fighter-squadrons. As you take enemy victory points and win scenario's as convincingly as possible, you earn ""prestige"" – the in-game currency – which you can use to either call for reinforcements during a scenario (which come pretty expensive), for upgrading existing units with better equipment in-between scenario's, or to order new units for your core force. This game-embracing mechanic adds a very rewarding strategic element to the game: how do you build, maintain and upgrade your core force? Do you pour lots of prestige points into an air force, hoping that one day you'll have to batte it out against the Royal Air Force, or do you play it more safely and postpone investments until better tanks become available for those Panzer divisions? But even then, some sort of air defence is badly needed, so why not ordering a couple of 88-mm AA guns which can double as very powerful aint-tank guns as well?And there's even more: as units fight, deal and take damage, they are rewarded with combat experience – a unit can gain up to five stars, and in doing so becomes ever more powerful. It can even be made ""overstrength"" for each star of experience it has in-between scenario's, making it very useful as the spearhead in an armored attack, for example. As units fight and stay in play through the campaign, they also get ""leaders"", who offer an ever greater bonus to the unit they command. An elite, 5-star unit with a couple of leaders attached to it, becomes something to cherish – which makes one hesitate: should I use it in the first line of attack/defense, and risk losing it? It is choices like this which make the campaign so extremely addicting: I have replayed it over and over again, trying to get as powerful and well-balanced an army as possible, ready for the ultimate (and hard to reach!!) series of scenario's which put the German Wehrmacht before the almost impossible task to invade and effectively conquer the U.S.Sadly, all of these wonderful ideas would immediately become irrelevant if the actual combat mechanics were badly executed. After all, this is an hexagonal wargame, where one has to position and move dozens of units on a map. Panzer Corps happily delivers in this department as well: the combat mechanics are very easy to grasp, more dificult to master (but there are a ton of difficulty options, so everyone can tailor the game to suit his or her needs) and quite complex underneath (as they should be, since all sort of parameters including weather and terrain are included into the mix). There are some points of criticism here: some maps are a tad too small for the forces being deployed, which makes large-scale operational decisions almost irrelevant as the outcome will be determined mostly by the correct (and rather traditional) use of infantry, artillery, armored units and airforce. Truly daring and original tactis are not always feasible – but then, neither were they during the war itself, so, what's the complaining all about?I want to state very clearly that I only played the base game for this review, and none of the huge amount of extra content which was released since. This additional content multiplies the amount of available scenario's by more than ten, adds a gigantic Grand Campaign as well as campaigns for the Afrika Korps, the U.S and Soviet armies. I will certainly try them out in the future, but they are not necessary to enjoy the base game, which is perfectly complete by itself. Three of the ""dlc's"" sold on Steam are actually stand-alone expansion packs (or rather new games using the same engine), so if you'd come upon a good sale for the entire package you'd be certain to make a great bargain.Very highly recommended, but you need at least minimal interest in turn-based wargames and/or in the Second World War.

												Don't let Steam fool you, it may say I only have a few dozen hours played, but this game has given me hundreds if not thousands of hours of entertainment.  I was a huge fan of the old Panzer General that I would play on my PlayStation 1, and this game is everything that game was, but updated and massively improved in so many ways.  The content is better, there is much more of it, and there is even multiplayer and modded content that can further extend replayability.If you are a fan of turn based strategy and light wargaming, this game and the Grand Campaign DLC of Panzer Corps is something YOU NEED TO BUY!  I LUV THIS GAME!			"

												Jawoll, Generalfeldmarschall!Accessibility: 9/10Replayability: 8/10Graphics: 6/10Sound: 8/10Panzer Corps is an accessible wargamer in the tradition of Panzer General. As the name suggests, it is a Korps-level wargamer that focus on maneuver and combined arms tactics. It eschews complex supply lines and routes in favor of easy to understand icons and actions. Playing a grand campaign from the cobbled stones of Poland in 1939 to the plains of Ukraine in 1943 and back to ruined Berlin in 1945 is gratifying in the sense that you get a sense of ownership in the accomplishment of your units. They will earn their Ritterkreuz, and so will you too if you last that long. Multiplayer is good, not exceptional. Be prepared for a long evening if you so chose to play.A serious quibble in this otherwise impeccable game is the DLC's which seem to pester and tease gamers with content. The DLC's are quite enjoyable in its own right but not worth the asking price. Get the core game, it is worth it. Get the DLC's when they are on sale.			"

												Easily one of the best games I've ever played.  Endless replayability, a massive amount of content.  A classic game that's easy to learn, hard to master.  Complaints?  Two big ones:  the price and a lack of polish.  The price speaks for itself.  As far as the lack of polish goes, there's an unforgiveable absence of multiplayer features.  No leaderboard, not even a way to track your win/loss ratio.  The menus are cluttered, unorganized and rather ugly.  No Steam workshop support.  The game is practically screaming for these features but it seems that the developers have turned a def ear.  Perhaps they feel the game has enough content, and maybe they're right, but for the price they're asking, one would expect a more complete experience.A game anyone would certainly enjoy, but in it's current state, I can only recommend it when it's on sale...9/10			"

												Whoever liked Panzer General will love this on. Who don't like Panzergeneral should stay away.Panzer Corps is nearly identical to Panzer General only with a sort of a modern flair... I mean technically.As native German speaking person I find the speeches a bid odd. If you're not a native speaker I think they will be great.I'm a bit uncertain abouut the concept of buying armies separately. On one hand why pay for an army you don''t want to play. On the other hand if you like to play all armies, say like in Panzer General, the game is rather expensive.Personally I love the genre as such and I'm looking very forward for the upcoming adaption of the 40K Universe. I hope it will be better than the old ""Rites of War"" . But anyways I allmost certainly will buy it.Greetings from Berlin, GermanyRobert			"

												Great WW2 game - simple yet challenging - even better in multiplayer.  Very good graphics and simple input makes a user friendly game which anyone can master in no time - a real jump right into game.  This allows for you to fight a scenario or campaign and learn the little things which make it a great game as you learn the system.  The use of core and non-core units with experience gained for combat makes a player utilize his forces differently - thus modifing scenario play once again increasing replayability. I have the most time ever invested in this game 3000hrs of Steam time and at least another 2000hrs before Steam added the game and time became tracked!  I have left the game alone for a month or two then keep coming back - once again because no other WW2 game offers so much satisfaction, simplicity, and great multiplayer.  Plus - for the price no better value!!  The developers did not stop with the game but supported it with DLC's and several other versions - Allied & Africa Corp adding even more challenges!!I am disappointed in one thing - muliplayer does not give the option of tracking wins and loses.  I don't want it to do so automatically, however I do want the option available.			"

Note:For full disclosure, I have never played any of the Panzer General titles (which seems to be the point of comparison for most players). Instead I will review this game based on its own merits.The key was provided for review purposesTL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Panzer Corps is a 2011 turn-based strategy game (TBS) developed by Flashback Games and The Lordz Games Studio with Slitherine Ltd. as the publisher. It features a hex-based gameplay mechanic, dynamic and branching single player campaign with a very unique unit veterancy system.PLOT (No Spoilers):Take command of the Wehrmacht and lead the fatherland to ultimate victory. You may also play as the Allied (DLC) powers in their defense of the free world, or may be play as the Soviet Union (DLC) and fight for the glorious motherland. If you’re like me however, play as the world-renowned Afrika Korps (DLC) and kick the Allies out of Africa.  PROS:+ Quick and easy to learn game mechanics;+ Graphics and art style is well suited for the game style (I personally would have liked an option to use unit counters rather than the static sprites);+ Custom difficulty options (make it as easy or difficult as you want);+ Land, air and sea combat with combined arms elements;+ Extensive unit variety, with the ability to either upgrade or downgrade the unit to a different unit type to suit your needs. (can only be done during the deployment stage or if the unit is in a city);+ Unique unit veterancy system which includes heroes, medals and battle history (I like this feature because it adds to my immersive experience with the game);+ Unit Library (similar to Shogun 2 Total War’s Encyclopedia where you can learn more about your favorite unit’s real world history.);+ Simple but easy to understand user interface with the appropriate tool tips to show what the button does;+ Good background music;+ Branching campaign (the outcome of your battles will have an impact on the overall story);+ Good replay value because of the branching campaign feature.CONS:- The overall map feels small (or may be the hexes are just too big) which leads to relatively quick scenarios;- AI’s decision making skills are questionable;- Limited scenario options if you only buy the base game…(see next CON);- Because most of the other scenarios are sold as DLC;- No unit supply chains (meaning you can fully reinforce or resupply them directly in front of enemy units. It would have been better if they implemented a mechanic where reinforcing or resupplying near an enemy unit is not as effective as reinforcing them away from the front lines.)- No option to use unit counters instead of static sprites.NEUTRAL:+/- Voice acting (specially for the Wehrmacht narrator) could be better;+/- So-so sound design.CONCLUSION:Panzer Corps is a GREAT GAME and I highly RECOMMEND this for World War II turn-base strategy fans. It is a very good hex-based strategy game that has strategic and tactical depth with enough complexity to have you wanting more (unfortunately, sold as DLC).WORTH IT?The base game is $19.99 (or your regional equivalent) while the bundle with all the DLCs is $79.62. Though I do like the game and recommend it, if you’re on a budget, it may be worthwhile to wait for a Steam sale and get the entire package rather than purchasing the content piecemeal.FINAL NOTES:Like I said, I have never played any of the Panzer General titles so I can’t make a valid comparison. If you have played Order of Battle: Pacific / World War II and liked it however, then I’m pretty confident in saying that you’ll like Panzer Corps too.--------------------------------------------------------- Like our Reviews?

About the game:First off, it's a hex grid, turn based strategy game. You know, one of those old strategy games from the 90's! It's actually an attempt to recreate Panzer General, which is a strategy game loved by many. By ME, anyway! If you don't know what Panzer General is, it's a virtual board game with hidden dice rolls, pretty basic audio and very minimal animation. Some of you might be turned off by the sound of that, but I think that this game incredibly immersive. I get frustrated when my enemy scores a rugged defense that thwarts my planned attack! I am fillled with joy when one of my units decimates the enemy and a hero emerges. I'm quite confident in saying that when you lose one of your units either due to a bad roll or just poor judgement, you will consider loading an older save to try and keep them alive.Some mechanics of the game:Each mission begins with specific set of auxilliary units. Auxiliary units are specifically set for only that mission so you won't have control of after them after the mission is finished. You could use them for dangerous situations because there's no real consequence for losing them. I wouldn't suggest just throwing them away, but sometimes that's what they are there for. Auxiliary units are represented by a grey color around the strength box. You are given ""Prestige"" at the start of each mission which is the currency of the game, used to buy your core units and reinforcing units (you also gain prestige by defeating enemies and capturing strategic points). Core units are what you will have throughout the campaign so take good care of them! They have a golden ring around the strength box. Core units will perform better than auxiliary units in almost all occasions due to having higher experience which gives your units bonuses. Throughout the campaign new units will be unlocked and it's a good idea to upgrade your units. Upgrading your old Panzer II's up to Panzer III's for example. Your units gain experience through combat, medals through participation or deeds, and like I mentioned before, heroes through excellence. When you reinforce a damaged unit you can either use fresh recruits which are cheap but it reduces the experience of the unit as a whole, or veteran replacements which cost significantly more, but alow you to keep your current experience value.Your units are represented by an icon and a strength number. The strength number represents the number of men available in the unit who can fight (it isn't literally 10 men or tanks, it's just a representation on a scale of 1 to 10+). Over time, through combat, your units can gain experience and levels. When they gain a level they can be reinforced to be an 'over strength' value. Over strength meaning that they can be brought up to 11, 12 or even 13 strength value. They will perform better of course, but the trade off is that it costs substantially more to reinforce the unit above 10.Your units have more detailed statistics which range from: Attack values against soft (infantry, some artillery, trucks, etc), hard targets (tanks, half-tracks, bunkers, etc), air targets (.. planes, planes, etc) and naval attack (against ships der) Defense values for ground or air attacks and also what type of defense your unit uses (soft, hard, air or naval).View range (how many hexes they can reveal)Movement distance and what type of movement they use. Certain movement types travel over certain terrain types more easily than others. There is tracked, wheeled and good ol' fashion 'Leg'!.Close Defense is how well the unit defends itself in urban or forest areas or when they are ambushed. Finally, 'Range' is how far the unit can attack from. Your standard infantry or tank unit can only attack enemies next to them. Artillery on the other hand can attack from a distance usually 2 to 3 hexes away.Units also have an ammo count and if applicable a fuel count which both need to be resupplied after a while. Ammo is  how many attacks or defensive shots you can make before needing to use a turn to be resupplied (a unit without ammo cannot return fire which is something you can exploit!). Fuel is fairly self explaining, a unit uses 1 fuel for every hex it travels. Resupplying restores both ammo and fuel, so it's got that going for it..TLDR; The game, while it may look fairly simple by it's screenshots or videos, has a lot of complexity to it for you to use to your advantage and I find it highly rewarding.Something about the campaigns:You start out with having tutorials teaching you the basics (you'll have to come up with your own strategies and tactics to get decisive victories!). Then you move into the campaigns. You can choose from 4 with the base game which determine the time you want to start the war at and the battles you'll take part in. Some of the missions overlap in the campaigns but it depends on your choices and victories / losses. Someone made a neat chart that tells you which missions are in each campaign: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/3318332566192367118/183E683584A5430315E3D95789E1D0CE1F7DE724/As you can see on that chart, the base game has in total 40 different missions. Add to that that you can change your core army around which can make the same mission play very differently and you have yourself a lot of replayability! Want an army heavy with panzers and mechanized infantry to flank and destroy enemies from behind? Or how about one focusing on a large number of pioneers and artillery to break through ANY defense? The choice is yours and there are a lot of choices.The game follows history to a certain degree, like when the war began and certain historical battle dates, but you can drastically alter history. For example: you can go as far as conquering the United States after conquering Russia.I'd say that the 'Grand Campaign' DLC's are the way to play this. The base game is great, but it's sort of a 'lite' version. The GC goes into further detail with the stages of the war. Instead of 4 missions conquering Poland it's 10 or so (14 all together but there are branching choices and situations) but this is straying into a review for the DLC now.[h1TLDR again?;[/h1] This game can be simple yet complex. Bland yet immersive. Yet, yet yet! Honestly, I think it's worth well over $20. It goes on sale once in a while so if you're on the fence just wait for one of those. This is definitely a game no strategy fan should miss.I apologize for this poorly structured novela of a review. This is my first real 'review'  and any feedback or discussion is greatly appreciated. Want me to never write again? I'll see what I can do! Thanks for checking it out!			"

												A grand tactical, turned-based war game with roots in hex based board games from the good old days.  The very simple mechanics provide a very tactical feel--the type of unit and the order in which they move and shoot is a core concept:  the game rewards good combined arms tactics (as does real life)--that keeps the game moving without being bogged down in tactical details (other titles provide that fix).  You also get a strategy game since you must decide on what battles to fight, and based on prestige gained in your battles, what equipment to buy or upgrade or overstrength, where to deploy to start and then plan a course of action.  This provides a role playing aspect as you must decide on how to build your core and then grow your units in experience by earning awards via combat efficiency and potentially gaining a hero that then provides additional tactical benefits to the unit.  It has another what if aspect when building the core:  do I go armor heavy and win with tanks or dominate with air power disregarding that artillery is the king of battle or use recon or airborne or engineers or other options to explore or replay trying a completely different mix (seapower is used but not as part of your core with the capital ships all historically named--that is awesome).  You can be rewarded with some Special Experience units that add to you core and provide extra assets that come in very handy when used properly.The scale of the maps and the number of units always gives you room to manuever (some reviews disagree):  it is another key concept.  The base game requires you to move out and take your objectives (some have said that is a detractor--but good tactics can overcome this issue and you may need every turn to get that decisive victory).  The DLCs allow some flexibility by providing an adjustment to ease the hurried feeling.  The situations in the scenarios (maps) are always interesting and contain solid historical and actual geographic elements plus at times actual units or leaders for the particular battle.  The DLC's add some very challenging tactical twists using very innovative objectives.  The DLC's also provide some surprises both as tactical problems or a very special reinforcement to your core (some very powerful units with perhaps a potential flaw) and some rewards for good battlefield management via captured equipment (a very nice touch).It is just fun and addicting: you ALWAYS want to play just one more turn and that will get you in serious trouble with the significant other!  I played Panzer General (and some other titles in the 5 Star series) and this game has taken the original concept far beyond that great start.  The DLCs push the limits even more.  Bravo Zulu Matrix and Slitherine!			"

												This is like the talented son of Panzer General II! If you're looking for graphics and flashy animations, look elsewhere. This is old school ""Just one more turn as the hours go by quickly"" gameplay. It's pretty basic, but quite strategic. Move all your units during your turn, then the computer does the same. The great thing about this game is that you can customize your army as you see fit. If you like a massive airforce with a few tanks to use blitzkrieg tactics...do it! Do you like to use artillery to soften up city defenses before sending in the troops...it's there. some strategies work better than others, but no matter how you play it....IT'S FUN....and so addictive.  Change history...invade England...invade the USA...if you're good enough. Spending your prestige points after battles is like opening presents at Christmas. Pay no attention to my hours on this game...I purchased it a long time ago from the original producers and have over 1500 hours logged in. Purchased every expansion and to this day I still play it weekly...my most played game ever.  One of the things I really like is that periodically a unit will get a bonus modifier applied to it as a reward (+3 Attack, +1 defense, +1 spotting, etc.) These modifiers actually make the unit noticeably better so it truly feels like a reward. As units gain experience in scenarios, you can also overpower them making stronger as the war progresses and when new technology arrives you can even upgrade them! I personally like the campaign modes and I like to try and rewrite history. Difficulty is adjustable as well as prestige points which allows you to upgrade and purchase new units. You can set it to be hard as hell or make it so easy that you just annihilate the enemy. Love the navy units as well! If you ever played Panzer General II and liked it, you'll feel right at home here. Lots of fun!!			"

												An extraordinary game by Slitherine. For those of you that adore Panzer General this game is for you, below I showcase the new update which adds ""Operation Sealion"" to the game. Yes, this is Agrippa from the Slitherine Stream Team :D.  An instant 10/10 and arguably the finest WW2 turn based game on the market. If you want content, this game is chock full of it, and the developers are always adding something new. Whether Axis or Allies, it is up to YOU to change the outcome of WW2.

												I was a big fan of the original Panzer General in the 90's.  Panzer Corps is a nice clone, but there are several drawbacks from the original.  Graphics wise there have been SOME improvements but some nice features of the original PG were left out.  Such as cut video scenes from WW2 and also during gameplay there are no battle boxes in the corners of your screen showing your troops fighting.  Minor details that might not be important to some but I think add a lot to the experience.  The objectives in Panzer Corps also are really difficult to acheive if you play with the fog of war on and anything above easy difficulty, which is really unfortunate.  In the original PG you had enough moves to achieve your objectives and have a decent shot of getting major/decisive victories, but not so in Panzer Corps.  I'm not sure what the developers were thinking as most maps you have between 10 and 13 moves to capture all objectives (for decisive victory) which on most maps is impossible.  Lastly, as a lot of reviewers have noted the game has only a fraction of the scenarios the original PG had, so you have to buy all the stupid DLC's to get the full package, which is a TOTAL ripoff.  My advice is to try and find a copy of the original PG for free and play that.  However you might like Panzer Corps for brief nostalgia.			"

												Well what can I say, Panzer Corps is a remake of Panzer General by SSI. Tried and tested formula that works, great game lots of fun works well. The new publisher's have added a couple of new things but have not buggered it at all. I like all new additions most of which come from the PG2 modders :) But hey what the hell they have bought back to life a game I love.The Only thing is the price if you can pick it up on sale well its a good buy. I really think the DLC/Addons are way over priced.			"

												I had a hard time liking it at first. It was very difficult to understand coming straight from Unity of Command (which is also a great game) and was unprepared for what lay before me. After a while of learning little tricks and taking time to understand the pros and cons of the units I began to play more. I am playing the grand campaign of the base game now. I am at Operation Sea Lion 40' after demolishing Poland, Belgium, and France in decisive victories. Its a great game for many other reasons. One being that it has the minor countries in it as well as the large ones. Romania, Bulgaria, Canada, Hungary, Belgium, and others. The only one it doesnt have is Finland but in the Soviet Corps that is coming out soon I saw it in there. I love this game so much now. I cant wait to play even more when I get the many expansions for the game.pros:- Large variety of units and countries-You can limit/turn off RNG rolls (I turn RNG off so that what it says might happen will happen)-Many other stuffcons:-Bit of a learning curve-Nothing else reallySo if you feel like it go out there and buy the game. It's Awesome!!!!			"

												Number of hours played by reviewers is a good way to decide if a game is worth it.  All too often Im reading reviews on games where people haven't even invested 4 hrs.   As I browse reviews on this game I realize 200 hours is nothing in play time.  I've never seen a game that a mass of people have spent more hours on.  After 100 hours I've played the actual game twice and now am getting ready to start the DLC's .  So far it's been a blast and a challenge.  I'm retired and find this to be very good cheap entertainment.  Late October and I think the DLC's are gonna take me thru the winter.  Let it snow Let it snow just dont let my electricity go out.

												First of all, it's not a bad game per se but it's simply not worth its price. You can get more for your money on steam. Save your money and buy CIV5, Unity of Command or TW instead if you are into turn-based strategy games.As a fan of the classic Panzer General, I bought this game three years ago. It comes with just 26 scenarios, some of which are nearly identical. If you play a campaign, you won't come across all of them. I finished the campaign in less than 10 hours and I'm sure there are players who play faster than I. It's clear that Matrix wants you to buy its overpriced dlcs. In the end, you would end up spending 80 bucks on a game which is nothing more than a blatant clone of the classic Panzer General. It appears that because the original PG creator company SSI does not exist anymore they can do it without facing copyright infringement claims. If you are not used to the old Panzer General this game might be boring and dull to you. The graphics cannot compete with newer titles, the gameplay does not offer a lot of depth. All you have to do is drag your units from A to B. Even if you're fan of the original hit Panzer General, you should not touch it. There are several free ports and countless campaigns available for free.			"

												After looking for a good TBS game in the WW2 genre and being overwhelmed by the choices available, I chose to stick to something tried and true. I played PG 3d and 'Scorched earth' years ago and wanted something not too simplistic but not requiring a college text to learn. I found the perfect balance in Panzer Corps, a game I have been unashamedly addicted to since the beginning of the year. For older gamers like myself that prefer turn-based games that have strategic/tactical depth and an immersive experience, PC is a near-perfect fit. I've slogged my way through the stock campaign as well as 90% of the DLC available. I've spent almost 1k hours loving this game and I haven't even touched the modding community's offerings yet! For people with an above average understanding of WW2 history, armies, equipment, and tactics this game is a pleasant dream come true. However, some of my complaints are the lack of simple features: a- Animations could be improved to show tank treads moving, truck wheels turning, soldiers marching, etc. 2D terrain appears dated, could use simple enhancements like trees swaying in the wind, water moving, waves on beaches splashing. b- There could be more differentiation between tactical styles for different armies (I've found that using the same style of play works the same for Germans, Soviets, or Americans), c- Units on high ground (hills, mountains, forts) should have stronger attack/defense benefits, d- Comprehensive GC includes many what-if scenarios....but WHY isn't the Pacific war ever included in the official DLC?? I mean c'mon, its not that hard to model the USMC/USN taking on the Japanese across islands, the Phillipines, Okinawa, and a what-if invasion of mainland Japan. The UK's defense of Burma and India, China, etc...all ignored!!!e- modding could be a little more easier / user-friendlyOverall, and excellent addiction that fans of WW2 TBS will enjoy;  just be sure to have lots of time available!

												1. Easy to play mechanics.2. Consistent themes through each DLC.3. The replay value is incredible, multiple scenarios and paths to victory.4. Multiplayer.5. You can adjust the difficulty numerous ways, even unlock secret levels, or custom settings. Set it to easy and win every time!6. Invade America with Axis Super Weapons.7. Invade Germany with just Sherman Tanks (Thanks US Corps, can you make it any harder, Just sayin')8. Serve with Rommel In Afrika (3 Tours)At the time of this review my Panzer Corps showed 451 hours log into the game. I started playing it in 2011 when it was first released. I really can't even guess how many hours I really have in the game. I have played all the content at least once and some like the Grand Campaign and Afrika Korps several times over.All the famous weapons and battles are there, you build your Army and (if you forgot to save) watch your units perish before you. Is it an accurate simulation of WWII? No. It is more like the Hollywood movies that stars Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, and Donald Sutherland. You and your men single handedly win the war for the good (bad?) guys and get all the glory.Full disclosure, haven't got all the glory yet, but I have to be real close. If I spend enough prestige to get Rudel's Stuka up to 15, I should be able to take the objective at...........................................So If you are reading this, it is time to man up, be the SGT Rock you were meant to be, and join the Panzer Corps. Your Mom will be proud.			"

												NB : Comments from playing with the original Slitherine version.Taking into account all expansions, I played over 300 PzC scenarios. And it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.This is first and foremost a “game” rather than a “simulation”, yet the game has plenty of historical chrome and details. It is really easy to get into the game even if you are not familiar with WW2 tactics. However there is plenty of room to showcase your skills whether tactical or for managing your corps. For those reasons I'm glad to see this game coming to Steam and a wider audience.Pros:- Simple 2D game engine with neat gfx and convincing sound fx, that efficiently support gameplay. Multitask easily, no crash in 300 games! However I had a few problems on MP while uploading or replaying turns, it might be due to poor connection or security programms.- Easy controls and clean UI, short loading times.- The game was already good on release in 2011, but the developers made a number of improvements and refinements which make it even better today. Plus Steam achievements.- The strongest game asset is probably the campaign game, where you develop your Corps scenario after scenario, your units gaining experience and heroes, you can also upgrade units with new equipments as the war progresses. Building you very own Corps, not only adds a layer of meta strategy over the individual scenarios, but it also awake the RPG fan in you.- Plenty of scenarios with the DLCs.- Over 800 unit types database, and easily modable, which is great for scenarios designers.Cons:- I wished the AI was better not necessarily in sheer strength but in adapting its behaviors to the various situations. It is not a problem when you discover the game, but with practice you'll note that the AI repeatedly uses the same pattern, and it is not so good at using combined arms.- Basically scenarios outcome are: defeat, minor victory, major victory. I would have liked either finer grained, or better calibrated, victory conditions. As it is, it is too easy too achieve a major victory on most scenarios.- Same for the difficulty levels. With 5 difficulty levels there should be something for everyone, however even the hardest level is relatively easy for experienced players. Nevertheless with the latest releases, there is now an “advanced settings” panel which allows to increase the difficulty to suit your skills.- The scenarios of the original game are OK, but those of the DLCs are better, in particular the scale of the battles depicted works better with the game mechanisms.- If you are looking for historical accuracy, you might get hurt.- Most MP scenarios feels too much like a RTS rather than WW2 battles.- Despite being very good on release, 4 years later the development is rather disapointing, the devs merely added more scenarios, they never cared to improve balance (especially in MP) or to add some gameplay elements (Actually most gameplay community requests were implemented in Order Of Battle: Pacific).Overall I rate the game 85/100. I think it could easily appeals to strategy fans even if they are new to WW2 gaming, or to the grognards looking for a lighter yet very thematic recreation.Recommended.PS: note that the base Panzer Corps game at 19,99€ is a fully featured self contained game, the numerous DLCs only add more campaigns. It is not like , say Civ V, where DLCs add significant game play elements you wouldn't want to play the game without.I think it would take over 100 hours to complete all campaigns and scenarios of the base game once. And you'll probably want to play them several time to try new strategy. Plus many free quality mods already available.Cheap maybe not, but very good value for money.			"

												Is ridiculously deep strategy game with an easy to learn surface, but a million fathoms of strategic depth to uncover.  The game's main feature is the dynamic campaign, each scenario has specific parametres to achieve ""decisive victory"" these are like ""S"" ranking a mission in other games and it is actually quite hard to achieve a decisive victory even in the early levels.  I often found myself getting a decisive victory on the last turn.  If you win through any other means it is a mere ""marginal victory"" and this is where the game gets really interesting.  A marginal victory is cause history to play out normally, but a decisive victory will lead into scenarios like Operation Sea Lion.  Furthermore, your core units (as long as they survive) will persist between scenarios in the campaign, they can also gain medals and have heroes added to them depending on their performance.  If you are a strategy fan this may scratch that itch for you.			"

												As an Old tyme player that missed the original general series (Panzer I,II, II,Allied, Peoples, Pacific And Space) I was delighted to discover this was a remake of the original series with a modern tech bump. It is one of the most easy to play yet challenging turn based WWII stategy games I have found yet. The Interface is very easy the strategy not so easy on high difficulties.  I'm another old guy who does not need to be dazzled with special effects or incredible graphics.  PanzerCorp, like the original General Series takes me back to my Avlon Hill Board Game days.   If you do not know what I mean by Avlon Hill Games you are either Rather Young or are not a serious gamer.  Since I'm to old to be taken seriously by the RPG players anymore, turn based strategy  and first person shooters takes the place of my television.   So Kudos to PanzerCorps------------------------------   I Give this Series 6 stars out of 5 for all aspects and I have all of the campaigns and downloadable material thus far and probably 500 hours of game play.    Where' s The Pacific Campaign ??  we want Pacific !!!!!!!!!!!!!!       A thought for the designers  how about a Korean War and an Israel/Arab Conflict series.  Really want to go all out, how about a US Soviet Long Term Clash starting in 1945 up until....................If you ever need a playtester feel free to call me			"

												Panzer Corps is a brilliant in depth World War 2 strategy game. The top down turn based strategy game is based on the classic Panzer General. If you are a fan of World War 2 games or a strategist at heart you will love this game. Check out my Tutorial videos if you are just getting started.

												I love this game. Simply put, it is an equal or better to the old Panzer General games. So many indie games have tried to copy Panzer General, a seemingly simple task, and failed. Unit experience, branching campaigns, over strength units, huge numbers of individual vehicles and infantry types, and a simple and clean interface. This one ships with small campaigns and a full grand campaign that branches in alt-history directions, but once you play that you will want to start picking up the add-on packs, which imho are worth the price of admission. Just buy them as you play them or wait for a big sale. My advice, after you've played through the main game, pick up the Afrika Korps campaign. It's long, with more alt history twists and turns if you succeed at your objectives. I have spent a lot of good money on lame pretenders to the PG throne on Steam over the years. Here, finally, is a worthy successor.			"

												Engaging, fun, both for casual and hardcore players. Highly moddable, and plenty of content to be played base or with DLC. DLC is not required, but over time have expanded to different area of the war. In the base game alone you'll be taking the role of Germany and fight through Europe, Africa, and America for world domination. If you play right you will eventually defeat the U.S. so the game alone offers hundreds of units and over 30 scenarios in the game alone. As mentioned the DLC merely expands to different nations or campaigns or even expands certain invasions. All of the DLCs offer different scenarios which are straightforward on the storepage, there is not paywall and with the level editor you can literally create all of these things yourself. (but you'll still want the DLC just because you'll love the game so much). This game is like the PC version of Advanced Wars: Day of Ruin which I played on the DS when I was a kid, while this game is a hex-grid rather a squared one, the way units fight and have fuel and a base hitpoint of 10 (can be extended when the units become experienced or elite) reminds me of the good old days of Day of Ruin. I never played Panzer General but I hear people mention this as a worthy successor, while those who have no experience with strategy games will find this game appealing and educational at the same time. This game is simply awesome and I recommend it, really it's kind of a must have in my opinion.Good day and happy gaming ! Thanks for reading			"

												Panzer Corps is a gem of a hexbased wargame. It's my own personal sit back and command game, so relaxing yet also challenging.In Vanilla Panzer corps you control the wehrmacht fighting from Poland to the end of the war in various scenarios. Each scenario has two methods of victory, Marginal Victoy and Decisive Victory. You should strive to obtain Decisive victories since it will allow you to access different scenarios to overthrow history and eventually invade the United States. Controls are super easy, left mouse button is all you need, what you really need to get familiar with is mechanics. I will not pretend I know every single mechanic in the game (i.e. just learned today that it might be better to obtain Marginal Victories to get more Prestige) and may get some wrong, but it is fairly simple for the most part (although I wish the game would make a better effort to tell you these less obvious mechanics). Your only income is Prestige which you use to purchase new units, ungrades new units, overstrenght you units and replace your troops. Overstrengthing your units occurs when you give one of your unit one more health than the base 10 that every unit has. Every unit can reach to five stars of veterancy which means you can overstrength your units from 10 health to 15. This doesn't sound like a big deal, but a 15 health Tiger Tank is almost impossible to kill (already that 10 health Tigers are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ same with 15 health infantry, aircraft, tankdestroyers etc.You have two options to replenish your troops, elite replacements which cost more prestige but allow your troops to retain their Veterancy stars so as to over strength and green replacements which is cheaper to replenish your troops but experience is lost. So you find yourself having to learn to economise your Prestige and learn when/when not to overstength, upgrade and/or replenish  The amount of units is crazy, nearly all tank, fighter aircraft, strategic bombers, tactical bombers, AT (self propelled or otherwise), troops, artillary etc. is depicted in games. 90% of scenarios are ground based, but there are some with naval scenarios. However, you cannot buy ''core'' (core refers to units that you purchase that carry over from scenario to scenario) naval units. Now, personnally I find Vanilla objectives to be less than stellar, no real variety. All offensive scenarios Decisive Victories are Control all objective cities with X turns remaining i.e. if you have 20 turns, you have to capture all objective with 6 turns remaining, meaning by turn 14 if you want a decisive victory. Marginal Victories are capture all objective cities within X turns, keepin with the 20 turns example, capture all objectives by, including, turn 20. The DLCs fix this lack of variety offering differnt methods of obtaining MV and DV.I've purchased every single piece of DLC and I'd adivse to hold off from them if you don't really want to go beyond Vanilla (i.e. you're satisfied just playing Vanilla campagin). The only reason I'm giving this advice is that is can be quite costly to purchase all the DLC, so make sure you really want more of Panzer Corps than what Vanilla offers. If you do want more to the base game I'd say you can't really go wrong with any of the DLC, personally here's my favorites:1. The German grand campaign   2. Allied Corps/ Allied grand campaign3. Soviet Corps4. Sea Lion (haven't gone too deep in this one yet)5. Africa CorpsAsthetic wise, sounds are pretty solid, tanks shots, damage to enemy units, bombing, machine gun fire etc. are all really good. The worst sound imho is truck movement that perhaps can be better. Graphics are not AAA but I find PC has the greatest graphics out of all the wargames I've ever played Ofc this is all subjective but I really find PC has some really great graphics.In the end, PC offers a really great remake of classic Panzer General and is a no-brainer pick up for veteran and casual wargamers.

There is room for a LOT of improvement especially in the graphics but this game is a strategic players wet dream.Just nominated this for the most go to game of all time.. Basically if you like turned based or WW2 strategy you MUST own this. If you like both then you NEED to own this.			"

												I bought a boxed copy of the original Panzer Corps in 2011 and i played it for dozens of hours before i buy the complete PaCo stuff on Steam.This game is very good. It's easy for a new player (new to Panzer Corps or new to turn-based strategy games) to learn but not easy to win, especially in some nasty missions. I have never played 1990s  Panzer General (i am too young for that game), so i can't tell the difference, but i think the developers did all the right things and created a 2010s classic, i think it's more than just a modern remake. The number of various units the game contains is mind blowing. Although is not a simulation game by any means, the player has a feeling that he plays real battles from World War 2 and not just a chess like game.I totally recommend Panzer Corps to any person that wants to play TBS games, newbie or veteran, this game is very good introduction to new players that want to enter the TBS genre and provide much challenge and fun to veteran players too.A classic.     10/10			"

												I had it long time and totaled lot of hoursI would recommend this game and would rate it 9/10The game has massive amounts of content, if you check out Slitherine forum you'll find lots of mods too.Way the game been designed you can blast through it just for fun, customise it in so many ways that makes it very replayable. The game has lots difficulty settings so user friendly. Visually its been nicely done. Lots of unit choice. If you loved Panzer General you will love this game. I recommend all the DLC. Grand Campaign is fun but can be frustrating towards last years on east campaign. West campaign tricky but fun. Allied Corps was bit to easy. Afrika Korps was great fun. Standard campaign nice to win out in USA. Soviet corps nice finally play with red tanks. Sea Lion challanging and nice see this campaign been done. Soon there will be US grand campaign. This really will keep you busy for hours of fun.			"

												Probably one of the best remakes of a classic hexbased wargame ever made. If you enjoyed Panzer General back in the day, you'll most certainly enjoy this..!I recently did a small look at the latest DLC, Soviet Corps, focussing on the Winter War in Finland of 1939 scenario. It give you a good (Though short) impression of what the game is like:

												So what is Panzer Corps ? Panzer Corps is an exact copy of Panzer General II updated for mordern computers.  That's it.  Overall this a pretty great classic game.  I can't count the number of hours that I spent playing the original, and there is absoultely nothing wrong with this game.  Would buy again.The only comment I will make is that if you are looking to see what a modern hex based WWII game looks like, then you should also pick up a copy of ""Unity of Command"", which was clearly influenced by Panzer General II, but which has its own really fresh take on hex based wargames.

												What can be said about Panzer Corps?First of all, if you ever enjoyed playing Panzer General or Allied General, you will love this game.  I have played almost 500 hours so far of DLC and the original Panzer Corps game, and will be getting the Gold Pack soon (probably tonight).  I have made it through the Grand Campaign with decisive victories in every game.The Good:1) The campaigns are incredibly done.  They are very challenging and well thought out.2) The game hasn't crashed on my system once and no errors in almost 500 hours of playtime.3) The units you can buy are very balanced in terms of expense and effectiveness.4) Hours, upon hours of exciting gameplay.The Bad:1) Unlike Panzer General, Air units, cargo units and even AA guns (on one particular map) will spawn and attack you or move in the same turn.  This adds a dynamic element to the game because you cannot just farm the enemy airfields and wait for spawning air units, but it also creates a situation where your best laid plans might fail due to circumstances beyond your control and can be annoying sometimes.Overall Assessment:This game is incredible and if you like stradegy games, you will love this game.  Buy it and love it.  It is truly one of the best games I have ever played and I have over 30 years of gaming experience, from RPG's, MMO's, stradegy games, console games, etc., and it ranks in my top 5 of all time.  Just Amazing!!  Seriously, give it a shot. "

												This is the best tactical-level war game of all time. Its roots reach all the way into the 70's and AH's entry into the wargaming world, and has preserved all that is good and playable in a turn-based WWII game. The Best. Ever.The DLCs work flawlessly, and each one adds significant depth to the games and dozens of hours of enjoyment. The 128 hours I've played so far are just on Steam; I've owned this game since it was first announced, and I've owned all the games it is based upon, all the way back to AH's Blitzkreig. I really can't say a single bad word about this game, as for me it is perfection (well, if it made breakfast that'd be great too.) It is not for the FPS guys or the RTS guys; however, if you can slow down and learn to enjoy a games depth and thoughtfulness and comprehensive presentations of conventional warfare in the 20th century, you will learn to love this game series.The controls are elegant, the options are varied and make for an excellent adjustment to give you just the gaming experience you desire. The entire game can be played with just your mouse, although you can set and modify many keymaps. The game contains a wealth of historical and technical data and will allow the user to satifactorily recreate any time periond, battle sequence, or campaign from this massively important time in human history. The map has two levels of zoom and a strategic view as well, easily shifted between ground and air units, which is all the divisions you need to play this game seamlessly. This can be a casual, quick scenario game, or a deep and long-lsting campaign with units developing heroes, increased combat strengths, and upgrades. Most all military units are represented, easily identifiable, and movement and combat are simple click/click movements. It has a nice musical background and great yet simple audio battle sounds. You can save at any time, you can review a battlefield after conclusion, and it has more than adequate support for most all resolutions. It is not a computer hog for resources, and can run on older or less robust systems than most games.I've never really had a technical issue, other than it getting a little sloggy after playing for 8 hours or so, and a simple save/restart cleared that up. With the release of the Soviet campaigns/scenarios, I can't wait to experience them from the Russian perspective; I will add to the review when I've played it a lot.In case you glossed over it, this is the BEST turn-based WAR GAME EVER. Replayability is infinite, as is the enjoyment. It is not for every single person on the planet, but only for the intelligent, patient players who enjoy a brilliant design and a flawless execution of an elegantly simple, yet deep combat system. Forget to combine your arms in the proper order, and an easy victory will turn on it and defeat you. It can be played solo, hot-seat (both players in the room but each player only sits at the PC when it's their turn, or multiplayer and PBEM.PERFECT. I cannot imagine recommending a game more enthusiastically than I recommend this one.			"

												Panzer Corps is a newer Panzer General, with the exception that you need to buy dl content to play with the allies, and now the russian campaign is live!. Still, is a very good game and I am glad to pay for the extra expansions, this way it helps the developers keep the game alive and not forgotten. Also I would like to add it is pretty challenging, getting decisive victory can be quite hard, and for that you need either to be perfect or be very lucky. This is a great game for those who love strategy and turn based warfare. Have fun			"

												Cons: - EXPENSIVE ($80 for a collection !!!)- Repetetive (click, point, click, point, click, point, etc).- While overall the graphics are fine, some aspects remain problematic.  Trees are extremely tiny, look like bushes on the map, forests or trees adjasent to forests extend over tiles which are classified as fields making strategic planning often burdensome- Simplistic.  Units health = 10, what does this mean?, why not show actual numbers of soldiers, equipment?  Supply map is not well explained/shown/integrated/conceptualized by the player, while supply is very important in grand strategy games in Panzer Corp you can be encircled over a wide area and still be fully supplied, how is that possible? Simply run on the map to the marked points (usually cities), knocking out enemy units on the way without worrying much about supplies, partisants or any other side-aspects of a typical 20th century warfare.  Very limited focus on units morale (all units generally have high morale, I guess German morale in Russia in the 1940s was generally good <-- NO IT WASNT, look at historic photographs and battle statistics)- No understanding what the units actually represent leads me to form a very poor bond with my   units.  Are these units divisions, armies?  What are these formations? (for exmaple, AT gun unit, does this mean its several platoons with AT guns?, but then how can this be when the map streches over 100s of kilometers and there are only about 60 units on the map).  When a unit reaches 0/10 its destroyed (kind of an arcade time count)- No battle/war statistics displayed at the end of each campaign/war (this is a historic grand strategy game so tables, graphs, performance charts is a MUST HAVE! )Pros: - Decent selection of equipment from the era.  - Decent graphics with well visible/recognizable unit icons- Awards to particular units for bravery or other special achievements- Simple click, point and click strategy game on a hex-based board layout (this might be a drawback for some, see below)________________________________________________________________More about the problems:The collection is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, the game is basically the old Panzer General series, its a simple hex-based board game, with slightly better (its a 2D graphics so you shouldnt expect much in the graphics department), maybe a few new units and mostly just new maps.  I mean COMMON $80 for dozens of new 2D maps for $80, REALLY?  Skyrim with its excellent 3D graphics and a much more complex engine was not even as expensive as Panzer Corps Collection is now.  Yes the developers state that this is a BRILLIANT REMAKE or some crap like that on their website, however they dont justify that argument with neither specific explanations about why its presumably so much better than the old, nor have I experiance anything new playing this game.  Considering that you can get Panzer General 2 for several dollars online and there hundreds (if not thousands) of FREE maps/campaigns made over the last 20 years or so which can be downloaded online, the games price is simply out of norm at the moment.  Also, some aspects of the older games were actually better than in this most recent one.  For example, I actually preferred the terrain in Panzer General 2 over this game (e.g., vegetation type, such as tree cover, was far more pleasent and recognizable in the old one).  Automatic switching between ground units and air units (e.g., when you move an air unit to attack a ground unit) is very clumsy and in some cases does and sometmes it does not result in an attack (you have to execute the command once more after you place the air unit of ground unit to attack).  There are other problems with the game, but these do not neccessarly reflect a sole problem of Panzer Corps but rather a general design flaw with hex-based war games (e.g., AT guns = if these are inf units equiped with AT guns, why are they weaker than regular inf units which lack AT guns?).Publishers Censorship:Aside from the game itself, the developer has been known to block/censor people on steam forum who complain about aspects of the game, such as the extremely high cost of the game.  Basically someone posts a message stating that the game price is overblown, then some other users (potentialy someone who works for the developer as this has been repeated numerous times on steam forum) posts a comment criticising the original comment with some unpleasent remarks (not even swear words), then the original poster responds to it with more unpleasent remarks (again, no swear words) and then the publisher quickly blocks the post and bans the original person posting the comment criticising the high cost of the game PERMANENTLY stating that the person has made an unpleasent comment !  Simple corporate scheme to block critique against the buisness strategy of the company.			"

												I have played this game since it came out - and I really enjoyed both the original campaign and the DLC from '39 til '45 seen from the Axis' side. After that I bought the expansions both never really got to play them since I had spent many hundred hours (not on the Steam version - only bought that a year ago approximately) and got a little tired of the game, I guess.However, I have played the multiplayer (PBEM) part of the game for many hundred hours too, with a specific opponent. That has been the BEST part of the experience. After we ran out of multiplayer scenarios after about 4 years or something, we began downloading custom scenarios. I can easily recommend ""1941"" that is a 99 turn game that spans 1941 to 1945. So all in all I can EASILY recommend it.However, I would LOVE a Campain based multiplayer where you can battle your opponent in a balanced way (maybe that is a whole different way - I got many ideas for how to do that...

												Took a little while for me to get into this but once I played more of the tutorial battles I started to like this game more and more. At first, it seems quite slow and cumbersome. The graphics aren't great and moving pixelated squares around may not seem exciting. However, once you play the 5th tutorial battle you are right in the middle of a full-on battle and trying desperately to counter the AI. The difficulty level is quite high and single player is a challenge. Your army gets stretched as you go across the map and you have to make quick decisions on where to reinforce, and how many units to move where. On a tactical level this game is very good. Battles move along quickly with fast fighting, and it is very easy to load up a game in your campaign and play a game or two after work. There is not much strategic planning as there is no base building, no allocating resources over wide areas, and no planning on a grand map. All the strategic decisions are made as you play your battles with units carrying over into your next battle, and new units being made available before each battle.It is quite a simple design but the battle mechanics are very good, and with even the early battles being a challenge it really keeps you engaged. The campaign DLCs add a lot of content as well. Recommended for wargamers, and especially so in the frequent Steam sales. 8.5/10 "

Firgured out if I lowered my computers resolution to 1280x768 and the DPI to 100%, then restarted the computer it worked great and was much easier to see.  So far it seems just like Panzer General and all seems to be working correctly.  Will play on easy until I remember the rules and am looking forward to playing more.			"

												A game that takes me back to Panzer General.  It makes me happy to play this.  One of the best things about this is the campaign play.  You can download in episodes or buy the whole thing.  You keep your units from one campaign episode to the next.  Make it as easy or as difficult as you want!If you love hex games or used to play Panzer General then this is the game for you!			"

												This game may not look like much -- after all, it takes its graphics from a game made in the mid-90's. But if you're looking for an excellent strategy game, you have to try the Grand Campaign here.			"

												This game is a newer version of the Panzer General series of games for Dos and Win95 from the early to mid 90's.  It is not difficult to learn and if you ever played Panzer General you probably don't even need to read the manual.  It falls into the beer and pretzels style of wargame.  My only real complaint is that you have to buy a lot of DLC to complete the game.  However that gives you hundreds of scenarios if you do.  You do not have to worry about things like supply lines, only what you are going up against and replenishing your ammo and fuel.  Weather is a big factor in success and so it the time limit.It is an excellent game if you like WWII style top down play - if you prefer more complex wargames such as Hearts of Iron (  I was totally bored by HOI III )   this is not for you .

												Panzer Corps is a fun and accessible war-game. I know, I know hexes are scary but don’t let that deter you too much. If you can put up with a little sparsity in its presentation Panzer Corps is an engaging and expansive strategy game.The base campaign sees you taking control of the German army during WW2 and you will visit most of the fronts in the European war. The game also uses a semi dynamic campaign which will give you access to new missions depending on your performance.It also features my favorite thing in strategy games, persistent units. througout the campaign your units will gain experience and perks that in the end can have a big effect on your units survivability. It almost goes without saying that your dead units will stay dead. A more personalized core force might have been even better but what is there is engaging and fun.In the end Panzer Corps is fun and easy get started in and I reccommend it to anyone who likes a bit more challenge in their strategy games without going full Hearts of iron. The only thing I can really say against it is that it might be a tad over priced without a sale and that its simple presentation makes the ipad version more attractive than the PC.			"

												I have been playing strategy games for almost 25 years. I love them. I am not an expert, but I am not bad at all.It is extremely uncommon for me not to find any flaws in a game. There is always something wrong.I have been thinking about buying this for a long time, because I have bought some games before, and just after that I have lost my motivation to play them.But now, after 11 hours of intensive playing I think, that this game is PERFECT. I am really amazed how everything has been thought out. UI is extremely useful, intuitive, and everything, what you would expect, is shown in the right place.AI is amazing. Many times, I just wanted to rush and moved my artillery (or support units) ahead into a theoretically safe area. And every time some AI units jumped in and slayed them like little kittens. AI behaves almost exactly like a human. It will exploit all your weaknesses. All of them. No regret, no remorse.I have skipped built in campaigns and have bought Grand Campaign '39. And, if you think, that conquering Poland is piece of cake, you are SO WRONG. 7 hours of playing and I have just came into the third scenario. Campaign is thought out very well. The map is not 100% accurate, but it does include all the terrain features that you would expect, type of units (lots of Polish infantry, but not a match for Wermacht, lots of AT guns, and great Polish cavalry), and strategic objectives of that time (ie. bridges in Northern Poland). It also features successful Polish counter offensive near Bzura river - in that scenario you really need to be careful with every move you make. I live in Gdansk, former Danzig, the place where IIWW broke out, so I know what I am talking about.Tutorial is just great and very informative. It doesn't treat you like a child trying to learn you how to click with your mouse. It focuses on the most important stuff.If I had the opportunity, I would come back in time and SLAP my past-me in the face. Just for thinking too much.Well, I don't have an access to a time machine, but don't do the same mistake... because the future-you could have...Do you remember, what I said at the beginning? It is extremely uncommon for me not to find any flaws in a game. This is the first time. Panzer Corps has no flaws at all.Just buy it. If you love strategy games, this would be AT LEAST one of the best games you would ever play.			"

												Excellent game, simple yet addictive.  There is much more to it, than meets the eye, when one first plays.  I love how units can gain experience and gain heroes (pictures of German soldiers), nice touch.  Can be quite a challenge (depending on the setting) even on Sgt. mode (if you don't want to lose a single unit, and you don't) but not so hard that it's frustrating.  All the many expansions and campaigns add tons of game time for the price.  I hope to see more.  Great game overall.			"

												TL:DR ~ you don't need any of these reviews.  Go watch a few of ReneMesis' YT playthroughs of the first campaign.  You either are an addict waiting to happen, or you really aren't.  Watching our good Norwegian commentator celebrate or bemoan his fate will tell you which you are.  And that's probably what you came down here for anyway.     If, however, you want to do it the hard way, or look for ' Review Rembrandts ' painting word pictures with light... well.  God help you. REVIEWAs many reviews here suggest, this game shows a clear descendance from Panzer General (for those who remember that venerable series).  Those older still, will recognize the style as the computerized form of SPI games or Avalon HIll's Squad Leader Series =  Boardgames with cardboard maps and real dice, so absorbing that shouts and hand slamming could punctuate play, with teams of players hanging on every die roll - cursing and posturing at foul or fair fortune.  I love this game, so for those who want the perspective of a fan, I will put up the main things that I respctfully still find some fault with - and later why those didn;t keep me from acquiring and enjoying the title. Problems 1)This game brings all that good stuff back I mention in the first para.. but obviously with the ease and greater detail possible only in a computerized instance.  While Panzer Corps is every bit as addictive as I remember those old games being this comes at a price as multiplayer is only asynchronous PBEM and only 1v1.  A shame, even if it is understandable with the limited objectives of the designers, this should not keep serious players from considering this title if they have the necessary green.  And that's another thing... 2)At the time of thie writing, the regular price for this aging title is simply too high, with all the DLCs and the base game still costing $140 US when not on sale.  You need those DLCs to play the grand campaign which is by far the queen of the chessboard of experiences of the title, and would leave a big hollow place in one's game world not to have.  We purchased a few copies of this while on a 70% sale so the total bundle amounted to around the price of a regular Triple A title.  Thats for a title that is 5 years old, even if it IS a huge title in terms of content and an incredible amount of work is contained in it.  Many people probably don't care about large segments of that body of work... regardless of the depth it may add to the game experience. 3)Repetition of scenario format and victory conditions makes some people go 'spla' and it can be a bit annoying at times since other means of accomplishing a scenario objective clearly offer themselves, and any afficianado of WW2 can think of dozens of objectives in history that could be modeled easily enough.  Benefits1)Library.  The detalied library of all the equipment provided in the game is an amazing resource and is accompanied by enlargeable diagrams. 2)This highlights a lot of the ways in which the game models supply, fuel, and replacement.  It feels right, and the various equipment and formations feel properly weighted because of that research as well as clearly, a great deal of playtesting.  3)There are few bugs.  No show stoppers.  Weird.  (heh !)4)WHen its on sale its a good value.  Many many units, and plenty of diversity. 5)Granular control and difficulty settings. 6)Not a computer hog, and while it is fun to look at, its no eye candy maven.  If you are looking for something to throw tri-sli at, you've taken a wrong turn somewhere...  (Hah ha ha ha!) 7)If you leave it set to reasonable variation of results (die roll), there will be those times you WILL be grumpy and cry out loud... put your face in your palm, and reel so far back... ""that you can clutch a fringe or two of the windy past"" when we rolled real dice, and shouted ""GODDA--- uhhhh ---NICE!"" Buy it on sale. but do get it if watching a playthrough makes you want to watch another one.  :)  ~'Crazy Uncle' Al			"

												Well then, what do I think of Panzer Corps?I bought the game when before the Gold bundle dropped so the DLC etc was a little too expensive for my liking but certainly worth getting for the content it provides. The retro Panzer General theme is a favourite of mine and all the classic features that made PG so brilliant are in there too. Fans of the Panzer and Allied General games should love this one and its well worth a crack says I.Pros-Retro magic-Strategic gaming at its best with a massive range of units and scenarios-Fog of war ;-)-Music and sound effects are greatCons (At time of purchase)-Cost of DLC (Kind of irrelevant now I guess).-Difficulty levels don't always scale in a logical fashion and sometimes the jump can be a bit much. (Not a deal breaker really though)I'd give it 8/10 Badger Points :-)			"

												Basic, turn based, hex map WW2 wargame. Looks and plays very like the old Panzer General from back in the day.I played through PanzerCorps on an iPad some time ago and now I've started replaying it on PC with all the DLC that was not available when I played on iPad. I mention that because, from what I've seen so far, its pretty much identical to the iPad version.Graphically its functional, but not pretty. Running at 1080p, the graphics look drab/blurry/grainy. Its like they took an old 640x480/800x600 screen and just upscaled it. The UI is messy and clunky. The boxes look the wrong size, menu icons look too small and theres a lot of 'wasted space' that could be used to display useful ingame information like terrain type/effects that aren't necessarily clear from the map. The 'clunky' feel applies to the whole thing, from save games to scernario editing. On the upside you get a lot of maps/scenarios for your money. At £35(ish) for the complete set, thats a good deal if you like 'basic, turnbased, hexmap WW2 wargames'.As for the battles ...... the combat results seem to have a wide range, so predicting the outcome of a battle is always uncertain. You think your unit of 109s should be able to take out the unit of Stukas in the tutorial mission? You may be surprised and find you need all three of your 109 units - and they end up taking more casualties than the Stukas! And don't trust those computer generated combat result predictions, they are downright fantasy.The AI seems to have some abilities you don't, so it happily reinforces its units in circumstances you couldn't, marches out of nowhere to attack your rear echelon units that it couldn't 'see' beforehand ..... etc.The AI is neither stupid nor particularly competent - but its unique 'abilities', your limited unit choices, scenario time restrictions, combat result uncertainty .... etc .... usually make for a challenging game.Anyway, I bought it again! Partly for old times sake, partly because I like it despite its glaring flaws, partly because theres a lot of game for your money, partly because its so undemanding it runs on just about any old PC ...... and the hex based ww2 genre isn't exactly crowded.

												Panzer Corps is very nice, very time consuming turn based strategy game. If you like old Panzer General games you will probably also like Panzer Corps. If you never played Panzer General-kind of games bear in mind that it is not typical RTS style game. You will spend lot of time on planning each unit deployment and each unit move to eventually win the battle. Your main concern might be the price, but truth is that you really no need to buy everything at once. If you get only base game, you will spend at least 50+ hours on higher difficulty in main campaign plus there is tons of free content. Later on you might consider to buy DLC’s, which are also great, especially when they will be on sale.If you into turn based strategy games with historic background this might be good choice.			"

												Way back in 1995 I came across the SSI classic Panzer General. It was an instant love of mine and has remained so ever since.  Heck, I still have my ancient 90's playstation just so I could play that one game.  For years I dreamed of some sort of updated remake to the classic. Well that time has come and its more than I could have hoped.  Panzer Corps is not only true to the original, it expands the rules and complexity without losing any of the aspects that make the game so addictive.  Anyone who is a fan of turn based combat or a WWII military history fan will find something to fall in love with.			"

												Best game EVER in my opinion,.I would change a few things of course,Especially giving artillery units one more ammunition burst when you play online multiplayer as SUPPLY ON,.I also don't understand why I can't BUY the multiplayer ONLY scenarios,.I know you can somehow click and paste them to you hard drive then swap them to your folder ect ect yadda yadda yadda,.But I'm too computer illiterate to figue out that crap,.I'm a PANZER GENERAL!,..not a compu-tech wiz,..But otherwise it's a killer game with a vast amount of scenarios,.I'm having a BLAST whooping some azz online against some old school guys who must have wondered where the hell I came from!I did buy the Afrika corps and I wasn't as fond of those scenarios as I was the Euro ones,.They are a bit Bland?,.But I guess the desert is THAT,..Not many river to cross!,.Heheh,.If you like wartime strategy with mind-bending chess effect,.this is THE game,.No political crap that changes the events of the war,( I do like some of those games).just kicking axx and accuring more prestige when playing scenario mode ..I also wish the AI would play more aggressively,.They really need to enhance that aspect of the game,.The higher difficulties just make it harder to destroy units and give you less bonuses, or decrease the amount of turns to achive a decicive victory,.but hopefully they are working on that,.But if you liked Panzer General you will LOVE this,.All I see are HEXES!   Heheheh ; )			"

												I remember playing Panzer General back on ps1 days. This game is the perfect remaster of that game and even if your familiar or new to this type of game it is a must for ww2 strategy players. One of those""one more turn"" games before bed. With some mods and dlcs out their you can even further add to your play time. Buy it today!			"

												Welcome to the best strategy game made.  This game possesses a degree of complexity almost unseen in strategy games, bordering being almost impossible to truly understand.  Panzer Korps is also incredibly customizable, in a way that that virtually every single other strategy game is not.  Of similar importance, the game is incredibly historically accurate, which matters if you want to have an authentic gaming experience when playing historical strategy games.  When you play a game and a M4A4 ""Sherman"" drives up and one-shots a ""Tiger"", or IS-2, ""LIKE A BOSS"", then you may have a problem ;).  Positive factors:I) absolutely insane amount of complexityII) ground breaking customizabilityIII) ranges from: easy-Erwin Rommel    (that means only a legend could beat the game)IV) very historically accurateV) even the Soviets are represented accurately and without ideological bias VI) endless *YEARS* of playtime (not hours, years)VII) inclusion of numerous fictional plot linesOf note:1) this is a very thoughtful and intense game, thinking is required 2) non-stop sexual themes and gore splattering are NOT part of this game3) constant flashes, bright lights are not present eitherGive this game a try and it will blow your mind.  Really an amazing game.  Definitely go watch the trailer, check out some pictures, read the description and then make an informed decision.  You will not be dissapointed!			"

												I can only begin by suggesting that this is ""Panzer General in HD"". There are many (mostly visual) improvements and as many additional complications, but the game remains fundamentally the same-a somewhat simplified tactical wargame worthy of many classic board war games (thanks to TTG, WRG, SSI and their pioneering predecessors) and the original PG itself, born of those little cheap boxed map-and-counter games those of us old or keen enough to remember started with. I would recommend the basic game at the start-veterans may miss the irritating arbitrariness of the original (weather and supply reducing the game to a perfect and deeply aggravating historic re-enactment are still optional, thank goodness!), but I believe as a veteran tabletop wargamer of thirty years that you will still find the challenge inherent in the original game, but with some shiny extra features that may please you. I must add that I am currently ploughing through the original game, crrently on sale (24 Feb 2016) and as such I must also add that DLC is also available. However I have chosen to avoid the DLC for now until I am familiar with the main game, in order to ensure that I know what I am letting myself in for. Feel free to do as you like, but as an ""old sweat"" familiar with long drawn-out military campaigns fought from the safety of my own four walls, this will do and saves me hours of setting up a table and putting it all away afterwards.

												Having played Panzer Generals in the 90's, this game took me back. It has a variety of campaigns and missions/battles that will preoccupy any grognard for hours, especially at the higher difficulties. Your core units rank up allowing them to survive later scenarios and if you manage to gain prestige, then you can use it to purchase new units or replenish current ones. If you love war strategy games, then this is an easy fit. 10/10			"

												Clearly the spritual successor to Panzer General, the game features far more depth, a great AI and a truly staggering number of great scenarios and campaigns.  Replayability is off the charts as well since it becomes obvious as you play each scenario what mistakes you might have made and trying different strategies is hugely fun and what the game is all about.

												I can't put it into words. Look at my play time...I've gone through less than half the scenarios. I've pumped my fist in victory and seriously almost wept in grueling defeat. Units can stay throughout a campaign and gain experience. Again, words can't come to mind to describe the suspension of reality during a hard fought battle, with sound effects that are spot on...it will make your hair stand on end. I think anyone who has played or is interested in Avalon Hill type wargames will be overjoyed with what this game has to offer. Highly recommended to my friends. I keep coming back to this game...no two battles are the same. Difficulty can be ramped up or lowered as you like. Look at my hours...many were spent sweating and worrying if my tactics would work. Worth every cent and minute I've played.			"

												I remember a young birthday when I used my money to buy some Airfix Matildas to help out against the Airfix Panzers on my tabletop desert battlefield. That was over 40 years ago and how things have changed... After progressing through the ZX Spectrum and Atari ST, I finally arrived at a 386DX and MS-DOS 5, a platform that was to develop into the best and most versatile gaming system the world has to offer.There was Perfect General, Panzer General, History Line to name a few. I loved the simplicity of Panzer General 2 and Battle Isle 2 over the wargames with more complex rules, preferring to play than read rule books. Last year I discovered Panzer Corps and was amazed at how easy it was to pick up and play, it must be the most accesible wargame ever.I've now played through the base game, and went back and replayed it a couple a times to make sure I had a go at all of the scenarios. I read a few tips to sharpen my game and have worked out the whole combined arms thing. I've moved on to Africa Korps on my laptop but I'm replaying the original game on my desktop on Field Marshal diffculty (my first go was on Colonel). I've bought all the DLC up to and including Sea Lion as I know it's going to take me a long time to tire of it.For the hard core wargamer who likes a thick book of rules and calling up off map artillery and air support, ensuring tanks are facing the right way and every realism nailed down, Panzer Corps might be too simplistic. But for a more casual wargamer who wants to flick through a thin rule book and do his learning on the battlefield, it's perfect. There's a great support community on the Slitherine website, and DLC keeps getting released. Highly recommended for those who want to play a solid wargame without having to go on a course first.			"

												Good game. Obviously there are flaws and issues -- the prestige soft cap and upgrade paths in some equipment types come immediately to mind -- and it is equally obvious that the devs are never going to actually address them. That said it is still a good game. No, it's not Panzer General. Rather than commanding your army to victory or defeat on your own terms, you are essentially consigned to reliving the harrowing slog of doom that actually happened. Still, it's about as close to Panzer General as you are likely to find.			"

												The tried and true formula so familiar to the classic Panzer General fans gets a second wind in Panzer Corps. You get to command a mostly persistent force through a number of historical and hypothetical WWII campaign scenarios that unravel depending on progress and success in prior battles. It's thanks to tactical depth, freedom and replayability as well as an unprecedented scale of campaigns found in both the base game and especially the numerous DLCs that Panzer Corps deserves in my mind the title of the best turn-and-hex based strategy game of 2014.Accessible for even those players completely unfamiliar with the genre conventions, it's a gem worth checking out even at the current steep price. As far as DLCs are concerned, the Grand Campaign '39-'45 is a must for fans of the genre.			"

												On steam i have a different nick than on Slitherine.com, but i am much better known in the Panzer Corps community as Nikivdd.I bought the game as soon as it was released 3 years ago and i went into Panzer Corps modding less than a month later.Ladies and Gentlemen, the rebirth of Panzer General is called Panzer Corps. A dream becoming reality, as i have always been a PG fanatic and finally i no longer needed dosbox to play the best turn based strategy game every devised. The main game of Panzer Corps comes with a tutorial campaign (for new players) and a basic campaign, spanning WW2. Single scenarios can be played as well and not to forget, the possibility to play multiplayer games.Africa Korps and Allied Corps are two great add-ons where in Africa Korps you can command and purchase a mixed force of Italian and German troops and where Alllied Corps offers the opportunity to start either as the Americans or the British. The British campaign of Allied Corps kicks off as a tutorial, in which difficulty augments slowly but it does feel good to kick the Italians big time in the butt, but when Rommel finaly arrives, you will need all your command abilities to outsmart the Desert Fox. For every campaign, you can make a lot of choices in terms of difficulty (very detailed), terms of game play and you can built and expand your army with a whole variety of units. You can even be rewarded an extra unit from time to time, SE units called, that do not count towards the number of units you can have in your army. Africa Korps and Allied Corps are guarantees for many hours of extra game play. It is not only while playing Civ 5 that a little voice says...one more turn please.... Hopefully your Africa Korps will march into Egypt :)The Grand Campaign (the DLCs 39-40 and 41-45 East and 42-45 West) offer over a hundred new scenarios. Each year of the war is a campaign on its own, but oh so special, that when you finish for example DLC 39, you can carry over and import (by prompt) your army in DLC 40! You can also start any DLC of any given year, with the pre-placed army. You will experience Stalingrad as General Paulus or D-Day as FM Rommel.Panzer Corps which is now finally available on Steam, is not the same game as it appeared three years ago. It became twice as good by several patches, new content, and surely by the tremendous feedback by the Panzer Corps community. How many games are out there, where the community has a say in the development of a game?I gladly admit, I have never enjoyed a community as much as the Panzer Corps community and as such to be part of a great family and i made a lot of new friends in the process.So, if you decide to buy the game on Steam, keep in mind that you reap the fruits of three years of game improvements!And in the meantime the PC community awaits with great anticipation, the next installment, namely, Soviet Corps!By Nikivdd (Panzer Corps beta tester and modder).

												So the game is like panzer general. The victories are the only real differance as they can add little things like destory trains or lead these small country units threw the capital or save some cut off units behind enemy lines while still capturing or holding certain objectives. I do like this game with these added victory conditions. The dlc to the grand campaign do add alot more battles then the original panzer general game had. Even with expierenced and battle hardened units its not as easy to roll over all units like in PG. Which I also enjoy. CONS: To enjoy the full game you really need all the DLC. And to buy it at regular price it just isnt worth it for a 2D startegy game. The AI seems to be dumb sometimes. Units with entrenchment will move off cities to attack and for no real purpose other then a chance to weaken an advancing unit. The AI airforce can sometimes be real dumb too, like just randomingly sit in one hex unit it runs out of fuel or is destroyed.			"

												I realize I'm biased and I've loved these games since Panzergeneral back in the 90s, but ""awsome"".Initially (when there was only the Wehrmacht part I thought, ""Yea, Panzergeneral just worse!"" because there was less scenarios in it and they had all but taken away my favorit parts ""defense"". But I grew to love it anyway. And with all of the expansions there are enough defensive scenerios as well. Now the only sad parts are, that the Wehrmacht part is boring compared to the expansions and the additions they made later, and that the Africa Corps does not ""intermingle"" with the original game like it used to be in the first Panzergeneral. Anyway, I love the game, I loved the Soviet Corps expansion and I hope to soon be able to get my hands on the US Corps to try my skill as an American general as well			"

												A very simple military strategy game. The scenarios in the vanilla campaign - ""Wermacht"" - are very true to the old Panzer General in that they're almost puzzles, forcing you to capture objectives in seemingly impossible timeframes. The Grand Campaign missions are more original, and the best of the bunch is the Afrika Corps expansion.			"

												""Must have"" for every fan of the Panzer General serie. Brilant turn based strategy for long winter nights. Game has many DLCs. Anyway original itself is playable again and again, even with europe WWII campaing ""only"". But then you most probably realize, you need  more and more. Africa campaing, Detailed europe campaing east or west, fictive Sealion campaing, Soviet campaing, British campaing or US campaing  :)10/10			"

												If you like turn based WWII strategy, this is it. Easy to learn, hard to master. Not as deep as others ( War in the east ), but thoroughly enjoyable. Played all Add-ons at least once, the Grand Campaign is really great. Also, there are some really great mods out there ( Afrika Korps, Ostfront ), but sadly you need a retail copy for them to work ( as far as i know ). Played Panzer General II and all fan-made campaigns, and this is at least equal ( Although not quite so diverse). Worth buying, even more so on sale. But don't forget Panzer General II, still a great game (GOG), with loads of fan made campaigns. Happy campaigning.			"

												This game is the definition of Strategy! The campaigns set you as a Nazi general, fighting your way through WWII.The game provides multiple campaigns, multiple tutorial senarioes and 1 campaign. The tide of history is given in two ways, one way is the eventual defeat of Germany, or world domination, climaxing with the Invasion of the U.S. Over 400 units, 4 campaigns, a senario screen, a custom map editor, and different difficulties,, this game will never grow old. The game gives two types of troops, auxillaries, and your CoreThe core are troops that you will take to every battle until destruction. The units can be upgraded during deployment or during battle with the use of prestige. Fuel, ammunition, and transportation also prove to be problems, along with weather and terrian.100/100 Realistic and provens to be actually challenging			"

												Strictly speaking, this is not a review per se, just some random, more or less organized thoughts about the Gold incarnation of Panzer Corps, a glorified yet mindless Panzer General and Panzer General II clone.PROS- excellently designed UI;- highly addictive game, perfectly recaptures the playability, if not the spirit, of SSI's 5-Star General series, while combining the best features of PG (remaking history on an operational/tactical level) and PG II (moving and firing are independent actions, units get heroes/leaders);- lots of units, including purpose-switching ones (AA to AT) and Wunderwaffen;- core army gets experience and in the Grand Campaigns can be saved and transfered from one campaign to another;- except for the Pacific and Japan, all theater of wars are visited and all major WWII sides involved can be played with their own campaigns;- huge content with high replayability value;- huge modding/customizable potential with official editor included in the vanilla game.- solid vanilla campaign, with lots of twists and turns and time-limit (which is absent in all the DLCs).CONS- non-existent AI (hence the mindless in the first line), substituted by heavy scripting that imposes how one should play the game;- wild inconsistency in the unit/map scale (in the same campaign, a city frequently goes from a one-hex size to a full map size);- odd unit management: upgrading within the same class to a newer equipment (say, from a Panzer III to a IV) means paying full price AND losing in the process all ovestrength points;- frustrating prestige management: it's called soft prestige cap, it's a feature not a bug and it basically punishes the player for performing above and beyond duty (the better army you develop, the less prestige you'll earn)*;- somewhat bizzare campaigns, marred by linearity (except the vanilla one and, to a lesser degree, Sealion), repetitiveness, elephantiasis (worst culprit is the Grand Campaign, where ""Bigger is better"" seems to have been the designers' motto) and historical oddities (like, for instance, Allied Corps, where half of the British campaign is spent fighting the... Italians, while the US enters the fray only in the middle of it);- experience cap in the Grand Campaign (which also features in its East Branch the most lame finale ever, Epilogue) and the US Grand Campaign, meaning that your units won't get any any experience beyond a limit which is set for every campaign in the GCs;- lack of historical identities/particularities, one campaign feeling pretty much like any other one (definitely a problem for the Soviet Corps) and all of them feeling like a tedious hurdle race with a predetermined ending.I'm not much into multiplayer, but from what I've seen so far it's functional and divided in two. One part features terribly non-descript and generic maps, perfectly balanced both in terms of units and terrains, with no historical realism whatsoever. The second part, much more interesting, features the vanila campaign scenarios, where somewhat more realistic conditions apply, thus turning a battle against a human opponent into a vastly different and challenging gameplay, with almost no relation to what goes on in the campaign.*To be fair, prestige cap can be avoided by choosing to play with another rule set, but this also disables some useful later patch additions. Experience cap, on the other hand, can't be avoided.			"

												It's a Panzer General clone for modern systems. The core game is still the same, but with plenty of tweaks. Not all of them are good, and the game can sometimes feel badly balanced, especially in MP. RNG still rules the day. Multiplayer only supports PBEM, although the turns are handled by in-built servers so there's no messing with email. The pricing on DLC campaigns is the usual Slitherine policy, as in expensive, but they do include PG1 style WW2 German campaign in the base game so it's good as such.For those who aren't General series veterans - it's a good starting point for a new strategy game player. The mechanics are simple but the game is challenging. You have to learn how to balance your force roster, which units to upgrade, how to advance, scout, exploit openings and weaknesses of the enemy etc. Maps have alot of variance and if you fight well enough, you can change the course of history and achieve what the German military machine failed to.

If you purchase the base game for $19.00 you will enjoy it, But for to get the full experience of the German side of the War. You need to purchase all of the DLC’S of the war in Europe about $35-45 dollars which you can purchase if the base Game drags you in as it did me. The research into the weapons is short of amazing. The DLC’s offer you the real campaigns of the War and after some research I found them to be accurate as far as possible. So I give this game a 10 out of a 10			"

												Wasting already over 30 hours, alone on the main campaign, i feel the need to write a recommendation for this really impressive strategy game.If you´re in this kind of strategy and maybe played games like Panzer General and the many others in the ""General"" series (i for one also would still like a modern version of Fantasy General) from good old SSI, you already know, what to expect.A deep and challenging campaign throughout the WW II time, with many varied unit types from each time of the war. The way you take is partly based on your success in the battles, if you manage to overtake the enemy fast enough, you can also change the course of history and get interesting hypothetical scenarios like invasion of GB or USA.Beside the well thought out maps and unit strengths/weaknesses your motivation is also to keep your core units alive, which stay with you and get experience/heroes/medals with your victories. To lose your trusty reconnaissance unit after five years, truly hurts.Surely it could use some comfort functions and the steam integration is still a bit lacking, but without question Panzer Corps is a must have for fans of this type of game.

												A modern recreation of Panzer General, a game from ye olde, Panzer Corps plays with the same classic gameplay of the original, kicked into the 21st Century.Giving the option of a progressive campaign, or both single and multiplayer independent scenarios, the Second World War comes back to life with the renouwned almost chess-like system of balance between Infantry, Armour, Reconnaisance, Anti-Armour, Artillery, AA, Fighters, and Tactical & Strategic Bombers. Each unit has its' own advantages, strengths and weaknesses - a King Tiger is truely a powerful tank, but it cannot win the war alone! With the original prestige system the game forces you to adapt your strategy around the battlefield: if you're taking heavy losses, should I pull-back, give them green reinforcements, or veterans? As you push through the campaign, with a choice of five starting years, your core forces follow through, gaining experience, and eventually medals and heroes.The flexibility of tactics allow your preferences to come out in your core and mission results. Choices such as those between ground attack and fighter-bomber aircraft: early in the game, you have the Ju87 Stuka and the Bf110. The Stuka is a more reliable source of damage, but more vulnerable to enemy interceptors and anti-air fire whilst the 110 can engage other aircraft, typically used to finish off shattered aircraft or mop up craft that cannot do much back like bombers, as well as faring better in air combat, but at the cost of less performance in ground strikes.Anti-tank, artillery, or anti-aircraft weapons on a tank chassis make for faster, more reliable defence and offense, but at a higher price and losing out on the bonuses crewed non vehicle weapons obtain - as they are not armoured, they fare better in close terrain and hold better ambush advantages, amongst other things. Sometimes a mix is better - keeping general support weapons with main attacks whilst giving mechanised AA, AT and artillery to tank groups to better support their attacks can benefit both. But now you're dividing your forces into two distinct groups and you have to weigh up whether the advantages are enough!A range of scenarios are present in the game: relive the humble beginnings in Poland, to the start of the turning point in the Caucauses - from all the major operations in the war, but also covering hypothetical situations - what would be the real outcome of a German invasion of the British Isles, or even an invasion of the American east coast?A strong variety of units are present. Progressive models of vehicles like tanks and fighters give you the oppertunity to upgrade as history produced each - even the late-war Panzer IV J has it's roots in the D model! Is the cost always worth it for the battle? Much of your choices may reflect necessities found in the real war, such as the shock of heavier armour in Barbarossa! Different types of each group present theirselves - infantry are diverse: light, heavy, mountain, paratroop, engineer, bridge-laying, cavalry, motorised and so on, and this type of diversity is continued in the unit groups. Upgrade your units! Infantry, anti-tank, artillery and the like can be given transport. The first option is the classic Opel Blitz truck, which gets you where you need. However, as a mere truck, it is highly susceptible to attack and as such many choose to upgrade some of their units to use the sd.kfz 251 or 250 halftracks which also benefit from the ability to fire when under attacked (or when the risky commander chooses to engage enemies!) Throughout the campaign, you also have the chance to obtain prototype and unique units, from the tremendous Schwere-Gustav railgun to the infamous Maus.Finally, if you wish to continue, the devs have bundled up new content in the form of two expansion packs, Allied & Afrika Corps, for a new experience, and the Grand Campaign which allows you to progress through all notable battles in the war: 1939 is now split into fourteen seperate scenarios! Carve your route through the war - your successes or failures will decide factors such as whether your force attacks through the Danzig North or Danzig South corridor in Poland, or whether to obey orders or mount an assault on the Dunkirk evacuation! Many of the scenarios have been bundled with unique objectives. For instance, one scenario in 1940 challenges you to assault positions to extract a French general and take him to the rear of the map, whilst one Polish situation requires you to halt troop trains to gain a decisive victory! Now get out there herr oberleutnant, and turn the course of the war!			"

												The base game without DLC's is great.  Slitherine is very MOD friendly and plenty of user added content. The base game covers the major battles/operations the Campaign DLC's break these down into different phases.Ex: Taking (insert city name) in the base game usually includes just one map.  In the campaign DLCs it is broken down into securing areas around the city on differnt maps then you play a map with the city.  Allied Corps is like Panzer Corps focusing on the major actions in WWII.  Overall plenty of content I found the $80 additional for extra a little steep but got it on sale at a price I thought fair.  After playing the DLCs I still think that price is a little high but not much.  There is plenty of content that will justify the cost for some people and now knowing what the DLC's add I would be more likely to purchase at $80.			"

												This is an excellent game that is well worth the price of all the content. I bought it here on steam before Soviet Corps, Sealion and US Corps were released, and bought all three of those DLCs without hesitation. You will get plenty of hours out of this just like i did. It will also run on most decent machines. The difficulty settings are very flexible and customizable to suit your playstylePlenty of what if? scenarios are avalible across the different DLC packs and the main game. There really is little reason not to buy all the content at once.			"

												Epic, just epic. Do you like strategy and thinking games, buy it!I have played the original Panzer General and all expansions in the 90's. Best games I played as a teenager and young adult.Now Panzer Corps recreates all the fun and adds lots more in the east and west grand campaign DLC's, events and my favourite Afrika corps.It looks good, plays comfortably and is a thinking man's game. Just don't expect a FPS experience or such or over the top graphics. I've been playing Panzer Corps from the release, now 3 years ago. And all stand alones and DLC's. Still playing and still having fun. When writing this there's a sale on, but even at full price it's worth it every cent. All complainers about the supposed 'high' price don't appreciate the 'easy to learn, hard to master' approach of Panzer Corps, or realise the immense replayability of the game. And now a sale anyways.... lolTry and have loads of fun.			"

												Panzer Corps is fantastic for what it is.  A turn based strategy game on a hex grid.  I played Panzer General and this game is excellent newer version of that old game.   Unit upgrades as well as experience.   A campaign tree that has branches based on the outcome of your last battle.   Compared to FPS and such, this may seem like an old school game, but that is exactly why I like it.  Thinking and planning as well as unit progression.If you like turn based strategy games and this is on sale, it is a must buy in my book.			"

												A wonderful modern homage to Panzer General II. If you like turn-based strategy games you will love this game. If you like the WWII setting you will love this game.The variety and availability of units, scenarios, and setups all are done with a nod to historical accuracy.  The AI seems adequate and offers two settings along with further tweaks in the assignment of ""prestige"" which is the currency both you and the AI spend for units and reinforcements. The default seemed a touch too easy but with the selection of AI 2 and increasing AI prestige I've got all the fight I want from the computer and more.Very fun. Just what I was looking for. Suggestions for improvement (or for a sequel) from me include:1) better color highlighting of units to distinguish friend from foe. My eyesight isn't what it used to be.2) better dynamic zooming of the battlefield instead of just  ""in and out"" with the map (ala sid meyer games) 3) More detailed battlefield projection tooltips**What I mean here is instead of a hover forcast of projection win-loss if I commit to an attack I would like not only those numbers but below them i would like a quick summary of why--i.e. why I am forcasted to lose 5 or half my strength is because my unit has a horrible hard attack and I am attacking a triple fortified hard opponent for example. I know I can find this information out by clicking each individual unit and will learn certain characteristics over time, but it would be nice to have some of this at hand without the additional clicking and number crunching.Very much recommend this game!

												I finally picked up Panzer Corps a few weeks ago, after waiting for it to go on sale--it's not cheap.  Like many other reviewers, I was a big fan of Panzer General and the Steel Thunder games back in the stone age. On the surface, Panzer Corps seems like a pretty straightforward reboot of those titles. It has a lot more depth, though. The game seems insanely easy to play at first--the interface is as straightforward and clear as anything. There are definitely right and wrong ways to do things, though.  It's rewarding to find out that Panzer Corps responds in the ways you expect it to, though--if you have a reasonable grasp of what the different unit types are supposed to do, it's fun to discover that your dreams of being an armchair Rommel actually work out.There's a huge variety of unit types, and it's really fun to build up the core of your army throughout a campaign. You really start to care about your units. In one campaign I was invading Sicily and feeling way too confident...I let my prized British commando unit (elites that couldn't be replaced) get chewed up by the Germans when I got cocky. It was one of those slo-mo 'no no no nonooooooooooooooo' moments, hehe.Oh, and after a bad day at work and/or with the gf/wife/whatever you've got, PC has the perfect solution to your problems.  Start a Wehrmacht '39 campaign on the easiest setting, and just roflstomp your way through the baby seals.Great game.  Totally addictive.  Get it.			"

												As stated by other reviewers, this is a revised and updated Panzer General. Great fun (assuming you liked PG or turn based strategy in general), incredible diversity of scenarios if you buy the DLC. Gameplay and graphics are solid, never had an issue of any kind. If there is anything negative it is that the more difficult settings are well balanced in the early years of the Grand campaign (playing as Germany), but once you reach 1943 it becomes nearly impossible to maintain a core force and therefore you will also end up fielding units of old men and middle school kids. Playing as the Allies you will roll through later years of campaign. Of course this is what happened IRL and you might argue that the game reflects the historical imbalance of production/manpower and ultimately hopeless situation of the Nazi's. Either way it is fun, there is some replayability in terms of applying different mix of units to the same scenarios, and I keep coming back to it from time to time to try different strategies and increase the difficulty.  If you buy, get the Grand Campaign DLC and if it is ever in a Steam Sale this is a no brainer for any turn based strategy fans, particularly those who have fond memories of Panzer General or enjoy WWII as a setting.

Panzer Corps brings it back to life on today's computers. Yes, the graphics should have been updated. Yes, once the battle is over, your units should be brought back up to full strength so you don't have to use valuable prestige points for replacements. But overrall, a good remake on a great old series. Hope they include the Pacific soon.			"

												This is difficult to say, since I was an absolute fan of SSI's Steel Panthers and later of Panzer General (of which Panzer Corps claims to be the offspring and evolution), but Panzer Korps falls short of its promises.I was so excited by the prospect of playing again one of my favourite war games of all time that I bought the whole bundle (admittedly on offer). Not only I enjoyed the original game, but I also contributed to it by creating several community maps since I am a military history buff.If you played the older titles the interface looks immediately familiar and you can jump straight into the game. The graphics haven't greatly changed either, and although I don't mind the retro-look as I don't play this kind of games for the visual effects, something a little more refined wouldn't have hurt.The main problems with Panzer Corps are the game balance and the map design. Most scenarios are won or lost in the first few turns if you can (or most often can't) take control of some ""chokepoints"" (mostly fortified towns held by overly-strong A/T units). Any delay will inevitably lead to failure. Since most available routes pass through the chokepoints you'll have to fight at a disadvantage. Problem is in most scenarios the A/T units in built-up areas are way too strong and can stop any armour you throw at them. Infantry would be a good option in these circumstances IF it could be moved fast enough, but most of it will lag behind. So you'll need a lucky hit that knocks out the opposition before you take too much damage or lose too much time. And it often really comes down to that, a lucky hit.During WWII both tanks and A/T evolved in time, with one or the other (usually the tanks) gaining the upper hand as circumstances went, but in Panzer Corps you'll find your expensive armoured units shot to pieces by oddly powerful cheaper units.There is very little in Panzer Corps which wasn't already in Panzer General while the scenarios are a lot less balanced. Ultimately a disappointing game, though one I relly really wish had turned out better.---------- Read further if interested in more details and response to comments in thread -----------In response to comments I'll expand my critique of the game for those interested.The main problem of Panzer Corps is that it changed its scope from a tactical game (such as were Steel Panzers and Panzer General) to a strategic one. This in itself could be a good thing but it is only half implemented.The scale (not necessarily the actual size) of the maps is much larger, encompassing entire countries, BUT the units fighting on them (and their combat values) are still tactical units. So, for example, you may happen to attack Paris with a couple of panzers, which is plainly absurd, facing a couple of A/T units. In tactical combat a decent A/T unit at close quarters could easily knock out a few tanks. However, the game has the ambition of being played at strategic level (hence the Grand Campaigns scenarios) so the units shown on the map should necessarily be strategic units, ie Panzer Regiments or larger formations.Panzer Divisions were COMBINED ARMS units, their strength being the mix of Motorized Infantry (Panzer Grenadieren), Tanks and Artillery, plus fast recce units (motorcycles and armoured  halftracks). On the other hand there were no A/T divisions in any army at the beginning of WWII. Germans never set up any such units for the whole course of the war as they were deemed too expensive. Soviets set up A/T artillery divisions only in 1943.So the game places on the same level tactical A/T units and strategic armoured ones, thus the unbalance. This is why the A/T units are very cheap in comparison. The game is basically an hybrid and doesn't quite succeed in either the tactical challenge (where Steel Panzers excelled) or the strategic one, as manoeuvre is overly hampered by chokepoints.In the end this is just a game. You may like it or not and anyone is entitled to his own views. I am happy to have a civilised exchange of opinion, but I find Cuqueen remarks about my military knowledge insulting and showing poor manners.			"

												I have been a fan of Panzer General since my Ps1 days.  There has been many Strategy games come and gone all of which I enjoyed.  Most IMO needed changes as I was always comparing them to Panzer General.  Things like terrain advantages / disadvantges were over looked in many games.  Then comes Panzer Corp!!! Wow it is as ever bit as good as the orginal AND the developers made all the right and additional changes.  The turn based challanges with friends over email is stellar!  If you were a fan or like mil-sim stratagey games, then this is a must for you collection!			"

												An introductory level wargame that skimps on realism to deliver ""beer and pretzels"", jump right in and conquer the world goods.  You'll be playing the campaign as any individual scenario is not particularly compelling and definitely is NOT a historical simulation of its respective battle.  The campaign is a blast to play, though as you'll be given a core force of Wehrmacht units representing Infantry, Artillery, Panzer, etc of possibly brigade/division size.  IMO, the units have no realistic size as the game is abstracted and for funsies.  As you conquer cities and finish battles, you'll accumulate ""influence"" points with which you can upgrade your existing units and buy new ones.  In addition, your units accumulate experience when they fight which will make them more effective and randomly generate leaders attached to the unit that gives them special abilities like +1 Movement, for example.  As the war progresses, new units will unlock as your original units become obsolete.  You'll start the war with PzKfw I and end with Tiger IIs.  The campaign has branching possibilities depending on the victory level you achieve, so it is possible to invade England, e.g.  My beefs with the game are few.  The main one being that the base game is short (but replayable) and to properly enjoy the game, one should purchase the Grand Campaign.  The game overall has an admirable level of polish.  Wish there was more animation. Don't expect depth or realism.  This is War lite, playable while drunk.			"

												When I was a kid, my father bought a copy of Panzer General by SSI for Christmas. The two of us played it to death. The same thing happened to PGII, PGIII, and People's General after their releases. PG and PGII were my top two favourite strategy games of all time. The right amount of depth and history for my mediocre mind, and I had the time to think about it. God bless you, turn-based strategy category.I have been chasing that kind of game ever since. A friend of mine bought the whole big package and I looked up reviews for the game. ""....the spiritual sequel to the Panzer General series ...""  What? No! It can't be.Oh. It can be. And it is. Trains, planes, troops, tanks, and automobiles. Hexagons and more theatres of war than you can shake a stick at.I've come home.			"

												This is a straight up winner! The type of beer and pretzels game that one can sit down at anytime and play without suffering through a tome like instruction manual. Hours of enjoyment as you attempt to rewrite the history of World War II from the German side. DLC's covering the war in Africa and WWII from the perspective of the allies. Additional DLC's that add more campaign ""what ifs"" that further flesh out the original grand campaign. A must have to be sure! For those Western Allies buffs who want to give it a shot at defeating Germany and Italy, there is Allied General which can be part of your Panzer Corp finally for a small price. Think of it like another DLC so to speak. It should be noted there is no Soviet perspective campaign tree which is a disappointment. With that said, what is in the game far outweighs what's lacking.			"

												Panzer Corps is a turn-based strategy or ‘wargame’. Each scenario you are tasked with deploying your troops and taking a set number of objectives across the map. Units earn experience and can be upgraded during the deployment phase with any new equipment unlocked. This is done using prestige points that you acquire by completing objectives and are also used to reinforce units during battle when they lose strength. Prestige points are persistent throughout the campaign meaning spending all of your points in one battle may not be wise as you are effectively depleting your resources for the next engagement; although you do receive some at the beginning of each scenario, what you have carries over.The graphics of Panzer Corps are fairly basic although nice to look at with each type of unit distinguishable from each other. Sounds can also said to be somewhat basic as each unit type has a single sound that is played during movement and attack. This may sound repetitive however after 18 hours of playing Panzer Corps I can say this has yet to bother me. The interface is effective at doing the job and gives you access to all of the information you need without being intrusive.Panzer Corps strikes a great balance between depth and accessibility and offers a great entry point into wargames for the uninitiated. The gameplay is addictive and the visuals and audio serve the game well, while the multiplayer uses a play-by-email method so multiple games can be played at once over the course of a few or more days.Panzer Corps has quickly become one of my favourite games and I would happily recommend it to anyone.

												Great to see the Panzer Corps series has finally come to steam.  It is one of the best turn based WW2 strategy games that I have ever played. It is easy to get into but has tactical depth.  Large variety of units to build your core army with throughout the game, there is nothing like having an early panzer crew survive long enough that they are a vetern Tiger crew by the games end.  Only downside is the Afrika Corps and Allied Corps are not stand alone because the original Panzer Corps is made obsolete by the Grand Campaign DLCs.  The Grand Campaign DLCs are by far the best value in each being a whole campaign in which your core units are saved and can be carried over to the next chapter of the war.  Allied Corps is great and allows you to play the western Allies starting in North Africa until victory in Western Europe.  Afrika Corps is great and featres some of the more challenging battles in the series while focusing on DAK and Italian forces in North Africa.  Great to finally see Slitherine/Matrix games apearing on steam for the historical strategy gaming crowd.			"

												If you ever played Panzer General series then your at home with Panzer corps. The game allows the same feel and design as the original series which was a extremely popular turn base WWII game way back in the day. You have the ability to buy units, upgrade them and go all out war with them. There isn't much else to say as it's very simple to understand and follow once you get in. The only issue I have with panzer corps which has been something appearing and disappearing from the Panzer General series is the more detailed outcome of engagements. In Panzer General you had the ability to turn on/off a small animation that is played on the top of  your screen which shows you two cycles one being the attacking force and the other being the defending force. This animation was extremely interesting as it showed you what your units were attacking and how much damage they are doing in a visual appearance instead of the basic fly over a target and see a smoke cloud appear and numbers go down. Overall the game is extremely fun for those wanting a turn base game as well as something that doesn't really need much thought just mainly which units can effectively counter the other. If your really 50/50 on it just wait for a sale the price is extremely cheap during this time...as well as it won't laugh at you for hating it so much.......I really hate you brink...you simply just sit in my library mocking me....with all bugs...one day I will have my revenge			"

												A good remake of Panzer General, but hopelessly biased towards the allies.........apparently winning the war wasn't enough,  we have to alter historical fact to belittle our defeated enemy, also lessening the achievements of the brave men who defeated them in the first place. I digress, however apparently the Russian ISU line is made from diamond plated titanium Armour with built in void shields, and German late war tanks are made from cardboard and crushed egg shells, held together with spit and bailing wire.............that being said 3 out of 5 stars.

												Очень понравилось, старые традиции, за простенькой графикой скрывается очень хорошо продуманная игра. Затягивает, очень много что влияет на результат боя, местность, погода, условия. Очень много различных юнитов с разными характеристиками и особенностями. Спокойный гейпмлей, своего рода шахматы, подумал, походил, передал ход. Рекомендую.			"

												Defending Berlin is somehwat impossible on normal difficulty if you have only strategic victories previously until that mission. You are so much outnumbered that you have just no chance. Game should not allow to continue if you have no chance on winning the following mission with only few core units. All in all i think a decent game but defending Berlin is impossible in a lot of situations , depending on how you did the previous missions. So all in all waste of time and the ki is cheating as well. "

												A great remake of the classic Panzer General.  This has taken the great gameplay of the original and made it better by adding some new features (such as railway movement).  The base game lets you play a campaign as the Axis where your core army survivors are taken from mission to mission through the historical battles of the war.   Its quite compelling to see your army gain experience over time, units gain medals and heroes occassionally appear.   Most missions involve capturing set objectives within time limits and if you are very successful then ""historical what if"" missions appear like the invasions of Britain and the USA.There is a lot of hours of gameplay in the base game alone, so dont be put off by all the DLC.   I cant comment on the Grand Campaigns as I havent bought those.  I do own the Allied Corps expansion which is a meaty expansion of the game allowing you to play the WWII campaign as the British or US.  You also might like it even if you dont normally play wargames as it is not complex and the battles are fast and fun.			"

												TWO STARS/5 ONLY.       I give Panzer General 5 stars, one star for better interface from windows 95 to windows 8, wow!, and one star for gameplay.       The old game is way better in maps design and replay value, if you can run any of the old games, Panzer General, Allied General, Panzer General II, Panzer General 3D & Panzer general III, buying them all together is cheaper than the basic game’s $19.99, not getting in to the DLC or the Allied Corps o the Soviet Corps to almost $100.00.	Is sad the waste of time of the gamers and the developers, any college programmer should be able to get a small team to do a way better (Not fancy) for extra curriculum activities.   "

												This a great turn-based strategic game. Certainly for players who remember Panzer General and any of it's successors. This is the ultimate version.For player who don't know this legendary game: this game keeps it simple in graphics and sound but that is also what makes you focus on the tactical gameplay of the scenario's and the strategic building of your army core.On the surface this game looks deceivingly simple but once you get to know all the game mechanics, you will soon understand how much planning and thought you can put in this game on the higher difficulty levels. The game mechanics are sadly not all super transparent at first, but using CTRL Click on a unit give you a detailed combat prediction and ""L"" give you the actual combat result from the last combat.Don't be misdirected by the many DLC's, keep in mind that this game was released in late 2011. The Grand Campaign let's you replay historical scenario's. As the basic game give you more a revisit of the original Panzer General scenario's with extra's (heroes) and some improvements like interface and gameplay settings.I haven't played Allied Corps or Afrika Corps but those two games bring a whole other twist to the game.And I haven't even talked about all the cool Mods and custom scenario's that have been build for this game. Just check out the forums of Slitherine if you want to get to the bottem of this game.For me, as a fan of the turn-based tactical and strategic games, this is the perfect WWII game. It focusses on the main issues at hand: how to succeed in combat. Logistics seem too simple at first glance but you will learn that if you don't keep your troops together you will soon be out of supplies and find that your units can't perform any more.So this game get's 9/10 from me.

												Easily my favorite war game on PC was the SSI classic Panzer General (1993).   PG went on to have 4-5 sequals and generally was a fan favorite for a decade.   Luckly for us Slitherine decided to dust off this classic with a bit newer graphics but the same old fun gameplay.   If you loved PG then stop reading this review buy the game and play.  If you are new to the series lets go over what makes it fun.  First unlike many other war games its very easy to pick up learn and enjoy.  Most gamers should be able to pick up most of what they need to learn in under 30 minutes of play.  Next for those of us who like detail but dislike horrible interfaces Panzer Corps has an easy to use interface that is nearly perfict.  Finally the depth of the historical missions are fun and exciting.  Eventually you will get attached to some of your brigades and be pitching a fit if one gets nailed in a bad spot.   Now for the bad....One area that really could use some help is music, its ok but after awhile you wish you could just turn it off.  Its not cheep but its not well done.  Also while they were faithfull to the old PG game they really didnt try to bring in something new that would wow the audience.  Perhaps a research element, perhaps better naval options, perhaps better ways to manage air cover who knows but they really didnt change any core gameplay.  Yes this isnt necessarly a bad thing PG was a darn good game but that was 20 years ago.  All in all the game is easily worth 50 without the DLC.  If you are a wargamer this is a must buy if there ever was one.  If you are on the fence or just havent played a war game before I would say there is no other game that could possibly be a better game to try.			"

												I'll make a quick review of this game.At first, most of you were probably thinking just like I was when I saw it the first time: How can you charge, That much, for something that looks quite like that which my (insert elderly familymember here) Would enjoy in his/her youth?Well, if you do enjoy armchair general'ing and feel great joy when your tactic successfully dislodges that presistent little infantry unit from the city which all your stuff needs to go through.... Then this just might be for you!Despite a somewhat elderly appearance, this game offers quite a bit of depth and does (especially true with its expansions and Grand Campaign) allow you some degree of choice. Also your units follow you from fight to fight (IF they survive). It also has a fairly alright difficulty editor for those of us who might not exactly be Eisenhower, Rommel or Montgomery, in terms of strategic prowess, so to a degree you can tailor your difficulty!My recommendation, if you like strategy, and would enjoy taking it online, you should indeed give it a spin! It also offers a good campaign mode for single players.I personally enjoy this game served in small doses on a rainy day, and sure enough, it has that good old ""Just one more turn"" issue with it, if you let yourself be immersed!

												This is first time I am really disappointed with the purchase. The game is not bad... it is actualy good game. BUT - for €20 you get less than 50% of Panzer General 2 content, similar maps, units, few minor upgrades and.. BUGS. I decided to give this game a go after initial wth? but when I tried to upgrade some of my units between missions and noticed that in most cases I need pay full unit prise not the the upgrade cost I resigned. Game is 4 years old, copying everything from Panzer General 2 (1997) and it still has such ridiculous bugs... €20 for that? Never again! MAYBE I would recommend it if it was for free.			"

												I much prefer Battle Academy 1 & 2 and Close Combat to this game. Many people will remember Panzer General from many years ago and you can still download it for free! The game might have been dressed up a bit but it's basically just the same limp excuse for a wargame - at least many years ago it seemed acceptable as there wasn't much else available because of the pc's being basic. At best it was an ok boardgame type game but doesn't have the realism of Battle Academy or Close Combat, or Combat Mission either. I don't know what scale these battles are supposed to be represented in, certainly not at the small scale seen in BA, CM or CC. In PC the battlefields are on a much larger scale which makes the problem of infantry not accompanying tanks in the same hex laughable. The Devs have also DLC'd it to death and if you buy the lot then you're going to part with a small fortune. I tried just the base game and at once I could see it was the same old game just with new window dressing. If you like your WWII wargames to actually try and reflect what it was really like, then avoid this game. If you like playing chess or draughts, then this might suit you.			"

												AI is absolutely broken to a point where the game is totally unplayable, don't waste a dime on this trash game. The game frequently spawns obnoxious defensive structures designed just to drain your clock (3 at guns plus heavy arty on a town...when you have only 20 turns to win the game) , and the AI has an omnipotent knowledge of where you do and do not have troops stationed (i.e. on a map where you have to capture a ridiculous amount of objectives, it will just so happen to spawn all its remaining troops on a location next to the first objective you captured. Due to the♥♥♥♥♥♥transportation mechanics in the game, and its obnoxious focus on turn limits, this makes the game just seem a bit too artificial. You're not fighitng WWII; you're fighting an obnoxious AI system). Thanks to the games thoroughly failed design in this department, you will literally have games that you were winnng beyond doubt turn into pathetic loses, all because you couldn't blitz your way back to some rando town you captured on turn one before the timer runs out. Joke game, joke representation of the war in general. Go play Hearts of Iron if you want something a bit less ridiculous and a bit more serious.			"

												I started to enjoy this game, played it for a few hours and got some achievements and finshed the first campaign.  I went and looked at the achievements and saw that there were one's for playing as the British, America et al, so I went to start a new campaign as one of the Allies...except I can't, unless I buy the DLC, which is hugely expensive!  This game is seriously dated - which in itself isn't a bad thing - but when you view the DLC and see the prices...it is a complete and utter rip off!  This is a disgusting way of doing business and I will avoid products from Slitherine/Flashback Games/The Lordz Studio from now on, as I believe they cannot be trusted.			"

Anything else you have to buy as dlc. Another anoying thing is that you have in the campaign battles which never happend. Since when did german locked down stalin or Captured Great Britain and finally the assault on Amerika. omg i really liked it until i met that point. That was too much fiction..			"

												An ovepriced clone of Panzer General with no combat animations (the jelly of the jelly doughnut in the original).It is better to download the remastered Panzer General version than play this or pay for it's atrociously ovepriced DLCs.Just to be clear, the whole game costs around 100 USD. That's the price of a good wargame with deep strategy and resource management features, something that people put time and effort in. A title, which resembles a browser flash game at best. A little more than an average iOS iPad game at the end of the ""this week's top free apps"" list. If you want deep WW2 wargame - go with Combat Mission. Or PG series. Or anything in this time and setting made by SSI.A fact unrelated to this title, but the producer (Slitherine, who are famous for overpriced trash titles) sank low enough to market a game based on ongoing Syrian conflict in the adspace of the game's launcher. It's the worst of business - it's an unethical company that does not care for its customers and one which has no integrity or ethics.Stay. Away. From. This. Garbage.			"

												If you like computerized war board games, you will like P.C.  Game seems to be pretty balanced and seems to give a tip o' the hat to Panzer General which was the model and example used for all computer war board games.If you want dynamic ""action"" then this game is not for you.  If you want complex detail, offered in games like CIV, then this game is not for you.  It is ""one"" dimensional.  War.  That's it.  No personallity conflicts, no loyalty conflicts, no complex economics to deal with, no partisians or resistance fighters, no complex refueling or rearming dynamics, just simple tactical battlefield strategy.  Now if you will excuse me, I have panzer divisions to command.			"

												Panzer Corps can be qualified as a successor to the famous and rewarded Panzer General series. In this game you take command of the German forces in World War II, sometimes assisted by their allies and must complete various objectives such as destroying a target or more often conquer the map. Panzer Corps is a turned-based 2D game which means that you organise your movements, attacks or other strategic action before the enemy does his. The German campaign will lead you in several theaters of the war such as the invasion of France, the taking of Norwegian's Narvik city, the assistance of Italian troops in their invasion of Greece or the famous operation Barbarossa. The campaign offers a continuity in the various operations which means you will keep your units from a theater to another. That way you will quickly care for your troops as they gain experience, medals and war heroes and you will try to keep the best of your regiments alive. Loosing a battle does not mean the end of the campaign or that you will automatically have to start again but you will continue the fight with a scenario according to your defeat. Now let's see the highs and lows of the game :[/b]- Good replayability : with various difficulties and numerous strategies possible you will like to start again a scenario and try to win it a different way.- The difficulty levels : They really offer a different difficulty which will accomodate the different kinds of players from novice to the master generals/ - The map is not just there to be pretty: Like a proper wargame, terrains matter. You may not want to attack while crossing a river, forests take longer to cross and units will move differently depending on their transport system ( trucks, on foot,...Etc )- Graphisms : Some will say come on we are in the 2010s but I like the graphism. The interface is very good and clean which is not always the case in these games and the units are clean as well. Once you are accustomed you will recognize the unit by their looks easily. - The sounds : there are not many sounds but they are correct and not horrible. Repetitive but very correct. The same goes with the music, it's not an epic music but it's enjoyable You may quickly forget that there is music though.- Multiplayer-Tutorial ( some games forget about tutorials so it's a good point. I jumped right into the game but for novice players it is important ).- There are achievements will add some new objectives if you like that kind of things.- Very fast, the end turns are quick ( The End of All Wars ? )- There is a demo on the official website. Some people don't care but I find very important that games have a demo, only to see if it works on your computer. - Where are the objectives ? Only when you end you turn and that's a shame. It's either hidden very well and in that case it's a low point as well but I can't find a single button to see my objectives during my turn. What follows is neither a high nor a low point: The DLCs. They had several new campaign ( the base game with the German campaign and the multiplayer already offers a lotn enough to see if you like the game ) such as with the Afrika Corps, the allied or more focused scenarios such as the year 1940,...Etc I bought two of them and I am happy with them. DLCs don't take away anything from the base game they just had new campaigns for those who want more. Some may not like it but at least features were not taken from the base game to be sold after as DLCs like so many games do. So I highly recommand this, for old Panzer General and the like fans as well for novice in this genre. It's very intuitive and you will soon get into the game without headaches. During my first play, I find myself playing three hours in a row withou t noticing time passing. 8.5/10 "

												Ok I love and hate this game....just like the Panzer General 2 forerunner.  The frustration comes from almost winning the scenario with 2 moves to go, the enemy gets some inexplicably lucky hits and boom..you lose!  That being said, it is one of the few games you really dont mind having to repeat your battles until you find the right ""puzzle"" to win.  I t really makes you careully strategize your moves.  For example..do you overstrengh and upgrade your elite units, or do you spend  your points on some new units of a type you don't have.?  The choice is yours, and you will find out, painfully, that it may not have been the correct one?  Does the AI ""cheat?""  Maybe, or i am just a slow learner.  Overall 7.5 out of 10.			"

												I may have little time on the Steam version, but i played this alot when it came out non-steam. Be far, it is the true heir to the classic Panzer General.			"

												From time to time I reminisce about the long nights playing Panzer General back in the mid 90's. Sadly, turn based strategy games were replaced by RTS's for many years, when there is plenty of room in the market for both. It was great to find Panzer Corps in my latest search for a PG revival. It is even better than the orignal game and I can already see hours and hours of play in the future.  A super deal on Steam and I hope to see this game tranlated over to tablets and consoles in the future. "

												Every time I play this game I immediately start feeling the old Panzer General atmosphere. It's a PG on steroids, people will play this game for years to come. And did I mention amazing mods you can try? Go to Panzer Corps forums and you'll find links to the tens of different mods just waiting for you to try. I especially recommend Winter War mod. Can you stop the Soviet Behemoth with your tiny, but determined Finnish force?			"
