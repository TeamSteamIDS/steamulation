												Reign: Conflict of Nations is not a bad game. But it suffers from comparison with a great number of A-titles in the same class. If you enjoy epic historical battles and tactical thought, go for Medieval: Total War 2 (or any game of Total War series); if you enjoy historically truthful political simulators with high degree of complexity, go for Crusader Kings 2. If, however, you are not a fan of great battles and CK2 are too complicated for you... go for Knights of Honor. I'd really recommend Reign only to medieval eastern Europe enthusists as myself.Reign: Conflict of Nations is an empire-building 4x strategy, depicting happenings in Eastern Europe between 1300 and 1700. Your ambition will be to unite one of the leading powers of the region (Poland, Lithuenia, Sweden or Russia) and become a hegemon. To this end, you'll need to build up a powerful economy, use diplomacy and spycraft, convert population to your religion, gather knowledge to make technological progress, and - of course - wage wars. Sounds promising, doesn't it? So... what's wrong with the game?Firstly, you will be required to do ALL these activities at the same time and that's - even with the help of action pause - is extremely difficult for bigger empires.Next, the battles are resulted by the computer, without giving you a chance to lead your troops or even influence the outcome. Moreover, the results are often unpleasantly random, so you'll find yourself kicking and screaming many times, after your highly superior army of knight has been wiped out by a rag-tag band of peasants.Third, you control basically all aspects of the game from the very beginning and none of them (to my knowledge) grows any more important later in the game, so it basically feels all the same when you control a miniature princedom in the heart of Poland, and a huge empire of the late-game. You just do A LOT MORE of the same stuff. And this is a recipe for boredom.Lastly, the game does not give you much choice of how you will rule your empire. In other game of this kind, you can choose to be a pieceful diplomat and trader, or a vicious tyrant, spying and assassining your enemies, or a steeled knight, conquering the world with fire and sword. Here, the game strangely pushes you into doing all - you can't win by the means of diplomacy, but you can't hold too many provinces with brute force (for unhappiness spawns infinite number of quite powerful rebels, who will finally defeat you anyway).All and all, R:CoN is quite playable, enjoyable and challanging in the beginning, but largely boring, time-consuming and repetative later in the game. It might be good springboard for those who want to jump into Crusader Kings, but feel intimidated by their complexity. And it might entertain you if you're fan of Sienkiewicz and history of Polish and Russian empire. In nearly all other cases, don't waste your money here!			"

												I pretty much have to say what the other negative reveiws have stated, that being the game is fun until you get a little ways into it. Then after that point, the game crashes more and more often.			"

												This game has one major problem that is unnoticeable in the very beginning, but soon becomes an overwhelming tumor killing the game. It's the fact that you have to manually control the resource production. The most optimal strategy is producing ±0 food and throwing the rest of the city population into gold and knowledge production. However, because the food production changes all the time because of various reasons, it have to be manually changed, otherwise you cause starvation or waste resources. And everything affects food production – moving troops, growing population, settlers, religious unrest, disease. It's no big deal if you have 1-5 cities, but if you control half of the map, it's just boring and painful to deal with the mess. Thus the actually interesting and unique parts of the game drown in the micromanaging tedium.I cannot recommend this game.			"

												CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Everything has to be controlled manually,♥♥♥♥♥♥happens and you can't do anything about it unless you see it on time.  Your production reduces on it's own for no apparent reason, your capital is defensell when you are training an army to be transfert to your general. Even if you know Eastern EUrope by heart, it take too long to find something. You do everything right and revolt starts. No level of difficulty can be set. You ambassadors disapear when no negociation where done. Technologie is expensive and you can't produce that much even if everything was built in your city. Finally, your allies lunch spy attacks against you. Nothing beats Knights of Honor. DOn't waste your money.But I alwayys blame steam for not providing demos.			"

												After playing for some time this game i have to admit I enjoy the micromanagement level because it gives the player a new level of control and also a series of considerations when making decisions. That is not to say that it is purely a positive experience. I will be the first to admit the frustration this game gave me the first time I started a campaign. Also the degree of difficulty to grow your settlements fast enough and the speed and strength that the armies created by the computer to invade you were quite unfair. The game lacks balance but the ideas and concepts it gives the player are not bad, just a problem in execution.			"

												Fun game, it's really hard. I've only played it ofr 2 hours and I've learned the jist of it from learning from my mistakes, the game does have a tutorial, it gives you tips on how to play and objectives to complete, the game had serious potential, but it's alright, I'm having a blast with this game so far but I can tell it'll get boring really easily, one nation can just dominate the whole game while others are just♥♥♥♥♥♥ like as Sweden, I managed to get 2 more provinces under my control now all I have is endless rebels, there needs bug fixing or balance changes, ruined the sweden campaign for me.

												Bought it on big sale and it has fulfilled my expectations. It is hardcore strategy game, so of course it is not for everybody, but I quite enjoyed it. The major flaw is in lack of any tutorial. This is big negative, mainly towards inexperienced players. Also there are some game mechanics, which annoy me, but generally I am happy with this purchase. I recommend it for seasoned players.The game takes place in late medieval age and concentrate on Eastern Europe. That is important plus from my perspective, because history of Eastern Europe is mostly overlooked.			"

												Challenging and solid but worth the effort?Reign: Conflict of Nations -  A game of "" what ifs?""Its there to offer gamers interested in historical eastern Europe a Strategy game -unlike fantasy worlds this is a harsh climate, the struggle is almost constant but not the fault of its game mechanics. It is missing minor production values and nuances of older games than itself but overcomes this through its choice of nations and almost endearing ruleset. I do have to admit that the GUI and Stain Glass/Manuscript art  is genuine and of quality. The game knows what it is implying and does so directly without notice of any shortcomings. To relive the Renaissance and Reformation era as Monarch/Head of State of an Eastern European Principality with very accurate names and maps is done adequetely.  Its where the game ends is the drop off. At 1650 the game ends with one popup window describing my loss due to not being as formidable as other leaders, a pity since I was established at top ranking of every nation on the statistics window in game of every category, OK I wasn't maxed out at Diplomatic relations, that is because I had taken over half the map and ran out of people to truance with. In my mind...I won. First the dissapointment of doing all this hard work with nothing to show, not even a summary throughout the years. I had lasting family dynasties, many brutal conflicts, trustful allies, great enemies, miserable generations, fascinating trades. Not even a list of every leader I had, at least, in a time frame would have let me remember fondly my hours into it. The game also misses some points  when - someone dies of say,old age. They sure tell you someone has passed away, but who it was and what their duties were in your vast empire, are up to you to remember where you positioned them, needing to check if there is a deficiency in your nation and replace him. The names sound alike over the years and portaits are reused. Confusing. Great Music  sticks with you throughout the day, and classical guitar. Only a handful of songs play throughout complementing the state of your province, they are good/great - I claim great. The game is simply simple that meanders into deep engaging and addictive gameplay. I am a fan. High difficulty in that most everything has a cause and effect. Want to boost farming? well be ready to lose out on gold and research for around 6 seasons. Want to buff Research for some seasons, well every other nation gets some too. Things conflict. This is where I now see my misfortunes in my personal game. Poland, historically suffered tragedy in the timeline when this game nears its end. I should have devoted more time at the start of my campaign in the spread of my empire as there was impossible odds against my nation from constant robbers, and instant takeovers by rebel nations and dark times on the regular after roughly the late 1500s. That is the type of attention to detail that I respect from this thought provoking experience. What if this game had a higher budget? I am leaning towards the developers putting out precisely the game they had envisioned.Pros:MusicGraphics/MapSimple battle controlHistorical accuracyDifferent troops per regionHighly replayable - each country should have it's own agendaNice damage system, regain health at city - red,orange,yellow,green - combine unitsHigh maintenanceArt direction - Manuscript paintingGet lost in the cultural significance overshadows some mechanics are half bakedCons:Charachter models are simpleSometimes hard to click on model because it is behind something.Too simple battlesHigh maintenanceDefineltely needs a journal because mission tab does not have any other messages to keep track of other countries at war etc.Nuances that needed to be implemented,which  have detracted from its own originality. See the diplomat screen's lack of infoRegiments do not regen health in villagesI guess I could say most of the faults could be a primitive aspect such as the time period of the game itself. But thats not the type of 4th dimensional gaming I prefer. But I kind of believe that a power hungry monarch really had no reason to keep tabs on diplomatic relations all the way across the map. In a way this is similar to old style CRPGs, and drawing your own dungeon maps on graph paper. If you really want to recall information, it is given to you, but only for a brief moment so take notes.			"

												Many promising features in this game, including a welcome exclusive focus on the mid/eastern European region. However, the combination of real-time gameplay with an 'open' strategic map fails to deliver a comfortable gaming experience. Numerous other small issues, including an occasionally awkward interface, all combine together to leave a game which just becomes a chore rather than fun. Better games with the same 'feel' exist.

												Ok. A mi me cuadran los juegos complicados, que lo ponen a uno a manejar la vara a lo maccro y a lo micro. La vara con este es que se pasaron de complicado.Es real time pero mapa tipo risk, tons se enreda uno y hay que ponerlo en el menos lento a cada rato pa manejar las ciudades a cada rato. No hay nada con una region, pero cuando lleva uno un cuarto del mapa ganao, diay nada mas que hacer que estar chineando ciudad por ciudad eternamente. Fua fua fua fuaaaaaa.Este no lo recomiendo, en vez de demandante es tedioso.			"

												Якщо бажаєте стратегію зі звичними правилами, приємною графікою та зручним інтерфейсом, то спробуйте «Reign». Плюси:  система героїв;  додаткові завдання (+ завдання «смутні часи»); затишна атмосфера, зручний інтерфейс. Мінуси: Нелогічна бойова система; між різними фракціями незначні відмінності ; дисбаланс на пізніх етапах (ворожі фракції надто помалу розвиваються)			"
