												Some say it's not as good as Supreme Commander (1) or Forged Alliance, and I think I'd agree with them. However, Supreme Commander 2 is still an awesome RTS which lately seem to be fewer and further between...If however you thought SC1 / FA had too much micro-management (with units AND resources), you'll probably enjoy SC2 more!

												I'm really not sure whether I can recommend this game or not. I first got this when it first came out and frankly, I was severly disappointed. It is a complete downgrade from supcom/FA. While I feel it is a good RTS on it's own, knowing what it came from is almost disgustng. If you want a basic RTS that won't require much planning then SupCom2 is your game. If you want an RTS that is massive in scale and requires actual strategy then I highly recommend you get SupCom/FA.			"

												Firstly I would like to say that this game is not all that bad when compared to the other RTS games out there at the moment, however for the fans of Sup Com and Forged Alliance this game is a great dissapointment. There are a great many changes and the entire game feels rushed and less smooth than the previous two, here are a few reasons why.The complex tech trees: Gone. You now start with one tier of unit and minimal choices. Some people prefer this over higher tier units smashing the lower tiers but its simply a lazy option taken instead of actually balancing the different tiers.The choices between different commander upgrades: Gone. Research will give you all the upgrades there is no choice involved.The fine balance between extracters and power and the need to control enough deposits: Gone. Pump out those generic one tier generators and you will recieve far more mass from them than deposits. There is nothing to be gained by pushing out to control a majority of the map simply turtle it out behind your shields (we'll get to those in a moment) and stock up on units/arty/nukesThe careful construction of defences and shields for maximum overlap protection: Gone. Spam those shields as close as possible and you can hold off the world. There are some small differences between the different races shields but they all can still all build as many as they want without even thinking about an efficent base design.The unique racial differences and strengths and weaknesses: Gone. First designer ""hey guys are we going to make the units and structures have different statistics like the first game and have counter intelligence options for complex game strategy?"" Design lead ""nah screw that it sounds complicated, make all the shields and other structures have identical stats and get rid of the other stuff"". Very dissapointing since the units from the first game were so unique but now there is no difference in choosing one faction from another.The detailed textures and environments that made it a great looking game: Gone. Its extremely unusual for a series to have a large gap between a game and its sequal and to not improve the graphical quality, this bucks the trend and goes backwards.Well organised unit co-ordination, grouping and movement: Gone. Walking into each other, spinning on one spot trying to collect something right beneath themselves and refusing to move are now the norms.There are more but to be honest I've got to go purge this game from my memory by playing Forged Alliance so this will have to do.

												As a stand-alone game it is amazing. But compared to the previous to Supreme Commander games this is a major step down. Remember how there were huge tech trees? such as the tier one factory can upgrade to the teir two which unlocked more units, well thats all gone. Instead now you build a research station which slowly gains research points which you use to upgrade your units not unlock new ones. Remember how you could choose a commander to start the game with? well now it is story based so you have to play the commanders in order (UEF, AEON the Cybran). Explosions are amazingly downgraded aswell. Remember the satisfaction of destroying a commander and watching a huge nuclear blast spread and destroy their base? Well now the commander explodes in a small blast and and all the oppents units die at once. Also all of the experimental units are extremely nerfed remember the AEON saucer? now it is smaller and much weaker, send 7 intercepters at it and it's gone. The Cybran spider bot has been turned into a crappy little beetle bot which are so easy to defeat they're in the first mission. All shields are the same size now (small, unless your counting huge UEF shield in the DLC) and instead of them all blocking shots the Aeon and Cybran shields let 15% of shots through! and now all shields look the same aswell. But the most annoying thing, the most annoying thing of them all is that everything you build counts as a unit. No more unlimited turrent defences, no unlimited shield protection and no more complex base defences. If you're reading this review before buying the previous games then buy this game first or dont buy it at all			"

												It's not uncommon for a sequal to be overshadowed by the original game, such is the case here.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good RTS and worth playing... but you are probably better off sticking with the original.  It has lost it's epic scale. 4/5			"

												I don't really like leaving negative reviews but this is one of those rare occasions where I really regret buying a game. The first Supreme Commander was perfect, an absolutely brilliant game and so was Total Annihilation before that. But Supreme Commander 2 just doesn't cut it. The game feels unfinished. There are only a few units and buildings per faction with no tech tiers or special functions. Graphically it is not as good as the previous game and the rehaul on the factions unit styles is just simply strange... like the cybran giant fire-breathing lizard with robotic limbs.The maps are tiny and the lack of units literally means the only strategy available is to hurl a constant wave of bots at the enemy. The campaign is also lacking. They've attempted to add more of a back story through a series of overly cheesy and annoying cutscenes and comms dialogue. You don't get the epic sense of scale that was previously seen in the first Supereme Commander.All-in-all, if your hoping for a newer version of Supreme Commander 1, I'm sorry but it's not this.			"

												A lot of people say that this game is too simplistic, and I admit that compared to the first Supreme Commander it is far less complex; however, Supreme Commander 2 does offer a streamlined entrance into the RTS genre for new players or a relaxing and explosive experience for veterans. Overall, this game probably isn't for the high-skill, intense matches that come from other RTS titles like StarCraft 2, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun in its own right. I would heartily recommend this for anyone looking for something easy to get into and fun to play, especially if you've got friends to play it with.			"

												This is my personal favorite RTS.  It definitely has a more intense feel than other similiar RTS games, such as SupCom 1 and Total Annhilation.  The overal strategy is a little smaller in scale, but this leads to faster battles that are more fun to watch.  It's still far more of a macro game than something like Starcraft, but it's one where you can still watch the units vs being zoomed out the entire time like it's predecesor.  It's campaign is plenty fun and playing on hard can be a good intro to skirmish matches.  In additon to traditional multiplayer matches, co-op vs the ai is very fun and challenging as well.  I also highly recommend the DLC, it adds many new units and research options.			"

												I grew up playing Total Annihilation back in 1998 and i still find myself still hopping back on every now and then. Supreme Commander 1 was a true successor to my beloved TA, and it still is. I found a new love. A year or 2 later, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance came out, which in my opinion is the definitive edition. The scale of Supreme Commander 1 is grand. I'm a huge RTS fan and supreme commander 1 has to by my number 1 favorite RTS game of all time, aside from its predecessor Total Annihilation of course. These 2 games have taken away a good portion of my life.Now on to Supreme Commander 2..... ummmm..... I'm heartbroken. I've forced myself to play it a few times but i honestly just cant take it. Its horrible. SupCom2 does not have the same gameplay as SupCom1. The scale of SupCom 2 is too dumbed down. There is no sense of grand scale in this game. The maps are unsatisfyingly too small. The unit cap is also extremely low. And the unit designs are crap. This game is just sad and ruins the Supreme Commander nameFor those of you who have never played SupCom1, then you might think that this is a good/decent game. I dont blame you.As a fan of Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, please hear me out...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! (I mean you can if you want. I'll just pity you). Go Purchase SUPREME COMMANDER: FORGED ALLIANCE!			"

												I'm very surprised at the amount of negative reviews. Ive played all versions for years (way over 100 hours each one) and they all are great. My favorite one to play *is* SC 2 because the experimental units dont take an age to build like in SC 1 and they are not godlike as they are in SC 1 (they can be beaten with enough normal units). There has been a lot of attention tot balanced yet diverse units within the factions. There are innovative units like the BFG Big Friendly Gun to convert enemy units to friendly and the grinder magnet thats very effective. Units dont get locked up bumping into each other when moving in big groups and scenery is awesome. So I think there is lot of advancement to SC2 and a must for the fan of the series.			"

												Edit 3: Unskippable credits...screw youEdit 2: Final mission bugged out for me. Just didn't progress and got stuck in ""cutscene""...yay. RESTART! ♥♥♥♥ this. How about a quicksave feature? No? Grrrrrr.Edit: It's not a bad RTS, just a bad Supreme Commander in my opinion. If you like good RTS games, buy this, if you want Total Annihilation, buy Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.I'm sad to see this series go down the drain...They've pretty much replaced everything that made Total Annihilation and later on Sup Com a unique experience with boring run of the mill gameplay. Let's go into detail:- The campaign: Again 6 missions for the 3 factions, following 1 storyline, which is basically good, since Sup Coms campaign mode just had 3 different endings for the same war. The animation quality of the cutscenes is, however, somehow worse than in Sup Com 1 or FA. The missions, so far, are extremely bland. I've completed 5 of the 6 UEF missions and I'm barely 2 hours in the game. In Sup Com 1 it took me that long to even beat the first 1 or 2 missions, since the battlefield would constantly be expanding after achieving your objectives (which could screw you over big time). This time around, the first mission takes 10 minutes...I♥♥♥♥♥♥you knot. Mission 5 was 25 minutes and I chilled. All the epic from epic battles has been siphoned straight out of this campaign. I'm sure this is not such an issue in MP, but I don't know how big those maps are.- The economy: They've ♥♥♥♥ing ""revamped"" the economy system...or rather they've dumbed it down...what made TA and Sup Com 1 so unique WAS their economy system. You had income and spending. If you spent more than you earned, you would slowly lose accumulated resources, until you hit rock bottom and your economy would tank. Things would still be completed, just slower. That was good. Wanna build a ♥♥♥♥ing mega artillery with 10 builders? Be prepared to have unlimited resources or face the consequences. On the other hand, you had a clear build path, and once your economy got going, say hello to mass production...you know, how it should be...in a damn war. In Sup Com 2 you instead gather resources automatically, but you can only spend those you actually HAVE. Like in Starcraft for example. Hey, this building or unit costs 1000 mass and 2000 energy, better wait till you've accumulated that before anyone starts building...♥♥♥♥ this.- Builders and plants: In Sup Com 1 you could assign several builders for 1 building, thus speeding up construction time if you had a good economy. Now only 1 builder may build at a time. At least you can still have them support the unit plants...for no additional cost by the way. Mass producing units also doesn't seem viable anymore since, at least in the early campaign missions, it's impossible to produce enough to actually create a massive army of 400 or so units...- Buildings: The number of buildings has been substantially reduced. Right now I have access to a mass extractor, an energy collector a research facility, land, air and naval base, a radar station, a sonar station, a shield generator and 2 defensive structures for land and air...yay. That is the amount of buildings Sup Com 1 had as Tier ONE. The tier system is gone by the way. Just build 1 construction plant and it can build everything.- Units: Same as buildings. There are only about 5 land units, 3 air units, 3 naval units and experimentals, which are for the most part rather ""meh"". Building an experimental in Sup Com 1 was a serious commitment and its loss was a devastating blow. On the other hand, these ♥♥♥♥ers could almost eradicate entire armies or bases on their own if the enemy did not have a valid counter. Remember the spider bots? Oh man...the megaliths the Cybrans have now are just a sorry excuse. The UED Fatboy II is a lot weaker than the original Fatboy, has no shields, no hit points and can't produce anyunits. What happened? Did they just forget how to build the good stuff after 25 years of peace? The UEF King on the other hand is a fun experimental...way too strong. Where is the balance here? I think it's good to diversify the factions more, but you shouldn't do so at the expense of complexity. Where are my patrolling air scouts? Where are my almost impossible to hit interceptors? Where are my T3 missile turrets? Where are my nuclear power plants? Where are my BRICKS!? Where are my almost indestructible warships? And my heavy gunships? Why do my air units hover in the air when they're not engaging enemies? And why are they swarming in a 1 by 1 area around each other when they are fighting? And why are they only flying at 10 meters above ground? Why don't they have to resupply anymore? That was cool!Interface: It's cleaner, but also more generic and sorely lacking tool tips. What does a Poseidon battleship do? No idea. What's the range? Does it have AA? Does it have torpedoes? Apparently yes, but the game doesn't tell you. There are less options here and I don't like it all that much.Research: Instead of building up your base, you now continously earn research points with which to unlock new buildings and units, improve your existing units (with personal shields or more damage for example), reduce build times or improve your ACU. A shallow system you have to deal with in every mission and match from the very beginning again. You building the biggest experimental units now just takes about 15 minutes maybe.Combat: This is actually the best part about the game. Units move effortlessly and don't get in the way of each other. No excessive ""rat's tails"" as far as I can tell. Animations and ordinance looks good. It's fun to watch...BUT!Graphics: What the ♥♥♥♥ were they smoking? They've replaced the somewhat gritty graphics from Sup Com 1, which were a nod to Total Annihilation, with some sort of cartoony mess. The UEF forces are bright blue and yellow with VERY little detail on them (apart from weapons fire, which looks great). They look like LEGOs for ♥♥♥♥s sake. The Cybrans are this yellow smudge of vomit, instead of the imposing black and red with the circuits on the ground, the GAAT gun laser towers, etc. It's a disgrace really. Supreme Commander Dostya would not approve...and neither do I.Oh Sup Com 2, what you could have been...if you want to experience this 90s era gameplay, play Sup Com: FA (it's a lot better than the base game and most mechanics actually work). And then play Total Annihilation and rejoice!DOSTYA OUT!!!			"

												I loved everything about this game. Its pretty easy for a new guy to come in a pick up the basics quickly. But its also complex enough for the veterans to spend a lot of time on different battle plans. The only thing I didn't like is that when your playing and you get close to the unit cap the game starts to slow down a lot. But this is far from a deal breaker. If you are looking for a simple to pick up but complex enough to keep you going RTS, look no farther.			"

												My god, this is such a downgrade from Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. There are probably a 4th of the units, the maps are all very small, the ranges of artiliery and radar are tiny, you can't have more than one engineer work on something at once, and the units move slowly. They implemented this stupid research system and got rid of the Tech system (Tech 1, 2, 3 and experimental) from SupCom and FA. You can't upgrade mass extractors or build different power generators, they ""rank up"" by simply generating more resources. There are only like 3 or 4 types of aircraft per faction. There are a lot of ground units, but not as many as SupCom FA,  and they aren't as fun.I absolutely do not reccomend this game to anyone, especially if you haven't played Supreme Commander or Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. I reccomend Supreme Commander: Forged alliance if you want to get any SupCom. FA even has a community mod launcher for even more fun.  Oh, also, this game doesn't support mods like the others did.SupCom 2 (This game): 2/10.SupCom: FA (The older game): 9/10.			"

												This game is one of the best RTS's i have played and i have played many. Much like other RTS's there are some kind of ""TechUpgrades"" But with this RTS there is a huge tech tree that consists of; Land, Air, Navel, ACU (Armoured command Unit) and structure upgrades. This allows you to upgrade and spec out your millatry, to out gun, out whit and out manouver your oppent's army. Also with the structure upgrades you can add anti-aircraft guns to the building ,even; Shields ,missile launchers and intel gathers (radar). All units are upgradeable and have different abilities. There is range of different building and units avalable to each different faction that consists of 3 factions. Each faction has there own different abilties, units, buildings and upgrades! I recomend any RTS lover to buy this. For an old game it runs great and any one can play!			"

They're a hell of a lot smaller-No Seraphim-No extra faction to replace the Seraphim from FA-Cheaper than FA, this might be a good point until you realise they only put the price down because it's worse-Game forces you to complete tutorial despite having played FA & SC1 for about a hundred hours-The graphics are better but the buildings themselves are now very ugly-The maps are smaller than FA-DLC-UI is smaller but very boring and a bit less informative-Does have official mutliplayer but it's smaller and less funBut the most important thing is that compared to Forged Alliance, this game is so dull and lifeless and completely lacks any character whatsoever.

												As a stand alone strategy game it isn't bad. It's not great, and it's kind of bland, and the story is extremely lackluster, but it isn't awful. That said in comparison to the game it's supposed to be a sequel to (Supreme Commander Forged Alliance) it's absolute garbage. My recommendation is that if you want a GOOD strategy game then don't spend your money on this. Buy Supreme Commander Forged Alliance, bask in how it is a superior game in basically all ways, and deny that SupCom2 was ever made.TLDR- Not a bad game as a stand alone, absolutely terrible game when put up in comparison to the game it's supposed to be the sequel to.

A bit about the game and developers.Supreme Commander 2 is a great robotic strategy game developed by Gas Powered Games and published by Square Enix.Gas Powered Games are also developers of Demigod, original Supreme Commander and so on and on, while Square Enix is a publisher of many published games like Tomb Raider, Hitman, Sleeping Dogs and others.About Gameplay.Supreme Commander 2 is a strategy game with three different factions. Each faction has its own units. Each Faction has its own bonuses. UEF have strongest unites, most expensive units and units with most HP. Cybran Nation are the weakest but the least expensive. They take the least amount of time to construct and are always largest in numbers. Aeon Illuminate are the most balanced units. Their HP and attack strength fits perfectly with the price of the unit and the construction time. There's one more faction in this game, but since it's unplayable I don't think they are too important.The game has both single player and multiplayer mode. In single player your objective is, of course, to save the world. The story is pretty good but nothing too special. The awesome thing about this game is the multiplayer. Since the game is about 2-3 years old the servers are very empty. And those that have players are usually professionals and games with them lasts about five to ten minutes. There's tones of strategies you can do to win this game. I played a lot of skirmish games to learn a lot about this game.To be able to play this game correctly you need to  learn fast. Because even AI is so smart that it can win against you on normal difficulty. It will attack you from all possible directions: water, air and land. It will attack in small waves while slowly building a huge wave of army. The AI is amazing.It has three different resources. Mass, Energy and Research. You can set up research facilities and energy builders where ever you want, but you can only place Mass on a designed area. Players can fight against each other to be able to own the Mass builders that they need.You need Mass and Energy to be able to build new units and structures, while you need research points to be able to research for new units, more HP or new building that will help you with who knows what. You need to make sure to always have enough of each, but you also need to make sure that you're able to make a big amount of units since this game is all about large scale wars.As mentioned before, this game is all about large scale wars.  In my opinion best tactic is to play with two friends. One person focuses on land units, second on water and third on air. That way you can have biggest army numbers due to smallest cost of units. There are two main game types, annihilation and score points. In annihilation your objective is to kill enemy commanders while in score points your objective is to gather as main points as you can by taking over couple of big towers.Graphic and AudioGraphic is great! Lasers and rockets everywhere, blown up robots, massive explosions. It's very well made. Details on the units are also extremely nice! Songs are very quiet and calming, but for the most of the time you're so focused on the action and all the lasers that you barely even hear it.Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Wonderful graphic.- Amazingly fun skirmish.- Huge scale battles.- Very fun if you have a friend or two to play against the AI.Cons:- No players so there are barely any multiplayer games.Overall grade: 7/10Extra info: If you're big mech fan as I am, and if you love strategy games, this game is for you. It doesn't involve much thinking, but it's extremely fun to play. Though, don't count on Gundam units to be in this game. Sadly there are no units looking like Gundam ones, hehe.Thank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you![/b] "

												As a fan of the original Total Annihilation series I liked what the old Cave Dog group did, Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance were good enough, but Sup Com 2 does not do the franchise justice at all. It is a very dumbed down version which replaces many of the original’s mechanics with research grinding rather then building up bases and getting more advanced units. Basic units are just that, basic they are very boring and very small versus the levels and other units, while you can upgrade them with various research items to make them more effective it does a very poor job at replacing the 3+1 unit tier levels from the previous games. With this game now more then ever you rely heavily on the experimental units rather then building up a force of mixed units of various tiers with maybe one or two X units in the mix.The main campaign does a good enough job at some kind of a story and MOST of the missions are gradual in their difficulty and challenge. However that difficulty spikes abnormally high when you reach the final 4 to 6 missions of the Cybran and you will fail multiple times before you figure out what the developers wanted you to do. The skirmish AI and the AI in general tends to cheat and does so pretty obviously, getting clear stat, research speed, mass and energy boasts right off the bat, even on normal difficulty, which is a shame because I always enjoyed the TA/SC skirmish games. I had shied away from buying this game when it came out after hearing reviews that it was a very basic and stripped version designed for mostly console play so I avoided it until 2013’s Christmas sale. I am glad I did because as much as I really wanted enjoy this game and get just as much play out of it as I did with Sup Com/FA and Total Annihilation it would seem that that is not the case. This will be one of the few games that I have purchased that will not last long on my hard drive, possibly to make room for something more worth while.If you really want to continue to the story of Sup Com and FA, then by all means buy it when it’s on sale again, but do NOT buy this if you were a fan of TA or SC/FA. This honestly makes me worry about what Planetary Annihilation will be like which I hope will not be the case.			"

												Before jumping into Planetary Annihilation, I wanted to check out what I missed ever since the days of Total Annihilation. It turns out Supreme Commander 2 does not disappoint! The campaign storyline may be cliched and a childish deviance from the original struggle between the Arm and the Core, but the overall mechanics, faction and RTS design are brilliant. In true TA tradition units are completely expendable, battles are aesthetically spectacular, and macromanagement is the backbone of gameplay. It's an excellent, constrasting alternative to Starcraft.			"

												Many say this game is a step backwards for the Supreme Commander franchise, but that is not true at all. The game is just a lot less complicated and sure, there are less units, but since when do we rank games ONLY by the number of things you can do? There are also many other positive things. Here are a few examples:- Gameplay is a lot smoother than the first games and the pathfinding system works faster- The economy is a lot easier to understand and get used to- Very balanced factions- Better looking HUD "

												This is a very playable and beautiful game, but unlike it's predecessor, it lacks creativity, is oversimplified and lacks depth and has such a WAAK storyline. It does lack the finesse of Supremme Commander 1 and Forged Allaince which I think are the bees knees...Whats more, I dont think that the people who developed it balanced the units particularly well, specifically the experimentals, I have no idewa why anyone would prefer to use a 'chicken egg' aeon unit as oppose to an Anomium (however u spell the AA exp)or UC  because it is rubbish, whats more the megalith aint that great either.  And then, why give the Aeon the AA exp (which can be taken down by 10-15  gunships) and give cybran the soul ripper, which is quite powerful (air unit) and give the UEF the terror exp thingy and no aa unit, I just think, as I read about Watch dogs earlier, that this dev crew have cut and pasted and not thought too much about what they were doing... (supcom 1 avoided this by making 3 tech levels which when paired with sheilds all races ahd would give each exp a very good run for it's money in defence, let alone the asfs, to the regular t1 intcepeteors)... regardless, I am not quite convinced that they did a great job of this, I admit perhaps i should throw each of them up against each other in a few skirmishes.Economy wise, yes it's like any other standard industry modelled strategy game other than the original which really doesn't work well when making experiementals, i.e.unless you are have money coming out of all orifaces,  your smaller factories will keep hoarding the resources whilst the exp factories etc will sit there doing nothing.  Yes... maybe there is some skill and attetnion to be paid to this problem, but this just makes a simple game into one of those tedious complex games that the Dev's clearly wanted to avoid, when going back to the drawing board from Supcom 1 and they way supcom 1 handled it was far more elegeant!Now , the research.  Well it has been done before, and it doesn't feel right, for a start, it kills the pleasure of killing and killing and getting better - veterency.  making your commander and exps mortal and very lacking even when some noob throws rubbish units at u time after time (though the mass income normally makes that worth it).  And yes, creating more research centre makes it easier...  But, after all that, research centres are rendered useless after all research is complete,  making a practical investment in those centres very short sighted strategy wise. End point is , research in the long run feels pointless.I suppose the research tree does make it easier for noobs who can look over their options, although restrictive trees dont necessarily do this, but the idea of upgrading lots of things on units is fun! even the ACU upgrades have been done away with in favour of this tree, so there is no choice, it's the capitalist idea, get resources and buy everything, boring! :(Also , as this is a Square Enix game, just as you would find the same smell about a 2K game or a UBIsoft game, so you do so with the airy fairy Square ENIX... shame, so many games are gutted and strung up by these awful mass companies, they should just let the real professionals get on with it!TRololol, this is worth playing on a weekend off, but it doesn't have anywhere near the life of a good  game would and defintely no where near it's predicessor!

												So lets get started, I got this game, after having a good portion of my friends pester me to get it so I can enjoy a ""true rts experience"". That was an extreme understatement. What I got, for such a cheap price, was probably one of the best RTS games I will ever have played. So let me tell you about some of my first experiences within this game. I downloaded it and immediatly hopped into the campeign and what I had recieved was some of the best 40 hours of gameplay ive ever had. after. After finishing the campeign I went into a multiplayer match. I was winning against the Cybran. Uppon blowing up most of his base with a few nukes, little did I know there was a fleet of boats that evolved to grow legs, and destroyed my flank. Overall, its a 9/10 game, if it had maybe some more units, such as the implementation of some from supcom 1, like in the revamp mod, that would make it a 10/10 for me.			"

												A good strategy game for beginner-intermidiate players. The futuristic campaign is not bad for a RTS, and offers a good challenge on harder difficulties. The three factions do not vary much in strategy in the early game though their mid to late tier units offer unique game changing opportunities from the brutal to the subtle. Thanks to a simple but effective interface, the game is also easy to play.  Skirmish/Multiplayer is a profound improvement to its Xbox 360 counterpart, having good pre-game options and a variety of maps and 4v4 compatibility (though the game's speed will definitely suffer with 5+ players). AI difficulty is reasonably balanced with customizable strategies for them to use. Internet connectivity in PvP multiplayer is typically not a problem either.Unlike its predecessor, Supreme Commander 2 is less complicated and therefore game sessions are typically quicker though long, protracted battles are still possible with the huge 500 unit cap and available rush timers. More experienced players may become bored by the lack of diversity in strategies that limits replayability, as many battles (especially against AI) hinge on simply building a ton of one super unit or another. The DLC adds some interesting units and buildings though.Overall a good value for a RTS fan or newbie looking to try somethings new, but not the most robust experience out there.			"

												Did you like Supreme commander, building your base, getting a massive army ready to go face to face with the enemy, or just turtle up and use heavy long-range artillery and nukes to destroy your enemy? Me 2, but lets face it, supreme commander was a game that required at least 2-6 hours of time for just one game. (Simply MASSIVE maps in SC1)Supreme commander 2 does what supreme commander did, but in a better way, with more fast paced action, without compromising the base building, and turtle tactic, making a quick skirmish a possibility in Supreme commander 2, where it simply wasn't in the prequel. Sadly this game is not so active anymore online, but if you've got a few strategy loving friends on your list, you could most likely pick this up for a bargain on sale, and have a blast.			"

												Did you like Supreme Commander (and Total Annihilation)?Then there is nothing for you here. They patched out *some* of the Starcraftisms since the demo, but it's still faster, smaller, and shallower, with tons of weird regressions. Experimentals aren't, unit variety is slashed, nukes are like hand grenades, there are interface regressions everywhere.Oh, and this is just multiplayer. We thought some variety might at least be enough of a welcome novelty from FA games to overlook its flaws, but it just isn't. The singleplayer, meanwhile, is absolutely godawful, with writing that would embarrass a direct-to-TV disaster movie.It doesn't matter how cheap it is in a sale, this isn't of the TA lineage in any meaningful way, and Squeenix do not deserve your wallet change for ripping the heart out of the game and feeding it to the Zerg.

												Genre - Sci-Fi RTSI only played this game recently after tying out Planetary Annihilation but finding it too complex for quick games, and I found this game similar in some respects but a lot more accessible. I have played several skirmish games, co-op and 6 missions of the main campaign. You have Land, Naval and Air units to build and research upgrades for. There are three major factions to choose from that are diverse but balanced in most aspects. You need to build up fairly quick and get mixed units to be effective. You fight in a Giant Mech that once destroyed loses you the game. The units are varied enough and the game is enjoyable in quick bursts.It seems to me to be the natural follow up to Total Annihilation, an old RTS game that received a lot of praise back in my day.  It is the first decent RTS I have played since Starcraft 2. Don't get me wrong with the comparison at the start though, Planetary Annihilation is also fun but when you are fighting across planets and using orbital platforms it gets very confusing, very fast. However, once you have graduated Supreme Commander 2 school and want more of a challenge, I would try that next. As for me I am happy being a Supreme Commander.			"

But when they dont want to take time, then i cant to anything about it.In this game are NO Ranks. The Multiplayer is sometimes really... meh.When 1 person lags, the other are lagging too.Aswell.. not many players play multiplayer and many just go for nukes what is then .. yeah...Well ... of to that.Story is .. well .. okay..Wouldnt say long, but its okay.I mostly play against KI and the KI is well made.I dont have many words about it, because its just a good game with nice graphics and not to much to say about it.If you like strategy, get it.

In comparison to SupCom 1 and FA, I can't really relate it because I've hardly played those, but if i had to choose between this and its spiritual successor, Planetary Annihilation, I would choose this solely because of its smooth play experience.

												First PC RTS game I played and I fell in love with it. Great game, lots of replay value, and even more fun to play with friends. Most people would say that its not as good as SC1, or SC:FA, but to me its like a faster version that is much easier to learn if you've never played a RTS before.  10/10 Great game.			"

												Significantly downgraded from the first Supreme Commander, number 2 nevertheless has a great story. But no matter how great the story, the gameplay has been drastically reduced. There was nothing like rolling over your enemy with hundreds of tanks or blasting them to oblivion with hundreds of bombers. Now that is impossible. A severe poulation limit reduction and minimal unit variation creates a rather sucky knock off of the first game. The number of different units have been much reduced. Basic tanks. Basic Walkers. Basic flyers. Worse still, Mega Units have been dummed down to be nothing less then weak. They no longer strike fear into the hearts of your enemies, but are merely a nuisance.I heard the developer wanted us to feel closer to the characters. I hate them all. Supreme Commander Forged Alliance however: I was genuinly angry when Dostia died. Buy this game if its on sale (99p). Otherwise, don't waste the 3 hours it takes to beat it. Go for Forged Alliance if you want the next step in the story.			"

												The graphics may look slightly dated at first glance, but this is a complex and rewarding RTS.PROS:+ The graphics really aren't that bad. It has a good level of detail when zoomed in.+ Fast, addicting strategy gameplay.+ Collection of simple systems come together to make a deep game.+ Land, Air and Naval units, as well as Structures such as Nuclear Silo, Energy Sheilds, Turrets, Artillery and more.+ Giant walker robots of death and flying saucers.+ Unique factions with each advantages and disadvantages.+ Campain makes a great introduction to each faction and gameplay mechanics and strategies.+ Multiple options for micro-managing unit movement, attack modes, etc.+ Fairly swift load times.CONS:- Cheesy campain dialogue.UNKOWNS:? I don't know what the online skirmish community is like.LE VERDICT:$ If you are an RTS or strategy fan, this IS your game. A staple of the genre. 8.7/10.1			"

Extremly easy to manage Economy, Deleted technology levels and added trees, COMPLETLY deleted Aeon Naval forces giving them amfibia for exchange. All of this only for better graphic. This is good game, but Worthless Supreme Commander. Yes i have DLC because friends told me to buy and should be funnier. Nope, it's not. If you're searching for some good but not too big rts, go ahead and buy it. If you're searching for good SupCom you're in wrong place :C			"

												Despite the rating I gave, its not a bad game, just a bad Supreme Commander. Go buy Forged Alliance.

												I am a huge strategy buff, and let me tell you, I have had a hard time finding a game that aces the RTS feel like SC2. I have nearly 500 hours in the game and have been playing it for what feels like forever. Especially when you combine the origonal in-game content with the DLC (I think its like $5 or something, theres no reason not to get it), you have such a fantastic range of buildings and units, affording you so much in the way of letting you pick your strategy.The maps are fun and interesting, if maybe a little static, and a few really push you into a specific, predictable strategy, but every RTS game ive ever played has those. The factions are very nice as well, each having the ability to suit multiple different play-styles, but they do certainly favor certain play styles. For instance, UEF favors highly armored, slow moving but hard hitting units, whereas the Cybran favors a huge mass of highly mobile assault bots, but can also bring some impressive gargantuans into play. The Illuminate favor a heavy tech tree, improving their units with research, as well as having some intense buildings and upgrades that can make them a force to be recconed with late game.The game was pretty intense for its time, but I feel that hardware has definatly caught up to the software SC2 is running. I have a GTX 1060 with 3 internal GB, with 16 external sticks to back it up, and I can run everything on max even late game.Now, my primary complaint with SC2 is that it has what I feel doesnt offer the HUGE, MASSIVE armies, capping players at 500 units, to include buildings as well as units. Most typically, I feel that it really doesnt bother me most times unless its very late game, or I am playing Cybran. If the game had a feature that allowed me to modify the unit count, this game would be 10/10.TL;DR: SC2 is a fantastic RTS, killing alot of modern RTS games IMO. The mechanics are super solid and the game works really well. Awesome game.9.5/10			"

												I'm not the best RTS player in the world, but I've been playing them since the days of Dune 2. I always loved Total Annihilation, then the original SupCom.This is a bit different, the pre-build system isn't as versatile nor is the cost management. It does however prevent players from getting into the building hole of SupCom, with the negative in that some builders can stall permanently if resources are stolen before they can allocate for a build item.With the mods available for this, I can heartily recommend it as the community is still going this many years after the game was released. Great fun as a bot stomp with mates and some crazy custom AI or as a PvP competitive challenge. Just don't take it too seriously :)			"

												By itself, it's not such a terrible game.  It's kind of like starcraft with a strategic view, which is actually pretty cool.  But it is not what I would expect to follow a game like Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.  Many of the models and names of the units in the game are similar to the previous game, but the scale of SupCom 1 is completely lost and having an upgrade system is against the heart of how Supreme Commander 1 was interesting.  It makes me thing that they were trying to compete with the player base of starcraft instead of creating an actual second game in the line of Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander (Supreme Commander was touted by the devs as the 'spiritual successor' of Total Annihilation, and I consider the first one successful in that regard, but the second, not so much).

												This game is a great followup to one of the best RTS games ever made (absolutely no bias). To people who like Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, this game is recognizable to the previous game, but takes a number of liberties, which distinguish it from the original, but not nesesarily for the better. These changes include the removal of the Teir system in favor of a research tree (similar in a way to Civilization), the nerfing of Expirimental Units, and the removal of the resource-stream in favor of a more traditional stockpile system. These changes may rub the wrong way with diehard fans of the original (understandably), but they all work together to make a cohesive game, with nothing really feeling left out.  I do not think the game is really better than the first for this, but just different  . If anything is really better because of these changes, it is the accessability of the game.  The game is much more straitforward to understand for a newcomer  , and ends up forming a cohesive, understandable, and much more simple whole. The one thing about Supreme Commander 2 that really shines above the original, is it's simplicity.  "

												I honestly do not know why this game gets bad reviews as it does from some people. But i absolutely love it. Actually i like it better then Forged Alliance. While Forged Alliance did have some nice bonuses as to putting more then one engineer on a building process and some other things, This game is abit better and more organized in my opinion. In Forged Alliance, to build an Experimental you had to use 1-10 engineers to build it on a random plot of land. In SC2, you can make them from factories. I for one like that instead of random plots of land. Other things i am sad to see go were the Support Armored Command Units. They were very useful but i wont that ruin my gameplay fun!The research is a nice add on, limits and makes things more complicated and more advanced. Not to mention very very challenging. Forged alliance was easy once a good base was set up, in SC2, it keeps you active and on alert for a surprise attack.Another interesting challenge is defending against the Nukes! First time i played it, i was torn apart! But i eventually found a way to defend against 5-6 nukes every 3-5 mins. People also mention units move slow...Actually, they don't. They are 100% the same as Forged Alliance.Pros:- Good System of Units- New Land, Air and Naval Units- New Structures- New way to acquire Mass and Energy- Challenging- A cool research system that provides complexity- Keeps you on alert and not underestimating the AI- Interesting Campaign and Storyline- Good Multiplayer System- New and Cool Maps to play on- Better Graphics- Better Quality- Less Laggy then Forged Alliance when building huge hoards of unitsCons:- Some classic Units from Old games were removed (Not that it is important!)- Only one engineer per building instead of many that could build one building in Forged Alliance- No SACUs- Some Useless Units, but it doesn't affect the gameplay at all- A little to frequent in Nuke Launching by AI and the # of Nukes is abit to high per strike. (Can be defended if done correctly)So in conclusion, I would recommend the game to all my friends and surely say, it would be a great purchase and you will have tons of fun and will keep you active for a good time !

												I had great hopes for this game back when it was announced. It had big shoes to fill considering how excellent Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance was. However, everytime I play this game it makes me want to go back and play Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance (SC:FA) instead. Pros:-Some cool experimental units-Some good art design-The level design is engaging-Characters are more fleshed out compared to previous onesCons:-Everything has been dumbed down-Economy has completely changed from the SC exp: can't spend energy and mass at a deficit-Interface is worse than SC:FA-Gone are the grand battles involving 250+ units-Much smaller scale than SC:FA-Tier system is gone and replaced with research-Unit variety-Maps don't come close to the size of a 64x64 SC:FA map-Cybran ACU looks awfulGPG Changed most of what made the previous SC games so great. The complexity and scale are defining characteristics of the series. Lacking these characteristics, the game falls flat. If a Supcom 3 is ever made it needs to go back to Supcom 1 and FA for influence not Supcom 2. I don't recommend this game if you are a fan of SC: FA.IF you haven't played SC:FA you need to forget this game and get go get SC:FA			"

												Before i begin i have already owned this game on xbox before but because of steam sale i decided to get it on pc aswell and i have to say this why does this game get so much hate i understand that its waterd down as there got rid of complicated things or stuff that there thought there should update like changing the tech to research points but the game is still there. Anyway the main review i have played this game for a good 2 hours now (on pc) and its way better than the dimmed down console version the unit cap is 500 instead of 200 you can change the gamespeed there is more AI options and the dlc is amazing (i dont own the dlc but its better than the console versions free one with just maps)as you get more units maps and more. the story however isnt intressting in my opinion i just skipped to skirmish and online. speaking of skirmish it is great fun you set the AI map and options and begin a full blown war on your computer screen AMAZING. Lastly i will say this online is great you dont need anything stupid like a surver or passkey you just set up a game invite a friend and done. overall this is a good game and while the story isnt good and some of the things are waterd down from the last game i think rts fans should give this a go.

												I honestly do not know why this game gets bad reviews as it does from some people. But i absolutely love it. Actually i like it better then Forged Alliance. While Forged Alliance did have some nice bonuses as to putting more then one engineer on a building process and some other things, This game is abit better and more organized in my opinion. In Forged Alliance, to build an Experimental you had to use 1-10 engineers to build it on a random plot of land. In SC2, you can make them from factories. I for one like that instead of random plots of land. Other things i am sad to see go were the Support Armored Command Units. They were very useful but i wont that ruin my gameplay fun!The research is a nice add on, limits and makes things more complicated and more advanced. Not to mention very very challenging. Forged alliance was easy once a good base was set up, in SC2, it keeps you active and on alert for a surprise attack.Another interesting challenge is defending against the Nukes! First time i played it, i was torn apart! But i eventually found a way to defend against 5-6 nukes every 3-5 mins. People also mention units move slow...Actually, they don't. They are 100% the same as Forged Alliance.Pros:- Good System of Units- New Land, Air and Naval Units- New Structures- New way to acquire Mass and Energy- Challenging- A cool research system that provides complexity- Keeps you on alert and not underestimating the AI- Interesting Campaign and Storyline- Good Multiplayer System- New and Cool Maps to play on- Better Graphics- Better Quality- Less Laggy then Forged Alliance when building huge hoards of unitsCons:- Some classic Units from Old games were removed (Not that it is important!)- Only one engineer per building instead of many that could build one building in Forged Alliance- No SACUs- Some Useless Units, but it doesn't affect the gameplay at all- A little to frequent in Nuke Launching by AI and the # of Nukes is abit to high per strike. (Can be defended if done correctly)So in conclusion, I would recommend the game to all my friends and surely say, it would be a great purchase and you will have tons of fun and will keep you active for a good time !

												I was already planning on getting the game before it went on sale but the moment my friend told me it was less than four dollars I got the game and the DLC for it instantly. I already played it a lot on Console and wow what a leap in gameplay it makes on PC.Some people say that the game sucks, mainly when compared to the original. Sure it has some things cut back from the first instalment but to be fair nobody has hours upon hours to plan a date with their opponent even when the game is sped up. Here in Sup Cop 2 it is far easier for one to pick up and start playing and doesn't take a year to get anything built.To be honest there is no ""Better"" option between Sup Com 1 and 2. Both are really good games even for their age and both deserve some playtime. Sup Com 1 is more for people that have a thing for more in-depth RTSs and that have a lot of time on their hands where as Sup Com 2 is more for people that are either new to the genre or that want to have some ""quick"" skirmishes.The DLC is very much worth it for the new things that are added and the new assortment of maps (but it is not needed to enjoy the game) on top of massive map pool to begin with.Don't listen to the haters of Sup Com 2 simply because ""It's not as good as Sup Com 1."" because really it's subjective. Both are good in their own ways.The Campaign is alright, some cheesy classic bad guy stuff but it's tolerable and a good place to get the hang of the game.I enjoyed the crap out of it on Console way back when so even tho it says (at this point in time) that I only have 11 hours played, trust me that I have far more than that.

												The stars of the first Supreme Commander weren’t the massive experimental units, for the most part. There were three tiers of deathbots before you got to those, each five times more massive, devastating and expensive than the last. It was about building dozens of factories, and streaming out enough deathbots to dominate enough of the map to produce enough mass to afford the next tier up. Then: stream out more.On a 25 square kilometer map, that’s just a very satisfying, physically simulated version of a normal RTS. On a 6,561 square kilometer map, it’s an apocalypse. Your mind goes into overdrive trying to manage eighteen separate assault groups, balance and defend dozens of income sources while ramping up production to meet your snowballing wealth.But throughout it all, the game takes care of the boring stuff for you: units defend themselves intelligently while moving, they organise themselves in optimal formations and stay in them come hell or high water.

												I have never tried the original Supreme commander so I won´t compare them.SC2 puts you in charge of a robot army. Produce and use your both small, medium and big bots to conquer the map and defeat your enemies. With very beutiful looking maps and huge unit caps, you can send entire armies of bots to destroy each other. And I promise you that if you see a big bot coming towards you, an even bigger is around the corner.			"

												Supreme Commander 2 is a Real Time Strategy game, where you build bases, collect resources and make an army, to destroy the enemy base.""How much more complicated could that be?"", you may ask.Well, if you think that you will easily win by having more tanks and more power than your enemy, you might be right,at times however.I enjoyed this game because it was quick and simple to learn.I also enjoy how beautiful this game CAN look.At times I found that some things were abit clunky or cartoonish.Nonetheless, this game is great.The single player campaign does not have the best story, if I am honest, but the skirmish and online gameplay are quite fun.If I had to compare it to the first game, I would say these comparisons:Better:-The graphics-The game is smooth-Resource collection and economy spending makes more sense-The idea of researching makes it easier-Seeing so many things happening at the same time is quite astonishingWorse:-There seems to be less units and buildings because there aren't 3 Tech levels anymore-The maps are much smaller now-Although you can still build massive armies, you seem to be limited to building 500 units AND buildings. How a buildingcounts as a unit, I will never know.Supreme Commander 2 is a good game, which have about the same aspects as the first game.Where there are pros, there are cons that weigh it out which leave it at a slightly neutral stand.

												In short - a more casual version of SupCom 1. Easier to play, but there's much less to enjoy. Good for casual occasional games with friends. Ultimately, it fails as a Supreme Commander's successor, but stands well as a standalone game.Although Supreme Commander 1 was meant to be /the/ strategy game, with large maps and huge unit caps, where build orders gave place to thought-out tactics, it ultimately ended up being a base-building simulator, as people grew to refer to it. Supreme Commander 2 trades the large scales for a tighter gameplay, shifting focus from the base to the units.The units are fewer in variety, each having a distinct role. There is much less fiddling with assembling a perfect mix of the hundreds of different bots, tanks, and airplanes. Choosing your tactics is now more clearly resembling rock-paper-scissors, which is both good and bad, depending on the player.Also, there are only either big badass mother♥♥♥♥ing guns, or cannon fodder. You don't build a tactical missile launcher to fend off your enemies. It's either a small artillery installation, or a nuke. Same with units vs. experimentals.But wait, speaking of experimental units, it's not as black and white. As before, they are pretty much useless alone when facing a critical mass of smaller units. Perhaps even more so than in SupCom 1, you will want to provide escorts to your big guys. Here, they are easier to build and to destroy, but having one early enough can still mean a victory.There is a new resource - Research - gained through battle and boosted by research stations. Tech tiers gave way to global upgrades (purchased with research points) that are applied to all units, buildings, or else - existing and future. This serves to speed up the game, though it takes away from the complexity. Whereas in SupCom 1 destroying an upgraded outpost with tech 3 factories was a big hit, here it doesn't take much to rebuild it. Experiments units are also unlocked with research.Instead of choosing between spending resources on improving your economy/units and building more units, you just do both simultaneously, while spending any excessive mass/energy you have on research stations.Speaking of resources, here you don't get to build mass/energy storages - they are unlimited. Instead of draining your money during construction, the cost is deduced at the beginning of the process. Finally, there are no mass fabricators, and I have never seen someone have a problem with energy, for the reactors are very cheap and effective.There is not much to say of the base. Just as unites, the buildings are also fewer. At the beginning of the game, you are presented with a choice of 8 ""normal"" structures and one ""advanced"" - the radar. As you research the upgrades for the structures, you unlock things like artillery, nukes, and others.Engineers now cannot assist each other when building structures (they can, however, assist factories).Everything is built much faster in comparison to SupCom 1 (where 30-minute build times weren't extraordinary, though improved in FA) - you won't find an experimental who takes much more than 3 minutes to build.I haven't completed the story, but from what I played it wasn't incredibly interesting. Perhaps as a tool for honing your skills, it would do.The visual style of the game is nice - it is also simplified, as if to underline the idea the developers had in mind. Similar to Planetary Annihilation - almost a bit cartoonish. Although now outdated and no eye candy at all, it is still pleasant to look at while playing.I would recommend this game to people who want to play a SupCom-esque game with friends, but don't want to take the days to teach them how to play it. It's simple, bright, fun, and fast. There is not much depth to it, but the gameplay is satisfying and victories sweet.Personally, I couldn't stand to play it for more than a few hours a month, as I kept switching to Supreme Commander 1. And if you want a fun match with friends, I would recommend Starcraft 2 over this.			"

												Basicly a dumbed down version of the original. Interestingly though, it has become a different flavour of the same thing, but they both taste equally good.The game is simple and that makes it interesting, everything is flat and rather straightforward but it works.It suffers from all the flaws the original has. Poor AI, when you can get experimentals .. spam the crap out of them, missions that are only difficult (if at all) for the first 10-ish minutes, etc. However the game plays quite nicelly, it has cheating AI's in skirmish/MP and because of the 'flatness' you do not have to reserve 2+ hours to take down a cheating AI in skirmish or do a single campaign mission. Compared to the original, with 5 (or 6?) mission, it actually has 15 though. That does offer some more variaty in the missions but the overall time you spend on the campaign wont be much longer than you spend doing the campaign in the original.			"

												das Spiel ist besser wie Supreme Commander 1 und Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.Das Ressourcensystem des Spiels wurde überarbeitet und vereinfacht.Ich finde es besser, weil die Spielmechanik deutlich einfacher ist z.B. man muss sich nicht mehr mit Tech 1 Tech 2 und Tech 3 auseinandersetzen. Diese Einstellung haben die entwickler gelöst, in dem sie ein Forschungssystem eingebaut haben, wo man sich mit Forschungspunkten die Gebäude frei kaufen kann.

												Ah, Supreme Commander 2. I bought this game first on the Xbox 360, loved it. One of my favorite strategy games. My favorite strategy is turteling and my favorite side is UEF, but I really enjoy Cybran. I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games.			"

												Best RTS of all time.The gameplay is addictive, and with a few friends you can unlock the full potential of Skirmish mode.The singleplayer story overall is alright, its short, but offers a sort of background on why the 3 factions are warring. Doesn't take much time to play through but is fun, none the less.The multiplayer is where the gameplay really shines through, there's nothing like having a massive land/nuclear war on Seton's Clutch (map). The interface is simple and easy to get into, overall the game is really simple yet you can spin the gameplay in some many different ways it provides hours and hours of fun. If your really into the game, then thats where the benefits of a modding community come in.My only real complaint is, about the way the addition of mods is so limited. The mods they have out there are amazing, only if it was simpler through say.... the steam workshop to get them. I think this game would still be played by even more people if the game had a larger mod community. But the game does have some great mods that expand the gameplay a ton! If you get this game I reccomend: Supreme Commander 2 0 1 3Revamp Mod For SC2and there are quite a few map packs out there as well. All in all one of my favorite games of all time. Just because of how much variation you can get in gameplay with friends.			"

												This game has been one my favorite PC games of all time. Whenever im bored or stressed out I always play SupCom2. I have over 500 hours in the game and going for the magic number 1000The gameplay is a lot of fun and it requries careful observation of what your doing but also be able to adapt to your opponents strategy. Unlike other strategy games SupCom2 goes fast. I mean FAST you dont pay attention and you will see yourself having 10000 mass and weak units. A good knowledge of the tech tree and game mechanics is a must.Single player is good for begineers to get their hand on all factions and learn basic mechanics of the game. but the story is a little dry. You'll find you will be spending most of your time online or playing skirmish. Multiplayer is troubling and rewarding. Very few games that you play in Multiplayer will actually be fair games and games are usually less that 30 min. BUT stalemates can last HOURS my longest was 3 hours and the game was so tense. Theres something thrilling about making giant robots shooting each other. The units attack from the land sea and sky. Winning the game isnt that hard either just build the most units as quickly as you can. The hard part is HOW you build those units. Will you build air to counter air? Or anti air units and Bomb Bouncers? Will you push a land force away with magnets or tele to their base. This game desperatlely needs a community and everyday the player count gets less and less everyday I see the same people online too extremely often when only there are 4 lobbies. But playing the game thrilling and rewarding and was the game that got me into PC gaming. I Love Supreme Commander 2			"

												There are some realism problems with the game when, for example, the ACU pushes a Megalith 2 experimental out of its way. I love the fast paced gameplay, not to mention the turtle favoritism...if you know how to play the game you can get a good turtle going and be nearly unbeatable...if not unbeatable. Is this not the purpose of a turtle after all? The research tree adds a level of re-playability to the game that is a big improvement from the stale t1 t2 t3 exp...progression that was the same for every single game SC:FA. Overall there could be some improvements but Ill give it a 9 for multiplayer awesomeness.			"

												An underrated sequel, but still a great game. The graphics and gameplay are solid, and although the experimentals are now 'nerfed' by quite a large margin, they still bring a great sense of power to the battlefield. The research system has been improved and overhauled, adding another level of resource gathering, and leading to more diverse factions than in the previous game. Admitedly, the single player campaign is not the best, and while I enjoyed it, you may see it to be cliche and guessable.But who plays Supreme Commander for the single player?! The skirmish mode and the online are the heart of the game. If this game is on sale, buy it. Note: The multiplayer is quite barren, so get the original Supreme Commander and the dlc as well. The FA forever mod is fantastic for Forged Alliance :)			"

												If you remember (or have seen) Supreme Commander ( 1/ Forged Alliance) ,you'll notice that the graphics look quite improved and that it's easier for the computer to process the game now, giving the series a great plus. Also, they added the research tree and research points, making the game running more fluid and offering an atmosphere of a fresh new game.The game has an issue that can't be easily spotted : the character's lines get annoys by their teen-style after overhearing it (espacially in the UEF campaign) . The other issues aren't annoying enough to be mentined [in my opinion].I definetly recommend this game! :)			"

As of yet while im still learning the game in many ways i have not won a single   1 v 1 match and the community is rather small but they are friendly and easy to get along with apart from one guy who was raging over the fact i was using strategy in a strategy game. If u get this game and cant find a player match bot matches are fun with a smart ai that makes you think your opponent is a human player although i recomend trying to get a friend to play this game with as the game is much more enjoyable with friend to play it with.

The graphics and gameplay are solid, and although the experimentals are now 'nerfed' by quite a large margin, they still bring a great sense of power to the battlefield. The research system has been improved and overhauled, adding another level of resource gathering, and leading to more diverse factions than in the previous game. Admitedly, the single player campaign is not the best, and while I enjoyed it, you may see it to be cliche and guessable.But who plays Supreme Commander for the single player?! The skirmish mode and the online are the heart of the game. If this game is on sale, buy it. Note: The multiplayer is quite barren, so get the original Supreme Commander and the dlc as well. The FA forever mod is fantastic for Forged Alliance :)			"

												I love this game. The units, the buildings, the strategies, the weapons...it's all so amazing. You can look close at a single tank as it fires it's last shot or makes a finishing blow on an experimental. You can pan all the way out to view your entire armies raid enemy bases or die trying. You can build amazing works of machinery called experimentals that can, and I quote, ""single-handedly turn the tide of battle."" -Manual. If worse comes to worst, you can launch a salvo of tactical nukes at your enemy and pray that they don't have any anti-nuke silos (which is, btw, one of the biggest ""lol nope"" moments I've ever had).Plus if you play as the Cybran Nation, you can get a fire-breathing dinosaur.

												This is my favroite time based stratagy game. I recommend this game to anyone who plays Company of Heros. There are 3 factions, Illuminent, UEF (United Earth Federation (Ha! Like that would ever happen with the people on this earth)), and Cybran. Each team has a diffrent types of units, buildings, and Commanders. The Commander is your main unit (aka YOU), and with it you can create factories that will produce troops to fight for you.There is also a reserch tree. Each branch (Land, Air, Naval, Commander) helps it with things like shield generators on your units, an escape pod for your commander, or even new units, like the Terror 2000 gunship. It's also has a great campaign. It's even fun to play with bots. Anyone and everyone with some skill will love this game. This game is a must have for all great stratagy players.			"

This game is very fun at a larger scale when it comes to massive army battles. Most of the time, I see my self actually spending more time looking at the over all radar unless I want to watch the battles up closely. It is amazing graphics to have like 50 artillery firing at a incoming land group.			"

												Supreme Commander Forged Alliance is a better strategy game, but I love how silly this game is with stuff like ""King Kriptor."" This game is also really easy to get into unlike the flux economy of Forged Alliance. However it boils down to spamming and spamming and spamming and spamming and spamming. Spam artilleries, spam anti-nukes, spam units. Spam research stations. Aside from that it can be a bit of fun, but you might get tired of it. The only problem is that this game doesn't have the greatest thing ever. GALACTIC COLOSSUS.GALACTIC. COLOSSUS.			"

												If you remember (or have seen) Supreme Commander ( 1/ Forged Alliance) ,you'll notice that the graphics look quite improved and that it's easier for the computer to process the game now, giving the series a great plus. Also, they added the research tree and research points, making the game running more fluid and offering an atmosphere of a fresh new game.The game has an issue that can't be easily spotted : the character's lines get annoys by their teen-style after overhearing it (espacially in the UEF campaign) . The other issues aren't annoying enough to be mentined [in my opinion].I definetly recommend this game! :)			"

												I can understand that players coming over from Supreme Commander and its expansion were disappointed, there are pages upon pages of SupCom players detailing the differences and rightly arguing that the game is less deep and varied. I however am not one of those people.There's a reason why some developers choose to ""streamline"" their games, and that is to make it inviting to new players. If you're new to these types of large scale RTS titles, then Supreme Commander 2's simplicity is a great way to get used to macro management strategies. for example: i had to adjust my habit of cueing my units up manually, as i would easily get swarmed by the cpu, the solution was to build a factory for each unit type i had and setting it to auto build. The maps are bigger than anything i had ever played and the scale was equally as daunting. Thankfully the streamlined approach of the game made getting used to it far easier and i quickly had fun playing it.As a result i can easily recommend this game to anyone who is just getting started in RTS titles, and more specifically macro management heavy RTS games, this is especially so considering its 14.00 price tag (much less when it goes on sale).

												Literally one of the biggest disapointments in the rts genre i have ever whitnessed. It's like they took supreme commander and watered it down past red alert 2 levels to create the most cookie cutter ""game"" ever. Gone are the powerfull experimentals, replaced with poor imitations that your ACU can easily defeat alone without any danger. A small handfull of the first tier units can take these out. Gone are the large maps and unit selection. Replaced with tiny zones and only one or two units per element (air, land, sea). You can upgrade them sure, but it still takes away from having to actually do anything strategical whatsoever, in favor of simply unit spamming. The visualls or good; at least for the environment. The unit graphics have been REDUCED substancially. If i had to give this game a score it would be 10%. You can tell right off the bat that no effort was put into this at all and everything became a cop-out black hole of less than mediocrity.			"

												This is a  medium-paced RTS that has a wonderful multiplayer and a decent singleplayer story. Has the basic RTS functions but lets you improve your army with ground, naval, air, structure, and ACU upgrades allowing to have a massive powerhouse army. With many factions each play-style is supported, rule the battleground with hard hitting expirimental uints, hold the air with a massive fleet of fighters, bombers, and gunships, or grasp the sea with subs, aircraft carriers, and battleships. This tests your skills of dividing and using all the parts of your army. See you on the battleground!			"

												Supreme Commander 2 is a great game and one of the best RTS that I have played since Age of Empires II. A bit different from Supreme Commander : Forged Alliance, Supcom 2 is smaller in scale, and changes up supply ""markets"" while still retaining the core idea of ""Energy"" and ""Mass"" from the last game. Research is now a resource used to unlock new tech, unlike the last game where engineers were your backbone. Despite these slight changes, Supcom 2 stays true to the aspects which made Forged Alliance good. Not very many people play the online portion as far as I can tell, but if you've got some friends, taking on the AI will be as good a time as any.			"

												Quick Summary: Real Time Strategy game with huge maps and tons of units in play. If you liked StarCraft or Command & Conquer, you should enjoy Supreme Commander 2.The game has 3 separate single player campaigns all taking place approximately the same time regarding an ancient piece of technology that has been discovered. You play a UEF commander (Human), an Illuminate commander (advanced alien race), and a Cybran commander (cybernetic humans) in the intersecting campaigns, all fighting against factions of the other races, as well as the mysterious Cybran Gauge, who seems to know a lot more about the Shiva Prime technology than anyone else.While the game has similar mechanics to most other Real Time Strategy games, what sets the Supreme Commander series apart is the massive scale of the levels and combat. You have a 300 unit cap and you can really fill the map with units. This is quite a feat because the maps are huge compared to other games like StarCraft or WarCraft. In fact, the maps are so large that you constantly need to zoom out and view the world from a strategic view, otherwise there’s no way you can rely on your minimap to keep an eye on the enemy. Additionally, the research/tech upgrading system is closer to Command & Conquer Generals, where instead of doing your tech upgrades in specific buildings, you access your tech trees in a meta console after you’ve accumulated enough research points. The research points are gained over time from building research buildings or killing enemy units. There are a ton of research options, so you’re unlikely to unlock everything in any given match unless you’re really, really trying.Pros:+Decent, long single player campaigns to get your money’s worth out of the game. Just playing single player will probably take about 12 hours to finish. The multiplayer can occupy even more of your time. +I mentioned the extensive tech tree that you can research, and these options can unlock a number of “experimentals” which are basically huge units that can march slowly across the battlefield kicking♥♥♥♥♥ Each race has their own experimentals to use, some better than others.Cons:-The graphics aren’t anything special. Dawn of War 2, which came out earlier has more convincing gameplay visuals, though the cinematic cutscenes for both these games aren’t all that impressive.-The game is really slow in single player. I don’t mean that the game runs slow on my computer, I mean the game is set to be slow paced and you can’t increase game speed (you can adjust speed in multiplayer). This is especially annoying because of how huge the maps are. If you already know you have enough units to win, you’ll probably want to speed up the game as you’re marching towards the enemy with your huge army.Overall the game is worth a playthrough for the single player campaign, but there are still people playing the multiplayer that you can match with.

												This is strictly an opinion from an old RTS player! First off Supreme Commander 2 takes place after Supreme Commander Forged alliance and that took place after Supreme Commander, so technically this should be Supreme Commander 3, Sadly like most good games and movies the following games are not as good as the original, in this case Supreme Commander 2 does not take place after both precursor Supreme Commanders and is mainly mint for younger players that use no strategy, unlike the old SC's were it took like 2 hours to get nukes and you have long battles, in SC 2 you can get nukes close to within 3 minutes and end the game in 10 minutes, here is a list of things....Pros...........................................................................................1. Good for first time RTS players2. Very basic controls and gameplay (Good for first time players)............................................................................................Cons............................................................................................1. Graphics are very cheesy and are not as good as the first Supreme Commanders2. Story line makes no sense and also does not follow the story’s left off by the other SC's3. Gameplay is too short, like I stated above you can easily win a game in 10 minutes4. Experimental units are to common, unlike the old game were you would freak out because of one in Supreme Commander 2 they are basically just another unit5. cannot build things unless you have the actually amount of energy or mass ( unlike were in the original Supreme Commanders were you could build into the negatives and build slower. in this one you have to have the same amount of energy and mass, this is a disadvantage if your under attack)6. Maps are too small, instead of big maps like in the old SC's the maps are super small in this one and no room to build massive basesSo over all if you’re a 4 year old and want to play this game it is mint for you ( I said this because my 5 year old sister has won all campaigns on normal) But if you are a older RTS gamer and played the other Supreme Commanders and even total annihilation, the precursor to all supreme commanders or any other RTS game this is not the game for you!Rank; 1/10			"

												This. Game. Is. Awesome. I LOVE the campain and gameplay, but sometings just different from 1. Personaly I think they should make a 3, and take the best parts of all the games and put them together. Also, it should have better chrashing animations like when a plane or something goes down it can hit other planes and take them down with it to. Tis is a Must Get fo me. One of the best, but not so much in the TOP 10 all te time.			"

												Back when I was a cub, I used to play Emperor, the Battle for Dune. This game's mechanics are similar to that game, but there are slight difference and there is also a futuristic theme the game.  The game plot is mediocre.The graphics are quite acceptable.Mechanics are pretty ok.I have never tried multiplayer (and probably never will, just because I am not good enough)I would however, in hindsigh, say that I would much rather have a base factory than having a crappy commander robot.

												Very fun real time strategy. If you have played the first game or Total Annihilation before looking at this game, then I promise that you will be happy with this game. The armies are massive, but the maps are still large enough to provide you with more than enough space to build and battle. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy sitting down for a few hours for a nice game of building massive bases while destroying others.			"

												This is a  medium-paced RTS that has a wonderful multiplayer and a decent singleplayer story. Has the basic RTS functions but lets you improve your army with ground, naval, air, structure, and ACU upgrades allowing to have a massive powerhouse army. With many factions each play-style is supported, rule the battleground with hard hitting expirimental uints, hold the air with a massive fleet of fighters, bombers, and gunships, or grasp the sea with subs, aircraft carriers, and battleships. This tests your skills of dividing and using all the parts of your army. See you on the battleground!			"

												Hardcore Real-Time Strategy! That's how you sum up Supreme Commander 2 in this sequel to Chris Taylor's original game. Supreme Commander 2 works out the tedious flaws of the first game while still offering the awesome scale of the so-called ""strategic zoom."" Supreme Commander 2 caters to traditional and hardcore RTS gamers, so be sure to check it out sometime.Hardcore Real-Time Strategy - Now with DLC! This DLC pack can be enabled/disabled within the game with a simple click of a box so you can game with friends who don't own the DLC, but there's no excuse not to own this pack. It includes new maps and units so be sure to pick it up for the full experience.			"

Product received for free
												This game quickly became one of if not my favorites after a friend bought it for me. All three factions are different and unique much like their units. Every map is well designed, the game is gorgeous (especially the robots id take one out for a date), you want the game to lag so you can watch the epic end game battle with all of your forces versus the enemies in slow motion. The base building is amazing, and it's sad to see a base go after the games over. This is one of the best real time strategy games out there, and it's a solid purchase along with its dlc, which is a ♥♥♥♥ ton of content so cheap even I can afford it.			"

												Please note, before reviewing this game, play the god forsaken campeign. It is quite fun, oh yes.THERE ARE NO TECH TIERS, YOU HAVE TO BUILD RESEARCH STATIONS!!!!!!! - Most of the bad reviews are because people come from SC FA, and expect the buildings to be upgradeable. Look harder next time, had to show my friend the research in the top left. He hated this game, and now he loves it. This game has given me many, MANY hours of enjoyment, I would highly reccomened it. It gets very intense very quickly when going agienst difficult opponents.However, there are about maybe ~33% units as much from FA, though you can constanly use all of them, rather than only having a effective few endgame units. They are all upgradeable, with shields, increaced firepower, ETC.The exprimentals are not as powerful as SC FA, but they are FAR cheaper to build!The Maps are smaller, but it makes for more intense and more challenging games. Overall, highly reccd. P.S. If you want bigger maps, the community had made some absolutly massive ones!http://www.moddb.com/mods/revamp-mod/addons/revamp-map-pack-v11 "

												Not as good as the original, however this game has its uniqueness. This includes upgrading existing units, researching new units (which in my opinion were already researched and you're just downloading that research), and making it easier to gather resources from all buildings of a single type with a single purchase. The downside is that you can no longer have multiple units building the same structure, which sucks. If you can get this game @ half off, go for it, otherwise just buy the original.			"

												Looking for some large-scale real-time warfare strategy? Check this game out. While not so large and comprehensive as first Supreme Commander (and Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance), it's still the king of RTSes and puts Starcraft 2 to its knees. Punching the enemy with 250 units or effectively using multi-monitor setups? Not many games can give you that, and SupCom 2 is the one of them. Or maybe you loved ""Total Annihilation""? You should like Supreme Commander 2 too.			"

												Given the changes of engine, art direction, and game mechanics, Supreme Commander 2 feels more like a spin-off title rather than a successor to Supreme Commander. Can be interesting to play through regardless.			"

												A very, very fun RTS, this game is. The gameplay feels nice, the battles don't feel small (and aren't, which is where many RTS' kinda fall flat. Each unit is actually a single unit, unlike many RTS' where the ""single"" unit is a squad) and the base-building is nice. The story mode is a bit ""meh"", but this game is fun to play with friends or in a singleplayer Skirmish. The 3 factions all play fairly different, with each getting similar base structures, but completely different units and tech trees. It's a nice game, definitely worth getting if you like RTS games.

												Well I have many hours in this game and prob just as many in the first game.  First off SC2 was a trade off in scale to be able to run on the xbox 360 (which is actually a good game if your looking for a good strategy for your console).  But it still has more scale than many other popular RTS games.  The game is far less unit managament and less unit upgrade focused.  You basically pick your attack path at the beginning and off you go, changing from your direction in the game is a bit hard to pull off but with a good teammate it can be done.  The game has great graphics, but unfortunetly it can't take advantage of our awesome new multi-core CPU's we have today, infact it really only uses 1 core and about 20% of a 2nd if you have it, for example the game ran as fast on my 4.2ghz pentium 4 extreme edition as it did on my Q6600 when I got the game years ago.  Gas Powered games is gone now, but just before they were bought up they released a new AI patch which really helped with a lot of the stupidy the AI had, the AI was already challenging but i quickly found a lot of tactics no longer worked against certain levels of enemies.  Faction balance is terrible in the standard game, imo of course, but once you add the DLC the game gets a whole new persective, every faction can now push there attacks in all 4 major ways (naval, air, land, artillery) except Aion who have no artillery.  At the current price point you would be a fool to not pick up the game and the DLC they are completly worth it.  Single player I still need to finish, I have always been terrible about finishing single player in RTS games though :)  If your playing a large multiplayer match or want to get into multiplayer make sure to get some friends going(you use steam to invite into games), and make sure who ever has the most powerful system hosts the game.

												I love SupCom 1. It is the epitomy of a great strategy game. Normally a sequel sets out with the goal of improving on the original without major changes to the formula. Not here; no, not with SupCom 2. Instead, this game is what you get when you take SupCom and gut everything that made it good and dumb down every mechanic. The huge scale, dynamic economy and awesome elite (experimental) units from the first game have all been altered or nixed. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game, especially if you loved the original SupCom.			"

												Faster paced than the original Supreme Commander, but much better if you just want to get a quick match or two in without sitting at the computer all day. Beginner skirmishes take anywhere from 30 mins to an hour, while competitive team matches usually don't run over 15-20 mins tops. This game is particularly fun if you have a friend to play with, either against, or better as an ally against other teams. Strategic gameplay is top notch; there are many options on how you want to advance up the research ladder. It took me awhile to get into this one, having been a big fan of its much more time-consuming and involved predecessor. After having sunk over 250 hours into this game though, I can honestly say it offers one of the best all-around RTS experiences you can get.			"

												For those who haven't played any games in this series, I suggest giving this one a miss and purchasing either Supreme Commander or SC: Forged Alliance instead. SC2 looks nicer and runs marginally better, but it's been simplified to appeal to people who don't usually play RTS games and boy does it show; the unit list has been cut down by two thirds (that doesn't stop some of the units being nearly useless); the in-game economy has been dumbed down so that it's impossible to stall; the maps and scale of the game in general have been cut back; the story is boring, as are the characters and it's also way too easy to complete.As I said: Stick with the previous games. People can talk up this one all they like - it turned out to be the one that ultimately killed the series.			"

												TL;DR: I'll put the tldr segment first because of the way they format the text:Supreme Commander 2 is a basic RTS that did not hold on to what it had in the first two games of the franchise. If you have not played the first games and are just looking for a nice looking RTS, then this is your game.I have played Supreme Commander since the original was released back in 2007, I loved that game and it brought many new features to the RTS scene that have now become pretty much standard (ex: “strategic zoom”). After the pretty much utter failure of Forged Alliance, I was pretty surprised to see a sequel to a game whose first installment was pretty good, but had lost grasp on its fans by making a spin off and releasing it as a full game at full price when it really should have been an expansion or DLC. The First two games: Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, were both produced by THQ, developed by Gas Powered Games and to quote from the boxes “An Arts From [designed by] Christ Taylor”. These games had many mechanics that separated from other RTSs that were out that the time. The games had a focus on large unit management (I’m talking 1000+ units, none of that 200 max unit stuff you see in other games) to dominate the battlefield, players also had to use the terrain to their advantage to flank their enemies. The resource management system that was in place in the first titles was also very different from other games at the time. Instead of having a set amount of resource in your position and you’re only able to build units with that set amount (if that makes any sense), SC and SCFA both had a resource rate system. This system would allow you to build as many units as you wanted, just production would slow down if you did not have a high enough rates of resources coming in, creating some pretty interesting situations when you realize that one of you Mass Extractors had been removed and you wonder why you’re not building as fast. Units in the first two games were handled by a tier system. When you could afford to spend some time and had some extra resource coming in you could choose to upgrade up to two higher (because you start on tier one) tiers unlocking new units and engineers to build. When you obtain enough tier three engineers (for sake of practicality) you could build some pretty power game ender units called Experimental Units. These beasts included things such as a mobile factory that could build almost anything almost instantly and was pretty much indestructible, to gigantic humanoid robots that would shoot laser beams from their eyes. You could also build a unit called a Support Command Units, which were smaller less functional versions of the main Armored Command Units (which is what you play as), pretty much they make great suicidal units. Now enough about the first to games in the franchise, let’s talk about Supreme Commander 2 (the third game of the series). You may be wondering why I spent all that time talking about the first games in the series; well it’s because they changed all that (well most of it). Publication of Supreme Commander 2 was transferred over to Square Enix, but was still developed by Gas Powered Games. The seconded game had more of a focus on small group combat rather than large scale unit combat like in the first game. The map design was also drastically different with even more of a requirement on terrain use. This wasn’t really a bad thing; the new maps were interesting and helped to balance the support between each kind of unit (land, air, sea). However one of the biggest flaws with in the game was with the units. They scrapped the tier system that was present in the first game for tech tree system. Gone are the days were you could build cheap factories that would pump out meat shields and cheap scouts. With this new tree system the placed in a resource, research points, along with the original two, Mass, and Energy. These points could be farmed or gained just from passing time, and then spent in the tree. Now some of these upgrades are pretty interesting, you can detach the control module of the AUC to make a quick escape and then make a bad♥♥♥♥♥comeback; but still the heavy focus on the system felt to simplify what made the first games unique and challenging; now all your factories have access two those high power units, and you no longer have to micromanage them. But by far the worst change that they made was to the resource system. They went from an “interest” based income system as I described before, to the standard “bank” system that is present in other RTSs such as Star Craft. This hurt the game, slowing the pacing down from all out action which made the first game amazing fun, to a waiting game to see who can farm the most and get Experimental Units first. In the end Supreme Commander 2 is a decent strategy game, but that’s all it is. GPG did not stick to what made the first two games so different, high pacing action with ridiculous unit counts and lots of explosions. The maps are interesting enough to keep games exciting for the first few rounds, and the visuals are fantastic even for a three year old game. However I still can’t help but feel hurt that this cult favorite that really was the benchmark for RTSs (both visually and mechanically) at the time it was released has been watered down to please a wider demographic. Also I feel that I should note that it was released a few weeks before Star Craft 2 so that didn’t help with sales. In all I would recommend the first two games over this one: Supreme Commander, and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, if you want a unique RTS experience and don’t already own them. If you want a beautiful RTS with unique units but really basic mechanics then go right ahead and pick up Supreme Commander 2.			"

Which kind of ruined the game as there was no community around the game at all.Note: The first games online services are offline, but you can google and find another community driven online server where you can find matches and such.

The visuals are improved, but the gameplay is very much inferior to the original title in this series. Maps and battles are far smaller, and experimental units have been changed from epic, expensive game-enders to boring, cheaper gimmicky-feeling super units.If you enjoyed Total Annihilation or the original Supreme Commander, check out Planetary Annihilation for a proper large-scale RTS.

												Supreme commander 2, is my personal favorite warfare based game. I personal enjoy playing this approximently everyday. I have my Father, my friends, ""Sameer, Justin, Will"" that play this same game. On some days we have a all out war FFA AKA Free For All match. For the last couple of weeks I have been way out into this game just trying to finish the campaign again. Sense I just got the game on my new HP computer I also saw the infinite war battle making one of my favorite games into a better all out survival warfare. If you are reading this review and are thinking about buying this game on Steam. I think you should think that again, and say ""Well lets go get that credit card!"" Supreme commander involves complex thinking and complex options to over defeat your enemies. You need to choose wisely with your research and you mass production in the maps format. Supreme commander 2 is cheap for it great graphics, and it's great performance. I got this game 2 years or so ago when it was about 50$. And personally do you see me conplaining about this game being boring? Well if I am happy then you should be Happy.                                            -TaylorTdude :)			"

												Alot of people will tell you that last iteration of Supcom is a superior game, but its much more matter of preference. In Supcom 2 games are less massive in scale, maps are smaller, but also matches take less time and there is much less micromanaging your base. Overall i like Supcom 2 more although Forged alliance was also a fun game. Multiplayer is more enjoyable then vs AI.			"

												an excellent game, problem is that this game jumps too fast to the experimental line, unlike the first game, experimentals are an acheivment. also the research system has you building like 15 research buildings in order to upgrade. i feel the first is a better game, but the second has a better engine. the thing is the first lags when over 500 units on the map the second dosent seem to have that issue. keep any eye out for planetary anihalation, which is the next game these guys are making.

												Love it i played it for 32 hours and i'm still not bored. The game is even better when you play with 4 friends against 4 Normal or Hard AI, but its fun to play on your own for hours upon hours. i think this game is worth buying if you are new to strategy games like me.The units are well thought out and are balanced apart from illuminate tanks are pretty bad. but this games economy system is well thought out too! i would give Supreme Commander 2 and 8/10 due to the jump between Normal AI to Hard AI is massive, all they do is rush you. some people still play the mutiplayer but not a lot, at the most i would find 5-6 Lobby's at anyone time.But an overall view of this game it is very good and i am going to keep playing it for a long time.

												Supreme commander 2, is my personal favorite warfare based game. I personal enjoy playing this approximently everyday. I have my Father, my friends, ""Sameer, Justin, Will"" that play this same game. On some days we have a all out war FFA AKA Free For All match. For the last couple of weeks I have been way out into this game just trying to finish the campaign again. Sense I just got the game on my new HP computer I also saw the infinite war battle making one of my favorite games into a better all out survival warfare. If you are reading this review and are thinking about buying this game on Steam. I think you should think that again, and say ""Well lets go get that credit card!"" Supreme commander involves complex thinking and complex options to over defeat your enemies. You need to choose wisely with your research and you mass production in the maps format. Supreme commander 2 is cheap for it great graphics, and it's great performance. I got this game 2 years or so ago when it was about 50$. And personally do you see me conplaining about this game being boring? Well if I am happy then you should be Happy.                                            -TaylorTdude :)			"

												Supreme commander is a very good RTS game. It looks amazing, seeming to focus on that as much as they focus on gameplay. You can scroll in to see every detail of every tank you build, and they all look amazing. The gameplay is much like any other RTS, but it twists it up a bit by adding addons to buildings, research points, and other cool things that you have to try to enjoy.

												Big improvement over the first Supreme Commander. While it was ""dumbed down"", it really helped the game as a whole. They streamlined it, made the game a lot more enjoyable to actually play in the early phases AND the late game stages, as opposed to SC1, where you'd just spam mindlessly and try to pump out a T4 unit as fast as possible.I understand some people don't like the change, I don't blame them, but overall this was a good thing for the series and helped newer people get introduced to the world of Supreme Commander and therefore drew more attention to the original and to me, that's never a bad thing. I recommend giving this game a go.			"

												I have thoroughly enjoyed this game ever since i discovered ity on the console the battles have good length and build up time and you can actually use more in depth strategy than in other games or you can still be simple and send a giant mega army to attack the opposition. It also has a pretty good collection of mods which you have to find on your own unfortunately, and to play with others online you have to have all the same mods or just play with the base game. With the game-play itself the only issue i have is how the bots tend to rush nukes, and then just stop attacking with anything else. there are occasional unit pathing issues but they mostly self correct after a moment of trying to go where they cant. overall a great game with a good campaign as well.

												There are so many differences between Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance and Supreme Commander 2 that they should be treated as two separate RTS games. The ""tactical view"" of the battlefield is still a main feature, but now you have to zoom out really far to see the unit icons. Unless you zoom really close to the units, it is hard to tell immediately what the units are. The campaign story was weaker than the original, but on the bright side, the missions themselves put a lot more pressure on the player. For more of the major differences, Wikipedia has a good article.After playing Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, I was disappointed by Supreme Commander 2, mainly due to the simplified unit mix and play style. But when considered as a standalone title, this is still a decent RTS game. I'll stick with Forged Alliance, though.			"

												Just bought this game in the last Christmas sale for R$ 5, and it is an amazing game for the price. Max unit count is really high (500), resources are infinite in quantity yet limited by extraction rate, and the main focus of the game is on the battles. Some units are specialized against others, there are many possibilities like nukes, air strikes, air drops, artillery across the map, etc. I would not pay much more for this title if it weren't on sale, but it is a decent and complete RTS option to play with friends. Definitely recommended.			"

												Quite possibly the only RTS to make ""macro-management"" a required skill, Supreme Commander 2 stands out from all other RTSs by having an interface that HELPS you with all your tasks, instead of artificially inhibiting you.  Being able to infinitely zoom in and out combined with a 500 unit cap (1 unit = 1 pop) makes Supreme Commander 2 the ultimate of large scale battles.Be sure you have at least a dual core, preferably running at least at 3.8GHZ to handle the sim speeds demanded by the game when fighting against 3+ AIs with friends.

This game has been a role model for future command and conquer gamesand has raised the bar permanently. This is just a must have for any command and conquer /RTS fans.			"

												Supreme commander 2, is my personal favorite warfare based game. I personal enjoy playing this approximently everyday. I have my Father, my friends, ""Sameer, Justin, Will"" that play this same game. On some days we have a all out war FFA AKA Free For All match. For the last couple of weeks I have been way out into this game just trying to finish the campaign again. Sense I just got the game on my new HP computer I also saw the infinite war battle making one of my favorite games into a better all out survival warfare. If you are reading this review and are thinking about buying this game on Steam. I think you should think that again, and say ""Well lets go get that credit card!"" Supreme commander involves complex thinking and complex options to over defeat your enemies. You need to choose wisely with your research and you mass production in the maps format. Supreme commander 2 is cheap for it great graphics, and it's great performance. I got this game 2 years or so ago when it was about 50$. And personally do you see me conplaining about this game being boring? Well if I am happy then you should be Happy.                                            -TaylorTdude :)			"

												Love it i played it for 32 hours and i'm still not bored. The game is even better when you play with 4 friends against 4 Normal or Hard AI, but its fun to play on your own for hours upon hours. i think this game is worth buying if you are new to strategy games like me.The units are well thought out and are balanced apart from illuminate tanks are pretty bad. but this games economy system is well thought out too! i would give Supreme Commander 2 and 8/10 due to the jump between Normal AI to Hard AI is massive, all they do is rush you. some people still play the mutiplayer but not a lot, at the most i would find 5-6 Lobby's at anyone time.But an overall view of this game it is very good and i am going to keep playing it for a long time.

												Supreme commander is a very good RTS game. It looks amazing, seeming to focus on that as much as they focus on gameplay. You can scroll in to see every detail of every tank you build, and they all look amazing. The gameplay is much like any other RTS, but it twists it up a bit by adding addons to buildings, research points, and other cool things that you have to try to enjoy. I know I am not giving this justice in this review, but, if you are reading this, trust me. It is a good game if you are a fan of any RTS game. I give it 9/10.			"

												Big improvement over the first Supreme Commander. While it was ""dumbed down"", it really helped the game as a whole. They streamlined it, made the game a lot more enjoyable to actually play in the early phases AND the late game stages, as opposed to SC1, where you'd just spam mindlessly and try to pump out a T4 unit as fast as possible.I understand some people don't like the change, I don't blame them, but overall this was a good thing for the series and helped newer people get introduced to the world of Supreme Commander and therefore drew more attention to the original and to me, that's never a bad thing. I recommend giving this game a go.			"

												I have thoroughly enjoyed this game ever since i discovered ity on the console the battles have good length and build up time and you can actually use more in depth strategy than in other games or you can still be simple and send a giant mega army to attack the opposition. It also has a pretty good collection of mods which you have to find on your own unfortunately, and to play with others online you have to have all the same mods or just play with the base game. With the game-play itself the only issue i have is how the bots tend to rush nukes, and then just stop attacking with anything else. there are occasional unit pathing issues but they mostly self correct after a moment of trying to go where they cant. overall a great game with a good campaign as well.

												Just bought this game in the last Christmas sale for R$ 5, and it is an amazing game for the price. Max unit count is really high (500), resources are infinite in quantity yet limited by extraction rate, and the main focus of the game is on the battles. Some units are specialized against others, there are many possibilities like nukes, air strikes, air drops, artillery across the map, etc. I would not pay much more for this title if it weren't on sale, but it is a decent and complete RTS option to play with friends. Definitely recommended.			"

												I absolutely do NOT recommend this game as the first game with it's expansion is tons better.While supcom 2 is alright, the team walked away from the ""you can have thousands of units"" part of the game and on top of that they reduced the graphics for this title.The worst part yet is that there's no map editor or mod maker which the first game had. Which kind of ruined the game as there was no community around the game at all.Note: The first games online services are offline, but you can google and find another community driven online server where you can find matches and such. It's still a fun game.But as for this, the sequel, no no no.			"

												90 out of 100It's a pretty good game, with several improvements over the original. For one, I definatly like the strategic view where you can organize units into groups. Supreme Commander 2 has a much better campaign and some well-designed skirmish maps. Another key improvement is the differences in the factions. In Supreme Commander the factions were basically the same and the only difference was the appearence of the units. Supreme Commander 2 has signifigantly incresed the depth and strategy of the game. There are a few downsides though. To start there's the desreased unit cap. In the orignal Supreme Commander you could have 1000 units on the field at once, whereas now you can only have 500. Also, some of the units have lost a lot of their original power. Take the fatboy for example, in supreme commander it was an amphibious mobile factory with a shield and immense firepower. Now it's just a large tank.Overall I'd say buy Supreme Commander first and play for a while, then buy this so you can enjoy the improvemets more and have better understanding of the campaign.			"

												Now, before I explain why I don't reccommend this, let me establish that this is, indeed, a VERY fun game. Its just dissappointing, compared to the previous SupCom games. My biggest issue, is how useless shields are. They cover next to nothing, in SupCom:FA, you could cover your entire base with 3 or 4 heavy shield generators. Now, in a DLC, you can get an experimental shield generator, but that's the DLC, and Im not talking about the DLC, Im talking about the game. Another issue I have with this, is the border markers, PDs range, shields range, etc. Its a thick ring, that doesnt give you a very precise-feeling measurement. I much prefer Supreme Commander's thin ring, it feels so much better. Also, they obliterated some of my favorite experimentals, namely the FatBoy. That thing was a beast, heavy shield gen, long range cannons, unit production capabilities. Now its just a big bloody tank. I love this game. But I would advise against buying it, go and buy the fist Supreme Commander, or Forged Alliance.			"

												Total Annihilation was a great game. Great concept. Supreme Commander followed that example and only built on it, making it a game nearly just as impressive as it's grandfather. Supreme Commander 2 however, took everything that made Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander 1 great and changed it. It's not a game of strategy anymore, it's now just a tech race as the smaller units are useless while the large ones are pretty much unstoppable, creating a gap that leaves little room for fun.			"

My biggest issue, is how useless shields are. They cover next to nothing, in SupCom:FA, you could cover your entire base with 3 or 4 heavy shield generators. Now, in a DLC, you can get an experimental shield generator, but that's the DLC, and Im not talking about the DLC, Im talking about the game. Another issue I have with this, is the border markers, PDs range, shields range, etc. Its a thick ring, that doesnt give you a very precise-feeling measurement. I much prefer Supreme Commander's thin ring, it feels so much better. Also, they obliterated some of my favorite experimentals, namely the FatBoy. That thing was a beast, heavy shield gen, long range cannons, unit production capabilities. Now its just a big bloody tank. I love this game. But I would advise against buying it, go and buy the fist Supreme Commander, or Forged Alliance.			"

												An accesible and lightweight evolution of the original Supreme Commander (and Total Annihilation before it) that shines in online co-op multiplayer vs. AI. Each of the three factions feels unique enough to encourage different tactics and long-term strategies. AI can be configured with pre-existing difficulty and behavioral profiles or customized to make it laughably incompetent or viciously productive. Both players and AI can be configured in any combination of teams, with or without ability to break alliances during gameplay.Jeremy Soule's soundtrack is grand and sweeping. It does a fine job underscoring the tension of base building and the escalating arms race just as well as it punctuates the shrapnel-filled battles.Sure, more maps would be welcome, but luckily there are a few well-balanced layouts that offer tremendous replayability.My recommendation: Buy it for yourself and 3 friends when it's on sale, skip the single-player campaigns, and go right for co-op multiplayer vs. a few AIs.

												The first game was Supreme Commander, then came Supreme Commande : Forged Alliance, then this.Sadly it doesn't live up to the series.  The whole game feels like a cutdown version of the earlier games, like if someone had to remake Supreme Commander with only a fraction of the budget.The graphics are worse than the earlier games.  The FMV's are worse quality than the earlier games.The game balance is poor and air units are overpowered. The storyline for the singleplayer campaign is weak and very cheesy and every campaign opponent is just a sad predictable spam of gunship formations.  The regular units are bland and experimentals feel more like regular units.The campaign was easily completable on Hard difficulty for a novice like me, who barely scraped through Forged Alliance on Normal difficulty. Which leaves only skirmish and multiplayer, where the gameplay is far shallower and blander than the original game and you'll quickly grow bored of it.  What basically ruined this sequel is basically the same thing that ruins a lot of PC game sequels, a studio has initial success and then they set their eyes on the lucrative console market.Here's a quote from gamespy reviewing the Xbox 360 version of the first Supreme Commander.""Cut out about 50% of the units, make the maps smaller and tighten up the bleeding edges to make a new strategic model and we might really have something. The pacing's right, the idea's right, but stuffing the entire PC version of Supreme Commander onto the 360 is just more than the poor machine can handle.""That's pretty much what they did here.  The only thing Supreme Commaner 2 deserves credit for is that on the whole the skirmish A.I is somewhat improved over its predecessors in terms of actually amassing units and launching credible attacks.

												Its a really great game. Easy for newer players to understand, complex enough for veterans with over 500 hours like me. I like it about the same as Forged Alliance. it is not dumbed down, but just is different form the other ones, and thats why players of the old ones don't like it. My complaint is that it slows down a tad when everyone has 500 or so units, but that dosn't make it a bad game.			"

												I loved the supreme commander series from the start, getting it in 2007 and playing it for hours on straight and loved every single bit of it, then forged alliance came out, which basicaly was the only way they could have ever mad SupCom any better. then 2 came out. remember the awesomness of exploring the map, building giant armies, and upgrading your tech to make your base better? well, they got rid of the tech system completely and made some wierd♥♥♥♥♥tech tree which will have you farming science and spam laboratories all over your base. and dont forget shields, because the only way to actually fight in this game is by spamming artillery that can fire acrossthe map, and yes you had that in SupCom 1 as well, but then it was tech 3 and took half an hour to build. now its (sort of, because of the tech tree) tech 2, and can be completed very quickly. armies are obsolete because of this, and the only strategy is spamming things. the campaign is filled with cliches, and really sucks compared to the earlier ones. i would not recommend this game, buy SupCom 1 or FA, but not this. also, DLC for more units? REALLY? THIS IS WHY FFA GOT MADE.			"

												Supreme Commander 2 is a nice RTS that is different from most others. The ability to produce units, artillery, experimentals, and general bases in one match makes it very different. Sure, maybe games like Company of Heros are kinda like that, but the SC series has a different vibe. I don't play SC2 often now, ever since I moved to its predecessor Forged Alliance.Forged Alliance in general, could be considered to be a better game. Better resource system, tech tiers instead of tech trees, experimentals are more expensive, but much more OP, etc etc. I would recommend getting Forged Alliance, but I would not go against getting this game. Supreme Commander 2 is a great game on its own, and its much more casual than FA, making it a good game to have some quick matches every now and then.Yes, I do recommend it, but I would recommend getting Forged Alliance instead.

												I like many others on here grew up playing Total Annihilation and later Supreme Commander then Forged Alliance which were all excelent games. The grand scale and complexity made them the pinnacle of strategy games unrivaled by any challenger. SC2 however is an embarassment to the franchise which lacks all the qualities that made the predesessors superior to every other Warcraft clone on the market. I cannot believe that Chris Taylor actually wanted to produce the watered down, simplistic, underachieving C&C clone(minus the good story and cut scenes). Let us all hope he is able to escape from Square Enix and work with a publisher that will allow him the creative freedom to masterfully craft the game that we all know he is capable of. Show support of good game development by purchasing Total Annihilation and the first 2 Supreme Commander titles but please leave this one on the shelf.			"

												Mmm... it's alright I guess.RTS gamey that... well, its functional, but I was not particularly interested in what was going on. It certainly didn't take much actual strategy (typical for the genre, actually), since my approach to every mission in the campaign could basically be summed up as ""Dig in, build an overwhelming resource advantage, then just bulldoze everything in my way."" Aside from one mission where holding what I had was the very objective, that approach was basically what I did for the entire game.Mmm... I guess it's not a bad game. The units were pretty neat and I did have to make a variety of them to be able to deal with anything I came across. But if this review sounds uninspired, then that's intentional because I'm about as interested in writing it as I am in the game itself.So if you like RTS games.... yeah sure. I guess have fun with it. Bwee. :o			"

												Supreme Commander 2 (SC2) is much better than Supreme Commander 1 (SC1). Don't believe all the naysayers!SC1 had tons of different units, 4 tiers and huge maps. The intention behind SC1 apparently was to simulate epic battles. However, it failed at that miserably. The usual multiplayer games didn't last longer than 10 - 20 minutes and ended at tier 1 or tier 2 at most. So you weren't able to use most of the units anyway. No epic battles of several hours (if players played seriously).SC2 doesn't try to simulate epic battles. SC2 is a very quick game. 1on1 games usually take about 10 minutes. Everything in the game is streamlined for quick games and it never gets boring. The game just makes a lot more sense. Unlike SC1, it doesn't try to be something which it isn't. If you want longer games, play 3vs3 games which can take about 30 minutes.Cons:- The online community is practically non-existent. The game is very old after all and most players who play it don't host public games. RTS games in general aren't the most popular games.Pros:+ The game isn't expensive. Ask a few friends who like RTS games and play with or against them! IMO, the game is worth its current price of 13€ just for its skirmish mode against AI. There is also a single player campaign for all three factions.+ There are not tons of different units. Too many units make a RTS too complicated without providing a real benefit. You don't need tons of different units to have a strategic game. Too many types of units just make the game bloated and make it difficult for new players.+ The size of the maps is just right. No boring wandering around in slow moting in huge maps.+ The ACU or an engineer can build all buildings. No need to distinguish between T1, T2 and T3 engineers. Better buildings and units are unlocked via the research system. Different tiers of engineers would just have been annoying without providing any strategical depth.+ Stability. Unlike SC1, SC2 never has crashed on my PC.+ Easy to pick up, difficult to master. That's what a RTS game should be like. There is a lot of depth in the game, e.g. knowing how to counter which strategy of the enemy.+ The factions play very differently. Every faction has its own cool things and the balance seems to be very good.+ Beforehand I was sceptical when I heard that the mass and energy isn't reduced per second when constructing but you have to pay the full amout of mass and energy for buildings and units. In fact it works perfectly. Nothing to miss about the old economy system of SC1 (or Total Annihilation).+ It is not possible to build a turtle base which withstands everything. Allowing too heavy turtling would only lenghten the game without making it more interesting. In SC2 attacking is the best defense.+ There is a lot of tension in the game. You always have something to do. There is no time for breaks. Fortunately, a game is short enough to be able to relax *after* the game ;)Conclusion: SC2 is the result of streamlining SC1. It's not a trivial game like some people may try to make you believe. IMO, the right things were simplified but the developers never oversimplified anything.			"

												As in RTS by itself, it can stand its ground fairly well. Though if you compare to its previous installment, Supreme Commnder : Forged Alliance, it's an abomination that must be purged like the likes of no other. So basically, if you're looking for an amazing RTS game that has TOO much content, replayability, and requires a good amount of strategy, get Forged Alliance. If you like spamming a horde of units into your enemy and enjoy hearing 'Tactical Nuke Detected', then this game is definitely your cup of tea.			"

Soup Commander dumbs now and shrinks everything plot, characters and the battlefield.In Forged Alliance, there are three factions fighting for galactic dominance. First the UEF professional soldiers of a corrupt government. Second Aeon have advanced technology while trying to spread their beliefs at the barrel of a gun. Third the Cybran Nation a splinterd orgainization lead primarily by a 1000 your old scientist who is trying free those enslaved by the UEF while having inferior numbers.Then there is the Soup Commander (this game here your looking at).

												I can only recommend this game if its almost literally ""Baby's First RTS""Functionally its fairly smooth, tech progresses at a fairly easy to undersand rate and resources are very easy to graspIf this had any other title, my only gripe would be that its a somewhat shallow strategy game split between two major recurring problems. 1) matches degrade into a race to nuclear munitions or 2) If nukes are switched off, battles become a competition typically of who brought more units (and in most cases, who is spamming experimentals)However, since this game does bare the name of a sequel to Supreme commander 1 and Forged alliance, its going to get a major thumbs down from me. To put things simply, it feels desperate. Over 3/4ths of the units vanished between forged alliance and 2 it seems, everything feels either too squishy or too beefy with very little in between. The fact that I can park 10 navy cruisers off the enemy base within 5 minutes of the match starting (the 'youre not allowed to enjoy the game' tactic) and shut down the game before it can start..? The fact that nuclear weapons are relatively cheap and quick to build, often removing further the concept of strategy. I suppose what it comes down to is; Of the units left in the game, do all of them feel absolutely necissary? Do all of them have a very clear use that cant be easily covered by another. My answer is no, any match can be won through spamming pretty much any one unit whether that be tanks, artillery, gunships, navy, nuclear missilesWhatever your fancy, its been watered down so much you might as well slap a dasani label on it. Addendum : I recommend this if youre looking for an introduction into RTS, things arent so crazy fast as starcraft but not as slow as some others. Expansion moves with the player even with its problems. If youre more confident in your ability however, Skip this. Dont even consider it an option. Go pick up Forged Alliance and have hours of fun ducking and dodging, surgically decapitating the enemy forces, and striking the final decisive blow.			"

												As a player of Supcom and Forged Alliance I found Supcom 2 was rather lacking in content, as a point of fact I figured, seeing as it was a continuation of the originals, that jumping into a skirmish rather than learning the controls would be fun, I was wrong. There is no strategy involved, simply throwing masses of troops seems to work fine. The look of the game, both graphically and from my brief inspection of the tutorial, seems very similar to some of Westwoods Command and Conquer games. Were I a new player to the series I'd most likely assume it was a prequel to the originals with the way it looked.I still had fun though, regardless of my initial shock, and I felt as though it had been made with an older feel in mind.All in all I was dissapointed with what I got out of this game. Was it good? No. Were it part of a different series of games I may have said differently but this is a poor excuse for a SupCom game. I do expect I'll play the game more but will no doubt return to the orignal games after completing the  campaign.Pro's:Some of the unit names are clear puns which made me chuckleThe old SupCom/FA maps made an appearanceSomewhat corny and old school feelCon's:For SupCom players; expect lower graphics than the originalsSeems untempered and in need of tweaksLack of strategy value, throw units at the enemy and wear them into the dirt			"

												After 700 hours playing this game I thought it might be time to rate it !When Supreme Commander Forged Alliance was released I was a big fan and used to play a lot with friends. We all loved the macro-management and these huge playgrounds to fight each other.Some people say Supreme Commander 2 is not a SC anymore. I would say it is, just a much more balanced version ! Power of experimentals were reduced, making it possible to fight an experimental with classic units. Also, maps are smaller, this is not a con ! It makes the game more ""rush-friendly"" to push people not to turtle every game until you get an experimental to leave your base.Apart from that, graphics are great, music is great, camera is very good with rotation mode when you want to watch at your badass units annihilating the enemy base, oh yeah and the DLC 'Infinite War Battle Pack"" adds very interesting buildings and units that greatly improve the different ways you can ply !Go for it ! It's a great strategy game.			"

												What to say about this game.  First visually it looks great, even several years after the release it looks great.  Gameplay wise its in shambles.  User interface and function is terrible.  Im not an expert at the so called 4x strategy games, part of this issue comes from really poorly designed user interfaces.  Instead of providing options to manage base building on the fly you are required to bounce back and forth with your units.  Couple that with an AI that can do that on the fly, makes this very frustrating.  Unit building is slow and you cant tell if something is building or not, the contruction should be individual to each building unit and not ordered by unit, so it makes unit construction slow and painful since most times when i should be seeing a massive group of units waiting for me to select, instead all i see is one and the next one is in a queue waiting because the unit from a different pool is currently be produced and this is on top of a possitive resource system with excess  resources waiting.  This is on top of the typical AI crap that is in every game, the AI will always have available the exact unit to counter my units and have almost immediate access to replacement units.  The single player game is a choir after the first two missions because of this.			"

												Think of an RTS as a rhythm game. It's all about finding a decent rhythm in unit production, to research, to micro and macro with your entire army. You must maintain your rhythm while also disrupting your opponent's. I bought this game during the Winter sale for $3.24. This game isn't even worth THAT.Here's where this game's problem comes in: this game makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense. The tutorial was written by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ seven year olds who don't the understand the basic concept of what makes an RTS an RTS. The game's rhythm is all place, it feels like Beethoven did a line of cocaine on his piano and then bashed his face on the piano keys. If my friends have to tell me to not play the Tutorial and just experience the mechanics on their own to like this game, only for me to bash my keyboard in blind fury at the stupidity of the mechanics, things aren't boding well.This is coming from a person who plays RTS games all the time. I have over 6000 hours on games like Total Annihilation Kingdoms (June 25, 1999), War of the Ring (November 4 2003), StarCraft (March 31, 1998) and StarCraft 2 (July 27, 2010) and WarCraft 3 (July 3, 2002). Mind you, StarCraft 2 came out THE SAME YEAR as this game. It took me FOUR MINUTES to understand the components of StarCraft 1 and how to play it, and even less time to understand StarCraft 2. I've played for almost over an hour and STILL don't understand what makes this game tick.Each and every one of the games I just spoke of above have superiority in all aspects, leagues above this game. Game feel, mechanics, art design, story, ease of accessibilty, easy to understand, and gameplay. I have not played any of the other Supreme Commander games, but from the looks of it, not only does this game♥♥♥♥♥♥on its predecessors, but on Strategy games as a whole.Do not buy this game.Refunded. I want my ♥♥♥♥ing $3.24 back. No words will be able to express exactly how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I am on this game. This game caused me to go on a freaking rage rant on the history of Strategy games for around two hours with my friends being forced to smile and nod. "

												After a friend had recommended it to me... I decided to give SupCom2 a try. The only other RTS game I played was CC Red Alert 3. I never really got into it. After playing this, I discovered that I really like this game and am more open to try other RTS games. This game has a great storyline (for what I have played in the first campaign so far) and an excellent gameplay. No regrets on buying. I look forward to work more towards the campaign and playing online.			"

												This game is nothing like the old Supreme Commander or Total Annihilation.To unlock new units and buildings you must research along a tech tree, not a bad idea but poorly implemented.The resource gathering/management seems overly simplified and you cant have multiple engineers work on the same project to speed it up.In the end its not worth full price, i got it at 66% off and still im disapointed.

												First off,  this isn't a bad RTS compared to some others that are available but compared to it's predecessors it's a shadow of the franchises former glory.  A more ""streamlined""  pool of units and resource management left this game feeling relatively gutted to someone who loved Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.Long story short just buy Forged Alliance and be amazed/dissapointed at what this could have been.  The graphics hold up suprisingly well and it's the alpha and the omega of what an RTS should be.  Seriously,  if you're a fan of 4x RTS (like Sins of a Solar Empire)  then you should really have it in your library.  This game is good if you prefer RTS's on a smaller scale but after playing the predecessors it feels smaller and therefore watered down to me.			"

Great to play with friends and there are almost no server problems and lots of variables, including maps, and options. I have played this multiple times, I feel the best way to learn is with friends and asking questions. Well that is how I learned. So if your going for what I have said through this review, buy it.

												Supreme Commander 2 is the ""hit"" sequel to the last game, Supreme Commander, and yet you would never know this due to the fact that they changed every single thing, pretty much leaving only superficial elements, like faction emblems.  They've gutted every single unit, every character, every part of the story, and the maps. Now, you're probably wondering ""isn't this good? I thought sequels were supposed to change stuff?"" You'd be right, but unfortunately, no change was for the better in this game. I can go on all day about the failings of this game, but to be quick about it I'll run down some bulletpoints. This review has been a long time coming, and I figured that now would be the best opportunity to do it, considering my most recent run of the game.-the gameplay has been made much simpler, which hurts it in the long run, because the developers forgot to compensate for this, and so the singleplayer is extremely easy, and multiplayer (if you can even find a match on the dead servers) is Starcraft 2-tier. Just like Blizzard's poor RTS sequels, all you do is just mass units and slam them against the opposition, without ever worrying about economy or defending multiple fronts. The original Sup Com may have had hints of this, but there was pure unit variety to make up for it, which meant strategies were opened up. With Sup Com 2, you just have basic units that you upgrade, almost like it's an RPG or something. -the upgrade system, which is supposed to be how you make your units better, is lazy and poorly implemented. It locks your entire army behind arbitrary walls and you have to upgrade before your'e allowed access to them. The upgrades don't do much to improve their survivability, as even a whole armada of tanks will fall to a small wall of defenses. Plus, the way you upgrade them (with research stations) is a no-thought process in itself, as you can just throw down 20 of them and instantly get all upgrades in no time at all. You don't even suffer an economic downturn since they cost so little. I give Starcraft some credit, at least locking units behind requirements made sense, and upgrading was a process that took time, but was worth it. It's not even worth mentioning how badly it cripples your ability to switch to another form of unit, be it land, sea or air. If you didn't waste your time and economy unlocking everything on land, and you suddenly need sea units, you're out of luck. -pathing and unit AI took a major turn for the worst, as your army will continually fumble over itself trying to go into even open corriors. Sometimes your units will prioritize looking at flowers while your base is burning half-way across the map. This is why I don't recommend attack+moving, ever. -graphically the game looks like burnt meatloaf that someone tried to save by slathering it with ketchup. The colors are too bright and don't mesh well into the environments, and the units put the ""ugh"" in ugly.  If you dont like it, too bad. Unit variety went out the window, so you'll be staring at the same ugly tanks and anorexic mechs on the same poorly rendered maps. -The maps are also unreliably stupid. Some are just poorly balanced, or not even balanced at all. Half are just ripped from the campaign, so you can tell there's laziness in the fact that some guys will get superior footholds. -Now for the story. Who here cares for story in an RTS, right? Well, I kinda did. I didn't obsess over it, but the original Sup Com had charm in its story. Sup Com 2 took notes from Starcraft 2 and had it be about some generic loner who has issues. For Jim, he had lady issues. For Dominic, he had family issues. Specifically some half-handed plot about fantastical racism. Also, there were subplots about terrorists and Dr. Brackman's extended family, but it reads more like fanfiction from people who just read Ayn Rand. William Gauge was a fun guy, but couldn't save the story. Oh, and some super weapon plot happpens later, but I doubt you'll care-lastly, the game was very poorly made, in terms of software. Even on the lowest settings, some units like illuminate experimentals will drag my framerate to a complete stop, and other things will cause the game to crash horribly. The original Sup Com didn't run perfect, but it ran consistent.  It didn't make me avoid using units due to fear of framerate drops. Overall, avoid this game, as it doesn't deserve to be called a sequel to one of the finest RTS's I've ever played. And don't be fooled by my 30+ hours played. That was me trying to justify the money I spent on the game, to avoid buyer's remorse. If you want to see how much time I put into a game I enjoy, take a look at how much I spent on the prequels to this stinker.			"

												Baby's first RTS, low unit cap and not many units make it easier for the newer players to handle, so I'd reccomend it for people either starting out in the genre or trying to get friends into RTS games. However, these features that make it easy to learn also make the game stagnate before too long, so more experienced players may want to play the original Supreme Commander, or it's expansion, Forged Alliance. TL;DR: Good for beginners, not for experienced players			"

												SC2 embodies the sprirt of the RTS genre. The multidimensional, macroscopic wars that can be waged offer an impressive approach to strategy as a video game dynamic. The sheer scale of some of the units in this game are both humbling and awe-inspiring to any player willing to consider what some of these steel behemoths would look like in real life. Also, there are a number of well made mods that add tons of new content and gameplay mechanics to SC2. I would recommend these to anyone that is getting bored with the vanilla version of the game.

												I am glad I waited until this game was on sale for a few bucks.It is definitely not even close to the value of previous Supreme Commander games.  It plays more like a fast paced MOBA or Mario type game where speed is more important than strategy.  There is a great deal of scripting which sometimes includes your own units, when they are controlled by a script and you are helpless and just have to watch and scramble your remaining units.It is way dumbed down from previous versions, and looks like it was made to appeal to a completely different crowd.I truly loved the first two games of this series, but I can't bring my self to play this beyond the first level.

												Man how do I put this?Like in a series itself its probably the best RTS since like Starcraft came out. Now I know some people may hate Starcraft like I do know but it was good when it came out till Heart of the Swarm. Anyway if you were there when this game came out and you compared it to other games based on how they looked and played you were probably strapping a firework to your back and see how fast you can get to gamestop to get that 30$ paypal card just so you could get this game. I mean I dont see many things wrong with it and thats mainly because it was made before about 78% of all developers actually cared for their games. I mean sure there is that 22% that cares about their games and dont implement a store button in the bottom right of the main screen where you can buy what your little heart desires or fat heart depending where you live *cough* *cough* america *cough*. Although I dont know if I exactly suggest buying this one because I think Forged Alliances is better due to having a bigger community that somehow acutally works on the game patching it etc. but hey dont get me wrong there is nothing wrong with this game in the slightest.

Tech dewelopment is good but it is not well thougth thrue. vs sc1 resouces are gathered and there cant be owerflow of construction u cant asist in building. There is a diferentiation in units between races but gameplay is the same. Too slow action pased against 1. artilery is useles in this game btw. Fewer types of units and buildings makes things even worse. It has nice combat animations but it all feels so slow.Art - more cartoony and i dont like models, just generic unit types. Mapsare nice but i miss the big scale o things as they were in previous game.conclusion - if ur looking for more complex game buy 1. If ur looking for a medium rts with quick to learn mechanics this is your thing. There is nothing special in sc2 just recycled mechanics with missing hearth put in the game. Still a good game but not a great game still looks fine but something is missing. "

												A DOWNGRADE of its predecessors, Supreme Commander and it's stand-alone expansion Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.If you want classic RTS gameplay like Total Annihilation, with massive maps and epic units, get Forged Alliance.The only improvement SC2 brings is better graphics. Everything else is just not as good. I don't recommend it.			"

												Its amazing, people give it hate for not thinking its as good as the first one, but it isnt the first one, its differnt, so dont even compare it to that. Anyway, i love this game so much, a little bit annoying how there are no multiplayer games ever up, but never the less amazing. Like nukes. Nukes are amazing. You launch one only to see they have a counter nuke waiting there. And then you discover mass conversion. Is that over powered or what. So this is just a win tactic to finish this Supreme Review off (See what i did there? Hehe)1) Make the 4 mass extractors around the 4 you start with. (when you spawn there are 4 around you).2) Make 3 research facilitys with your little building friends.3) After 2 is done SPAM (Not the meat) energy generators.4) Build into mass conversion research.5) Make 8 Mass Converters.6) ????7) Profit!

												so let me just sumarizestory - dumbed down klische campaign with lots of type i am the hero focusing on 1 charakter and not interesting in a sligthest. sc1 story was great it was about war this is just so bad story telling...gameplay - comand & conquer/star craft wanabee with bad execution. Tech dewelopment is good but it is not well thougth thrue. vs sc1 resouces are gathered and there cant be owerflow of construction u cant asist in building. There is a diferentiation in units between races but gameplay is the same. Too slow action pased against 1. artilery is useles in this game btw. Fewer types of units and buildings makes things even worse. It has nice combat animations but it all feels so slow.Art - more cartoony and i dont like models, just generic unit types. Mapsare nice but i miss the big scale o things as they were in previous game.conclusion - if ur looking for more complex game buy 1. If ur looking for a medium rts with quick to learn mechanics this is your thing. There is nothing special in sc2 just recycled mechanics with missing hearth put in the game. Still a good game but not a great game still looks fine but something is missing. "

In the game's defence thou I do have to say that the design and animation was great both on PC and console, but it still doesn't measure to height of the previous games.			"

												Okay...My opinion regarding SupCom2 is a little...neutral. The game itself is okay and adds an interesting twist to the SupCom universe. However, it isn't the TRUE successor to the original SupCom game.For one, the resource system. It just seems...eh. It changed from the positive/negative income and moved to building/unit pricing where you need X amount of resources to buy Y. Doesn't exactly endear me.Another point is the research tree and research points. Why?! I was perfectly okay with going through three techs. T1, T2, T3. Simple. Easy to understand. But now, I've been given a third resource. I'm a casual gamer, I don't do competitive stuff very often. Rant at me if you wish, but getting a third resource was a pain in the carping♥♥♥♥♥ When I tried to move to focus on one thing, something else suffers. Honestly, I would forget about research and then half way through the match, remember I can upgrade my stuff. So, meh. Not enthused.I do have a pet peeve. Why can't I order engineers to assist in building something? In SupCom original, build time could be cut down if you assigned an engineer to work on it, of course at the cost of using more resources. But it's gone now. I'm not pleased by the lack of that mechanic, but I can live with it. I guess...Now, I HAVE to bring up the naming. Seriously, take a moment and look at the Aeon Illuminate unit names. The 'Weedoboth' fighter/bomber? The 'Sooprizer' Experimental Gunship? The 'Fistoosh' Mobile Missile Launcher? I'm mildly amused. And I'm also questioning the alcohol content the designers possessed when they named these. That, or sleep deprivation. Or it could be they had only a week before release. I unno.One last thing. When I first played SupCom, I was blown away by this 'epic' feeling. The units and their attacks held a kind of weight to them, as if a single shot from a T3 Aeon Battleship could conceivably oneshot most structures and units. Now, these units in SupCom2 just feel dinky and unrefined, even when at maximum upgrade sometimes. Sure, it doesn't hold true to all units, but it's present in most. The build time is also shortened. When you went to build a Tech3 artillery piece on SupCom original, you EARNED it. It took an hour to build that thing, you deserve it and its firepower. In SupCom2, you have TWENTY heavy artys, maybe more. You can spam them for days and don't get me started on the nukes. I'm not even gonna step in that territory of rant. I've done enough for tonight.Long story short, if you want a sequel to SupCom original, go get Forged Alliance.			"

There is only a few maps that give you the opportunity to have air, sea, and land battles on a big scale. It's a fun game for smaller wars.			"

The look of the units in this game is amazing to look at and fun to play but their are some small issues that kinda of took away the epic feel of the first game.Smaller maps, smaller unit limit and the tech progression is no longer the tier 1,2 3 of the first game that followed its steps from the epic series total annihilation. All that thanks to square enix who made this sequel ( A big WTF when I saw that) Still its a solid RTS and good game if you're a fan of the series. 6/10			"

												As far as real time strategy games go, you really cannot do much better than supreme commander 2.Yes, square enix is basically gone.  Yes, the story line is more or less just there to say ""this game has a story.""  And yes, this game is old.But it more than makes up for it with the massive armies you can command (1000 unit count, but realistically the max is 700 individual units since you need a little space for structures... like mass extractors and powerplants).  It has just the right amount of variety of units for each faction.  Truely exotic buildings, like a structure that can instantly teleport a massive army of small units or say 50 expeariemntals (one expeariemntal is worth 50-100 normal units... just imagine what that would do to a base... or a commander's unit) in to the very center of the enemies main base, or a artically cannon that shoots smaller units instead of projectiles, or a giant magnet/meatgrinder that sucks and destroys 100s of smaller units before it has to cooldown.Exotic weapons such as a kraken submarine, flying aircraft factory, and a literal flying saucer.You can have as many as 10 commanders in one game, 5 per side.  Massive maps.  And ways to cheat resource limits, like energy to mass converters - which consume massive amounts of energy and need to be manually activated each time you use them - can provide you enough mass (resource) to make the next batch of elite units.Giant robots.  Nukes.  Floating baby belle cheese rolls of death.  Artillary arrays.  Armadas.  Armies.  More nukes.   Walking battleships.  Sky-fleets.  Giant flying brains.Need I go on?			"

												AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COST!ALL YOU HAVE TO BATTLE WITH IS YOUR SUPREME COMMANDER ROBOT AND A FEW ENGINEERS WHILE THE ENEMIES ARE BUILDING MASSIVE BASES WITH POWERFUL UNITS AND UPGRADES!I DONT GET IT... IS THIS UNFAIRNESS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY IN SOME SICK SADISTIC WAY?  WHY THE HELL CANT YOU BUILD BASES OF YOUR OWN?!?NOT TO MENTION THAT THE GAME IS RUNNING ON AN EXTREMELY UNSTABLE ENGINE WITH MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF BUGS, GLITCHES AND LAGG!I RATE THIS GAME 9/10 BECAUSE OF THE HUGE AMOUNT OF DAILY PLAYERS PLAYING ONLINE!

												Was great, superior to the first game even, until they patched it to play just like the first game (in terms of resource managment) and thus revived all the reasons i stopped playing the original title. Do not recommend.(EDIT: someone axed a question and steam wont let me type a reply over 1000 characters.)answer to question about what specifically was changed: to anyone who hasn't played the original it wouldn't really make any additional sense with context. but 'ere we go!the original game suffered from a lot of cons: slow down, extremely lengthy build queues, poor balance between factions, the necessity of having pre-created construction blueprints for base building, to name a few. the most poignant of all, however, was the resource management system this RTS employed. effectively you could queue up ANYTHING regardless of actual resource reserves or resource income rate. buildings, units, upgrades, all of it would simply go into the queue as you picked them. in most RTS games, if you can't afford something, you had to wait until you COULD to produce it. supreme commander 1 said ""nuts to something easy and efficient such as that!"" and decided that to compensate for letting you always be able to construct anything it would merely extend the production time. so now, a tier 1 tank that took 20 seconds to create with adequate resources became a tier 1 tank that takes 3 minutes to create as resources trickle in and are equally distributed amongst all queued tasks that you do not pause. this could get GROSSLY out of hand if you were not keeping up with mass and energy generation. experimentals that took 6 minutes to construct were taking 30 minutes. ain't NOBODY but a guy i knew named Andrew had time fo dat. along comes supreme commander 2 and SUDDENLY we had a resource management system that made SENSE! (we also had other marked improvements across the board from performance to simplications of unneccessarrilly complicated game mechanics, which some people, namely the aforementioned Andrew did not enjoy). The system had been changed so that you could queue up whatever you wanted but construction/progess would NOT begin until you had the total necessary resources to complete the item in the default build time. effectively the game was working like every other RTS in existence because you don't revolutionize the wheel by making it into a hexagon. along came a patch for SC2 that changed the resource management system into a carbon copy of the system from SC1. this made the game VIRTUALLY unplayable to me. i went from being able to beat the entire game to being unable to launch the game from steam because i couldn't stand that system after having been spoiled by the infinitely superior system the game launched with. the game lost ALL appeal and in an instant became unplayably boring and frustrating. They didn't even make it an OPTION. (did they? i doubt it.)			"

												I do not know who though changing the game to this style of play was a good idea but whoever they were should be baked slowly over a bed of hot coals for ruining the series with this steaming pile of dog sh*t.Single player maps are much smaller and faster paced, which helps somewhat with play length but the combat system, the story, the units, everything else has changed to use fewer units and have smaller bases.This isn't Supreme Commander, its babys first command and you are the infant as far as this game is concerned.

												In my personal opinion, this is a dumbed down version of the original games for newer players to try and understand, which can make veteran players feel confused as too why they can't 'tech' up, and have to research to get simple things such as gunships, artilleries, and such, which just doesn't feel natural, and it also makes you question the decisions the factions take, like the UEF not having a fighter/bomber but having a fighter plane and bomber plane seperately.Oh, and the campaign doesn't really mention why there's another war going on...Atleast, i couldn't find an explanationWell, atleast the seraphim aren't in this game, so atleast it makes sense...somewhat, otherwise this would just be a cluster♥♥♥♥			"

												A really fun RTS. The graphics are good but the most noticeable thing about the game are the effects. The flash of weapons firing, targets being hit, things exploding, it all looks really good and this game has some great presentation value. I'm the SUPREME COMMANDER zOMG! A lot of RTS games try to add new things and end up increasing micromanagement big time. I took two micromanagement economics classes in college, I don't need more of it lol. A lot of RTS games just feel like work instead of enjoying a game. This game gives you a way to build armies and to research upgrades and it is not overly detailed with who-cares-what-else. It is easy to get into with a quick and to the point how-to tutorial. Why can't all rts games be this intuitive? Why do they have to add layers upon layers upon layers of micromanagement and boring tedious details? Because the people who make them and play them are pretentious d-bags, that's why. I would play this over pretentious CIV games any ♥♥♥♥ing day.Although not complicated, it is still a challenge. That's the one problem I've found so far and it sucks: very uneven difficulty spikes. Missions 1-3 out of 5 in the first campaign? Whatever, it was no problem. Mission 4 in the first campaign? It was ♥♥♥♥ing stupidly hard. I got it on my third try when I realized you need to do it a specific way which is one of my biggest pet peeves with games: lack of player freedom. You can't build additional money generators in this mission so you do not have a lot of resources coming in so you have to plan it precisely. I figured out that you have to build a ton of ground/air defense towers and keep engineers repairing them and replacing them as needed. Have enough towers to guard the front and NW/NE sides and a bunch of fighter planes on guard and upgrade their health/dmg fully. Be working up to building the walking juggernaut things as quickly as you can while upgrading ground forces health/dmg fully. Keep pumping out fighter planes from two air factorys. After all this, I sent out two juggernauts with 40 air fighter support planes and blasted everything down finally. God, damn.I suppose in closing I can say this is a decent RTS game but really it just makes me want to reinstall Starcraft 2.6.5/10			"

												This game stinks compared to supreme command 1 and forged alliance. They took everything that made those two unique to the rts genre and threw it out the window. I don't even get how supcom2 is supposed to work.First all the resources became like static. Gone is the balance of energy and metals in vs spent. You can't upgrade your collectors anymore. So basically each level you are completely limited on resources. Then they severly limited the number of units you can build. All the maps are smaller. So you end up just building the biggest units you can. And then they drastically reduced the number of units. No more countering units and build specific strike groups of mixed types. And now units have upgrades instead of different level bases. So you just spam upgrades, build as much research facilities as you can and then max everything. All strategic depth, rushing vs building, what to build, what stuff to use, it's all gone.I didn't even finish it cus it's so bland. And even if you didn't play supcom1, it's still a very dull rts game. Just go get supcom1, please. Don't waste your time here.			"

												When I got this game I was very excited because I very much enjoyed the first one. The first thing I noticed was the maps, they were interesting but I liked the first one better. Then I noticed the tech tree and the units; they felt like the developers rushed this game. Not even the graphics are good enough to rationalize playing this game instead of the first. Do your self a favor, spend a little more and buy the first game.			"

												Considering how good the 1st was and espcially Forged Alliance, I would say that you are more wise to buy them. The resource system (including the research system) is stupid, and just slows the game down. Yet another boring game which is frankly overpirced, even if it is £8.99. Now I don't really care much for graphics, but I will state the graphics in my opinion have not improved, infact gone the wrong way.			"

												Babies first RTS plain and simple. Absolutely horrific economy (seriously it's one of the worst I've ever seen it's so bad you never have any resources unless you convert energy into mass) Terrible unit balancing terrible UI. The game is generally♥♥♥♥♥♥so why do I find myself enjoying it? Oh that's right. Veterans of RTS want to introduce new friends into the RTS genre to have more people to play with. But if you're not already a fan of RTS type games being thrown into SCFA (Supreme Commander Forged Alliance) Is overwhelming and you'll likely uninstall the game shortly after out of frustration. So anyone who by default does not have the brain injury required to enjoy RTS games should buy this one first. SC2 is babys first RTS which I said earlier. It's used to get new RTS players into the scene because if you stuck them into a real RTS they would fall down on their face and cry. TL:DR If you like RTS games go buy Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. If you want a friend/girlfriend/boyfriend to get INTO rts games then buy them this play it with them until they're good then buy them SCFA so you never have to play this disgusting excuse for a SC game ever again.

												If you're a fan of the first supreme commander than take note, this game:- Has less tactical elements and requires less thinking.- Has shorter, more fast paced games with less focus on strategy.- Is much easier to learn and play.- Run out of things to do faster with only three factions and a relativly small arsenal.Otherwise by all means its a great game, alot of patches and the DLC (which i heavily recommend if you want to play alot) have made it more balanced than its xbox version. If you plan on playing online have some friends because finding random online players borders on impossible. Its a good bit of fun, but not really for the more serious RPG players. The campaign is not bad at all and fighting AI can be a good way to kill time. Considering its low price and low technical requirements, by all means buy it if your looking for a cool RPG!			"

												Supcom 2 is a rather fantastic RTS game and a nice continuation of the series. While I'm not too keen on the story, I know the mechanics and units make the game on par with RTS games like Command and Conquer. The experimental are a good idea implemented well. I see some people don't enjoy it, but I'll never find out why. It's very well polished and the balance is pretty good. It's difficult for me to pick a unit that's too good. While I can think of a few that're pretty bad, one of the Aeon units in particular, that mostly comes from the overspecialization of Aeon units in particular. Either way, worth it.			"

												Definitely no.I simply love SC1 (and the expansion). I liked the serious atmosphere, the almost constant battle between resource generation and consumption, the demanding time, resources e careful planning in order to build a decent base with proper defenses. Anyway, SC1 is cool, SC2....eee....no.SC2 have its merits. The stories and more elaborate dialogues is a good thing but don't save the game. Unfortunately, good RTS games aren't make eith just good stories and dialogues. Everything that make SC1 an awesome game were removed from SC2:1 - Serious look and atmosphere - SC2 look like some kind of cartoon with bright colors from some kindergarten.2 - Resources - its easy to get and generate resources. No more paying attention or planning the construction of base or experimental units.3 - Building base - in SC1 we need to overlap shields (paying attention to energy consumption) and hope they would hold long enought while your defense structures and units take care of the enemey. In SC2, just one shield will do for everything.4 - Tactics - why bother thinking on how you will get to your enemy? Just spam anything from your factories and make them move straight for the enemy base. Pincer attacks? Too much trouble. Coordinated sea, land and air attack? Even more trouble. Artillery fire? It's boring.Anyway, the devs maybe were drunk, in a bad mood or just left their kids in charge, i don't know. But they just took everything that make SC1 an remarkable game and throw them in the trash. And painted everything with neon paint....too childish.			"

												An okay standalone game, and pretty cool really. (Voice acting and writing is godawful though)A great way to convert console gamers, but as a sequel to the beloved Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, this really does disappoint.People say that this game was dumbed down and ruined by consolification. Not quite true, as while it's undoubtedly dumbed down, Supreme Commander also got a console release (can't vouch for Forged Alliance though). I think it's a Square Enix publisher issue. For example, the unit cap was considerable larger in older games, and while it's still large by default, it doesn't live up to the old standard. However, and I think this may be a sign that the devs KNEW this game was worse, you can change your unit cap in a .prefs file in your ""Appdata\Local\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander 2\"" folder. (Only tested up to 1000.) You can also activate the ETA timer in there (another removed feature), so that when you hold SHIFT to queue, you can see a (normally incorrect) ETA. I don't really understand. It's like they added it, but it was turned off, lowered or removed at the last minute, and I can't imagine that's the devs. It's sad to see SupCom die, really, and this game can be quite a bit of fun with friends, but the campaign is awful too. The gameplay is dumbed down (but you knew that already), and the voice acting sounds like they were bored. If anyone played Spider-Man 2 on PS2, Xbox or Gamecube (but not PC - god not PC) then it's like the citizen voice acting; they sound bored as hell, and slightly underpaid and rushed. The writing is cheesy too, so I don't really know what went on there (although that trailer above really wants to push this 'awesome story').It's said for me to say I don't recommend this game; it does have it's moments; but I can't understand some of the choices made. Especially when it had such potential - well, I say that, but making games is hard, people have misfires, and while this is a big one (it killed the franchise as far as I'm aware)TL;DR: Get SC:FA if you want a really good RTS, or get Supreme Commander: Gold Edition or whatever it was called to get both 1 and FA.

												okay first off, before I say anything, I don't like this game, it made way to many mistakes, and didn't give enough content. Now to start the review, this game is great, if it weren't supreme commander, this was made to be part of the supreme commander series, and in that respect failed, the modeling was weird as well, and the gameplay was like taking all supreme commander veterans, and calling them noobs, it made the economy system so easy, all you have to do is give your acu a command and it will happen quite quickly, and way to easily.  not only that but the matches are to short, they don't offer, well, fun.  If I were to recommend this to anyone, it would be the people that want an easy RTS, and like easily made weapons of mass desruction, that just as easily fall.  I get that Square Enix had their own vision, but they didn't have the one that all of us wanted in a supreme commander game, I'm going back to forged alliance, see you on the battlefield.			"

												Talk about butchering a perfect franchise.This has to be the worst sequel to any game I've ever played.The writing is infantile. The tech system is a complete waste of time when the best tactic is to swarm you opponent with the cheapest units in the game and win in ten minutes.Defensive structures may as well not exist And the experimentals, oh the ultimate source of fear have been reduced to complete pushovers on par with the tech 2 units from the original games, which don't lack the feeling of impending doom when you spot one, you just kill it with a dozen of your weakest units and move on.Do not buy this game, and tell your friends not to buy it, I did, and I regret every second of it.

Все в игре большое, юниты (если они даже не большие, то их все равно много), карты, древо исследований. Из плюсов могу выделить графику (сейчас уже не оч, но если не графоонанировать то сойдет), естественно геймплей, и масштаб. Ост... Нуу он эпичен, как и все в игре. Из минусов могу выделить оптимизацию, но это такой минус, который не всегда актуален, ежели у вас не совсем ведро, то на высоких сойдет, а если мшина помощнее можно и на ултрах побезумствовать. Игра затягивает, в ней интересные эпичные сражения. Поставлю я это игре 8/10			"

												Terrible AI and as cool as the Units are, they are terrible.  Planes stray off, tanks sit around while they get destroyed, worker bots are hard to keep track of.  An don't even try to shield your (Experimentals) heavy units, they only work well alone.  I felt like I should just name my commander Zap Brannagin.  ""Now, like all great plans, my strategy is so simple an idiot could have devised it. On my command all ships will line up and file directly into the alien death cannons, clogging them with wreckage.""The Campaign is not fun, an a little short, after beating the game I still have no idea what any of the factions are about.  Mission starts are annoyingly unproductive and lack direction.  I hate when the explosions start shaking the screen when I'm trying to lay down a row of turret defenses, and Micro-manage my units at the same time.  Trying to put down Experimental factories are a pain. (because they're so bulky)   Plus, there is no help in the dialouge, it's just annoying, I feel nothing for any of the characters.It is worth a play if you like RTS games.  Like I said, the units are cool.  I do like the skirmish maps (lots of build space) and the ability to zoom out to full map is sweet.			"

												Do not under any circumstances purchase this game. so much has been taken out that made the first one great and so much random rubbish thrown in for no reason that this barely qualifies as Supreme Commander any more. Buy the first one or buy Planetary annihilation. Hel even total Annihilation was a better game and that came out in 1997.Despite that I do have to say that as a generic RTS it's okayish, nothing stands out as really great and the fact that it's folllowing in the footsteps of two such fantastic games just makes it seem like dog ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in comparison.

												This one is a tricky one for many reasons. Ive seen other reviews and people say that they have played many strategy games and this one is a good one and  i agree. This game on its own is a decent strategy game, with more tactics then strategy though. The so called strategy is basic and ""streamlined"". It takes no real brains to play and is just a spam fest. Its just build big units send them at your enemy in waves and whoever does the best job or sucks the least wins is what it boils down to. I was excited when this game first came out being a fan of the first supreme commander and supreme commander forged alliance. If you analyze this game from its predisessors this game is a huge let down. The graphic quality is inferior to that of the first supreme commander in my opinion. There is very little unit variation which is sad because the first 2 had so many diverse units that each had their role on the battle field. The one thing in my opinion that kills this game if you are a fan of the first two games is the eco system. In my opinion that alone was a major stepback in the wrong direction. In all they took the core concepts that made the first 2 titles great, ""streamlined"" them and made a game for casuals  ( which is not nessessarily a bad thing).  If your a newcomer you will enjoy this game, if you have played the other two this game will have little replayabilty value after a short time.			"

												I've tried writing a review harping on about everything in detail but I can’t do it, this will have to do.Simply don't buy this game, the graphics have gone down the drain, storytelling went the way of Hollywood Godzilla/Transformers, away from the interesting bits and focusing on the humans and their sob story. Building stuff is a drag if you don't have the exact ""change"" then you can't even begin construction, nothing seems to run on power ergo no way to tie up resources to choke the shields, meaning usual tactics are out of the window, this truly has become a spam and attack RTS.Everything has been changed, mostly for the worse, the experimentals all became smaller and less impressive or non-existent, they are all built by factories now and even the experimental factories can’t begin constructing the experimentals until you have exact change. I nearly cried when I saw the Fatboy enter the scene in campaign, no shields, no AA and not a factory, the size of the Fatboy has also gone down in size it doesn’t even resemble the one from Supreme Commander or FA.Simply put, if you like Supreme Commander then don’t buy this or maybe do so you’ll be able to appreciate FA even more.

Great graphics for it's time (compared to other games). It has a great multiplayer feaure. Public multiplayer games as well! Skirmish for offline with changing the diffuculty of the AI to your likings. Campaign can be lived without and this game would still be amazing! I HIGHLY reccomend this game to my friends and anyone else.""  ~Budderball			"

												After being an avid fan of the Supreme Commander series from the original, i expected this to be epic. It's not.It's so dumbed down that in parts it feels like some of those 'strategy' mobile games. The attnetion to detail is gone from every aspect of the game, right down to unit names. The experimental units don't feel like an acheivement to build at all, in fact you can just spam them late game as everyone else does and just win by numbers.There is almost no intelligent defense systems, building your base feels like you mayaswell be back in Age of Empires not in Supreme Commander.All in all this game feels like the developers looked at the original and thought 'meh, i like shinies'. Don't waste your money when there is still Forged Alliance!			"

Remove most of those units, reduce the visual quality drastically, make it look cartoony, reduce the size of maps so the largest of maps are smaller than the smallest maps in the first game, and make it so engineers sit around doing nothing if you don't have every single bit of energy and mass you'll need to build it.After you do all of that, you get Supreme Commander 2.

												It's the worst Supreme Commander/Total Annihilation Game Yet. If it was called anything else it would have been okay - but then it would be called a rip-off. Suming it up, it might be close to okay, but it angered the fans and players of the previous games as the removed almost everything that was liked about the series. I'm only a little bitter.			"

												I bought this game on sale a while back because I had fun memories of Supreme Commander 1. The game feels lackluster compared to Supreme Commander 1. The building system is pretty linear and lack luster and it feels like there's a lack in unit option. In order to build better units they implemented a research system, it's a resource that generates overtime and you can increase the resource generation by building more research stations.What makes the game incredibly unfun is that it feels like you need to commit to one type of army because of the research system. If you build a land army and commit your research on it but later on you want to add an air army into the mix the air army will be incredibly weak making your overall army weaker.I bought this for the campaign. In the campaign, the naval army isn't always available to be built in most of the campaign, it's specially important for the Cybrans because their naval army has a research that allows them to walk on land and the ships are pretty overpowered compared to land units. The game only comes with 18 missions, 6 missions per race and all the missions aren't difficult.The skirmish felt much better in SC1. I enjoyed skirmishes turtling it out against hordes of insane AI armies marching in the door. What makes this less appealing is that only the UEF has a tier 2 defense, plus there aren't any walls you can build.Overall the game is best defined as meh. If your interested in checking out this RTS, you should buy Supreme Commander 2 first then buy Supreme Commander 1 and Forged Alliance so that you will feel like the gameplay was improved.			"

												while it pains me to not recommend this game. Because while it updated the graphics and AI, Supreme Commander 2 changed many things: it changed its Economy from Supreme Commander 1 and Forged Alliances floating economy system to full payment upfront. it took away many unit types and Supreme Commander 2 was attemting to obsolete the 'clumsy' tier system with the the Research System (which i though was kind of neat to an extent), the maps are far to small and the maximum pop cap is 500 and the maximum map size being 40x40km (approx.) compared to SupCom and Forged Alliances maximum pop cap 1000 and the maximum map size is 81x81km. now i get to my final item the Experimentals because in Supreme Commander 2 they made them Dirt Cheap to build but stong enough to take out a fair bit of low tier units, but  in SupCom and Forged Alliance when you started building that Experimental  you knew  your economy could handle the strain and when it was done you felt a sense of pride when it was finished, because if you didnt have a stong enough economy just building the cheapest Experimental would break your economy.

												Awful writing. Awful characters I don't care about. Awful dialog. Okay, so, RTS games aren't 100% about the single player, and it's okay that this one has an awful campaign.I come from the background of Starcraft/Warcraft, where I probably have 500+ hours played on Starcraft 2's ladder, making it to masters league. I'm a very skilled RTS player, and I do not know how this game could ever have a competitive scene, as the tools to be a better player just do not exist with  such a lack of depth in skill.How can you expect me to play an RTS that doesn't have hotkeys to create a unit when you select that building? With such a bad UI? There's no menu options to change hotkeys that already exist, even! It was released a few months before Wings of Liberty, and you can't have this quality of production with such a huge competitor arriving on the scene in the same year.The clicks and keys are unresponive, I can never really tell if my unit ""understood"" that I gave them a command. The combat is slow, the units are boring, and the only distinguishing factor about this game (the command overview, zooming out to see the entire battlefield) apparently was done better by its predecessor which is now modded to be a better experience.I was excited to get an RTS game in a Humble Bundle. Especially one that has 87% positive reviews on Steam. I would not buy this game for any amount.			"

You check your own army, do you got enough defence turrets, resources and machines to drive them back? Your cannons start to pounder against the enemy while they advance against you, then you realize that one of your experimental robot is ready for battle. You get quick smirk on your face and counter-attack. You think you got the enemy on the run, suddenly you feel a cold chill running down your spine.

												First of all, supreme commander 2 is NOT a bad game. It is just different from the others in the supreme commander franchise. The main point of the game is the same (destroy enemy commander) but the economy and gameplay are a little different from the rest. Overall, supreme commander 2 is my favorite because of the differences in the game compared to the rest of the franchise.			"

												This game is honestly a lot of fun. As a casual RTS gamer I can honestly say that this is the hands down most satisfying large map RTS. The game usually consists of major battles that actually make you feel like you are controlling an actual army. The battles are visually a lot like Star Wars with lasers on both sides being flung out mindlessly towards the enemy.			"

												8.5/10Pretty good game, seeing as how they expanded it in the direction I wanted them to from the first game. Expanded research, actually strategy instead of throwing stuff at the opponenet, and all the usual graphics and stuff that come with a new game. However, they basically halved the general map size, reducing match length, and they removed the different tier levels, which had its pros and cons. Overall, a great game following up from the first one.			"

To be fair, I think most of the criticisms were valid as compared to the original: smaller map scale, smaller unit count, simplified game mechanics, etc.. That being said, as a general RTS's go, this is a very fun game. You can have huge battle with hundred of robots duking it out on land, sea, and air. Just as importantly the game is very well optimized so you can field huge armies with no lag. If you love SUPCOM and TOTAL ANNIHILATION, this will scratch the itch unti PLANETARY ANNIHILATION is released.			"

												OK first of all I'm only recommending this game because it IS fun on it's own, but if you want a true sequel to supreme commander this is not it.  The battles are smaller and much less epic feeling than the originals, but to make up for this the units you do make are more important and custimizable through research.  I felt the story wash lacking any real charm and didn't really satify me with the ending, but multiplayer and skirmish matches are very fun indeed.  These battles ""almost"" bring it to the epic feeling of supreme commander originals.  All in all though, this game is very fun and is a good game to play if your bored out of mind or need to hold you over until another game come out.			"

												Great example of what an RTS should bring to the table! The singleplayer is a little bit lacking, but the game really comes to shine in the multiplayer mode, where every game ensures epic battles, aided by the constant decision making that shows in every great RTS. Supreme Commander 2, whilst a bit rusty and ambiguous at certain points and lacking a bit of flair in the singleplayer, still provides an experience that is well worth the $13 price tag.			"

												This game is awesome for any RTS fan.  The scale is enormous and takes on multiple battles on seperate fronts.  It requires a lot of multitasking.  Maps are twice to four times the size of SC II, but the bigger units are pretty visible on the map.  My favorite aspect of this game is the pure awesome sight of watching your huge monstrous units walk the map; they don't just dwarf the smaller units, they make them look like ants!!  It's so much more different than other RTS games in the scale of battle alone.			"

												For someone looking to resurect the flames of the Supreme Commander in a new light, this game MIGHT be for you.  The video and constant action playing out, on screen, keeps your intrests in the battle and always moving focus between researching and fighting back.Unfortunatly the game feels like a lite version of the previous ""forged Alliance"" game. A lack of units on the field tends to diminish the deep intrest a player might want to build on.  Matches change from 4 hour long epic battles to 1 hour quick matches.  THis is due to the decreased map sizes and new lack of battle straegies, due to the lack of units to play with.			"

												This may be a bit late, but i thought it would be wise to share my thoughts on this game, as far as Strategy games go, this is one of the largest scaled ones i've seen, giving massive battlefields, high-tech units and destructive power to everything, unleashing my inner desire to kill everything in a large area, while having a big play area to have so much fun with! Up to 8 player maps, maxed out games can end in 15min or up to 2hours long, giving a wide variety of ways to build your forces and face your enemy head on in this large-scaled-high-tech-land/air and navel weaponary pure destructive fun, this would have to be hands down one of the best i've played, even after the game has been out for so long, people are playing it everywhere today. So as far as you should play it or not? i think yes, yes you should play this game.			"

												My favorite RTS game standing alongside Dawn of War: Soul Storm.  It's very in depth and every faction is balanced fairly not to mention the units.  Each faction has a special little quirk to them that can be unlocked through research.  The Illuminate can build on water, the Cybran's navel units can walk on land, and the UEF can produce a flying aircraft carrier as well as a regular one.  There are lots of things that make each faction play differently.The campaign is very impressive and provides a good challenge as well as a great story (im my opinion).			"

I'm glad I tried it.   The things I was expecting to be dumbed down were not dumbed down.   It has better graphics, and some interesting changes.   It is geared for faster playing.   My biggest complaint would be the need for some larger maps.   Other than that this is a good game and I got it for a steal.			"

Maps are twice to four times the size of SC II, but the bigger units are pretty visible on the map.  My favorite aspect of this game is the pure awesome sight of watching your huge monstrous units walk the map; they don't just dwarf the smaller units, they make them look like ants!!  It's so much more different than other RTS games in the scale of battle alone.			"

												OK first of all I'm only recommending this game because it IS fun on it's own, but if you want a true sequel to supreme commander this is not it.  The battles are smaller and much less epic feeling than the originals, but to make up for this the units you do make are more important and custimizable through research.  I felt the story wash lacking any real charm and didn't really satify me with the ending, but multiplayer and skirmish matches are very fun indeed.  These battles ""almost"" bring it to the epic feeling of supreme commander originals.  All in all though, this game is very fun and is a good game to play if your bored out of mind or need to hold you over until another game come out.			"

												This game, obviously has a different set up than SC1 and FA. It is a dumbed-down version of SC1. I would still recommend this game, it holds its own in the RTS world, but in many peoples' opinion, the new interface and engine doesn't compare to FA and SC1. I agree. I would recommend checking SC1 and FA before buying this game. One thing that most people find nice about this game, is the fact that the matches are usually shorter. Experimentals are much easier to get, but are also not as overpowered. I find this to be a nice setting because it leads to a slightly different change in gameplay then what SC1 and FA offered. All in all, a well-rounded game with a change of pace. If you're a fan of RTS, chances are you'll enjoy this one for a while. SC1=Supreme CommanderFA= Supreme Commander Forged Alliance			"

												Massive let down over the first. If there ever was an example of taking a game and ripping anything and everything great about it out and then putting a 2 on it this would be it.Want massive maps with crazy units attacking epic bases? Go play supcom 1.Sorry, I am a big fan of the first. Having said that 2 is easier to learn and play, has some fun moments during MP and you will enjoy pumping out huge numbers of the games experimental units. If you and your mates want to load up for some quick FFA action this could be the right game. This game is worth the sale price of 14.99USD (in australia).			"

												Been a big Squaresoft gamer, since FFII on SNES.  Been a big Cavedog player, since Total Annihilation, the predecessor in the future timeline of the Supreme Commander series, when the wars were over and left nothing.  But war.  Played the demo and was not impressed with its mythological aproach/introduction to units of each faction.  When I got the game though, it was a whole 'nother story (quite literally!).  I enjoyed immensely the plotlines of each faction and their tie-in's.  It was done well, and the pacing was good on Normal difficulty.  I got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked on Hard at first.  Definitely toned down from Forged Alliance in terms of resource management, but shifts focus to the war effort and strategy without the constant monitoring of resource influx.  I love them all, and each version/sequel honestly stands alone.			"

												I love this game, it's a bit more accessible to newbs than SC and FA (I actually played this first as a training game, then moved on to SC and FA) but as others have mentioned, it's still not as good due to a lot of the depth and scale being dumbed down to make it more accessible.I'm pretty crap when it comes to multiplayer, which is why I kind of just stick to skirmishes unless my mates are online (who are equally as crap), then we'll com-stomp some Hard AI's. It's just a shame I can't get my two friends to play FA because they're elitist scumbags who automatically assume ""Older game = Worse Game"" Still a good game though, and better than a lot of games in it's price bracket at usual selling price. If you're reading this while the game is in a sale then stop reading - there's no justification of not buying this game for ~£3.40 inc. DLC (unless you can't afford it, of course).			"

												If you're looking for epic battles, get SupCom 1. SupCom 2 is a step backward in many regards.  There are quite a few gambreakers (like aegis shields requiring manual regeneration, mass conversion being automated [having to select all your mass converters and pressing Alt+M every 6/20 seconds is not fun at all).The number of units has been downscaled. There is a research tree system now.  Experimentals are now a slightly larger unit rather than the awesome units they had been.Overall, it's not a bad game. It plays more like a Command and Conquer title on a larger scale (I like CnC).Get it for less than $10.			"

												Ok, absolutely wonderful game, I play it often with friends and in skirmishes. I played the Stronghold games for years, and this game is a wonderful take on that kind of gameplay.I only have one real issue with this game, and it gets pretty annoying after a few times--The game RANDOMLY CRASHES ON ME.I mean, I love this game as it is, but it's awful to be 33 minutes in game with a 400+ army, then have it suddenly and without reasonable cause close to the desktop.This has happened to me on several occasions, and from what I've seen online, this is not an uncommon problem. I really hope there will be an update or patch to fixing this soon, or some way of easily fixing this major issue.All in all, AMAZING game, I love to play it and all, just PLEASE FIX THE CRASHING PROBLEM.TL;DR--Awesome game, Super Reccommended. 9/10 for me, and only because it randomly crashes. (And get the DLC too; It's a great add-on.)Thank you.			"

												Less micromanaging so it's easier to climb into and develop a strategy. Then again the strategy is either spam nukes, or expand slowly with defences and artillery.if you can make a team where one person is aggressive and the other is defencive minded then you will have a solid team.

												First-of-allSupreme Commander 2 isn't the prequel of Supreme Commander: Forged Allience!So, after we cleared that let's talk about Supreme Commander 2.Yes! Supreme Commander: Forged Allience is better then this one, of course it came after it but this one is still a really good RTS!Let's try to split this review into four parts.-Positive facts-Mixed facts-Negative facts-Personal AddsPositive facts-Supreme Commander 2 is the refined version of Supreme Commander where they tried new things and improved It. -This game works on a toaster, the game doesn't need much requiements and works pretty fluent on older PCs-It is easier, wich makes it more playable for newcomers and give playes that don't play RTS a game they can learn and love it.-This game is still ""alive"", this game is still getting played by 30k players in the last two weeks-It got a (""deep and powerful""-PC Gamer) story that is really intresting and exciting-It looks still good, you wont believe it but for a game that was released 2010, it's pretty-It has Multi-Monitor Support and got some pretty cool features like tactical maps on the one site of the monitor etc. that are really cool-It got a really fast and addicting gameplay, you can play for hours without even realising it-Got a tech-tree where you can upgrade your units and expand your arsenalMixed facts-It splited the Supreme Commander community into two smaller communities-Doesn't got something unique-A.I. have some problems with the movement but this doesn't happen oftenNegative facts-I am happy that I don't have to write something down for the negative facts because they isn't something gamebreaking or something very awful, but if you want someone to hate this game for some reason you can read the review from Geoff Hunt ->Review link[www.gamerevolution.com]<-Personal Adds-This game is one of the best RTS you can find nowadays but his sequel Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is better and cheaper.-This game is PERFECT for newcomers and people that hadn't play RTS-Games before and give them an easy and pretty cool game to playConclusion:->If you are new to the RTS genre, buy this game!->If you are familiar to RTS but want to have an easy game and want to ""test"" the SupCom Series, buy this game!->If you are familiar to RTS and want something challenging, buy Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance or better buy the Gold Edition so you can see what this and the newer game is based of.

												Pretty fun game. It's a bit dumbed-down compared to SupCom1 IMO, but still a nice RTS. Kinda wish micro wasn't as important as it is here, but whatever. At least you don't need whole night to finish one game as opposed to SupCom1 skirmishes. ;-)In short, I feel it's quite underrated. The tactical view as known from SupCom1 is still here (aka, zoom out to see the WHOLE battlefield) and that's what I really, really miss in other RTS games.			"

Many of the unique features present in the first installement are missing from part two, all thats left is ""just another RTS game"".Enjoyable graphics, even a hint of story in the (short) campaign.Add to that quite a few bugs, many crashes (last Illuminate mission is almost unplayable). Often the cursor dissapears, you have to restart the game. When it crashes once again you long for a quicksave/quickload but the game doesnt offer that.			"

												Supreme Commander 2: Supposed to be the continuation of the first title: Forged Alliance.As a ""new"" player in Supreme Commander 2, I completely agree with all the other negative reviews of the game, but I'll tell you more about something I have seen it's not covered.The maps are small because the developers decided it would've been a good idea to implement 4v4 matches in which 1 real life second lasts 4 or even 5. You end up having rounds that take 5 hours but should've took 1. All the system configurations are very good so it's not that, it's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ communication system. Well done.Secondly, if you disconnect, you can't rejoin and you die. Yeah, this is a feature that you need.Third, path finding: You have air units, and you redirect their path a bit to the left to the arrival point? You better wait till they rotate 360°, which takes an immense amount of time especially with experimentals.Experimentals, more like useless pieces of standing or flying breads, besides the special buildings: They aren't even balanced, they cost less yes but they're really ♥♥♥♥♥♥..Even when they fall down.Fourth, Apparently two engineers can't work on the same thing at the same time.Fifth: I hope you don't like ground units, (Especially experimentals) because they're disgustingly slow. The only way to win is by spamming  normal bombers.Sixth: AI, for some reason their conversion rays have an immense range (Not kidding here), and they can still convert things underwater (Whilst I've read they shouldn't be able to)Seventh: There are like 1/4 of the units in FA.TL;DR: Looking for a good supreme commander game? Go for FA, yeah it's still laggy if you play in multiplayer (justified because it's an old game), but it's better.			"

												     This game is a classic, and it surely was made during the dark age of RTS games, where strategy games were nearing extinction and after my favorite RTS base builder series got ♥♥♥♥ed over by removing bases.      All my units look like toys and ants, and the entire game feels pretty well thought out. Some of the amphibious units are amazing, and the projectile system is spectacular especially when it comes down to missles and artillery. They even got point defense and all the things that makes land/sea battles at an epic level.     I never played the origenal Supreme Commander, however there is enough single player content in this to satisfy the waning multiplayer community. I recommend it, dispite the publishers infamity that is wrongly placed on them since they don't make games, they only market and sell them using contracts that will screw a company over if they F up only once.

												This to date has to be the RTS I have played the most. I have replayed the whole campaign on a number of occasions. Also play skirmishes and multiplayer with my friends on a regular basis. It is quite a different game from SupCom 1 due to the way the research has been changed. But I think it makes for a faster paced game.Each side has its Pro's and Con's, lending themselves better to either your play style or the distribution of land & sea. Overall a fantastic game.My only real criticism is that there is no native map creator/editor. This is something the game sorely needs. If they released a new DLC which added a new storyline/maps and a map/scenario creator then TAKE MY MONEY!			"

												Brillaint game. I know there was a lot of hate towards the game from some of the community because it was not set on such large maps as the previous game. But you get used to it pretty quick and it makes sense. It was never meant to be a direct clone but a step forward in design, graphics and performance. There are plenty of unique units (even more if you get the add-on pack) and a good single player experiance. Multiplayer for me was tough as there are too many really good hardcore players out there that could get hundreds of units while I still had no defense and olny a handfull of crap units. So I much prefered to play with me and a friend against the AI. The only down side for me is that there is no map editor and no new DLC. Hope one day the Dev's release a map editor.			"

												If you liked SupCom 1, this is absolutely nothing like it and you should probably avoid it entirely. Campaign mode (which is as much as I ever want to play of it) is very anime. The scope of the game has been scaled down considerably, which is a feat considering it's based almost entirely around building giant hulking end-game units.  To its benefit, everything is vastly streamlined when compared to its predecessor, and the economy system makes more sense to a newcomer. Everything else, though, is basically reinventing the wheel when they already had a pretty decent one to work with.			"

												Has alot of similar gameplay elements to the old school Total Annihilation, but unfortunately lacks the variety that TA offered, such as varying defense buildings and a larger array of units.  What it lacks for in what was mentioned, it offers ""research"" to tailor your strategy.  All in all, its a semi-stripped TA with updated graphics.			"

												It's fun, but cant say i highly recommend it. Bought it on Sale and so should you if you intent to buy it. As advance as the tactics were in the first Supreme Commander and its expansion, you're not gonna find this here. It's an experimental buildfest were i really dont have the feeling that they are ""experimental"". You build them by the dozens and its just another unit like the rest and most are not even that powerfull in comparison to regular unit. Unit tiers are gone and basic units are not unlocked at first. Other then that a lot of tech just seem to have been lost in between the years of the first and second game. When in doubt, don't buy.			"

												This is a very different animal from the original. It's a good game. This sequel excells at co-op against the AI, and predictably the single player aspect suffers for this. Unit limit caps are much lower, maps are smaller, options are fewer, and everything is simplified and streamlined to make for faster gameplay in the multiplayer environment. With all that said it is a superior entry into the RTS feild even if it doesn't scratch the same itch as the first one.			"

												This is somewhat conflicting for me. Yes, I would recommend this game if it was a standalone. It's a solid, albeit somewhat simple RTS that is easy for newcomers to dive into. With that said, it is a complete downgrade from SupCom 1/FA. To put it into perspective, just one of the five factions in SupCom FA has almost as many unit types as all four in Supreme Commander 2. But back to this game alone. If you are new to the series and want an RTS with some degree of depth, then this is it. But if not, or if you're a more seasoned RTS player, than pick up Supreme Commander Forged Alliance.  "

												Your ability to like this one is heavily dependent on whether you bought it just because it's called as a direct sequel to Supreme Commander. The map sizes are smaller, battles are more frenetic, and instead of balancing upgrading tiers versus feeding the meat grinder, you have to balance collecting research points now. All in all, the gameplay has changed a lot, but it's still decent on it's own merits.The single player campaign is kinda crappy, though. Story is total garbage7/10			"

												The game is not terrible in it's own rights. But the same can be said about Command and Conquer 4. If you have no idea what SupCom franchise is, and better yet are not that into huge strategy games, then getting SupCom2 is not a bad call. It's fast paced, it has cool units, and some interesting mechanics. For a heavy discount it is okay. But you know what is a better deal? Buying Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. It's a standalone expansion to the original SupCom, and a pinnacle in the short lived franchise. The scale is epic, and does not compare to anything. 81x81km maps with orbital lasers, nuclear artillery with global range, and clashes of 500 units a piece? You bet. Forged Alliance is simply unique, and there is no game to date that managed to repeat the formula. SupCom2 is a bland, boring ""we want to make a second Starcraft"".Oh, and if you are into story based singleplayer, forget about SupCom2. It is absolute garbage. Get original SupCom instead (3 campaigns, 1 per race, all worth while)			"

												This game, compared to the first one is no where near as good. It is a scaled down, dumbed down, mess that is an insult to the brilliant Supreme Commander. I bought this game when it originally came out at the release price of 40 pounds, and I have never bought another game at the same price that was equally disappointing and left me feeling regretful that I bought it.This is a lousy game that doesn't even deserve the sale price of $6.50. This game boasts less unit types, smaller maps, a horrible in-skirmish tech tree (seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking) and general all round badness. Buy the original. It's cheaper, and 10x as better.			"

												This is exactly how a sequel should be, at least in my opinion. It changes the game in the correct areas. It takes the base game and does a lot more than just upgrade the graphics or make minor changes. It is Supreme Commander done differently and because of this the two games can coexist just beautifully. This sequel adds new strategic elements because the unit and structure progression is done in a different way. By getting this game you add to the SC experience, you don't replace it (if you own the first game that is, which you really should because it is awesome).I'm not really sure if this is better than the original but it kind of doesn't matter. They are both great on their own merits.			"

												If you've never played Supreme Commander, then you have missed something. A classic RTS with some very interesting elements, huge maps, lots of units and massive battles. The expansions and sequel are also very good, however they do bring very little new things to the table.It reminded me of M.A.X. (Mechanised Assault & Exploration.) Also a great game, better said a ""Good Old Game"", however it is a bit aging now.

												Supreme Commander 2 is the ultimate strategy game. It has an effective multiplayer skirmish system, and if you want to play by yourself, there is a reasonably good campain as well as a great AI battle skirmish. The maps are beautiful and gameplay is fairly simple to learn. Unit AI is not perfect, but that is to be expected to soem degree. The enemey AI are very good if you want them to be, but are still within the range of bing defeated, if you put a lot of time and effort into it. Getting forward in the campaign is harder than I think it should be, and there are multiple stages that you can see were mot as thought out. However, the storyline is pretty good, and is not nessesary to play.  Overall, I would give the game an 8.75 out of 10.			"

												It's just so much sound and fury. There's a lot going on, but there's no real feel that I'm actually controlling anything besides clicking a bunch of buttons until I inevitability build up enough troops to just head to the only path towards the enemy and achieve victory through the barest planning and barest strategy. Comparrisons to the original are inevitable, if this game's pedigree didn't come from a solid history I wouldn't have gotten it . Mostly what I find distressing is how dumbed down and just ugly it looks to the original. On the surface they look similar, but the maps are tiny, confined and uninspired. The AI is lazily written where the enemy just sends a constant stream of the same enemies along the same path continiously. The plot...well the plot was serviciable in the first one, but in the sequel it's straight up offensive. For instance, how do you not know who a guy's wife is when you're planning a coup when said guy controls a giant mech with unlimited potential?At the end of the day, this feels more like a cash grab then a serious attempt at a game. At least I didn't pay full price.			"

												I love the first part and the expansion pack. I played those a lot. And I really mean a lot. It is hard and the micromanagement is really necessary to rule the battlefield. In this sequel, this micromanaging option is gone. The game is more fast-paced. No need to build a strong economy. You just need to build some necessary buildings and you can create experimental units within 10 minutes. But it has a charm. :) The research trees are unique for every faction and every faction has it's own strengths and weaknesses, but the balance is great. It is more like a C&C, then Supreme Commander, but it's still good, especially the multiplayer with live opponents.			"

This game is also very well optimzed! the first game would bog down for me in larger battles regardless of graphics settings but in this game I have been in 8 player battles with 1000+ units shooting eachother and the framrate didnt even noticably drop. 7/10 would build nuke defense and forget to build anti nuke missles for it and get nuked anyway again!

												This game is insanely fun and awesome. If you like strategy games, you probably want to get this, I really enjoyed playing this game. It is great on just skirmish mode, but adding the campaign and complete story too, it was a nice addition. All three factions are fun to play with and the game is varely balanced. Its also pretty stable but from time to time, in a 4 hour session, it will crash, but only if you try spamming. Now putting aside how much I like this game and start being more like a critic. I say my final words, don't quote me on this(but I will)""The game is farely well made and has the basics down pretty good, it could have some changes done to it to make it better, and more like Forged Alliance but overall I recommened this game""(minelion1 1).

												Still one of the best RTS's availibleIts a bit smaller and faster than its big brother but its still a giant of a game. In some ways it is the superior of the two, though it doesnt match the grand scale of the early title it is still bigger than almost all other RTS.It plays well, still looks great has a huge selection of units, buildings and maps. Base defence is viable(!!!) killing your enemy with long range arty or nukes is an option aswell as armys of hundreds of units and/or some epicly large ones on land, sea or in the air. A simple but effective tech tree opens up various options and adds research managment to the mix of resources. You can even custimise the game by removing particular things like nukes or experimental units, speeding or removing research etcYou cannot say you are an RTS player if you dont own this game.Get it, get it now.

												Supreme Commander 2 is the successor to the critically-acclaimed Supreme Commander 1 and Supreme Commander Forged Alliance titles made by Gas-Powered Games and published by Square Enix.  In the distant future, wars will be fought not by hordes of manned armies but rather swarms of drones remotely commanded by people in giant robots in the battlefield for some reason. This toned down sequel has drawn either much praise or a lot of vitriol from its community.  With such mixed responses, one may wonder if this game is even worth playing, let alone looking at it.  This review hopes to answer that question (summary below):	-Story:  Being a game published by Square Enix, one would expect story to be the primary focus of the game, but it seems that even the story in SupCom2's case was toned down in comparison to its predecessor (even though it was enough for me to want to see what the end looked like).  Throughout the 18 campaign missions divided equally between the United Earth Federation (UEF), Aeon Illuminate and the Cybran Nations, the three factions struggle to keep a fragile alliance together from internal plots to thrust one side into power over all others.  While this may sound dramatic, the tone never gets too grim while also avoiding an overly idealistic view.  The main characters sound like interesting concepts, but they're all executed in an uninteresting way with monotonous speech and limited facial expressions.  It also doesn't help that the FMVs feel lacking and empty.  Despite these facts, the campaigns still provide the benefit of practice for the multiplayer community, at least enough to familiarize the player with each faction.  It's still recommended to practice in skirmish mode and within the multiplayer community itself though.  Whether you care about the story or not, the campaign is at least something to pass the time and learn about the game.  Score:  3/5    	-Graphics:  One of the main complaints voiced by fans of the previous Supreme Commander games is that the graphics in SupCom2 aren't nearly as spectacular as its predecessor.  While they aren't as bad as they could be, the presentation of the game is rather simple in a way that's almost lackluster in both unit and world design.  Even on the highest graphical capabilities, the game looks like something made out of legos almost.  The scaling is also a little strange, but it's understandable as to why the developers took this path:  They were betting on the idea that gamers in the start of the 2010's wouldn't be able to afford powerful computers with the best hardware on the market.   As a result, those whom had played the first game and eagerly awaited a new and improved sequel were disappointed while it didn't discourage newcomers from entering the franchise.  If you're the kind of person who doesn't care too much about graphics, this is the game for you.  If you wanted something even more realistic than the first, look elsewhere.  Score:  3.5/5	-Gameplay:  Another complaint by the fans of Supreme Commander 1 and Forged Alliance was that the gameplay was toned down in terms of complexity for SC2.  While Supreme Commander 2 is simpler than its predecessor in terms of strategic depth, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  The goal of the game is to assert your military supremacy with swarms of unmanned units while also avoiding total annihilation.  Units are constructed out of two resources:  Building Mass, and energy which is easier to harness since generators can be placed anywhere as opposed to mass extractors which are placed on strategic points and must be secured.  Instead of tiers, factions can invest research points that are accumulated over time to improve their units on the spot with increased gains in research the more research facilities are constructed.  Rather than requiring buildings dedicated to unlocking research though, one can just simply access their tech tree and spend points on what they can afford.  While this does sound better than the typical method of improving units, it can be tedious or outright absurd to feel the need to relearn upgrades every single game.  SupCom2 also benefits from allowing players to plan joint-operations with their land, naval and air units and the sheer size of one's armies, fleets and squadrons is still impressive with support up to as many as 500 units per team.  While some may complain about the downgrades given to each faction's late-game experimental units, they are still powerful enough to require planning to deal with effectively.  The view of the game is also impressive since not only is there a typical minimap with fog of war that's already drawn, players can zoom out and view the entire battlefield to coordinate multiple assaults in real time.  It may seem overwhelming at first, but it won't be take long to improve one's micro-management and multi-tasking skills.  To put it simply, if you're looking for a game with strategic-depth that's important for a long-term goal, play SupCom 1.  If you are more a fan for smaller-scale battles of tactics, SupCom 2 is the game for you.  Score:  4.5/5-Sound:  Even though it seems that sound wasn't a high-priority for Supreme Commander 2, there's still a small OST that might have been complimented if it only had more songs and influences from the kind of music heard in games like Hawken or Battletech.  There is a recurring leitmotif here that may be detected on and off, but is rather downplayed in contrast to everything else.  Fittingly, there is dynamic music in Supreme Commander 2 that shifts to match the intensity of the battle with almost nothing but wind at the start and a building orchestra that climaxes once the battles rage.  The warnings for this game only tells you of critical information that requires immediate attention such as “Nuclear launch detected” or “Commander under attack”.  The voice acting for the game feels mostly restrained, with lines alternating between hit-and-miss sarcastic remarks and attempts to add character development that fall flat most of the time.   Not much to say here, but it probably could have used something more.  Score:  3/5	-Replayability:  Despite the divided fanbase in regards to Supreme Commander 2 and its predecessor, SC2 still has hundreds of players in the multiplayer community.  The community hub is still fairly active, and there is a modding community for the game as well, just like the first game.  Even if you're not into multiplayer, Supreme Commander 2 has a campaign that would probably last the average player about a week or a week and a half to complete just for the regular objectives alone.  For completionists, there are also hidden objectives to discover in each campaign mission to improve one's score.  There is also skirmish mode which can be played against AI with misleading difficulty values.  Fortunately the game's AI opponents are relentless enough even on Normal to improve one's strategy and drive them to feel accomplished as they eventually defeat their opponents.  The good news is that this game will last a good while for fans of short-term RTS games.  Average life expectancy would probably be around a month just for the singleplayer alone and several for multiplayer if it still lives on.  Considering that the story ending on a cliffhanger that probably won't be answered any time soon, if at all, SC2 is in no danger of being replaced by a sequel unless a spiritual successor is developed.  Score:  4/5-Summary:  Supreme Commander 2 is the kind of game that's enjoyable in its own merits. If it weren't so conflicting with the lore, it's probably be more tolerable to SupCom 1 fans if SC2 could be thought of as a prequel in disguise as a sequel. If you aren't too judgmental about graphics or complexity and just wish to have a fun, futuristic short-term RTS, then Supreme Commander 2 is for you.  Overall Score:  18/25 or 72%.			"

												If I hadn't loved Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, I'd think this a mediocre game and would have just moved on. However, I did love them, and this game is most definitely not a successor to either. The resource system, one of the most interesting and compelling features of the series, has been dumbed down to a simple 'collect and store' system like every other strategy game, leaving out the uniqueness that made these games successful. What I expected to find was SupCom FA with better technical implementation. Instead, I got an incredible disappointemnt.If you liked SupCom 1, don't buy this game.			"

The game brings a lot of different game play to the table for how you can pick and choose what is activated in your game. If you don’t want nukes turn them off. If you want to have a massive little bot battle you can do that too!

												Supreme Commander 2 is a fast pace RTS game with good music/style and graphics. SC2 takes the good aspects of SC/SC Forged Alliance and simplifies it to increase game speed and dynamics. Adding a tech tree and smaller maps, you will find yourself in constant conflict between players. However, due to the decrease in unit/building types and smaller maps, it takes away from the overall strategic aspect of SC/SC Forged Alliance. Still, SC2 is a must have for RTS Gamers!			"

												The game is not terrible in it's own rights. But the same can be said about Command and Conquer 4. If you have no idea what SupCom franchise is, and better yet are not that into huge strategy games, then getting SupCom2 is not a bad call. It's fast paced, it has cool units, and some interesting mechanics. For a heavy discount it is okay. But you know what is a better deal? Buying Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. It's a standalone expansion to the original SupCom, and a pinnacle in the short lived franchise. The scale is epic, and does not compare to anything. 81x81km maps with orbital lasers, nuclear artillery with global range, and clashes of 500 units a piece? You bet. Forged Alliance is simply unique, and there is no game to date that managed to repeat the formula. SupCom2 is a bland, boring ""we want to make a second Starcraft"".Oh, and if you are into story based singleplayer, forget about SupCom2. It is absolute garbage. Get original SupCom instead (3 campaigns, 1 per race, all worth while)			"

I bought this game when it originally came out at the release price of 40 pounds, and I have never bought another game at the same price that was equally disappointing and left me feeling regretful that I bought it.This is a lousy game that doesn't even deserve the sale price of $6.50. This game boasts less unit types, smaller maps, a horrible in-skirmish tech tree (seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking) and general all round badness. Buy the original.

Everything from the three tech stages to awesome experimentals has been taken out.  The core of what made the original Supreme Commander has been lost.  The unit variety is pretty pathetic. Most of the naval units have been stripped out, and the game seems to favour air combat for some reason.  The experimentals are even more pathetic, requiring only a small wave of tanks to take out (as displayed in the first mission).  Honestly avoid this game.  SupCom has become a shadow of its former self. "

												If you're a Command and Conquer fan, you'll like this game.If you're a Starcraft fan, you'll enjoy it for a bit.If you're a Supreme Commander fan, you won't like this game.  This is the main problem of this game: It's a fun RTS, but not a true Supreme Commander sequel.  The shallow, unfinished, and frankly, broken sequel fails to live up to what made the original so good.  It is fun, if you haven't played the first games or weren't a fan of how slow or convoluted they were, until you reach the problems of the game.  The engine can't support even the small amount of units you can pump out, the pathing is new and cool... but still broken and frustrating.  The maps are small, the units are unbalanced, the mod support is weak.  I could go on, but I'm tired of bashing on a good game.  It's just a disappointing end to a franchise that could have rivaled the likes of Command and Conquer.			"

												If you like Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance, you probably didn't like Supreme Commander 2. If you didn't like Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance, you probably didn't play Supreme Commander 2. While criticized by fans of the first game and its expansion, Supreme Commander 2 still stands out among Real-Time Strategy Games as one of the finest and most fun in the genre.Keeping the zooming map, large-scale battles and massive unit cap from its predecessors, Supreme Commander 2 offers several new innovations of its own. With a better User Interface and snarky graphics, it uses less computing power and thus solving the problems of computer crashes and lags its predecessors were notorious for. The best innovation, however, has to be the introduction of a unifited tech tree where players can choose their paths of research and therefore various strategies that range from an experimental army to rushing for nukes.The co-op is simply fantastic.

												I'm an RTS fan. Overall the game the engrossing, but the campaign script is pretty banal, and annoyingly you can't skip the droning cut scenes. The voice acting is pretty bad. Not a good introduction to the game. 2/5 for the script and acting. 4/5 for the missions. Compared to something like Starcraft 2 the script seems to be written by teenagers.Gameplay-wise the units are quite varied. The research tree is mostly power-ups with odd units being researched. I didn't always get the sense that it really made much difference which order you chose research in. 3.5/5 for AI balance. 4/5 for general fun. 3/5 for strategy elements. Seems to be more about brute force, and unit balance, and once you learn that all the missions are pretty much the same in terms of build order and selection.Haven't played multiplayer. I suspect that is the strong point. I briefly played SC1 and that seems more challenging. I suspect this has been simplified to entice a wider audience, but it seems a little too bland. There is nothing quirky about the units, script. It is a polished RTS, but not a memorable one. I think that sums it up for me.			"

												I started this series with Supreme Commander and then moved on to Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. I've played thousands of fun and amazing hours of the first two games and it only took me a few hours to find the horrible flaws in this one.This game is nothing like either of the first two games in function or in spirit . It is an all around disappointment, with so many things changed for the worse. For example, build queues beyond your current resources (the ability to plan ahead) are gone. Units have been simplified and unit numbers reduced. The overall game has taken on the per-game-leveling mechanics as those seen in the Battle for Middle-earth II and Command and Conquer: Generals RTS games. Map sizes have been greatly reduced and the graphics are terrible: the units look like fisher price toys.Basically, if you've never played the series, this game will be overly difficult to learn for what you get back from it and if you're a huge fan, like me, you'll absolutely hate the changes they've made.One reviewer said something like ""Chris Taylor has created a game that is, simultaneously, too simple for experienced players and too complicated for new ones"". That about sums it up. This one should be nominated for ""The Worst Sequel Ever"" award.			"

												While most argue that SubCom 2 doesn't measure up to it's predecessor and certainly not to Total Annihilation, I try to judge games on their own merits when I can and on it's own, SubCom 2 is a competent RTS. The story is far smaller in scale then the first game, following the stories of three childhood friends on different sides of a three-faction war. It's nothing to write home about, but it ties the missions together well and features a few good twists. More importantly, the game itself is very fun to play. It harkens back to an age where battles in RTS were more about sheer size and broad strategy instead of tactical rock-paper-scissors with everything being a hard counter to something else. If an RTS can keep me playing instant action modes because the actual gameplay was just that fun, I judge it a good game. I don't generally play against anyone in RTSes, but I'm sure it has value as a competitive game, again, probably not on the level of the first but nonetheless fun to play.			"

												Not one for me: I prefer turn-based, micromanagement strategy games which is the exact opposite to this. But I still enjoyed playing it and would definitely recommend it.Unit balance is good with vastly different tactics all being viable meaning this is one of the first RTS games where you have to actually think what the opponent is doing and not just do your own thing.UI is nicely set out and everything is quite intuitive allowing even beginners to easily control the huge armies you can gather.The single player campaign allows you to play all 3 factions and sets out a decent story line that flows throughout although the difficulty does fluctuate quite widely. Single player skirmishes offer an enormous amount of customisation allowing you to set up pretty much any set up you wish and for those who get into this far more than me the online community seems to be very committed  with many helpful websites and boards offering tactical help and guidance on how to become a skilled multiplayer...

Some of concepts for the newer units are pretty sweet...but they removed many of the BEST experimentals from the original.Overall: Yes they added content but they got rid of way more so you have less content to play with, they ruined the econ sysytem by symplifying it to a terrible degree and overall it saddness me to see the potential this game has but what it actually turned out to be.Get forged allianced over this to check the series out and if you like that then try this and see what the fuss is about			"

												""What's in a name?"" is the main downfall for Supreme Commander 2.The game is a very potent RTS, streamlined and easier to understand, and for many aspects, it's a good thing!  The economy is more straight-forward, there's a good tech tree, and matches are action-packed!But, do I recommend this game?  NO.It suffers the same problems as almost any RTS sequel.  To improve on a series, you iron wrinkles out of your previous game, make it easier to learn, to understand, to play, and ultimately to enjoy for as many people as you can.  The same changes happened with Lord of the Rings : The Battle for Middle-Earth II, in my opinion:  Solid game, loved by many and in many ways, superior to the first game.  But as for SupCom2, it lost its soul.  They are maybe better games in the end, but also more generic experiences that they once were.So, SupCom2, great game, but bland.  It needed to be named something else, because this isn't Supreme Commander.			"

												Total Annihilation is one of my favorite games of all time. I would say its probably in my top 5. So when Supreme Commander came out, it was like my childhood dream came true. When they announced a Supreme Commander 2, I was very excited to know it did well enough to produce a sequel. That is, until they started saying things like ""unit upgrades"" and that they were making it more ""streamlined""Supreme Commander 2 is not a sequel to Supreme Commander. It is an attempt to make Supreme Commander more appealing to the masses by making it similar to more traditional RTS games like Starcraft or the C&C series. It has unit upgrades, they took the large choice of units and unit ""tiers"" and reduced it to 1 or 2 main infantry/tank units for each side. The Aeon no longer have naval units, they just use their land hover units. This is not Supcom streamlined, this is a regular RTS with the infinite zoom feature. The heart and soul of SupCom/TA is gone, its just an empty shell with something else inside it now.If you enjoy traditional RTS games, you may find this one interesting as the infinite zoom ability is a mechanic all RTS games should have.If you loved TA and SupCom, you will hate this. I bought it day 1 and I don't think I have ever regretted a game purchase as much as this game.			"

												The game is not as good as forged alliance but it is better for people who don’t have a fast computer. The factions don’t have as much of a wide variety of units but the fact that the non experimentals are around the same level means that you don’t have to worry about having to constantly tier up. One of the problems though is the tech research the having to research the individual techs, although this dose mean you can make your units stronger and have special perks something the old game lacked. As much as the cybrans have pretty over powered units compared to the other teams the other teams can beat the cybrans by using the right tactics. I rate this game9/10   for the ultra powerful cybran dinosaur			"

												     This game is a classic, and it surely was made during the dark age of RTS games, where strategy games were nearing extinction and after my favorite RTS base builder series got ♥♥♥♥ed over by removing bases.      All my units look like toys and ants, and the entire game feels pretty well thought out. Some of the amphibious units are amazing, and the projectile system is spectacular especially when it comes down to missles and artillery. They even got point defense and all the things that makes land/sea battles at an epic level.     I never played the origenal Supreme Commander, however there is enough single player content in this to satisfy the waning multiplayer community. I recommend it, dispite the publishers infamity that is wrongly placed on them since they don't make games, they only market and sell them using contracts that will screw a company over if they F up only once.

												If you're a Command and Conquer fan, you'll like this game.If you're a Starcraft fan, you'll enjoy it for a bit.If you're a Supreme Commander fan, you won't like this game.  This is the main problem of this game: It's a fun RTS, but not a true Supreme Commander sequel.  The shallow, unfinished, and frankly, broken sequel fails to live up to what made the original so good.  It is fun, if you haven't played the first games or weren't a fan of how slow or convoluted they were, until you reach the problems of the game.  The engine can't support even the small amount of units you can pump out, the pathing is new and cool... but still broken and frustrating.  The maps are small, the units are unbalanced, the mod support is weak.  I could go on, but I'm tired of bashing on a good game.  It's just a disappointing end to a franchise that could have rivaled the likes of Command and Conquer.			"

												This game gets alot of flak for some obvious flaws that are legit, no LAN for one, weak multiplayer in general, however i dont have any friends who play rts so this doesnt matter to me nor will it if you are just like me, this game has some maps that allow for crazy unique rts battles, lots of fun, this game for me personally is an improvement over the original supcom series in every way, if you are creative with the restrictions you can have air only battles, artillery only battles (special map with no land connects) sea and air, endless possibilities, not too much focus on resource management, more on spectacular battles. Campaign is decent, unit variety between factions is fantastic, each faction has great flavour and style, game looks great.I rate this over planetary annihilation currently, sad to say.Wait until on discount and get the exp too.

												A good solid strategy game, complete with giant mechs. It's kind of like a mix of universe at war and command and conquer , the thing that sets it apart is the research system which is easy to use, and expansive. You can upgrade air units, ground units, your base or your command mech. Resources are fairly easy to get, and the large game ending units are all pretty cool.There's three factions but from what I've seen they all play pretty much the same, except their end game units are a little different. Like red alert 3 this has naval battles, but I honestly don't know why they bothered. Solid 8.5/10			"

												I'm an RTS fan. Overall the game the engrossing, but the campaign script is pretty banal, and annoyingly you can't skip the droning cut scenes. The voice acting is pretty bad. Not a good introduction to the game. 2/5 for the script and acting. 4/5 for the missions. Compared to something like Starcraft 2 the script seems to be written by teenagers.Gameplay-wise the units are quite varied. The research tree is mostly power-ups with odd units being researched. I didn't always get the sense that it really made much difference which order you chose research in. 3.5/5 for AI balance. 4/5 for general fun. 3/5 for strategy elements. Seems to be more about brute force, and unit balance, and once you learn that all the missions are pretty much the same in terms of build order and selection.Haven't played multiplayer. I suspect that is the strong point. I briefly played SC1 and that seems more challenging. I suspect this has been simplified to entice a wider audience, but it seems a little too bland. There is nothing quirky about the units, script. It is a polished RTS, but not a memorable one. I think that sums it up for me.			"

												I started this series with Supreme Commander and then moved on to Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. I've played thousands of fun and amazing hours of the first two games and it only took me a few hours to find the horrible flaws in this one.This game is nothing like either of the first two games in function or in spirit . It is an all around disappointment, with so many things changed for the worse. For example, build queues beyond your current resources (the ability to plan ahead) are gone. Units have been simplified and unit numbers reduced. The overall game has taken on the per-game-leveling mechanics as those seen in the Battle for Middle-earth II and Command and Conquer: Generals RTS games. Map sizes have been greatly reduced and the graphics are terrible: the units look like fisher price toys.Basically, if you've never played the series, this game will be overly difficult to learn for what you get back from it and if you're a huge fan, like me, you'll absolutely hate the changes they've made.One reviewer said something like ""Chris Taylor has created a game that is, simultaneously, too simple for experienced players and too complicated for new ones"". That about sums it up. This one should be nominated for ""The Worst Sequel Ever"" award.			"

												Definitely one of the greatest if not the greatest RTS i've played. It's fun, not as micro heavy as the 1st one. 3 factions, tons of units and buildings from each nation. The battles are quite amazing, you can have up to 1000 units (buildings included) in the vanilla version. You can even disable some things if you want to in the match setup, for example you can disable artillery or nukes, air units, land units, naval units. This is useful when you want to have a game where you only have to focus on 1 thing. This game is quite challenging even in vanilla if you have everything enabled.Longest match i had was 5 hours. Also there is research system, which means that everything is not unlocked right away- this adds a nice additional strategic aspect to the game, makes you decide what you want to get first.I didn't care about the story much, but the gameplay is great. Strategy games never really made me hooked story wise, unfortunately. Story wasn't bad though, i just prefer building and obliterating enemies with my faction.Some people prefer the SC1 and FA, but i like this one a lot more.This game requires quite decent PC, after every player gets tons of units, game gets quite slow. It usually stretches the match by a lot. There is a mod that is being worked on atm, ""Revamp 2.0"", there is Alpha of it. They basically make new units and buildings, some are from SC1 and the economy system is modified a little. I highly recommend that mod if you are especially interested in ridiculously challenging AI. I struggle greatly against even Hard AI... They made everything harder to get, researching is a lot more important now. Everything is ♥♥♥♥ing expensive. But it is one of the best mods i've played. If you want a more extreme version of the game just get the mod too. Mod requires the DLC, but you should get the DLC too, why would you not get it.I will rate the game 10.0/10.0I got nothing bad to say about this game other than you should try Supreme Commander 1 and Forged Alliance so you can see if you like the micro style more or the macro one. SC1 is also even more strategic. These 2 games are completely different IMO.			"

												First-of-allSupreme Commander 2 isn't the prequel of Supreme Commander: Forged Allience!So, after we cleared that let's talk about Supreme Commander 2.Yes! Supreme Commander: Forged Allience is better then this one, of course it came after it but this one is still a really good RTS!Let's try to split this review into four parts.-Positive facts-Mixed facts-Negative facts-Personal AddsPositive facts-Supreme Commander 2 is the refined version of Supreme Commander where they tried new things and improved It. -This game works on a toaster, the game doesn't need much requiements and works pretty fluent on older PCs-It is easier, wich makes it more playable for newcomers and give playes that don't play RTS a game they can learn and love it.-This game is still ""alive"", this game is still getting played by 30k players in the last two weeks-It got a (""deep and powerful""-PC Gamer) story that is really intresting and exciting-It looks still good, you wont believe it but for a game that was released 2010, it's pretty-It has Multi-Monitor Support and got some pretty cool features like tactical maps on the one site of the monitor etc. that are really cool-It got a really fast and addicting gameplay, you can play for hours without even realising it-Got a tech-tree where you can upgrade your units and expand your arsenalMixed facts-It splited the Supreme Commander community into two smaller communities-Doesn't got something unique-A.I. have some problems with the movement but this doesn't happen oftenNegative facts-I am happy that I don't have to write something down for the negative facts because they isn't something gamebreaking or something very awful, but if you want someone to hate this game for some reason you can read the review from Geoff Hunt ->Review link[www.gamerevolution.com]<-Personal Adds-This game is one of the best RTS you can find nowadays but his sequel Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is better and cheaper.-This game is PERFECT for newcomers and people that hadn't play RTS-Games before and give them an easy and pretty cool game to playConclusion:->If you are new to the RTS genre, buy this game!->If you are familiar to RTS but want to have an easy game and want to ""test"" the SupCom Series, buy this game!->If you are familiar to RTS and want something challenging, buy Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance or better buy the Gold Edition so you can see what this and the newer game is based of.

												Supreme Commander 2 is a fun and fast-paced RTS game with loads of weapons and units that make for some truly epic battles. It has had a number of patches since release so it's better than ever, adding improvements like (my favourite) repeating build queues. There's nothing more fun than overwhelming an enemy base with 500 units after destroying their defences with nuclear missiles. And the game engine handles such huge battles very well! Highly recommended.			"

It runs VERY well on almost any computer. This is one of the few games that I can play in higher settings and always achieve a great FPS. Which is important for a large scale RTS game such as this.

												In all honestly, For those who have never played supcom 1 or forged alliance (nor own them),  I would not see you a fool to get this game, it does have some things going for it, like smoother graphics, faster pace (very good for multiplayer games), and they did add a little more flavor to commanders in places where it was non-existent.But what tears me straight toward saying ""No, I would not recommend this game."" is that it is a HORRID sequel compared to the two stars behind it. First we were graced with Supreme commander, which practically gave birth to the level of RTS we see so much of now (or surpassed in scale as Sins of a Solar Empire did). Forged alliance enhanced the graphics of supcom 1 and added a whole new faction that was mentioned several times in supcom 1, the seraphim, and a multitude of new units. Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion and Supreme Commander: Forged alliance are literally the only two RTS games I play anymore, I am such a huge fan of them.I like many other fans of the series got this game expecting the same magic, but when I realized Square Enix was involved in this project and not THQ (A company who I later learned had essentially fallen apart on hard times). My heart sank slightly. It really hit rock bottom as I jumped in and started playing...I immediately walked into the campaign, and after seeing the sheer madness of the Forged alliance campaign.... I beat the Supreme commander 2 campaign in just a day or two... NOT a good start. The whole story lacked much of the attention grabbing that could be found in Supcom 1 and Supcom Fa, it seemed to just guide my hand the entire way like I was a child that didnt know what to do, RTS games shouldnt do that... EVER. I will give credit in that the story of supcom 2 did have a rich background like that in supcom 1 and supcom FA... but it seemed like I was playing in a game set in an alternate dimension rather than a game set not very long after the end of the seraphim threat... the only character from supcom 1 and FA that carried over at all, was Gustaf Brackman... a shame... especially since the end credits of FA showed QAI rebooting... so that bonus bit no longer fits in, further supporting my say that this game hardly lines up with being set after forged alliance. The story that takes place WITHIN supreme commander 2 was like a crap sequel to not one but two emmy nominated blockbusters (Supreme commander 1 and FA)Back to the gameplay for a moment. I do want to give the devs of this, and chris taylor, credit for keeping some little flair from the original two games, like the cybrans having ships that can walk on land, etc. But I dont know what was going on, either Chris Taylor had far less say in how this game was developed or he was on some sort of drug when he was working on it. There is extremely little reason to ever use naval units as there is such a lack of variety of them from what I recall. Naval units weren't the only thing lacking, as there was a sense of emptiness in the manner of units, so all I ever ended up doing was nuking AI or spamming so many of a single unit that it didn't matter AT ALL what the AI did, they would get annihilated, even with the considerably smaller max amount of units compared to the first two games. The experimentals don't even look like they would hold up against their prequel counterparts, the Megalith II looks like a baby scorpion compared to the Megalith I, which outsized the monkeylord (which I WILL crack a smile that they put into this game as DLC.). When using them in supcom 2, they feel ludicrously more fragile than their supcom 1 counterparts, which i don't see the reason for really considering that in supcom 1 and FA you could easily take them out by just spamming what they are weakest against... (for galactic colossi, GUNSHIPS... LOTS OF GUNSHIPS).What hit the final nail of the coffin for me was research..... just.... WHY? What is the point if i don't get to use everything in the research tree? WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP THE UPGRADE SYSTEM THAT WORKED SO PERFECTLY!?If you want a great RTS for multiplayer though, I WOULD recommend this SOLELY for multiplayer... otherwise... AVOID THIS GAME.			"

												I love this game, but there are a few things holding it back. Mainly when it starts to slow down, I just played an almost 2 hour game with AI and the actual time was only 45 min. When compared to other RTS games this one is my definite favorite. You can't have huge battles and artillery shells just flying in others but in Supreme Commander you can! Launching nukes is so much fun but can be infuriating when the anti nukes come online. The Commanders and units are so cool and you can have epic battles on this game. But the main thing again is when it starts to slow down, it's unbearable. But if you like any RTS this game is awesome and will make a great addition to your library. However you should also consider Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, the Prequel to this game if you don't want the slowdown. (I'm still looking into how to combat the lag after awhile.)It doesn't slow down if you have Sorian AI and other mods installed. Plus there is a strong community behind that is very active and patches the game years after it's release. Supreme Commander is a good game if you don't have the slowdown and is very fun to play with friends.Also the soundtrack is pretty good for those tense moments when it's either win or lose!			"

												One of the best RTS games I've ever played, Supreme Commander 2 brings a lot to the table. Where most RTS games bring a unit cap of 14, 150, or 200, Supreme Commander 2 brings a whopping 500. The scale of this game is amazing. From tiny Titan Bots to the collosal King Kriptors, this game is sure to wow you by how big the units are, and how many can fit on a screen without lagging. Of all the games in my Steam library, I find myself coming back to this one the most (almost 80 hours). The campaign is very fun and the characters are all very solid. The online is great, and even single player skirmish matches seem to never grow stale with all the different map options. All three factions feel very well balanced with every unit being weak to one unit or another, however, the 500 unit cap makes for very intense and interesting battles. If you don't already own this game, buy it now. you won't regret it.			"

												Not nearly as impressed with this game as I was with the first SUPCOM. I do have to agree with everyone that it was a watered down version of the first game. Apparently it was desinged for console systems which can't handle RTS'es very well. The experimental units aren't nearly as epic as they where in supcom1 either.  The one feature this game has is the AI that allows larger units to wade through a group of smaller units allowing it not to the stuck and move past.  Heres hoping for a more worthy sequal tha tis Supcom 3.  Meanwhile... Play Supcom 1.			"

												An excellent game by an excellent company, Gas Powered Games, that has unfortunately been disolved by another company (Wargaming.net). It has plenty of maps, units, and strategy to keep you entertained for a long time. Important to keep in mind is that the game is designed to be more worried about the big decisions and less about the little ones. Infinite Queueing, Infinite zoom, a straight forward resource collection method lend this game to be far from Starcraft 2, the other SC2. If micromanagement is your thing, this game likely won't be as interesting to you as Blizzard's RTS, but that doesn't diminish the fact that this game can scale to epic proportions, with a fun design and great battles.Mind that multiplayer will be staggered, as the game has been released for a while. Great campaign though, if cliched.I've put a lot of time into this game, and I don't regret a minute of it. Highly recommended.			"

												It's not my favorite RTS, but it is still a fun game by itself. I know a lot of people dislike this game because they feel that the predecessor is superior, and I do agree that the original Supreme Commander/Forged Alliance is more fun than this game, but Supreme Commander 2 is still a fun game to play.Pros:+Good graphics+Not as processor heavy (SupCom 1, I'm looking at you...)+Unique research system that lets you improve units as you please.Cons:-Different economy system where units will not start building unless they have the resources.-Multiplayer maps are too small in my opinionOverall, this game was actually better than I thought it would be. Reviews can be misleading sometimes, and I think this game is worth a try. You will never truly know if you'll like it or not unless you try it, and I'm glad I did.On a side note, my favorite RTS is none other than good old TA.			"

I haven't got to ranked online matches but they're probably OK. Build crazy units like a giant spider-bot, a fire-breathing dinosaur robot, a cannon that shoots your units at the enemy or a magnet to pull enemy tanks to you. Worth €5 certainly.			"

												In a certain way the naysayers about this game are right; Gas Powered Games had to put their knees on the ground just to get Supreme Commander 2 made. They had to make several compromises to make it run on a console as well. Yet, even with the limitations that Square-Enix (publisher and IP-owner) imposed the developers have made the most out of SupCom 2 on PC. While reduced in scope/options compared to Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance (FA) this sequel certainly has its value. It's more performant, it's flashier with graphical effects, has faster gameplay and it also offers several interesting unit/experimental ideas. The new research tree is easy-to-use although it does make you lose (track of) the game sometimes because you and your enemies are making hard choices which are not always immediately clear until it's too late. It's less about a long and constant war on all fronts (like in SupCom and FA) and more about picking the right front to fight on. Going for a jack-of-all-trades way of researching isn't going to win you any games. The whole experience is great fun nonetheless, and that generally in a lot less game time than a regular SupCom or Forged Alliance session usually demands. Three factions make for nice variation though just as before you don't have to expect as much differences between these sides as StarCraft offers. The overall experience doesn't suffer though as you have more (broad macro) tools to fight a futuristic war here.A reasonable campaign and stock standard skirmish play options don't sound too thrilling but especially in the latter part (skirmish) Supreme Commander 2 really comes together. The AI is quite decent (thanks to modder-turned-developer Sorian working at GPG at the time) and the selection of maps worthwhile. A fair share of updates made the game not lose its edge and the Infinite War Battle Pack DLC is frankly a no-brainer to buy alongside the main game. I wouldn't say the multiplayer balance is perfect, not a lot of online players present too. Same case for mods, don't expect something as vibrant as with the original game, let alone the total mod craze of Total Annihilation. If you want a quick and spectacular romp of RTS fun in (co-op) skirmish play, you can't go wrong with this. It's not the SupCom 2 some would have liked to see but it's clear by now that several publishers didn't believe in a second addon for the original SupCom (which was originally the plan) nor a true sequel that would be as big in scope. SupCom 2 as we know it is the best alternative we got in the end. If you want something more complex then there is still always the active Forged Alliance Forever effort. That ultimate next-gen all-out-sci-fi-war simulator will have to wait I am afraid until the RTS genre makes a big comeback...			"

												This is a great game and I like to reccomand this game to every one. Although it could use some upgrades in its navy field.I never play the first Supreme Commander but I played and still play the Total Of Annihilation. If I want to compare Supreme Commander 2 with Total Of Annihilation which was the best game in 1998 I must say, Total Of Annihilation is a lot better in terms of units and their advancments. In Total Of Annihilation you can produce units and production facilities under the water which in Supreme Commander 2, your only underwater unit is the submarine which can only attack the units in the water including the shipyard of course. Supreme Commander 2 could certainly use a underwater constructor to take it to the next level.			"

If you don't like fighting up close and personal, use massed artillery emplacements to rain death down on known enemy locations or use strategic missles to scout the map through nuclear fire.

												Doesn't have the epic scope of the first game or Forged Alliance, but it's still pretty fun.			"

												I enjoy supp comm and lot. Its unique in rts strategy games in that macro and micro control go hand in hand. My biggest complaint just to list one is the AI system. I dont like that units do not turn and attack if being fired at from behind. However if you are alert this isnt a big deal. The only time it becomes a problem is when you have 100s and 100s of units and it gets hard to baby sit each one. Otherwise the game is a lot of fun and especially fun at lan parties.			"

												Absolutely fantastic.The fights are great to watch and the unit variety is fairly nice, though there could be more, and I do miss the aeon navy,Plus it's like 9 quid. That's pocket change. Get it. And the DLC, it's worth it. Just get it. The people playing this need more people to play it WITH, and that can be sorted out fairly easily, now, can't it?Also, Square Enix were behind this one. They're also behind FFXIV. Can't argue with that.			"

												A good solid strategy game, complete with giant mechs. It's kind of like a mix of universe at war and command and conquer , the thing that sets it apart is the research system which is easy to use, and expansive. You can upgrade air units, ground units, your base or your command mech. Resources are fairly easy to get, and the large game ending units are all pretty cool.There's three factions but from what I've seen they all play pretty much the same, except their end game units are a little different. Like red alert 3 this has naval battles, but I honestly don't know why they bothered. Solid 8.5/10			"

												Supreme Commander 2 is the ultimate strategy game. It has an effective multiplayer skirmish system, and if you want to play by yourself, there is a reasonably good campain as well as a great AI battle skirmish. The maps are beautiful and gameplay is fairly simple to learn. Unit AI is not perfect, but that is to be expected to soem degree. The enemey AI are very good if you want them to be, but are still within the range of bing defeated, if you put a lot of time and effort into it. Getting forward in the campaign is harder than I think it should be, and there are multiple stages that you can see were mot as thought out. However, the storyline is pretty good, and is not nessesary to play.  Overall, I would give the game an 8.75 out of 10.			"

												Okay so it's not FA or Sc1 even but it's still a fun game. It's allot simpler that Sc 1, and the economy is ten times easier and overall it's a fun game. If your a Supreme commander fan though dont expect too much because it can't even hold a candel to FA or supreme commmander 1. As long as you think of it as a diffrent strategy game and not an SC game I think it's still fun.7/10			"

												Supreme commander 2 is a more stream line version of its predecessor with enthuses on malty player and speed. Most negative comments on this game have been focus on lack of continuity to its predecessor and its approach to streamlining the proses. However judging the game soul on its merits and excluding its franchise. One is able to state it is a top contender for an RTS.Skirmish:The game attempt to streamline and simplify the tech tree, building and units by eliminating a lot of low tear early game tech (which became obsolete one’s high tear was researched witch plagued is predecessor) favouring a more late game play style. Buildings and units may feel homogeneous at first however the game really picks up ones you have unlock a few mid to upper tear tech. In The late game units and building give each faction a unique play style with different tactical advantages with each its tactical counterparts make’s the game a well-balanced skirmish platformCampaign:Solo play is soled it’s a good introduction to each faction’s tech with a slow progression arc from low end on the earlier mission and scaling up as you progress throw the story .only down side is each faction has 5 missions. Each mission dose scale up as you progress and achieved objectives more of the map opens up and new objectives are added it still can feel a little shortsThe story was ok. Voiceovers was believable and the plot was mediocre with a predictable plot twist but not game braking Other reviews:Quick summary for the first 7 negative recommended in the Most helpful tabRiph .hours played 6.8Sliced off 90% of the contentBatto Rem .hours played 37.2Nostalgic outlook no spices  Ruby Rhod. hours played 11.8Nostalgic outlook no spices  Sleek .hours played 27.4Nostalgic outlook no spices[K29C] Gwennec. hours played 1.7Feels unfinishedMaps are smallerCampaign Story lacking scope and scale?

												If you played the origional Supreme Commander, you might not like this one. Although, this game does have it's high points and is quite fun to play in multiplayer (Provided that you have a few friends to play it with). It just does not quite match the complexity, scale, or feel of the first game.			"
