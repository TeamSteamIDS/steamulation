												I really want to like this game. I backed it on Kickstarter, I enjoy the tabletop version and turn-based squad-based combat is one of my favourite genres. Unfortunately, it's not very good. Not truly horrible, but not good. The camera has improved with patches, but it's still wonky. Many battlefields have tall structures messing up the camera and you can't zoom far enough out to get a good view. This is one of the main problems with the game. The UI takes up too much space. Gets worse because of the camera issues. The character selection process is not intuitive and not very responsive, mostly a problem when units activate out of turn. The rules are neither transparent enough nor a direct translation of the boardgame. That makes playing the game a tad more confusing than necessary, though it's not a really big deal. The developers went with a square grid movement system for no fathomable reason, when there are hexes available. Not a big deal at all, but it annoys me. The AI is stupid. Single-player skirmishes are only worth it as practice runs. I have severe CTD-troubles. If you're lucky, this is not a problem. For me, the game is not currently playable because of this combined with the next problem... [edit: I have conquered the CTD menace by setting graphics to the lowest setting possible. It works, but you can scratch the below comment about graphics -it has to look like Minecraft if I want to play.] [edit 2: Oh, it's back. Even on lowest settings.]YOU CAN'T SKIP CUTSCENES! This is unforgivable in any game. [edit: diligent research shows that you can, indeed, partially skip most cutscenes but it's not good enough and the fact that I had to be told on this forum how to do it doesn't help. ""Enter"" key, if you need to know. Not ""Esc"", oh no.]Edit 2: I still haven't figured out how to save during campaign battles, pretty sure it's impossible. For a game with CTD issues and where battles can easily take an hour, this is a problem. There are good things too: The game looks and feels good, the single-player storyline is OK, there are frequent patches to solve known issues. Unfortunately, it's just not good enough. If you don't suffer from CTDs it should be OK, but there are better games out there to spend your precious time on. Try it if you like the setting and get it for cheap. [Edited because I take my reviews very seriously and listen to constructive criticism.]			"

												I concur with others that this game is not yet ready for general release. I say shame on whoever decided to declare this release ready. Yes the campaign is done and combat works, but there are too many pain points to make this game fun yet. I know it is common if not the norm these days to release a game and then spend the next 6 months fixing it, but I don't feel that is right to your customers. I was a kickstarter backer so I understand there will be rough edges during the process, but setting the game for release in this state makes me fear the game will never receive the attention it deserves.-Camera controls are unintuitive and require constant adjustment.-Mouse input is erratic.-Game engine completely stops switching between units. screen freezes breifly and FPS counter will go to zero each time enemy AI units make a move.-controlling units require too much busy work like changing facing before being allowed to attack a unit instead of just allowing the unit to select between all units in range and just change the facing as appropriate. Doing unit facing changes at the end of each units turn is cumbersome and unnecessary.The UI currently bogs down the game. Turns feel like they take twice as long as they should because of constant camera angle changes and other control issues. Even something simple like selecting a unit is often unresponsive requiring multiple clicks and hunt for the hotspot.			"

												I originally backed this on kickstarter because Privateer Press said they were going to bring the tabletop wargame experience to the video game world. As a long time fan, and former press ganger, nothing has stirred my imagination more than wanting to see these characters, machines, and beasts animated and actually interacting with each other. It does deliver that, to some degree... when it works.I wanted to enjoy it, I tried to enjoy it. In some respects, I NEEDED to enjoy this, but I can't. It is continually bogged down by constant fatal errors, a conflicting design philosophy, an underutilized graphic engine, and; probably the most heartbreaking downside, a complete lack of soul.Those of us that saw these problems and were deeply concerned tried to communicate these issues to the devs on the forums were shouted down. Our questions and concerns ignored until we just... gave up. They just don't want to hear it.This game is not an accurate representation of what many fans would call a Warmachine experience.It is a somber memorial to what could have been, and I am ashamed that I backed it.

												I'm a HUGE fan of the tabletop game and you'll see most of that in this digital version.  That's a good thing.  However, to have access to ALL the units you're going to have to pay real money for small DLC faction packs.  This digital-blister-pack approach has managed to frustrate a lot of players who still see huge problems and missing features in the ""core game.""The problems I have with the game are the horrible UI and the inescapable sense of being on rails.  I think that in multi-player that sense of rails might go away, but I was expecting and hoping for more from the single-player campaign.  It's just not that good.The UI gets in the way all the time.  It's cumbersome and about as much fun as filling out your taxes.			"

								They've lost their god damn minds with this price...As someone who has the game, let me tell you, it is ABSOLUTELY NOT worth $65 to get in right now. There is 1 map, and 1 list for each of the 4 factions. You get no choices when it comes to building your list. Do yourself a favor and wait for the release, which will be cheaper anyways.			"

												After playing through the game and observing where it has been going since beta, I can say I would not reccomend this in the state it is currently in, and do not feel it will get to a point where I would in the near future. For people who enjoy the table top game this game is an awesome idea to experience more story in the Iron Kingdoms, and to play the game in a way that requires less clean up and even try out different factions. For a project like converting a table top into a PC game, there were of course its share of bugs that would be expected from a relatively new studio. I was perfectly fine with that, they were trying to get the game fully released so all its kickstarter backers could enjoy what they paid for. Unfortunately, the game ended up feeling hacked together when it was officially ""released"". The single player campaign, although it was enjoyable to be given different scenerios to overcome, there were just a lot of things wrong with it. The camera was, and still is pretty unbarable, the UI would not always play nice with the map you were on, and the AI was not very challenging and followed a very specific sequence of moves unless you put a target right in their face. The cutscenes were something out of a launch Playstation 1 game. Completely still models with the camera panning to whoever was talking, and even then you had a hard time seeing who it was because of the lighting. With how much work that was put into the in game models, you think they could have animated the scenes. That said, the in game models are pretty nice, fans of the table top will appreciate how the characters and warjacks look animated. The multiplayer was meant to be the bread and butter for this game, a way for people who enjoy the table top, or even new comers, to come press a button and be put into a game of warmachine instantly. The multiplayer feels like its lacking A LOT. Yes you can be matched with another player, most of the time. It is not uncommon for the ""quick match"" option, to not be quick at all. The multiplayer as a game functions, bugs excluded, but it not very enjoyable because of the problems the overall game has, as well as very simple win conditions. The UI is just awful. Actions feel unresponsive, it is arranged in an unappealing matter, text can be hard to read, and it difficult to traverse the playing map. Getting information to appear on your spells and abilities usually requires you to click the button for it, thus committing to the action. The grid system is also not executed as well as it could have. It feels clunky and sometimes even inconsistent. What is worse about knowing all these things is the price tag that has been on it. The DLC model is also kind of a turn off, especially in the state the game is still in. If the game were in a relatively bugg free state, charging DLC is reasonable. Developing the DLC seemed to be as high, or perhaps an even higher priority than making the game as functional as it could be. TLDR: Game is no where near as functional as it should be. UI is unbarable, camera is wonky, gameplay is not strong enough to hold it all up. DLC seems to take a place above fixing bugs and improving overall functionality.			"

Early Access Review
								I really want to recommend this game because I'm a huge Warmachine/Hordes tabletop player (I backed the KS), but there is no way $65 is a justified price tag for this game in it's current state. Just to be clear, I do not think the early access is worth the extra money. The UI is unfinished which makes it frustrating to move warrior models around (and the lack of Units in the game makes moving 11 Mechanithralls ""solos"" a very time consuming process), game breaking bugs abound such as certain knockdown effects not affecting large base targets, some spells are listed on the UI but are not in the game yet, 20 FPS is about the max anyone can seem to get despite current gen computer hardware, and it is generally a painful rather than fun experience at the moment. I will happily create another review when the game is done, but as it stands I cannot recommend this purchase.One thing I can say about the game in its beta state that will carry over to the final product is that this is *NOT* a clone of the tabletop game. Many spell effects and abilities differ, major effects like Disruption do not function the same, point costs have been changed since everything is now a solo, Warjack systems have been removed entirely so a jack with one box left functions just as well as a jack with 20 boxes, everything rolls three dice for attack and damage, and everything is grid based with an always-visible grid (read: pre-measuring). The devs have listed a full list of changes in the forums: http://steamcommunity.com/app/253510 These changes may appeal to you or they may frustrate you, just don't buy this game thinking you will be getting the same experience as the tabletop.

												2017 Update: A lot has changed. For one, this is NO LONGER PLAYABLE THANKS TO THE UI. It used to flow decently well. Not perfect, but then what is? Now it's clunky and unuseable. Get out of me, Warmachine Tactics.With this game, I tried. Really did. Actions were clunky at times, sure, whatever, I can deal. Units performed completely randomly at times, that was anoying, but in keeping with the tabletop to PC feel of the thing. Not a AAA title, but it never claimed to be. It was building up to a decent game, pieces at a time. There were annoying parts fixed, like global spells lens flare-ing the screen un-playable for a small buff, that were fixed. Generally it looked like a nice game without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ish nature of some people who shall not be na-*cough*EA*cough*-med.Then a funny thing happened with the Mercenaries faction. It was originally availiable to play with the standard game. Then it was shoved ceremoniously behind a DLC paywall. Same with the Retribution. And there's so much of it. For the price of the DLC and the game itself, I can put together two, maybe three physical armies on the cheap. Anyone who knows about how expensive miniature wargames are, knows that this is ridiculous.This could have been a nice cheap entry point to the physical game for some, but it's not anymore. Could have been a nice turn based strategy for others, but with two of the factions locked out of the multiplayer and a bluh campaign, it's not. It could have had a great story for the Iron Kingdoms, a setting oozing with so much badass flowing through it's rivers that even the goblins wear shades and walk calmly away from explosions, but it wasn't. Not the worst story, but could have been better.Sorry, and this saddens me to say, but I cannot reccomend this game.tldr; Don't buy it, DLC is too much for too little, doesn't do enough with what it has.

												Short version: Don't believe reviews older than March 2015. The game is better, prettier, and more stable than ever before. It still might not be for everybody, but it's worth a look.UPDATE: August 2016 - Updated spell effects, all new UI, somewhat improved AI, and generally very attractive and stable performance. This is how the game should have released, and more updates are on the way. I can recommend it still.Long version:I've been playing since Early Access, but wanted to wait until the last of the Kickstarter DLC was released before writing a review. In the meantime, I've watched a nearly unplayably buggy game get lots of fixes and polish from the developers, and now I feel like it would be fair to give it a balanced review. APRIL 25, 2015PROS: +Excellent character models and animations fully capture the look and feel of the Iron Kingdoms setting.+Very deep core gameplay draws many concepts faithfully from its table top origins.+Single player story is decent, written by game creator Matt Wilson, and has some fun missions.+Each faction is very distinct, and has a good (not great) variety of models.+Multiplayer is fun and intense. I've only dabbled, but I could get hooked.+SP Skirmish mode is okay for testing teams or admiring art assets.+Highly active and invovled development team communicates regularly with players.Minor Drawbacks:* Some spell and engine effects are too shiny/intense for my taste. * The balance between troops and warjacks has shifted quite a bit in favour of the former. Feels different from tabletop.* No Man's Land single-player campaign leaves out two of the factions almost completely (3 if you count Mercs).* Limited unit selection in early matches means not as much replay value for single player campaign.* The user interface has been improving, but it takes up a lot of screen, and isn't the prettiest.* Some of my favourite units aren't out yet, and I know I'll have to pay for them as DLC someday.* Controls and camera are better than ever, but still take getting used to.* There isn't a large enough player base to guarantee fast MP matchmaking yet.Major CONS:- Core game features are not yet implemented (no Hotseat, no Asynchronous MP, no painter, and only stupid-easy Skirmish difficulty)- Single-player campaign has bad AI, and compensates with waves of suicidal dummies.- Certain graphics configurations caused the game to crash frequently. I'm good now, but it was unplayable at times.I recommend this game more than I ever could have before, especially to people who tried an early build and gave up because of the bugs and lack of polish. It is very playable, very fun, and worth coming back to.  For new players, I would recommend it if you are a fan of the Warmachine universe, or if you like skirmish tactics games. Just be aware that there's a long road ahead for continuing development.			"

												I know I don't trust most reviews that are all good or all bad, but honestly after giving it way more then a fighting chance it has failed on every level. The interface is the opposite of intuitive and the animations are off-label PS2 at best. I'm amazed with how well funded it was on kickstarter we have what we've been given. This is the first time I saw fit to write a review, but honestly with the Privateer Press, kickstarter AND early access money there is no excuse for this wonky old-school indie game feeling slop.

												Good:-Models look nice -Combat animations are fairly well done.-Army customization works fairly wellBad:-Army customization shows no descriptions on equipment, special abilities, or powers of units.  Unless you already know all the terms and what each unit looks like you won't know what you are doing.-Many Textures aren't crisp even on highest game settings-Cinematic scenes are just models frozen in position.  The camera pans around and there is voice over but that is it.-The UI, all of it...-Buggy cursor registration-Completion of unit action phases is buggy, sometimes not completing properly and other times getting extra ""outside of action activity""-Tiny mini-map with no configuration.-Whenever voice-over text or instructions are displayed, all UI elements are disabled-You cannot return to menu during a cinematic, you can quit the game though.---I have friends who play the tabletop version and I was interested but didn't have the time or money to get into it.  That said, they were excited about it so I backed the kickstarter for this game.  I finally ended up getting my Steam key last week because I noticed the game was on sale and I still hadn't even gotten my backer key yet.  The turnaround was fairly fast from contacting them to getting my key but I still wasn't impressed that I never got a notice or key when the game was released in the first place.--- Update:I wasn't able to get powers and abilities hover information to work previously, even waiting 15 seconds while hovering over different areas.  I was able to get these to work today after Eyl's comment stating that they were working for him.  My problem last time could have been related to crash issues and forced process termination.  The problem still remains though that there is no visual differentiation between what are section names, weapon names, abilities, special abilities.  It is all in list format with no standard in font sizing or type.  For example:Weapon name has a smaller font size than weapon damage/range information.  Weapon damage/range information is the same font size as the ""Melee Weapons"" or ""Ranged Weapons"" headings.  Shadowing on the fonts is random and appears to be a problem with it not being toggled on/off properly as it isnt standard across units or even in ability listings on a single unit.Even if that was fixed right now the game still wouldnt be worth the $40 price tag.  If they fixed all of the ui issues, cursor registration, buggy animations ( units turn backwards and then forwards upon completion of a move action ), and put actual cinematics or even comic style cinematics into the game I would consider looking at it again.  However as the game currently stands I feel ripped off even at the backer price.			"

Posted: January 12, 2015
												You can find my previous Early Access review in the comments.Now that Warmachine Tactics has been officially released, I feel it deserves an updated review, so here are my impressions of the current state of the game, focusing of the single player campaign.My inital impressions were not particularly favourable, this is largely due to the very poor voice acting that began in the intro and continued into the game.The voice actress for Alison Jakes is particularly bad, her voice is stilted, her dialogue does not flow at all, which is totally at odds with her character, who seems to be a chatterbox with a smart mouth. This is not entirely the actress's fault, though she doesn't help with an odd accent on her voice that comes and goes. She has very little to work with as the dialogue she has been given is terrible. As the major character of the Cygnar campaign, she is kind of important, but sadly she is probably the worst of all the early game characters. This is pretty bad considering none of them have particualrly good dialogue, they just did an even more terrible job with her.Music is inoffensive, though entirely forgettable. I'd suggest just switching it off and playing some of your own instead.Graphics are competent, though no more than that. Farly standard and won't blow your mind. Though there are ridiculous things like, why the hell are the character portraits of such low res terribad quality? It would literrally be a 10x improvement if they just took a screenshot of a characters face in game instead. It is mystifying to me.Animation is weak. Most of the basic movement is fine, though jumping onto and over obstacles is very stilted, particularly the transition from being infront of the obstascle to interacting with it, it just looks weird. Death animations regularly bug out, so instead of a rag-doll of a corpse, you get a weird pixellated spasm of colour and then the body is on the ground. Melee combat animations are generally stilted and way too slow, there is also too much disconnect between the impact and the effect on the target, making it look rather silly when a character gently waves their sword in the direction of an enemy and after a very noticeable pause, the enemy flies backwards as though they have been hit with considerable force.Camer work is sloppy. It generally works acceptable well for navigating the map and issuing orders. But as soon as the game seizes control of the camera, which it does to zoom in on combat and other events, it all goes wrong. If there is a piece of terrain available for the camera to hide behind, it will find it. I believe at least 50% of fights I have 'watched' from behind a wall, or tree or other terrain feature. If you aren't going to bother to put the effort in to handle camera zoom properly, there is really no reason to do it at all. Currently they have made a net negative impact to the game with this, rather than just leaving it out.There are also a number of bugs remaining in the game, that seem to randomly block you from issuing context sensitive orders to your troops, for example not being able to issue melee attack command during melee combat, instead having to walk out of combat and shoot the enemy. If I was not familiar with Warmachine from playing the tabletop game, I may have thought some of these bugs were my misunderstanding of the rules and therefore not realised they were bugs. That they still exist is an example of the lack of polish that remains in thsi game.Gameplay is largely competent although the AI is non-existent (more later), but does not flow well. There are numerous little ♥♥♥♥ly (n i g g l y) issues that do not work properly. For example facing, it seems to be half random as to which direction you end up facing after moving. If you move, you'd expect your finaly facing to correspond to the general direction you moved in, but this is not always the case, you could instead end up facing either left or right of the direction of movement, a fairly minor point, as you can adjust facing after moving, but as you have to do this for all your units it quickly gets tiresome. This is clearly an issue in the programming of the game, as the enemy always ends up facing the wrong way after moving as well, and has to re-orientate, adding more waiting time during the enemy turn. Which is another fairly major issue. There is no way to skip animating the entire enemy turn. This is not a problem when playing a human, as you actually want to see what they are doing so you can react, but the computer will never do anything even slightly unexpected, it is easy to predict the exact position of all enemy units 4-5 turns in advance and there is never any doubt in exactly what their response will be, namely headlong charge into primary weapon range and attack, as soon as you get within the scripted spotting distance.Several missions into the single player campaign and I have yet to find any evidence of any independent AI activity whatsoever. All enemy activity is scripted to such a predictable degree it is ridiculous. Basically like this. Either the enemy will remain entirely passive until you are within a pretty close proximity and then rush to attack the nearest unit with his primary weapon, or you are fighting a wave assault and the enemy will rush you in waves from maximum range. There is no attempt to perform coordinated assaults or flank you or any other slightly more complicated manouvers.As a re-creation of the tabletop game, sadly this fails badly. Weapon ranges are stupidly short, warjacks retain full capability until destroyed, to name but two glaringly obvious fails.Overall, Warmachine is a fairly competent game, but it is obvious that the team at White Moon Dreams are very inexperienced, with possibly a couple of experienced developers/managers among them who have failed to sufficiently spread their expertise to avoid rookie mistakes. Without knowing the details behind the contract, it is impossible to know where the blame for this failure to hire sufficient experienced staff lies, but it has clearly impacted the quality and polish of this game.If this review seems very negative, it is because it is my first impressions, and it was the bad points that stood out. The aspects I've skipped over or not mentioned were pretty much competent, but not particularly worthy of praise for being outstanding or notable either.I would still not recommend this game, though it is a huige improvement on when I last played it. The price is still a bit too hgh for the technical quality of the game. Once the price drops to about £15 I may reconsider the value for money. The main fault of this fail lies squarely with Privateer Press management, their decision to pass this project to White Moon Dreams. A totally inexperienced studio who have clearly done their best, but made all the standard rookie mistakes and clearly have no experience to make a decent AI. Which even experienced studios regularly fail at (Hi CA and Total War). I don't know if this was done to retain more creative control, or to cut corners and milk the IP... sorry, for budgetary reasons (like Privateer Press are short of a bob or two), but it has resulted in a dissapointingly substandard experience, which will probably end up costing PP more in lost revenue.PS. I'll review this again once I've played all the way through and played some more multiplayer and see if I change my mind. I'll also try and condense this ridiculously rambling text wall into something vaguely readable, at some point. Oh, and I LOVE how Steam censors <n i g g l y> but arsed is fine, lol. PPS. Drop the santa hats. If you can't be bothered to make more than a half-arsed attempt then don't bother. They look stupid and were clearly knocked up by an intern on MS paint in his lunch break.			"

												I want to like the game. But until they implement an AI, all the other work they are doing on the skirmish and campaign is worthless. It currently runs every unit into melee, even units made to be sniping. If they had any intent to fix that, I wouldn't be so frusterated. But this has been the situation for months and rather then making any progress in improving the AI, they have decided to focus on adding more units. I don't care about more units, I just want the existing units' AIs to work!			"

												The game it self is fun and i really like to play it, the mechanics of the tabletop are nearly caught in the game, but what makes me really sad on this game are the politics of payment.With the basegame you get  four factions with 3 casters 3 light, 2 heavy jacks and 5 warriortypes to chose from.Each other added faction or model has to be bought separatly.In fact: I bought a fullprice game and got between 30% - 50% of a game and for the rest of the game i´m supposed to pay again and keep in mind it was a kickstarter-project so they already got money during development.I have to say: It is a huge shame to see the pc adaption of a wonderful tabletop like warmachine end up like this.

That they have to release a new patch literally every day proves what a poor state this game is in, attrocious quality control is nothing to be proud of. Super disappointed in this, one of my most regretted purchases to date.. and I have supoorted a bunch of bad games in the past sadly..

												I was not frustrated at first (thinking that it was still in beta) but wow... this game is full release?Super disappointed. I am usally not a campaign type of guy but I figured, ""Hey, its full release. There is no way it can be as buggy and blocky like it was in Beta.  Right?"". Wrong.  Pros-Multiplayer is fun, but basic mechanics that made this game different were missing.  -Character models look great!-Love the idea of not having to whip out the models errytime I wanna smash some Khador-Colors and vibeCons-HORRIBLE ""action cam"". Very cringeworthy-Subtitles look like a game from a PS1 game that didn't get the proper funding.-DLC before basic mechanics are finished. I mean, look at the patch notes...-No damage boxes... I know it was stated that this was going to be the direction from the get go but with this ""final product"" it just seems like someone said, ""Screw it, people will still buy it."".I wanted to make a video and at least show how the multiplayer was fun but it crashes with every video cap program... just straight up fails on the opening.With the last note under the Cons, I am tired of this feeling.  It has happened alot this last year or so but this one hits home (I've been a War Machine TT player since its release) and dissapointed is not the  correct word.  2015 will be the year that his changes for me.This game is #ForeverInBeta.

												The big problem with Warmachine Tactics is that I kept finding myself ask 'who thought this bit was a good idea?' while playing it. While there's a whole host of performance and mechanical issues with the game, the reason why I keep uninstalling it is because far too many design choices are simply self-defeating.Here's a few of them:-No saving in single player missions.-seemingly unskippable cutscenes (which can easily last 5 minutes, making replaying a mission truly obnoxious).-no way to leave multiplayer quick match without force quitting.- the utterly bizarre decision to fill cutscenes with frozen characters. Descends into farce when the camera zooms into motionless characters' faces when delivering exposition.-The conversion of the Warmachine ruleset into something where it feels like absurd effort has thrown at the simplest of enemies.None of these seem to be design features that should have escaped QC, let alone early access. In particular, the unskippable, farcical cut-scenes smacks of a hole in the budget that got filled in an 'arty' fashion. Game balance feels truly out the window, simply because everything feels extraordinarily pillow-fisted, so massive effort has to be hurled at largely inconsequencial enemies.The main gameplay feels like a kludgy, sticky mess where you often feel like you're fighting the controls more than the enemy. The AI is pants-on-head dumb, making Skirmish mode some what akin to shooting fish in a barrel. The conversion of the Warmachine ruleset often feels extraordinary restrictive and often poorly signalled (it is often hard to tell a unit's facing, which makes the facing rules a frequent pain). Knowledge of the tabletop game feels essential to making the game playable, yet the game doesn't clue you into the changes it's made to units' abilities so even that knowledge is often wrong. Mechanics and effects often feel wonky or unpredictable (I've watched an electro-leap leap to an enemy a screen away, which basically the opposite of what it's supposed to do). It often feels like the camera is deliberately annoying you, hiding itself behind terrain when you're trying to see what's going on.Multiplayer feels extraordinarily hampered by a limited pallette of options as well as the aforementioned Quick Match issue. Frankly, I've gotten one game of multiplayer in the year I've owned the game. Apparently, multiplayer missions have flags and killboxes, but I've no idea what either looks like because the game doesn't seem to show them.The core campaign is little better. It's your bog-standard 'discover macguffin, fight to macguffin, fight off people who want it, then destroy it' plot that seems to be the default RTS plot design and Sturgis might as well be called 'Arthas' for the originality in his contribution. Due to Jakes being as pillow-fisted as the rest of the units, the missions often feel like they've got a reversed difficulty level, with some of the toughest missions coming at the start and the late game missions feeling much easier. Again, the AI is dumb as a box of bricks, often letting you dictate the pace of missions because enemies often won't activate until you attack them (the sterling winner has to be a late mission, where the Butcher will gleefully run around in front of your guns like a headless chicken). Mission design itself often feels profoundly unfun, with many missions with multiple fronts, something that just doesn't work with the Warmachine game mechanics. The game often doesn't signal the arrival of enemy reinforcements, leading to you often just spotting reinforcements by accident halfway through a turn. I shouldn't have to play 'hunt the mechanithrall' at the start of the turn, but there's no better way to check you know what's going on. Missions often require you to keep a number of character units alive, but this often causes auto-wipes half-way through missions as they're profoundly squishy. Special marks have to go to the second longest running character in the campaign, known either as Sarge or 'Trencher Sergeant'. Looking identical to his fellow Trenchers, he's easy to lose to enemy attacks and suffers the indignity of never being given an actual name.The unit selection feels a lot like someone went through the minature game, picked their favourite models and stuck them in. In particular, once you've unlocked Jakes' feat, it really doesn't feel like it works well with the rest of the Cygnaran army. It's a close combat buff, but there's only two melee infantry available and one of them already has all the buffs she hands out. There's also a paucity of repair units, which only makes the campaign harder. The 'alternate weapon' variants of infantry (like the Trencher Grenadier and Winter Guard Rocketeer) have almost identical (if there is a difference, I haven't noticed it) appearances, which means you often have no idea what the enemy troops are armed with until they fire it at you.So the big question is 'can this be fixed?' I really don't think so. The game cries out for a complete overhaul of the mechanics, but that'll take ages and if it hasn't been done yet, I doubt it's ever going to happen. Fixing the awful cutscenes would cost a ton. Realistically, the only things that can be overhauled are the array of bugs and poor design choices. An option to save during missions and skip cutscenes would be a nice start to making this a lot more user friendly.So in the end do I recommend this game? No. It simply never feels fun to play. While it has a few bright spots (a late game stealth mission is surprisingly fun for a stealth mission) the single player has a difficulty curve more akin to a roller-coaster, terrible cut-scenes and profoundly bad mission design. Skirmish mode is as challenging as beating a puppy and just as much fun. Multiplayer seems to be completely dead. It's a shame, but that's the truth.			"

								$65?  What?

Currently I don't see that here.I'm a Kickstarter backer and I'm really glad that I got a lot of extras + because there's no way I'd buy it for this price on Steam.   X-Com was worth the price.

The interface is buggy, and it's very easy to make an unintentional mistake that will cost you the match/scenario. Hopefuly it gets better, but I can't reccomend it at this time.			"

												It's just bad. How can it be this bad? Really, how can it?Yes, it horribly mangles the Warmachine ruleset. Yes, its controls are counterintuitive, unresponsive, and poorly designed. Yes, its ugly. Yes, its boring and repetitive. But somehow, that doesn't even really sum it up... there's something more, something worse than the sum of its parts. It's just a bad game, get Mordheim instead :/			"

												I was a backer of the original kickstarter campaign, so I had the key from mid-August. Didn't bother with the early access though, as I've learned it could spoil the fun of finding your way through the game once it's released, so I waited till official release became available.To my dissapointment, at the time of writing despite being released the game is far from actually feeling like a polished product ready for shipping. At best it's a public beta. Counter-intuitive in-game controls, camera which is tending to look everywhere other than where you need it, blurry and very slow graphic (12 FPS on GTX 650 1920x1020, seriously?). Obviously it hasn't been playtested properly yet, so a patch or two might get it all fixed.Unfortunately, lack of optimisation it's not the only problem. I didn't play the original tabletop game, but I do enjoy turn-based tactic strategies such as XCOM, and, I am sorry to say that, this game falls short of the modern standard for the genre. The introductory narrative in the beginning of the single player campaign fails to communicate even who I am, who the war is with, and for what cause, main characters say pretentious fluff and refer to georgraphic locations I've never heard of, voice acting is dreadful and amateurish. As a result I lost interest after 30 minutes of playing, and will uninstall the whole thing. Perhaps if you are a hardcore fan of the original tabletop you would see through all the sloppiness, but I'd rather play something else.			"

												Warmachine tactics is a game full of potential, it stays fairly true to the table top version. However the game suffers from optamization problems, bad voice acting, mediocre animation, bad UI and a few other problems. It does have XCOM syndrome where you can miss several 98% hit chances in a row but you cant really argue with rng. If they fix problems with the game then I would recomend this highly. Try the demo first though.			"

												I really really want to like this game, but I can't. At this point in its development it should be relatively stable and mostly functionally complete. It unfortunately is no where near that. I might call it alpha quality. There are graphical glitches all over the place. Some maps are unusable due to their weather effects. The get one chance to set facing system is so frustrating that alone makes me want to give it a negative review. On mac the game is not playable. The graphical glitches are so severe you can't see 90% of the map. I've reported these issues multiple times and have no response. Currently I can not recommend anyone spending any money or even time on this game. I think it gives the Warmachine franchise a bad name.			"

												Had high hopes for this game but overall am very disappointed.  The graphics looks great, but the game seems to randomly bog down as the FPS drops to zero with a stutter when you are doing seemingly minor things like firing a rifle, but during large battles everything is fine.  The interface is buggy to say the least.  Select to move a unit to one location and it will end up moving half way across the board without rhym or reason.  Units will face the wrong direction even when you tell it to change facing.  This leads to two different units with their backs touching but they are swinging swords at each other??  Colors for walk/run/control area are very hard to see in the background colors of the boards and you cannot adjust them.  You have to ""guess"" sometimes if you are even close to where you want something to move.  I won't comment on how bad the AI is for enemies, several other posters have done that.  Overall a big disappointment.			"

												Each update makes this a better game and assuages my fears about this game, which was ""really"" rough when it first released.  It is getting closer to what I would expect a beta game to be at, though I have my doubts about an end of August release.  I hope they take the time they need and keep rolling out great updates.  This game has the potential to be great.Edit 5/8/16:  The biggest complaints about this game have rightfully been the large bugs and the horrible user interface.  With the last patch the game looks MUCH better than it had, and is now very playable.  The bugs are getting squashed too.  In the end, cut scenes on the single player game still look bad with the lack of animation, but the game runs great and is easy enough to navigate around in and do what you are trying to do.  This is the game that should have been released.  Too bad White Moon Dreams took this long to get it out, but they are still plugging away at it, improving the game experience.			"

And some of the basic unit abilities are pretty unclear. This, togheter with some glaring graphical glitches makes this not fun to play.I hope the devs fix these technical issues, and allow us to enjoy what seems like a good game.			"

Early Access Review
								The good things of the current game are the overall visuals (both characters and environments look great), true to the existing miniatures and the sound does the job. Textures are very pixelated in close-ups (no texture filtering at all).The gameplay itself could be good if interface, camera and performance issues wouldn't ruin the experience.Every mission starts with the camera in a stupid position and you need to adjust it, fighting with unacceptable camera controls: the camera turns around its own pivot instead of turning around the scene. It also can be zoomed in beyond the ground! It feels like a free floating debug camera. Also, the camera jumps back and forth in order to focus on every performed action, which turns out being very annoying. There are so many strategy games to look at for inspiration; I don't get how it can be like that.The clumsy GUI requires some effort to get it (not the most intuitive one) and some of its elements are way too big, e.g. log and dialog texts (huge and blurry). I play PC games in front of my screen, no need to make texts readable to my neighbors ( ;Last but not least, the interactions with the units and buttons are sometimes screwed up, so you need to deselect-reselect your unit.So overall, the game shows some promise, but it feels like there's still a lot to polish. Some elements, such as the voice and dialogs, need even more than polishing: that should be shredded and redone.			"

												I'm not really feeling this game. I don't play the table top game which may or may not have to do with it, but I was looking for a fun and good a strategy game. Sure you go through the first nonsense levels which are boring and more of a learning tool. The stragtegy is sort of there but how you movement and action is somewhat linear. Your not making any big plays. Pretty much your biggest decision is how many points of action your going to give what warjack. I wasn't looking for an X-com experince like so many people are, but the game would feel a lot more fun if you chose your load outs, which you can do in pvp. Your stuck with what you got.Advancement is another issue for me.  Your main character does advance but it keeps everything on par, It sort of reminds me of dead island is the way of advancement, it doesn't change the game all that much. Zombies or in this case trenchers and war jacks are on the same level as you, to the point that you never really even get that slight edge through side battles or a tech tree. Combat is rather boring in general.  No new weapons or any major skills. Combat can be annoying because when you want to attack you have to turn a trencher or war jack in the direction you want to attack, which doesn't cost any action points but I don't understand why they just can't make trencher turn around on his own when you want to attack the baddie. It may sound trival but it's annoying when you spend 5 minutes just turning your guys around.You might have 2-3 trenchers with 87% chance of hitting the target, yet two out of three miss. For having these high percentage rates of hitting the target there is a lot missing going on.  Healing is sort of a joke, you get one or two points back which is a good deal but it's prolly not going to save you. Nothing new is really brought into this tactical game, which sometimes is a good thing, but you sit there and think...""okay attack this guy, you attack him. Now you. Hmmm still not dead, okay you attack"". It's pretty much, moving around in a small stage saying ""This is what I got, I see what you got, let's do this"".Even in x-com your % range is off, but the cover system is put into place for this. You don't have a cover system.Graphic wise, i'm not a grapic snob but they seem fine. I don't want to beat up on the game too much, no one really caes about the voice acting unless it's actually good, It's cheesy and can be over looked but there is something to be said about having great voice actors. They make you like the character, there really is no attachment here.The game is sort of average, I'm not sure how I even feel about it. I sort of want to give it a four because I thought it would be different, but that's on me. I give it a 5/10 because it's just average.  I can't get excited about it.			"

												It's been over a year since release. At this point it's pretty fair to judge it on what's inside it. Overall the price reduction is well warranted and helps justify purchasing this game.As a Warmachine player and gamer I cannot recommend this product unfortunatly. While it's very fun seeing these models come to life the UI and gameplay is still ""buggy"" and clunky.In comparison to other turn based strategy games, it is entirely too easy to give improper orders. A total lack of in game saves turns this problem from a mild irretant to a rage quit. Further the AI is a mixed bag of being exploitable while the rule set can easily see important models murdered in one lucky turn.The core campaign's gamemechanics are too close to the tabletop to produce a strong experience. I have had a miserable time trying to force myself to finish the campaign and have had all kinds of weirdness, stupidity, and frustration occur on missions 5 and 6. The infinite-respawning enemies are not clearly marked and it takes attempts to learn the eccentracies of the missions. Again the lack of save states hinders a smooth experience.Beyond that the dialogue and storytelling are a bit lackluster. There are novice errors throughout. It feels both indie and professional at the same time which leads to mixed expectations.I'm not sorry that I own or purchased this game. In point of fact I'm happy I supported this adventure. However, it does not feel like something I can recommend to others. If it had a strong single player campaign then I could at least recommend it on that point.			"

Early Access Review
								I have played around 10 matches or so, and I admit it has been a few years since I have played the TT, but I feel PP did a fair job in bringing this game to the Online Game world.  The price as many have indicated is based on KickStrater, and for most people I would recomend waiting until release when the price will be much lower.  However, those who have played the TT will realize the $65 is nothing compared to how much money and time it takes to get a army up and running.  It appears the the Deluxe Ed. will grant some free additional units and that had me sold to get this game now!  This game will be riddled with ""in-gmae purchases"" so be aware!I wont waste time with listing all the issues in this Beta, which there are a lot! But I remain confident the PP will grant us a game worthy of the title Warmachine.  A few major issues for newbies, is the lack of explainations of abilities.  Even myself had too look up some spells onine mid-game to remind myself of effects.  A minor detail now that I expect to be fixed, but those not used to the game will struggle.  For those TT players I say you will miss the in person interaction with your enemy.  You are forced to sit there for 3-10min per round in silence watching a turn go by and there is no chit chat.  I miss the cheers of ""WHAT A HIT"" or the cries of ""YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!"" as the game played out.  A audio connection would be great or a chat box would be nice at least.  Units have moved from single point kills  to multi-point health, and that is nice, but I feel that this has greatly shifited the balance of power.  Now a few ""solo"" units can easily take down a  warjack in a turn or 2, and a Warjack can have 2-3 hits on a SINGLE unit and not kill it.  So when your Jack is ganged up on by 3 units, it has almost no chance!  Something needs fixed on that.Overall this is a game to get.  For those who have played TT, now is a great time to buy, it's a low cost compared to what you have spent already on TT, and you'll get free stuff, Newbies its great to learn in a beta with few armies options, so the matches will be as even as they will ever be.   However, PP will try to sell the the moon with in-game upgrades, so if this game releases at $20 (and who knows!) the $45 you'll save may be better spent upgrading to the units you want, and not the freebies they'll give you in the Deluxe.

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW: 9/25/14With the latest patch from 9/23/14, you can finally play Skirmish mode, which means that you make your own army and play against someone else with their custom army, or against the PC (currently on Easy mode).  A typical skirmish game takes about 30-45 minutes.  For $40, I think that's a pretty fair price for what you'll eventually get when this game is complete, not to mention that there's going to be a 21-mission single player campaign too.Fun is what it is, and it's pretty close to the tabletop miniature game.  It has so much ridiculous potential that if you're a fan of the Iron Kingdoms lore, miniature wargaming, and/or the X-Com style of turn-based strategy combat, then you'll have many hours of fun with this game in my opinion.

												Kickstarter backer.  I played single player multiple times and multiplayer twice.  The game plays up the randomness too much.  While it translates a lot of the rules from tabletop, theres a different feeling when you are the one rolling the dice rather than a randomizer.  Having an entire turn of misses scroll across the screen is demoralizing.When I'm playing single player, my guys were just as survivable as the enemies.  I've done a fair number of turn-based games and when you're fighting against a force that respawns, your guys are usually just better.  I played mission 8 (the one where you kill a bunch of inactive juggernauts) and stopped.  Unless you get the perfect rolls and do things in the right order, one of the 3 (Rourke usually) gets smeared into paste by stray shots after holding him back the entire game to avoid it.Animation isn't smooth.  It's incredibly choppy and the game plus along at 8FPS.  It's terrible seeing as I'm playing far more power hungry games at better graphics levels with no issue.Finally, the mechanics within the game seem random.  So I move Jakes up and cast Positive Charge on my Lancer before attacking (doable on the tabletop) to get the bonus.  Instead, everything stops.  At other times, I can cast and attack.  Or the Lancer changes from a 2x2 grid size to a 1x1 grid size.When making charges, you are warned about opportunity attacks.  So I'll pick a charge lane, go at it to find out that they didn't notify me of this opportunity attack.All-in-all, this isn't a complete game.  If you want this style of game in fantasy, look at the Fire Emblem games from Nintendo.  If you want it in Sci-Fi, look at XCom.  But for the love of all that is holy, don't get this in it's current state.  I've wasted too much time trying to play this and I'm always frustrated by the end.			"

Early Access Review
								Having played this game through and done a bit of skirmishing, I have to say I'm very optimistic. It's graphically beautiful with excellent animations, fun ragdolls and a boatload of fantastic effects. It's very clearly a labour of love too, visible in all the little details you can find in the textures and on the models. The boardgame rules translate flawlessly onto the PC as well, turning a game that can take hours to play into something you can play in half an hour or so. The abilities are cool, the units feel unique and powerful, and tactical play is just so genuinely satisfying.I'm not seeing a lot of cons either. Most of my issues with the game as it stands come with the fact it's in Early Access. It's an incomplete, in progress game. It's got its crashes, its glitches, its frame drops and all that, but it's so easily forgivable. I don't regret a single minute spent on this game and I'm excited to return to it as it gets updated. This is also definitely a game that I could see myself gobbling down DLC for, getting new armies and units. The content you get with the main purchase is definitely, in my humble opinion, a full game's worth too, so I don't feel like it's unwarranted to do so. A solid singleplayer campaign and a nice selection of armies and units for multiplayer. It feels complete in that regard, and I'm certain they'll be adding onto it before the game comes out proper.That being said, I do need to point out that this is a boardgame turned into a PC game, and thus the main crowd it attracts are the boardgamers, the war gamers, the tactical turn based gamers. It's methodical. It rewards understanding your units and their abilities, thinking through your actions, making smart plays and using positioning to your advantage. It's not for everyone, but boy oh boy, it's definitely for me.			"

												Tl;drIf you like turn-based games, have the patience to get into the game and it is OK for you to overlook a number of flaws, then you should try this rather unique game.Longer version:Overall, this game is hard to rate and I certainly would not recommend it to everyone as it has several issues:- The game was released too early. This resulted in lots of bad reviews and is the reason for a second major problem: lack of players.- as very few people seem to be playing the game, it‘s really hard to find an opponent in multiplayer. Out of the 80 h of time Steam says I spent with this game, probably 20 h I was waiting for a game. - not only the waiting time for a game is really long, but a match (at least at 50 pts. level) is a serious time commitment. This also applies for singleplayer: you cannot save during campaign battles, if you do not have the time to finish a level, you need to start over. - the AI is really bad- not really a downside, but the game has a steep learning curve (including getting used to a rather clunky interface) and the AI is not helpful in improving. Still I think this is a good game and has lots of potential.- actually I liked the single player campaign. I am not sure what people expect from a Kickstarter game regarding cut scenes (a complaint in many reviews), but I think they worked quite well in telling the story. While the story is certainly not extraordinary, it kept me playing from one level to the next and I really liked the diversity of the maps. As the enemies in the individual levels are scripted, the dumb AI is not that much of an issue.- Overall, I think this game is quite unique in bringing a tabletop game to the PC. It may be described as a mash-up of XCOM (turn-based tactics elements), Bloodbowl (positioning your units; not to hide the ball, but your warcaster), and Warhammer (regarding colorful fantasy setting; I have to admit I did not know Warmachine before).Even though the developers are relatively slow in improving the game, they have been committed to making it better for quite some time and I think they improved it already quite a bit. Overall, I think this game is a solid 7.5/10 with lots of potential.			"

												TLTR: 3/10. Bad UI. Bad gameplay. Bad board-game port. Bad graphics. Bad sound. Bad skirmish-mode. Bad campaign. Good not one thing I could find. I've been trying to force myself to play this game in the hopes of eventually liking it, but but I cannot find a single redeeming quality.28. Des. 2015 - One year after release.UI: Mouse-clicks need to hit the correct pixel to choose units, meaning I need to click 3-9 times every time I want to choose a new unit. UI is otherwise very clunky and dependent on on-display buttons to control your units, which slows down gameplay to a crawl. Plenty of UI glitches causing unit-control to fail and causing a turnover for my most powerful units.General Gameplay: Developers chose an engine what was unable to handle the board-game. The result is a game uning the Warmashine brand without being Warmachine. Everything in this game is a poor look-alike. The difference in particular doesen't use the PC-medium to improve gameplay, rather being a result of poor development and decisions. The developers also doesen't have a clue, evident in the many many unelegant solutions for gameplay and presentation. They made mistakes I haven't seen in PC-games since the 90s.Graphics and Sound: All the lines are too soft, affording the game a generic cartoonish look. The colors are way too vibrant. The music and sounds are very repetitive and I turned them off after playing for about an hour. I was getting a headache.Skirmish and Multiplayer: The maps are very small, leaving no real room for manouvering. The game is so poor that the entire worldwide playerbase can be measured in two digits, making finding players for mm a chore.Campaign: The missions are drawn-out and have an unappealing design. The dialogue make me cringe, and are partially unskippable. Cutsceenes are ugly, meaningless and unskippable. The mission objectives are very unclear (Example: Protect the train - but the train is 1/4 of the scenario graphics and there is no way of knowing which pixel you need to protect or how fast and under which conditions the enemy can harm it. Example: Move down the gorge - but the gorge have 3 directions and there is no way of knowing which way is ""down"".)			"

												As a backer of the Kickstarter, I'm very disappointed in this game.  I have a 6-core 3.5Ghz processor, and while my graphics card isn't all that hot, it is an Nvidia gaming card... and this is not a real-time FPS.  It's a table-top game with ""flavor"" animations... most of the game, very little on the screen is moving, yet I have to turn the video settings way down to keep the audio from being choppy, and I still get terrible frame rates.  There is no reason a game that is presenting a mostly-still image should get such terrible performance, even with a cheap video card.  I was really surprised to see the game released and it still be hardly any better when I tried it out shortly after it went into beta.  The developers shouldn't have started working on DLC, they should be working on fixing the problems with the game.As others have noted, the UI is very clunky, and the number of times I move a unit to the wrong location because the UI interpreted my click wierdly is annoying (and I've only played 4 hours!), and accidentally entering melee with a unit you meant to shoot at can mean the difference between winning and losing a battle.  The camera is difficult to maneuver, it's hard to find all your foes (you can't see the mini-map during focus allocation), and it's easy to lose track of active enemy units among all the dead enemies and visual clutter.This game had lots of potential, and it could still be fixed... I'm just afraid that the developers don't see the problems here.The reproduction of the tabletop game is, as far as I've seen, rather good.  If you enjoy Warmachine on the tabletop and don't get to play enough, and you can put up with a poorly made game, it might be worth it.			"

								Don't buy this game expecting you'll get the whole game, just buggy. At this stage, it's basically a proof of concept, which it works great at. It has really good graphics for a game of its type (though unoptimized at this point), the sounds and music are great (though some sounds appear to be missing), the UI is currently a placeholder, and it works, but is ugly and unintuitive. There are two maps (which are nicely designed, but there need to be quite a few more), 4 armies (though there is no customization of what you're taking yet), and a single singleplayer mission.The pricing is unfortunate, but if they'd priced it lower than the kickstarter beta access, they'd have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off early backers. But pricing it the same pisses off Steam users. Probably would have been better not to do a Steam Early Access, or at least do it closer to release at a more reasonable price point. At least there are goodies included with the extra price, which you won't get with the standard edition.In conclusion, I'd like to give the game a 'sort of' recommendation. On the fence? Wait for release, buy it for $20 (I think that's what the final game will cost). Otherwise, think of this as preordering the digital deluxe edition, with a bonus included preview so you can try the game out. "

												The gameplay itself is alright,  but it lacks the ""basics"" of any game, very unrefined.It seriously needs:-A restart option to restart the level again.An option to skip cut scenes (spamming esc, space, enter, mouse buttons won't work).A quick save/save option (I can't finish a level in one sitting everytime, then it would lead to watching the cutscenes over and over again).It also needs to refine its unit selection process. Clicking on the units would not work even when i have no units selected. Switching targeting units is a mess too. Pressing Spacebar won't work, need to click twice on Prev/Next to select.Updated: I like the story, and I've tried to play through it with all its flaws. Ordered one of my trenchers for a combined ranged attack, lost all unit commands after that. Even after pressing end turn, all units froze, even the enemy is not moving. Loss all progress and forced to start over the mission again.Gave up. Uninstalled.			"

												This game is a miserable failure.I play videogames and tabletop since the early 80's, Warmachine/Hordes for over a decade. This game based on the Warmachine Tabletop is, regard to gamplay and graphics, dull, sloppy, wobbly and blurred.What was the task for the developer?They had a complete, full worked out rulebook and nice balanced factions/units. All they had to do is to translate this into the game ... and failed. The translation of the rules is a mess, flawed and inexplicable.They had tons of models, artwork and backround. Nothing to do at this point, simply translate into the game.They have written their own story and did a average job ... not good, not bad.They have created cutscenes lacking in charm, more like a shadow puppetry.They have created misleading and obscure missions.They have choose/created a game engine that beggars all description.Only the fact that I`m a Cygnar fan for more than 10 years carry me through this game.Save your money and time. Stay away from this game! "

												Really wanted to like this game, as I'm a fan of both Warmachine and TBS games; but there are too many bugs in it at this time to get any kind of enjoyment out of it.  The most annoying is that multiple units will frequently lose activation status in the middle of a turn before all units have acted.  Trying to end turn gets a message that some units still have actions to perform, but none of those units can be selected to act.  Worse, the turn cannot be ended, so once that happens, the only thing that can be done is to reload from the most recent save point.  Some turns have taken three or four tries to get through because of that bug.Optimization is poor, as I'm constantly dealing with performance issues with a system that is over the recommended specs on processor and memory, and roughly equivalent to the  recommended speds on video (dual Nvidia GTX460s in SLI config).  The controls are also rather clunky for a TBS game; particularly the camera.  Character focus is particularly annoying, since the game will auto-center on whichever character is activated, which can shift camera position wildly and slow things down as focus changes.Ranged targetting also has some significant flaws.  It's also not always clear who is within a particular unit's field of fire; and targeting is extremely clumsy.  Cover appears to exist, similar to X-Com Enemy Unknown, but it's very hard to tell if it actually has any effect on the actual gameplay, since the RNG seems to overrule any such effects.One of the weird things is that there is no character amination in the cut scenes.  None.  There is dialog, but the characters just stand there like figurines, not even any lip movement, and it's often hard to tell who is speaking without the voices.  Dawn of War 2 handled this much better.Even more annoying, the official website does not appear to have any community forum, and no mechaism for submitting bug reports.  It's like the producers simply don't care about making it work.I got the base game and all DLC for less than $20 on sale, and it was still overpriced; as the game is almost entirely unplayable at this time.  I would strongly recommend against purchasing this, even at a discount, until they get these bugs fixed (something that the development team seems to be making no effort to do at this time).			"

												I will start off by saying I never played Warmachine the tabletop game.I am a huge fan of turn based strategy games such as XCOM, Civ, and Fire Emblem. I love me some board-games too, most recently I've been hooked on X-Wing miniatures.This game scratches all of those itches. You have a very wide selection of units to choose from, and four factions at present that all feel very distinguished from each other. The depth of strategy in building a squad alone is immense, and it only gets more tactical when you actually have to deploy your units and do battle.PROS:*Proven gameplay taken from award winning tabletop game that's been around for a while*Massive depth available for building and tailoring your army*UI that is very helpful for n00bs (mouse over things to get them explained!)*Animated ""models"" breathe life into a miniatures game*Awesome rag-doll for corpses. Having a warjack hammer someone and watching a crumpled corpse get propelled backwards is always satisfying.*Multiplayer Options (local, async online, etc)*Well done single player campaign helps you learn units and gameplay rules*True hit percentages.... you can have only a 20% chance to hit with a 5% chance to crit and successfully crit your target!CONS:*True hit percentages.... you can have  a 95% chance to hit with a 50% chance to crit and miss your target...*Single player is only Cygnar Faction.  More please!*Still being worked on. (not really a con, but some UI elements are a little rough still and things like the Army Painter are coming)*No way to save skirmish games midgame. They do move pretty fast but if you need to do something else and you've got 2-3 rounds left it's going to be an issue.*Camera can take a little getting used toThis game is a lot of fun. If you enjoy turn based strategy games, chances are this game will rock your world. It's not too hard to get into, but it'll take a few games to know what you're doiing enough to venture into the army creator.As is 8/10With  currently announced planned additional features: 9/10Highly reccomended			"

												This is not a finished product. If it's advertised as so, it's a lie. It's very much unpolished - you can, for example, zoom into the ground, revealing hidden units or objects (NOTE: This issue has been corrected in the recent patches). It has potential to be a great game, but there are a few things you should consider before buying. First of all, this game came from Kickstarter, where it received more than 1.5 million dollars to be produced. Anyone who plays it, though, wouldn't say that it feels like a ""1.5 million game"". There are much better games in the market produced with less money. I was a kickstarter backer and I feel kind of deceived, because it doesn't look like all the money we gave to the developers was well spent in producing the great game that was promised. Voice acting is bad, the story is bad, gameplay is decent at the very best, and the main characters are very poorly animated. I don't know how they decided that ""animate the wind blowing the character's clothes"" was more important than ""ANIMATE THE MAIN CHARACTERS FACES WHILE SPEAKING"". Really, in all dialogues what you get is a blunt face staring at emptiness, while a voice-over is played - done by someone who clearly isn't a native English speaker. Hell, I'm not even english or american and I can tell the voice acting is bad and done by someone who's not completely fluent.Bottomline: if you're a fan of tactical turn based games like me, wait for a Steam Sale and get it; however, you should also be open-minded and have a lot of patience to overcome Warmachine's current shortcomings. If you're not a die-hard fan of the genre, don't even bother.It will also depend on how developers will fix/improve this game with patches over time. What I'm doing, and suggest anyone who bought it to do, is waiting 6 months or so until this game GETS FINISHED.			"

												I really want to like this game. I loved the tabletop wargame and was looking forward to this like you wouldn't believe. And as far as a port of the tabletop game...it works. Visually it may not be stunning, but it's faithful to it's source...the control system is easy to use and manages to reflect the tactical side of the tabletop game...so if you are playing against a human opponent, this does what it set out to do.The campaign doesn't.The campaign has a horrible habit of spawning opponents with no warning or indication, even repeat spawning, so the tactical side of each mission goes to the wayside. I think the mark of a good strategy game should be the ability to complete each map by being good at marshalling your forces and being a good commander...not by having played each map to the point that you know where all the spawns are and how long to hang around in one place. But repeat plays are the order of the day, here. You play the maps, get your butt handed to you by the enemy forces...not because they were better, but because they got a spawn...and then once you learn all the stuff that happens you play through and win. Your strategy is dictated by the timed events in each map, which leaves you with little actual room for innovative tactics.The map that drove this home is one where your force is breaking through a gate, while being attacked by pursuing forces. Those forces are represented by increasingly tougher waves of spawned enemies, that will just continue to spawn until you move through the gate...so setting up a defensive line and weathering the storm is not an option...you're forced into a survive then run tactic.And thats the problem. For a tactical game...the campaign wants you to do what IT considers the best tactic. Railroading is not fun in these kinds of game. So until that improves, I can't recommend it.			"

												TL;DR Review: Games ok in current form, needs work. Buy it if you're a die-hard Warmachine fan, but it's different from the tabletop. Being fully released for a while now, Whitemoon Dreams has certainly made an impressive game for only having a little over a year for development and being an Indie Developer. That being said, the game still suffers from optimization issues and bugs. They are almost doing themselves a disservice by putting an FPS moniter in the corner of the screen. Playing through the single player campaign, my FPS changed with every mission, some hovering around 50, while others struggled to get above 15. The graphics setting do allow you to gain a few FPS by knocking down the quality, but sometimes that doesn't even help. Another big stumbling block is the bugs, which have gotten better. Sometimes these bugs are a simple graphical glitch, but other times, they either make the game crash or don't let a unit finish attacking, effectivly ending the game. In the campaign, the cut scenes are sometimes fully animated, but other times, it's just panning shots of still models. I actually prefer this to the way other games just plop the idle characters into place, idle animations and absense of lip-syncing ruining your sense of immersion. I understand that Whitemoon can only do so much, being an indie developer, and have limited manpower, but the cut scenes just feel inconsistant. To anyone who plays the tabletop, this is a similar experiance, but there's a great differance. Some good, some bad. For one, it's a grid based system, as opposed to freely moving about the field to whatever distance is desired. This system makes melee ranges interesting. Stats are made more akin to a ""out of 5"" system, making some things hit harder than the tabletop, while others suffer. Another change is that Warjacks no longer have systems on thier damage grids, and it is instead more akin to a health bar now. Of all the changes from the table top, I really wish this one had stayed. In addition, certain units have gained abilites, like Assault Kommando Flamethrowers can now ""Flush out"" enemies hiding behind cover and push them back. On the subject of warrior models, there are no units in this game, all grunts are now solos with about 8 - 15 health. As a result, some damage has been amplified, like corrosion does 3 damage a turn and fire is even more potent. Warcasters, however, keep the same health they have on the table top. Despite all this, I still adore this game. I love seeing the tabletop game come to life. I love seeing the animated cut scenes in the campaign. I love the progression that the main protagonist goes through. I love seeing units breathed new life with new abilities and mechanichs. I love the communication that the Developers have with the community, and how often they update the game. All in all, it's not perfect, but I love it all the same.			"

												Disclaimer: I have not played the multiplayer yet. This review is based on a single player experience. This game is like a daily crossword puzzle.. There is a slight challenge and an even slighter sense of accomplishment when you complete it ultimately though no one goes online and reviews a crossword puzzle cause well it's a crossword puzzle.. This game doesn't allow you to do anything other than play their missions who show up one after another after another without a pause in between to save the game and go eat (or something crazy like that). One unit ""levels up"" after each mission and I use the word level up loosely cause all that happens is one of those units gets a stat increase that is not in your control, it just happens. You have no say over any part of the missions, the game gives you a goal and tells you what to do.. This game is boring enough without adding more to this review but unfortunately there is a MAJOR flaw to the game which is the camera.. Please watch gameplay reviews before buying this game cause the camera angles (which constantly change every time an action is taken) are horrific, more often then not the ""action"" camera will zoom into the wrong area thus not letting you see what the opponent actually did! The only way to play this game is to continuously adjust the camera to an overhead angle and zoom it all the way out or else you have no idea where everyone is. So graphics mean nothing (not that this game boasts good graphics) in this game when you are playing a far overhead game.. Anyways, my two cents			"

								As a player of the tabletop game, I had some reservation about the transition from boardgame to video game, given that I've seen poor adaptions or just carbon copy adaptions of other game franchises. Though I am happy that it is mostly a faithful recreation of the original tabletop miniatures game, with just enough new and different elements to make it unique and interesting. This is more than just what battle chess was to chess (ie, fancy animations added to a classic game), but instead every unit and mechanic of Warmachine is given a revamp to suit what is basically a squad based tactical game.I love the progress in the game so far (being early access beta) and can't wait for the finished product, so I can twist the arms of people I know to grab a copy, so that I may play against them.

It isn't unplayable, it just isn't worth the time required to play.I say this with nothing but regret. I'm a massive Turn-Based Strategy fan and every time I see a game like this miss the mark I'm sad for the genre.			"

												Can't really enjoy it because of horrible performance issues. I have a fairly high-end PC, yet the game constantly lags, stutters and even freezes for minutes at a time if i do something unusual... like click 'load game'. All while hogging 16GB of RAM running on medium settings... seriously?Which is sad, because the world, units, factions etc are beautiful and unique, with an interesting game system on top. Maybe after another year of development... currently, a 40min mission takes 2 hours, because you are constantly waiting for something. Much potential, but not worth it in present state.			"

												FIRST OFF, THIS GAME ISN'T BAD. I only picked 'no' because Steam hasn't given us a ""Depends"" button yet and I like to think this might encourage a little more critical thinking. I would reccomend this game to a specific group of people: namely the long time Warmachine fans. The devs did a great job of recreating the game and it's rules- it's about as close as you can get to playing the actual tabletop wargame. The graphics are rock solid and the battlefields well suited to the skirmish style gameplay.Pros:-Plays almost exactly as the original game- Models are faithful to the original designs, and even improve in some areas.-Good maps-Fair range of unitsBut...the cons:-UI and menu layouts/designs. They're servicable, but inelegant. If you're new to Warmachine, you are going to struggle to make sense of what might come naturally to someone who plays the tabletop.- Sound design is limited. The music isn't bad, it's just that the same song loops continously while you play. I eventually turned it off and had a playlist going in the background. Voices are sporadic and mediocre.-Unit selection is fair, but  getting nickled and dimed for the  additional units is some BS.  I bought the video game to get away from this in the tabletop game, man.-And most damnably, the AI. My word, the AI is breathtakingly stupid to the point of most matches feeling anti-climatic. You'll feel like you're bullying a ret,arded kid. This AI could be decent for practice if you're new to WM as a whole, but is mediocre for anything beyond that. If you get this game, be sure you've got some buddies to play with. Because after the 6th time your AI opponent just walks it's warcaster right into the melee range of your juggernaut, the novelty wears off. In short: If you've played the tabletop and are an existing fan of WM- go for it. Just be sure you have some friends to play with. Beyond that though, I can't reccomend it. It's a good adaptation for a niche game. You just have to be into that niche to get your money's worth.			"

												I have played both Mordheium: City of the Damned and Warmachine Tactics. And my reaction as soon as I touched Warmachine was, ""THIS GAME IS WAY MORE POLISHED THAN MORDHEIM. HOW IS IT'S RATING WORST!?""The answer is of course that Warhammer's IP is more popular, so people flock to that. Warmachine did alot of things right. I shall endeavour to explain why I feel this game deseves more love.THE KEY TO HAVING FUN: Is to understand that this is basically a digital TABLETOP wargame. Expect long turn times, units on a table, and numbers you could care less about reading. That's pretty faithful to the source material, so I can hardly fault the developers. People are upset because the Models' mouth don't move during cutscenes or the controls are weird, or whatever. Who cares.  I treat it as a board game and has loads of fun. If you can keep this in mind and understand that miniatures shouldn't be animated anyway, you won't have much to complain about. Cheaper than buying the actual models right? Of course, if they made this as a pure digital boardgame, it would probably be way better. Who Would Like this Game: People who like motion blurs, somewhat complex boardgames and tea breaks in front of their computer, have no problem with the dice gods and aren't anal about faithfulness to the source material (2 die, 3 die, who cares?)Who Would NOT like this Game: People who care alot about perfect animation, smoothness, perfect controls, a thriving multiplayer matchmaking service and a populous community. And video games. None of which applies to this game.+ Proper ruler Based Movement (none of that WASD FPS nonsense Mordheim gets up to where you can't see what's around the corner- instead, it emulates the ruler based movements of the tabletop fairly well)+ Small map (thank goodness, otherwise games would take forever)+ Zoom out for bird's eye view (for proper tactical gauging)+ Easy to comprehend information bars.+ Excellent Unit Models, Lots of Factions+ A kind of still alive Multiplayer (you may want to arrange games through the community groups, play with friends, or campaign. If you want a definitely alive TBS multiplayer, Warhammer 40k: Regicide is what you want).+ Not a pure RNG game. Positioning is actually somewhat important as are ""Combined Ranged Attacks"". Cons- Motion Blur can be eyewatering. The key, I find, is to just find an angle you're comfortable with and play, the map is small, there's no need to move around as much.- Stupid control scheme, takes some getting used to, but once you do, it's fine. (I hit tap the X key for unit deactiviation. Saves me time and sanity)- Long turn times. I move all of my units and attacks. The opponent does the same. You want TEA while you're doing this. Not really a con per se, because this is what a tabletop game is like.- Annoying numbers and things you have to read. Fortunately it's organized. Fortunately you can just ignore it. I DON'T READ. I zerg Rush and Bayonet the enemy. Like a Baws.TLDR; Try the Demo, treat it like a board game, not a video game, it doesn't hurt and you have full access to the multiplayer (minus some units).			"

												I understand why this is getting mixed reviews. The first thing you're greeted with is characters who are stationary and unmoving during a cutscene.Going into this I knew that Privateer Press is a company that makes wargames using miniatures. And that the characters in this are essentially figurines. I recommend going on Youtube and seeing some of the actual game footage, particularly the cut scenes, before you buy. So you know if this is a turn-off to you.The devs focus seems to have been the combat system, which plays alot like the recent X-com games. My first impressions are that the gameplay is deep and well-made. I suspect that much of the community is more interested in the competitive multiplayer aspect then the campaign.This should not be surprising but I should also mention that I encountered some bugs, mostly minor graphical ones.Anyway, if you like tactical wargames, and don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about how pretty the cut-scenes are. Then you might very much love this. But try the demo first.			"

Early Access Review
								KS Backer here and I gotta say, this is the biggest let down ever.  If the ""early access"" is like $20 then maybe it be ok but even then it's still asking a bit much.  What you see in the trailers on steam you honestly aren't getting any of those yet.The game is poorly optimized if at all.  I realize it's in ""beta"" but even with my machine it's having frame issues.  There's no voice over for any characters so the game feels dull when you move them.  The UI sucks, there no graphics to the UI, it's literally just a wall of text.From the beta I played for the KS backers there was only 2 factions to be.  I'm not sure if there was multiple maps because the game was so bad I couldn't stand it.  I closed the game in the middle of a match with another player.Seriously, this is the type of game Privateer Press think it's OK to put up on steam for $65 especially at this stage?  You might as well just keep this crap to in house testers and still label it as pre-alpha.Future game developers/publishers...  Stop using Early Access to rake in easy money.  Either let people sign up to test your game for free and actually give you feedback instead of making them spend X money and hating you for putting out a shoddy title.  I'm sorry but people's review that gave this a thumbs up are either trying to justify their poor purchases or they really like to ride that warjack pole.Anyone who reads my review you have been warned, definitely not worth $65 and I actually wish I can get my backer money back this is some BS.  I've made a lot of bad purchases on steam but this one really takes the cake.			"

However as time passes on they have been adding more and more to the game and fixing the problems. Keep in mind when this first came out they made it clear that the game was in alpha or beta so at first it was not going to look so great. With all that said this was a fantastic first attempt at making their first video game. But I wont lie I cannot wait till it is fully updated and playable.HOWEVER!If you are a fan of the table top = buy it on saleIf you dont play the table top = I would not recommend this OR wait till its fully updated			"

								Hiya,       Long time Table top player here and let me start off saying this isn't the same thing. And that's a great thing. Now of course this game is still in early access so it is bugy and it does have some known issues with certain graphics cards. So check those discussion threads and make sure this game will work for you now before buying it, or wait untill the the full release.       As it is currently Warmachine is a fantastic tactical game with good balance and different feel between the factions. Multiplayer is definitely going to be this games strong point, but even the main story is looking solid so far. The lore of Warmachine is great but you're not going to need to know any of it to succeed in this game, it looks like new players will pick this up quickly. Really if you have experience with turn-based strategy games I think this will be a breeze to grasp. The even better news is that with all the freedom in unit selection and the range of units it's easy to create tons of strategies. And the multi-player community is already here and going to get stronger as the game nears release and leaves early access.       Bottom line for me this game is good. Even if you can't get it now I highly recomend following it and picking it up later. I don't think you'll regret it.			"

												A lot of polish has been going on ever since the beginning of the beta. Every patch continuously works on sqaushing bugs and many new features continue to be added. The new hold right click to change facing on movement is a wonderful feature to make gameplay that much smoother.The design team is extremely commited to making this the best it can be. They have been very open and interactive with the community about suggestions and changes. They still filter the community's suggestions but they are very good at explaining their reasoning behind their decisions. It's very inspirational to see this from a developer and I hope to see more community involvement in game design in the future.For those who want a competitve turn-based tactics game with solid combat mechanics and great unit selection, I'd highly recommend this game. There are some challanges with regards to camera control and there is a learning curve with the various unit and caster combos, but very rewarding once you get a grasp of the game.			"

								Current ideas  I thought of that might improve the game and help give it the Awe in Awesome. Could possibly use a zoomed in combat cam that will follows the selected character as they go for a finishing blow, possibly with a short battle animation of them erradicating the enemy players unit. Might even do good with one that follows a moving enemy too in order to notice what your opponent is doing if possible. Slow motion death cam could be neat if possible. Still having fun.

												Genre - Steampunk?Fanatsy Turn based StrategyI have never played the board game of this but have played similar games in the past. The game itself has an extensive campaign with 20 missions, having differing objectives and units throughout. You play as the one faction Cyngar, although I suspect that other campaigns may be added later. You command basic troops, heroes and bandits (Mini Mechs). You also have access to some spells and abilitys to turn the tide of battle. The controls are not the easiest but after a bit of trial and error they should make more sense and help you decide which units to move and attack with first (I recommend the tab key for cycling through units). The game plays well and the universe and story of the campaign are fairly engaging. I haven't tried a skirmish game yet but this should allow you to contrpl the other factions against the AI or humans. There is some DLC, but this just adds more units to the skirmish mode, so don't feel obliged. A fun game for all fans of turn based strategy.			"

												While I haven't had some of the slowdown issues other reported, I found Warmachine tactics to be incredibly clunky. The UI was unplesant to use it simply didn't feel good to move units around. I felt like I spent more time trying to get units to do what I wanted--even basic attacks are often several layers of clicking deep in the unit's action bar--than I was thinking about tactics and strategy.The camera would frequently get in the way and it didn't zoom out far enough. It was far too easy to end a unit's activation by mistake. Units have too many abilities with very minor differences in damage and effect for the way the action bar is laid out. If I'm going to be forced to click through several layers of the action bar to get to an attack, I'd at least like that to be because the attacks are substantially different and represent more interesting options than what is on offer with many of the units here.I would have much rather seen lower graphical fidelity and more attention to useability. This game is just too fiddly for me given its medium depth tactics and the high volatility of its dice mechanics.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't normally write reviews of early access games, but I felt inspried to do so given the rather one sided nature of the current set of reviews.Let me clarify one thing, the price of the game is a reflection of fairness regarding the price players paid during the kickstarter to access earier versions of the game. Contrary to most, this game will actually decrease in price as it gets clsoer to release, just like we have seen with Planetary Annihilation. Therefore this review is based on a 20$ game.The game itself looks gorgeous. There does seem to be a little overemphasis on the glow effects, but other than that and a few graphical bugs expected during beta the game is a real beauty. There is a definite lack of features and areas to play in, but that again is also to be expect in the game's current stage of development.Gameplay wise it could not be better. This game more than any other I have played brings the tabletop to the desktop. They have very succesfully transferred what is a very top quality tabletop boardgame and directly applied it in terms of look and gameplay to the PC. Players take turn moving their (now fully animated and awesome) miniatures and attacking, with all of the actions avaliable in a simple and effection fashion. The UI is clearly unfinished so we cannot take a good look at that yet, but the layout is very intuitive and the ability to move your camera right down into the heart of the action makes for some really exciting action moments rarely seen in the turn based genre.Overally I conclude that the game is already enjoyable, but only about 50% feature complete and I very much look forward to the final product as all of the work so far is superb.

												TL;DRWarmachine: FrustrationMy full two cents:I love Warmachine, it's a very solid and well thought out game that isn't too much of a cult or too difficult for anyone to get into. That being said, it pains me to do it, but I just can't recommend this game. Minutes in, you'll see how horribly optimized it is with framerate drops, freezes, etc. And sweet jesus, someone needs to explain to me how you can miss 90% chance hits, 90% of the time. The game will make you want to put your head in a vice and start squeezing. My biggest issue would be with pathfinding. While a lot of times, you won't have an issue running off into the distance to regroup, sometimes your units will choose to run right in front of multiple enemies versus taking the equally long, but wide open route. The free strikes involved will make a huge difference in-game. Other small issues are all within the quality of the game itself. The voice acting is unbearable, the cut scenes are of PS1 quality where the ragdoll effects are fairly competent (priorities?), the camera is TERRIBLE. There is no way to get it just straight up and down with the maps, or to redirect it to look around buildings and similar when trying to move units. This results in your clicks, though clearly on the ground around the corner, to be redirected to the front of the building. sacrificing your movement.Clearly I've got some gripes, but a small part of me believes that with these frequent updates (anywhere from 500MB to 3GB), one of them will actually get it right. Till that happens, I can't fathom giving this game a thumbs up. It's physically painful to play.			"

The game mechanics are different enough that you're going to have to make adjustments, but if you're good at the tabletop you'll probably be able to adapt quickly enough.The single player is terrible, but I can't imagine playing a wmm tabletop vs a handful of infantry anyway.

I would goto cast a spell and it would be greyed out, and I am like well how much does it cost.  While the ones I can cast list there cost.  I had to back out and search in other windows to find the information.  This might seem minor but to new players and people unfamilar with the Warmachine world this would be annoying.Coming for the background that I played the tabletop version for over 10 years, I sure I could still find lots of enjoyment from the game.  But I could not recommend this to someone just looking for a turn base stratagy game, it lacks refinement, and there are elements that are way below the standards for game asking so much.  I would wait until this drops to the $20 mark before picking it up.			"

												Looking solely at story this game has been quite enjoyable. However for a ""released"" game it is lacking in some basics that other turn-based strategy games already have inplace. Such as oh I don't know the option to save in mission; either you complete a mission or you have to start the mission from the beginning. There is also no fog of war in this game, so when you are in a mission you can see all the enemy units (excluding any trigger created units).Looking at other reviews I see I am not the only one who is very disappointed in the choppy camera functions but this could easily be fixed. The controls for the camera are terrible and simply awful in comparison to other strategy games. Rather than a simple hold shift (or other key) and move the mouse to adjust the angle or rotate the camera, you have multiple sets of keys you to use in order to manipulate the camera to the desired position. But overall, I would still recommend the game. I just hope that the developers fix the various glitches and the camera controls.			"

												So frustrating! This could be an awesome game. As another reviewer noted, Warmachine: Tactics is ideal for a board game to PC game adaptation, due to its complicated rules of combat and movement. But this seems more like a prototype than a finished product. The basic complaints are all true, the buggy camera is especially annoying. The music is irritating, and apparently never changes. After a couple hours I finally just turned it off entirely. In spite of the bugs, I really gave this game a solid try, but 6 hours in and I'm just giving up.The big deal killer for me is three times now, after 30-40 minutes of play on the train crash map, a system notice will pop up, taking focus off the game window, and the game instantly crashes. This wouldn't be so bad if progress was saved, but nope, gotta start the map all over again. Compare Warmachine to XCOM: Enemy Within, which was released around the same time. I'm giving up on this one.			"

It is still a blast to play for fans of the tabletop, and if you can stand the bugs that are still being fixed, definitely get it. If you are easily frustrated by bugs, then I would wait a while before purchasing so they have a chance to fix everything up. I am looking forward to them expanding the game into more diverse Skirmish options, and maybe including playable Hordes as well.			"

The extra units are not game breaking , DLC for this game is more like options than it is advantage, this is More a way to play the match differently , if you pay 50 bucks for example and buy all the DLC you will have the same advantages as a person paying 20 dollars and getting the basic game.   The balance for the game is set and established by the table top rules its based on and established over 10 years.   65 dollars you get your game and 20 extra units, Dont like the price Wait and you will get the game for much less and minus the extra units.     Everyone has there choice but either way , this is a tital that you will regret passing up.			"

												Run away as far and as fast as you can from this game! I wanted it to be good, as I like the table top game, but it absolutely isn't. It lacks polish in a big way. Targeting is atrocious, the camera is beyond bad, I'm six missions in and stuck. To be clear, I've beaten almost every game I've ever bought and never once not finished because it's ""too hard"". There is some 101 stuff they have completely ignored in this game that is standard for tactics games. You cannot save mid mission so one mistake wastes an hour of hard work, you can't pick your troops before a battle. This is absolute garbage. Way to lower your standards Privateer Press.			"

 I definitely recommend this to anyone that likes turn based squad/army combat. Pros:+6 unique races to choose from, each with their unique play styles, abilites, visuals, etc+GFX is great, lots of attention to detail on the models, with great diversity between factions+Wide range of passive/active abilities to choose from across all the units+Each unit can be used in many different ways (eg ""melee unit"" doesnt just have to run in and slash)+Tech support is responsive and helpful Cons:-Campaign is linear, with no customisation between missions-Single campaign, player mainly only uses 1 of the 6 races-Low number of maps to choose from in MP/skirmish-No army painter for skirmish/MP-No hotseatAt the moment there isn't anything on the PC market that is like this, but as others have said, its like a mash-up between Warhammer and XCOM. It's a very diverse game so naturally it has a relatively steep learning curve. I have thousands of hours experience in different strategy games, so I can safely say this is a great game.The game (and more importantly the DLC's) get very cheap when there's a sale so if ur hesitant about the price, just wait for a sale.

								Everyone needs to understand that this game was created from a Kickstarter ages ago. It's in Alpha, there will be BUGS, there will be control issues. So get that through your system. Regardless, if you are a fan of PP industries you will truly enjoy this game as it is just like the tabletop game. Granated, with a few things here and there that seem off. I am sure the designers of this game will iron out the details. Beautiful units for an Alpha, minor details that catch the eye and bring the characters to life. Pretty fun game. For 64$ you're not just buying a early release but supporting the devolopment of this game to be something more than just the cookie cutter turn style games out there.			"

												Honestly a bit of a disappointment with this one. I was a kickstarter backer played it a bit early on thought that there was a huge amount of bugs especially the camera that made it barely playable left it for a long time came back six to eight months later. Lots of problems had been resolved but still the single player campaign is really lacking. It just isn't fun. There is nothing really wrong per se with it, it just doesn't feel very engaging. This game might shine in multiplayer but single player left me completely cold. I was hoping for some XCOM-like Steampunk game but this clearily isn't anywhere near that. Can't say much how it compares to the tabletop game as I never played that one			"

Early Access Review
								Warmachine: Tactics is a turn-based strategy game, akin to XCOM and similar. While it is faithful to the tabletop game it is based upon, it currently offers little for the large price attached to it. I will go into more detail below.Pros+ The Asthetics - The game is set in the Iron Kingdoms, a high-fantasy world designed by Privateer Press that mixes magic and steampunk technology, resulting in the trademark multi-ton Warjacks of the franchise, and the Warcasters who control them. Each faction has a very distinctive design and colour palette (from the armoured and crimson Khador to the clean white and gothic-like Protectorate), so no matter what your taste one or several of the factions should appeal to you.+ Performance - In eight hours of gameplay, I have only suffered a single crash and malfunction in the game. The game seems to be in a surprisingly stable state. My only complaint about the preformance would be that on a low-medium setting, I am only getting 15-20 FPS. However, I am unsure weither this is because of the game being unoptimized or because my computer is getting a bit old. Nevertheless, if you have a somewhat modern rig, you shouldn't have any problems running the game at a pleasant FPS.+ Fun-factor - Being a player of the tabletop Warmachine, the prospect of seeing the normally still and silent models come to life is very entertaining. Then watching the behemoth Warjacks swatting away infantry like insects is thrilling. The team behind Warmachine: Tactics has faithfully remade the tabletop units into the game. and they look, move and feel as they should. Add to this good sound and visual effects (I have no doubt these will be further improved upon) and satisfying ragdoll effects.Even in its currently limited state, I have enjoyed every minute of the eight hours I have so far spent playing Warmachine Tactics, and I am certain that I will continue to play it for hours to come, both before and after the game's release.Cons- Early Access - As it stands, the game is in a pretty unfinished state. While the game runs quite well (Only one crash in eight hours of gameplay, and no game-breaking glitches or bugs.), it is unoptimized. Alongside this, many of the features that are intended to be in the final release are not yet implemented. All four main factions (Khador, Cygnar, Protectorate, Cryx) have only one battlegroup of units available, and this battlegroup can't yet be modified. There are also only two multiplayer maps, and one singleplayer mission available.The advantage of buying the game during the Early Access is the addition of the Digital Deluxe edition, which includes some future paid DLC for free.- The Price - For what the game Currently offers, it is expensive. When the game is released it will be sold at a lower than current price, but at the disadvantage of not including some of the paid DLC that will be released after the game's release. By buying it now you will recieve the game, some future paid DLC for free And being able to play the game in it's current form.According to the developers, the combined cost of the finished game and DLC will be higher than the current price for the Digital Deluxe edition on sale here.Conclusion - Before you make any purchase, you should look up some gameplay videos on YouTube. There are many to chose from, and don't be afraid of watching several before deciding weither or not this game is for you. I also need to stress that the game is Unfinished. It is clunky and rough around the edges (In addition to it being expensive for what it currently offers.)But that should be expected from any Early Access title available on Steam. Do not buy this game expecting a finished product filled with content, because you wont find that here.If you are fan of Warmachine and don't mind playing an unfinished and work-in-progress game, in addition to paying quite a bit for it, I can safely say you will enjoy Warmachine: Tactics. However if you aren't feeling the urge to immediately play it, you wont miss out on much by waiting for the full release and a cheaper price.If you are less experienced about Warmachine, I again recommend you look it up properly before you make your purchase, else perhaps wait until the finished game is released, and along with it a lower price tag.

												Reviewing the single-player campaign only.Do you long for old school games, where each level took 30-60 minutes, there were no saves, and if you trigger an event too early you lose? Well then Warmachine Tactics is for you. You'll be humming along in a scenario, and all of a sudden one of your guys will move forward and enemies will spawn and kill one of your essential characters. Or you won't be moving fast enough towards an unclear destination and an unkillable wave of enemies will spawn. The solution is to replay the levels over and over until you figure out all the tricks. Plenty of UI problems too. The camera is wonky. The UI uses light blue and green to denote important information, but many of the levels are played on snow, which washes out the blues and greens unless you zoom in and stare at the screen.			"

												I really wanted to love this game, but it remains a huge disappointment. Privateer hired a game company without the experience for PC games, and it shows. The interface is clunky, graphics 'fuzzy', and the camera is glitchy. I would say most people that purchased the game expected a play experience similar to the tabletop, and this does a terrible job of translating that experience. Another failing is the complete lack of a save feature - be prepared to sit it out for  hours as the missions get progressively longer.This isn't a game that aimed for the stars and failed, it failed to even break orbit. At a current $4.99 on sale, it may well feel like a waste of money.			"

												It began with a simple request. select your faction...""the dragon of course"" replied my wife. By this time I had gone through the single player tutorial and a couple missions that were available when i purchased the beta but now it was time to contruct my first list now the real fun begins. A friend and fellow tabletop gamer had shown me the kickstarter campaign and I was intrigued but I had never heard of kickstarter and had not even played the tabletop version of warmachine so I instead waited to see if this would ever really happen. I consider myself to be an example of exactly why this game was made. As I said earlier I had never played warmachine, I had never used steam, and frankly avoided most social network communities and yet here I am less than a year later my consoles collect dust, my other tabletop miniatures sold, and I am the proud general my own tabletop cryx list to compliment their online bretheren. Most importantly, I am here reaching out to you the reader and supporting, no encouraging your decision to play this fine game by great people at white moon dreams. Finally, if ever we are to meet on the field of battle may the best warcaster win.			"

Just like in the old Blody Bowl.The controversy and mixed recommendations:Too soon released as a full game. Now it is ok and still improving.Optimization, I have no problem, but if anyone have older PC. Its worth checking the minimum requirements for medium graphic settings and stable 15-20 fps.

												I'm a big fan of Warmachine and PrivateerPress, so understand this is probably somewhat biased. I enjoy the game thoroughly. Admittedly it is clearly a work in progress, but I would call the base game a decently completed product. The optimization is lacking a bit as the frame rates will be surprisingly low on high settings for rather powerful computers. That being said, the system flows very well, it is very pretty for a turn based strategy game, and if you enjoy the Iron Kingdoms lore, it is very hard not to enjoy the game. I can't wait to see this game if/when they add all the factions and troop, jack, casters for Warmachine and Hordes.			"

								This game is a true representation of the Table Top. Which is exactly what I wanted it to be. It seems clear from reading the reviews that players don't understand that. Many of the complaints I've seen from people is the price point, however if you were going to play WM in a game store (Like I do) then it would cost you $50 for a battle box + tax. In the digital game you're getting 4 battle boxes + a unit and the promise of all that is to come for $65. The amount you get alone in this deal is far greater value. If you are a table top WM player this is an exact copy, and it is fantastic. Good work folks at the studio I can't wait for the finished version and I'm looking forward to Hordes! All the negative reviews that I have read, are clearly from people that don't play the table top and have no idea what they are looking at. Keep up the good work!			"

												I just recently purchased this game, was lucky enough to get it for a great price (Deluxe Edition), I'm exceptionally impressed. I realize there are many fans of the Warmachine franchise that play the table top game and may differ in what they are looking for. I had no clue what to expect, have never played this game in any capacity (VG or TT), that said, this is one heck of a turn-based strategy game. I love TBS games, X-COM, Jagged Alliance etc., so for me, this is absolutely perfect. I was able to pick up the rules relatively quickly, there are a few warlock spells and such I'm still trying to get the hang of, though overall I feel it's very adaptive and natural to play if you give it the chance. I can't say enough good things about the game, it definitely needs to be refined and optimized more, though I haven't had a single issue with it, no crashes or stability issues (sound sometimes intermittently stops for no reason, talking like for 1/16th of a second, though it's noticeable). The current six different sides (with Merc and Scyrah expansions) are all unique and offer something different, plan to get the expansion: The Retribution of Scyrah and hope to see Convergence of Cyriss added at some point. The game had me interested so checked out Privateer press and noticed some amazing units in the gallery and an additional faction. Khador is fantastic to play with, easily my favorite. Definitely recommend this game to any fans of TBS games, this is a rich world similar to Warhammer, really enjoying it! Can't wait to see what new maps and units are introduced.			"

												As a a Tabletop/War Gamer in general and especially a Warmachine/Hordes player, someone who followed WMD when it first announced a Warmachine game and a backer of the later Kickstarter-Project I truly hate to say that I can't recommend this game. The developers had enought time to fix some major bucks or design flaws, but they didn't. Performance issues are still at hand: if your game kept running  for a respectable amount of time without a crash, than that just means a crash is a soon-to-be occasion. Not a ""possible"" occasion, a crash -will- occure. The UI is quite obnoxious, but usable, and keeps looking like a developing kit.For Lover's of the tabletop: Yes, it is nice to see some of your beloved units, 'jacks and 'casters moving, but that depends on the FPS rate at which you stop talking about movement. Same goes for the cutscenes betwen the missions of the No Mans Land campaign: they are more like the stills with subtitles on a classic Nintendo game, but with sound/voiceacting. The Nintendo would've had sound, if the system could've done it. The PC/Mac System could handle motion...But back to the issue for people coming from the Tabletop: Its not a good representation of the game you know. It has a good number of similarities, yes, but sadly just enough to make you wonder (or in case of a backer: shake your head out of utter lack of understanding) why they didn't designed the game as closeley as possible to it. From a lackluster point system to represent the ability scores of your army to a just as bad changed scale of for the hitpoints. Never dream of seeing a Trencher act in a concert with 5-9 fellow unit members. He's just a solo with massivly boosted hitpoints, to keep large numbers of grunts out of the game, because ""the engine could not handle that"". That leads to a things like AoE's being of more than maginal value against, well, anything, because they were designed to benefit from te existence of single-wound infantry or low HP medium Infanty. Quite easy to see the error here. Well, wrong engine then, I would say...Keep in mind how the game is named: WARMACHINE: Tactics. Warmachines. That are, to my understanding, the Warjacks, the defining feature and a great bit of the appeal the whole system has to most of its fans. It's steam-powerd fantasy. The Trencher is not steampowerd, the Ironclad is. And the Warjack didn't get the same treatment of powerscale adjustment the units got, which lead to funny things like 3-4 mechanithralls ruining a warjacks day. To my dispair, as much as I like Kickstarter and as much as i cheered for WMD to take the challenge of creating a video game adaption for warmachine, I think Kickstarter allowed WMD to get through with what they tried the first time they started developing for Warmachine: taking a bite way to big for their mouth, trying to design something that's way too large for them, playing in the big league while not able to hold the bat straight. W:T has potential, much of it, but I can't quite see the nurturing enviroment developing it needs to flourish.			"

												I'll play the single player through because I'm interested in the story and have played the tabletop a lot. I cannot, however, reccomend it to anyone. The graphics are bad, they have 0 motion during cutscenes, even the avatars don't move their mouths while they talk. The controls are clunky and it's way too easy to lock in the wrong command with no way to undo it. The animations are long to watch and no way to short-cut them. I don't need to watch 10 infantry run up the field, and have to watch each one do their slow thing before I can tell the next to do the same.From what I've seen of the missions, be prepared to fail most your first time through, then see the trick they want you to pre-setup, and do that. Wouldn't be so bad if the missions weren't hours long with no checkpoints....I'd not even recommend it if you got it free. Not worth the time until the devs put a LOT if time into it :(			"

												It's alright. For what I paid for through the Kickstarter, I'd say it's worth it as a Warmachine fan. But they've got still got quite a bit of work to go if they think people will pay a full 40 for it. On the plus, Warmachine game mechanics are implemented fairly well. Unfortunately, the game handles like a very clunky and tempermental version of XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The camera is a bit fidgity too, but nothing some grease can't fix. And between the cutscenes and the menu, I feel like I've gone back in time to playing Warcraft 3. But all good things come in time, and they haven't stopped working on it yet. If you're a Warmachine fan, or interested in trying it out, I'd recommend it if you ever find it on sale, but not at the current price.			"

You will maybe like it.For everyone who is playing tactic games: Don't even think about it!There are many reasons for it (sorry, I'm working as a QA in the gaming industry and maybe I found more things, where somebody else would say: Come on? Really? The game is fine for me, it doesn't bother me that much!). So here we start:1. You can't choose any other language, it's only in english. Not really a problem for me, but even Games for 5€ like ""Knights of Pen and Paper"" got more language packages. Even subtitle would be fair enough for people who don't speak english.2. You can't cancel the intro, you have to see the full conversation of 3D-Models who do nothing... NOTHING... You hear them talking and the camera is switching to each person, but they don't move. Not even once, or move their lips.3. A part of the second one, is the 3rd crap... You got 3D-Models and they do nothing? oO All videos are like this. 3D-Models standing on the same position, camera is moving around/switching positions, but the whole situation is static! It's like you looking at Barbie and Ken standing there and you listen only to voices. This is so epic...4. Gameplay / Control settings... OMG, this isn't only the 4th reason... There are so many issues... Didn't they gave it to someone else who just said:""Rly? Who would play like this?"", or they said:""I can handle it, it's fine for me, bring it on!""4a. The camera moving, it's fine with the keyboard, if you get into a curvy level with alleys... it will drives you crazy, of switching the fews.4b. Camera again, but this time the ""Enemies Turn"" -.- You always... RLY F***ING ALWAYS!!!!!! Move back to your champ... This means... (camera view) The enemy make one move... The camera switch back to your champ... (camera view) The enemy attacks... The camera switch back to your champ... and it's all the time like THIS! After a match of 30mins, you are getting crazy!4c. If you didn't played the TG-Version, you are confused after the tutorial. Well, not really confused, but in my opinion, when you played a tactic-game you can move your characters to covering position and when you got some movement points left, let your character defend/attack when an enemie is in the line of sight. Here is only ""Done"" the option.4c. Choosing another target. You get missions, where you have to destroy mission objectives. ""You played the tutorial? Yes. You see all the overload of informations? Yes. You can attack the objectiv? No. Did you saw the little buttons with ""Next""? No... F***!"" and it is like I said. You got massive buttons to do something, an overload of informations and two little buttons for ""Next"" to choose another target.4d. Combined attacks for example is one of the features, where you first don't know what the hell you got to do. Till you found out, you don't even need another character, no. When you combined it, with the characters who are able to do so, it happens nothing... Till you click again on one of these characters to double-ok-lets-this-finally-finally-finally-finally... It feels like: You want to uninstall it? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? 4e. No automatic-""End Round""?! oO... What the hell... You made your moves, you can't do anything... after 10sec you realized, you didn't click the ""End Round""-Button.4f. Why you need to show a timer, how long the AI need and you needed for your turn? Who cares? When you put a time-mission into it, make a counter and stop it, when the AI make his turn...5. Clipping bugs... When you got a curvey level with many alleys, you will hate this level so much. Mostly you don't see anything, cause the automatic camera moves into houses/hills/etc, so you can see everything inside the houses/hills/etc, but not what happen outside of it...6. Sound bugs -.- I'm playing with a headset. Mostly I get shocked of a massive, but short sound interrupt from nowhere. You done a mission and befor the ""intro"" for the next mission starts you got a short sound-queue of the winning sound for 1-2 seconds, which is so loud, it will blow you up sometimes. ;)To conclude:You might got some fun, if you are a TG-Player. If you ""only"" like tactic-games and played some others befor, you won't be satisfied. There are too many things which will make you so angry and you will ask yourself, which person decided this and if this person really was the right one for this job, cause even a reta** wouldn't do this.They got really nice ideas, but only ideas... So many companies try to reinvent the wheel. Cause they wanna be someone. Games are for gamers and not for a Product Director, or a Game Designer. You want the people like your game? Make easy controls, put some lifeblood inside, stand behind your project and when you be really cool, invite 10-20 people to play that game WITH NO INTERRUPT! And see what they do!Well, I'm out... I will try to continue this game, when I'm so bored and really got nothing else to do and even to do nothing would be bored.			"

Early Access Review
								It's a Steampunk XCOM: Enemy Unknown with extra mechanics! No, but really. It is. But aside from that, Warmachine Tactics is a turn-based tile map strategy RPG set in the Iron Kingdoms world, and seems to be loosely based on the tabletop game of the same name. Even at this early beta stage, the game is showing a lot of polish and in the new and work-in-progress Unreal 4 Engine itself, runs fairly well. I was able to maintain 25-35FPS in the midrange settings. I have no doubt that this game will run like hot butter when it's optimisation is completed.The game is very pretty, and the range of spells available between Warcasters, Warjacks and Infantry bring pretty interesting gameplay. However my initial impression of the 'direction' facing mechanic is that it is somewhat obtuse, but after some playing you get used to it. One of the things that also frustrated me some was that when you being taking actions with a unit, you can't 'save' actions for later in your turn. You must complete all possible actions or end that unit's turn in order to take action with another unit. That being said, the one single player scenario available in game is a lot of fun, and when it was completed I was only left with excitement for the next piece.Closing this up, my only regret is that I don't have more time to play it RIGHT NOW. It IS a little bit prohibitively priced, but with the extras you get when the game goes into full release I'd say it's probably worth it. This is how Early Access should be done, and even in it's early beta state, with pretty solid gameplay I must give this game an 8/10.			"

Early Access Review
								Before I start I must say that I have played 3 or 4 games of Warmachine / Hordes on tabletop....So far I have played about a dozen matches. This is a faithful reproduction of the tabel top game. The factions are currently limited to 5 or 6 so differnt units and 1 Warcaster which is a long way away from the 50 or so in the table top game. Having said that there have been weekly updates which introduce knew units. So for instance tommorow there are knew warjacks being released for each faction. The look of the units and the quality of the graphics could not be better.Even in this beta version I would very much recomend this to anyone who is familiar with the tabletop game. I think this is pioneering work being done by Privateer Press and £37 is not much money  to support this, and certainly nothing in comparrison to collecting and painting the figures outside of the virtual environment.For those not familiar with the game but interested, there is no better way to learn than playing the beta and being forced to  use just a handfull of units. The alternative is to wait for the full release and instead be faced with the daunting prospect of learning and understanding 100+ units with 1000s of combinations in what I think will be a competitive scene.I give this game a big thumbs up and think and hope  it will be a huge success.

												This is not good game, it is not polished in almost every way- on screens game looks great but when you play it it doesn't look close to that, it definitely doesn't look like unreal engine 4 more like unity 4 or even 3 and I have everything on high on my 980Ti so I can't go any higher than this - conclusion: to much photoshop on screens and to little real game look- whole controls is clunky and counter productive- maps in cinematics are blurry- texts are blurry and have some small artifacts around them, some dots etc. - to strong glow around movement boundaries are distracting and super ugly- motion blur is very bad I turned it of in first 20s of the game- whole GUI is bad, some parts are very small and I have to lean closer to monitor to read what is there, bad designed, not very easy to look at all this and get information you need- character designs is great but shaders and rendering quality is dragging them down, shame on that,character designs are strongest part of this game, probably only strong part of this game- in game cinematic are bad, no lip sinc no animation just static poses and blurry text, could be done much much better by repalcing them by just static hand painted images than this 3d ugly something- you can't skip cinematics- not intersting characters and ""story"" almost no story, I would be ok with no story if mechanic and combat was great but it isn't. If you put story in game at least make it little bit intersting and this is not intersting at all.and so on and so on to much problems in every step			"

We have a nice campaign which gives the basics of gameplay and Sygnar features and we have a really nice competitive multiplayer with an army customisation (yet it has to be balanced). I think in several months when all units will be added, Warmachine will become a perfect multiplayer skirmish game, Tired of SCII and Dota mom rapists? Well, here we go.			"

												This game feels very unfinished as of yet. The systems and gameplay are all there and work great- it's very fun to play. But the UI and controls/camera feel like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you desire incredible amounts of polish in your games then I would suggest steering clear of this for now. If you absolutely love the idea or love Warmachine then I would heartily recommend the game. It's fun and works well, but the devs are still actively fixing and optimizing things to work better. Hopefully within a few months there will be a UI overhaul or at least they will tighten up a few loose ends here and there. It's a great game but it may be worth holding off for a while longer. If you think you can stomach the difficulties of actually controlling the game itself then by all means jump right in. Don't be alarmed by the amount of DLC either. Some of them are packs with multiple DLC bits built in, and the mercenary factions are not entirely necessary to the core game or to making a competative list.			"

								I am a sucker for this type of game, but initially the reviews scared me off, as well as the high price.  But after the price drop I decided to take a chance and purchase the game.  Actually I found it pretty well focused and enjoyable.  It needs some additional work, to be sure, but it is playable.  I finished the initial scenarios fairly quickly, but I intend on going back and trying them again to see if I can make it through without losing any of the team members. If UFO and the Space Hulk game had a love child I think it would be something like this.  I'm hoping that the developer will continue to build on what could be a 'classic' turn based PC tactical game.			"

												As an avid Warmachine player this game is a massive disappointment. While the designers attempts to capture the feel of Warmachine are admirable they fall short. Some abilities had to be changed or altered and this is understandable. Feora's feat doesn't function correctly at all. The changes to make infantry are interesting however the execution fails especially with weapon master models. The scenario modes all lack kill box which is a pain when you are already playing with a shortened unit list. I had one game where a Knight Errant walked up and hit The Avatar for 18 damage with a critical. Speaking of which the randomization doesn't seem random. There are streaks where you will miss frequently and then only get critical hits after that. My dice are more average then the random number generator and I rolled 7 sets of snake eyes in a single 50 point game at Lock&Load this year. The maps lack terrain and you don't get to see your opponents deployment if you are player 2. Negatives- Warjacks don't have systems- Weapon ranges are messed up - No counter deploy- Lack of terrain- No kill box (screw you Severius)- Feora's feat doesn't function correctly (I'm sure there are other issues but really?)- 3 Weapon Master Infantry will drop Avatar with criticals- When you boost a spray all to hit rolls seem to be boosted with a single focus- Limited by using a grid system (you lose so much finesse with the placement of things)- You can't cast a spell then fail a charge for extra movement- Star system is janky as hell, opaque, and demonstrates a failure to understand Warmachine.--Using the numbers from Warmachine would at least make sense as it is math. The star system isn't consistent as it bins certain numbers together. i.e. def 16-18 may all be 4 stars-Criticals in general, everything can critical-The FAQ and manual are useless, go lose some quick match games and you can slowly figure out how things work by losing- In general I feel like the designers took Warmachine and tried to make it their own version while tossing away an already solid system for something they came up with while drinking one night. People have spoken with them at conventions and during early access about the star system and other things. The designers answer was a fairly condescending ""Trust us, we are game designers."" You should just code the existing game, not hack it to pieces.-Pros-Nice idea to change infantry over (I still feel it was unnecessary to alter the game this much)-Animated warcasters! Seriously this is probably the second best thing- Best thing is you get to play a story in the Warmachine universeTL;DR Can't recommend, Won't recommend, Disappointed Kickstarter as we were promised warmachine on the computer and we got poop.edited some spelling typos.

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game on Kickstarter and the beta is quite promising. Overall, the game is quite tactical as promised and the combat looks and feels visceral. Since it is still in beta, I will not comment of the bugs, lack of all playable features, etc. since that is to be expected from any beta. It is still too early to judge the single player storyline too. The gameplay, multiplayer-wise, is already quite fantastic even in beta.I have 3 concerns. First, it is for a very high end computer. It barely runs on any computers from 3 years ago or older, especially laptops. I have confirmed this on a number of computers from the pre-2011 lineups. On lowest settings, I run at 3-4 fps. Don't expect to get any higher than 20 fps unless you bought the computer in the last two years with a mid-to-high-range (at the time) graphics card. Surprisingly high requirements should bar a good numbers of players, expecially at a time when PC/laptop sales are in a historic freefall.Also, there are specific issues for the two major groups of players: those familiar with the tabletop game and those who aren't.For those who are familiar, they may be very turned off by the rules changes from the table top, namely that the units of infantry are much smaller in number and thus scaled so each infantry is considerably more powerful than the tabletop version. For those who aren't familiar, the price for the game on Steam, particularly for the digital deluxe, seems a bit of a gamble. If they aren't certain they will like the game's universe, that is asking for a lot. Thus, both groups face a major downside with the purchase of the game. I wish they at least catered to one of the groups, preferably the tabletop fans, who probably backed their kickstarter with capital already.			"

Now though, I can barely get the game to run, on a machine that should crush it. The odd graphical glitches still exist. The animations are poor. And I do not feel like this is a Warmachine game at all. You could change the colors around and slap another name on it and it would not make a difference at all.

												One of the major issues I'm having with this game is that, despite having a computer that exceedes the recommended system requirements, the gameplay feels rather jerky, and not quite as fluid as I would like. The cut-scene graphics leave much to be desired (they feel like something from a second-rate PC game from the early 2k's). The text-box dialogues throughout the gameplay have an equally old-fashioned feel. Now, the idea of what they were going for with this is a great idea. They made a great blend from the table-top game into a playable PC version. You really do feel like you're playing the table-top game in a new, dynamic way. That being said, the execution of idea hasn't been the best.My last point, and this is my biggest issue with the game: $40 price tag?! For the quality of this game, that's way too high. What's worse? They have DLC content you have to pay for. All in all... I'm rather disappointed. This seemed like a good idea, and some things look great about it. But, overall, it falls short (especially of its own price-point).			"

												Warmachine: Tactics had so much potential and that it makes this implementation all that much sadder.  It's been more than a year and a half since the game was released and despite all the patches there has been no real improvement to the fundamental problems.The UI is a clunky and obtuse mess.  Simple tasks are needlessly complicated to the point that it can be difficult to tell if a bug has occured or if, for example: the character isn't moving because the UI is in some state that precludes moving.  Even just cycling through characters can be difficult.  Hit 'tab', nothing happens, end turn: ""You still have characters with actions left"".  Hit 'tab' again and they select.With a little thought Warmachine could have been an X-Com competitor.  Add a few context sensitive menus and a bit of object picking to the mouse and do away with the awful stateful button menus.  The entry to making an attack shouldn't be deciding you'll make a ranged attack before deciding which enemy you're going to make the ranged attack on.  The default enemy chosen when ranged attacking is usually not meaningful.  Let me select the enemy and then select what I want to do to them.Rather than popping up hints on how to calculate the various 'things' let me hover the mouse over something and show me the modifiers for it.  An obvious reason for why I can't exit a characters turn would be helpful too.  It feels like no effort has been put into user interaction at all; there are problems all the way from the blurred and stretched fonts to the poor - and largely absent - presentation of what's going on on the battlefield: who still has abilities left, what abilities, which enemies etc...  It's all really bad.Couple the UI with poor voice acting, poor writing, unfinished cut-scenes, a host of bugs  and some dodgy AI and you're left a game that looks nice in screenshots but is almost painful to play.Spend your time elsewhere, play X-Com or Fallen or Divinity or anything else instead.

												When this originally released it was in a pretty sorry state, and even now this barley gets a positive review from me. The Good.- The demo that has access to multiplayer with solid prebuilt lists- The price drop to $20 for the base game is a fair price for the content.-  Active devs pushing large updates. This game will only improve and the devs are proving they want it to. That being said there are still issues.- Brain dead AI (apparently currently being addressed and will be resolved soon)- UI is medocre at best and takes getting used to, sadly resulting in mistakes until you orient yourself to it.- Multiplayer is dead. This being a big shame as in its current state it could be really fun. Thems the brakes though when your release version is lacking content and is borderline unplayable.All in all if your a fan of turn based stratagy or enjoy a very table top like rules style (though certainly differnt then the table top game itself) Its worth the $20. The DLC on the otherhand is only worth it if multiplayer is resurrected/have friends to play with and/or the skrimish AI is updated and actually challenging			"

												BuggyWay too many DLCs (I already have the real models, I'm not spending money to get them in digital form, sorry).It is a bad mix between the tabletop Warmachine game and Xcom. I love tactical games, and I had no problem (unlike some) with this not just being copy and paste of the tabletop version, but it felt like they didn't want to stray too far, and I think that really hurt the game. They should have just went full tilt in the way Dawn of War is nothing like the Tabletop of 40k, as an example (not the same game type obviously).After all this time it STILL has horrible performance issues.I backed this in kickstarter, and I can't complain because I got some models to use in the Tabletop (phsical of course), but the game is a huge let down. I held off so long trying to review this, to give them time to finish the campaign (which is a whole other frustration), and flesh things out. It just turned into a dlc generator and really feels like a middle finger to those of us that were actually excited for this, only to find sooooo much of it put behind dlc. You will have been able to buy the game more than once if you end up buying the dlc, and frankly, the dlc is just extra models which should have been included in the base game, with a few armies that I can maaaaybe understand being dlc like Mercenaries.

												I'll admit up front this game isn't as good as I wanted it to be, but it is still fun.Some minor crash issues with startup that seem to revolve around unit selection, hopefully it gets fixed soon, and they've acknowledged the frame rate issue. There are changes from the TT game, but I find they mostly work well for a video game adaptation. I will recommend waiting to see it on sale, unless you are just hard core into the idea of having the game.The skirmish AI is brick stupid BtW, so don't expect too much of a challenge right now. Another improvement I hope they make.I'd call it a solid 6 out of 10. Nothing incredible, but still a fun adaptation of a game I love. With a better AI, some improved stablization and far, far better voice acting the game would easily hit the 8 out of 10 mark for me. "

												A very good game if you like turn-based-strategy!  It's all about creating a synergy amongst the units at your disposal and timing your main character's unique one time use uber-ability ""feat"".  There are enough models to suit any playstyle and balance is pretty solid at this point.The single player campaign has an interesting side story which lets you play through and learn the Cygnar faction, but the game really shines in MP with the ecstasy of a well executed win and/or agony of defeat.  Be warned though, your average MP game tends to go 40 minutes to an hour,It's also different enough from the table top version that new players aren't at a disadvantage while still keeping to the heart of that experience as well.  All in all, worth playing if you're either into TBS games or a fan of the IP.			"

												Short versionTLDR score: 5 of 10. (with hints it could still be better in the future, definitely needs UI work now though).... Some solid fun elements, there is merit in there, but cluttered with issues in a genre with peers having only the fun element and not the control hassle.TLDR buy/don't buy for the casual reader: Generally NOT recommended, but worth it on sale.*.... I paid $30 for the game and the elf expansion... I felt ripped off by at least 10 bucks. I would wait until it as at least on sale for 1/2 off. My wallet cries for those who bought this thing when it was $40 base.-----Longer versionSteam wouldn't let the full review post. It wasn't longer than my past reviews of other games, maybe the new review system has a smaller limit? Whatever reason, just know A) The longer version went into detail on what other reviews have said. The game needs a UI overhaul or at least major tweaking (which doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon) because controls and unit info feel like they're in late Beta not this far post release. That's not a good sign.B) As a newcomer to their mythos I was let down by how few Warjacks I could take (in a game called warMACHINE), mildly annoyed at how many bland regular troops I'm forced to take. That may be personal preference though, if you like guys with electric swords (or flame throwers or WWI infantry) more than you like steampunk mechs you might like it. I've been told that's true to the tabletop as well.C) They do appear to still be adding units, both free and DLC, so the game is still getting support. That does seem to be a good sign. (I've seen pictures of the tabletop Hordes armies, maybe we'll get some of them someday in this?)			"

												Seems like an alright game, even if there's no mouth movement when characters speak (I can accept that for a budget title). Game play wise it's closer to the new XCOM than Mordheim and I actually appreciate being able to select what units move and when. Camera control is better than XCOM 2 as well (yeah I'm aware you can dl free camera mods, but it's nice that the thought was put in right out of the box here and I won't be corrupting my savegames just to enjoy the privilege). Everything is a little rougher than a triple A title to be sure (and arrg there's a little too much bloom on everything) but there's still a lot of slick animations (mantling for instance). Dunno if I'd be happy to pay 20 dollars for it yet, i got it from the humble bundle after all. I just thought I'd write my review to weight in on a few things. Most of the critical reviews have nothing to do with the game itself. More than half are protests about dlc policy. A large portion of the remaining critical reviews are are outdated, there are complaints the game doesn't run well but i'm on a mid-tier system and even with everything but lens flare on ""Awesome"" settings I'm getting some crazy-stupid high frame rates without the fans kicking up to jet engine levels or the celcius climbing. As for my thoughts on the actual game? The tactical combat itself seems excellent and looks to have a lot of solid systems in place. I particularly like the allocation system because it requires you to make a judgement call, examining the feild in advance to determine whether the warcaster or warjack is going to do you more good this round at the start of your turn, which calls for a bit of a tactical appraisal and a bit of gambling. I also like the ability to spend focus to improve accuracy. I can't recall a turn-based strategy game I've played since Jagged Alliance 2 that let me do something like that and it's been sorely missed. Since it is reminiscent of XCOM I should probably make a few comparisons about differences since a lot of people will be familiar with that system. While you can select what order you want your units to move in, once you use part of a unit's moves here you have to use all of that unit's moves up at that time or forfeit them. It takes some getting used to but focus can be used to make the system flexible at least. A UI feedback addition I particularly like is that when you're planning to move a unit, visible lines of sight are drawn from the potential location to any potential targets as you hover over the tiles. How many times in XCOM2 have I been shown the damned little targeting icon only to find out I'm illogically not able to hit the target I wanted to hit or once I've moved to that spot I'm not allowed to target any units at all, even though I was told beforehand I would be? Not a problem here, if moving one square over would block my LOS, the line vanishes and you know before you commit. Also you can play the game with any controller if you so please,  though the movement cursor zips around so fast (and the sensitivity is not adjustable) that you might just opt to use a keyboard and mouse even if pads are your thing. The option is still there though. Maybe it's a matter of not coming into this review with any grudges over kickstarter this or DLC that (and the price of entry I paid can't hurt) but I'm actually enjoying this game quite a bit so I think I'll recommend it.

Early Access Review
								Enjoyed the latest update.The tweaks makes things smoother and the new map let's you see what's going on (drove me nuts in the first map).Some things I'd like to see tuned and tweaked:• add 8-way facing• controls on the camera feel off, maybe an option to hold a key and move the mouse for quicker movement? maybe have the same to lock focus at a point and swivel cam via mouse?• some abilities have descriptions of what they do, other do not. all abilities a unit has are not on display (there's no way to see an opponent's feat as far as I can tell.)• have a way to select nothing or deselect (wanted to see an enemy units stats, but game kept stuck selected my own units and moving phase instead)• option to shrink the unit select field, takes up alot of screen space when text or a smaller pic can do the trick. Could see it being a pain in a larger scale battle scolling through a huge list.• option to set own hotkeys, though that's just my preference.• When preping an attack, if you change the type of attack the target changes to the first in the order, this can get a little annoying.• cycling though units via keyboard, it goes to the warcaster first each time, when I'm trying to move my grunts quickly having to pass over my warcaster each time (or accidently activate them by mistake) is a pain. Would prefer the next unit was just the next on the list after the one I activated. If I need the warcaster immediatly I can click them on the map or click them on the list.• audio: music and sound effects separate setting, option to have audio play while game is in background.• cinematic camThat's all I can think of at the moment, hopefully that's useful to the devs and maybe something in there they didn't hear already. My understanding is that some of this stuff is already being worked on. Just don't know where to look to verify that and probably best to voice my opinion in the beta rather than regret later when the game is done.All and all, think this has the potential for awesome when it's completed.

												This game had a pretty rough development phase and the release was fairly rocky as well with many disappointed supporters. I, however, was one of the people who bought the Humble Bundle so yes, I am that cheap but I am also a uni student and hence, broke 80% of the time. Now this game was a mixed bag for me. I love the steampunk aesthetic and the units look amazing, the animations are very well done (slight clipping aside), all in all, the game is visually solid. I played this game once before I actually owned it, there was actually a big chunk of time between trying it and buying it. When I tried it, there was one thing that really get on my nerves and that was, the game ran like♥♥♥♥♥♥ You'll be glad to know that after buying and playing it, it no longer had that problem. The game runs great.So I've already given a few pros to the game, now I'm going to present some cons.The first and foremost, the UI sucks. There's a lot of things on the screen at once, a lot of numbers and different sections of the UI. There's a part of the UI that tells you the stats of the currently selected unit, if I actually played the game more seriously, I would've found it useful, instead I ignored it because it was ugly along with the rest of the UI. Useful but ugly. I ended up playing a couple games vs the AI without even looking at that part of the screen so it was basically steampunk XCOM at that point. That brings me to my next point, I played against the AI a few times after completing the tutorial. To put it simply, the AI is moronic at best. I won one game vs the red faction (whatever they're called, they had three hard-hitting mechs/warjacks), due to the fact that the enemy warcaster charged ahead of the rest of his squad and proceeded to get wrecked by my two warjacks and the rest of my squad. Anyway, it is what it is. You can exploit the imbecilic AI to learn the units in your chosen faction and learn about other factions as well. Other than that, there's no reason to play against them because they play like a human with a few extra chromosomes. I've heard the camera does weird things sometimes, from my experience, it happens every now and then, not everytime. Here's a major gripe that a lot of people had about the campaign/story mode. The characters' lips don't move when they're talking. While the complaints aren't necessarily wrong, they made some odd decisions which didn't help it. If the cutscenes don't show the characters' mouths actually moving, then they should've done it either the characters don't move at all so kind of like a comic book style where it's basically a picture rendered in 3D or have an actual drawing. Instead, the characters are moving about, swaying, breathing while their lips aren't moving and it looks...amateur to be honest. Here's the real kick in the teeth with this game. It's really fun. The game itself is great, I enjoyed the time I spent with it (albeit it's not a lot but that's what happens when you have exams). Despite all the negative points I made above, the game is really good and really fun. But you will have gripes with it. It is not by any stretch a perfect game. But it's fun.EDIT: I forgot to mention a few parts of the game. Let's just say the keybindings are really helpful once you learn them but some keys have odd placements. It's something I overlooked because I wasn't playing very seriously and used the mouse 80% of the time but I did try to use the keybindings. Also, the game tends to punish you for choosing the wrong unit because once you select a unit, you must give it commands because if you desselect it, the unit won't be able to move. They can shoot and fight but they can't move. It's quite bad when you select your warcaster and decided that you wanted to move the warjack instead but that's fine, if I was a little strategic, I probably wouldn't have a problem with this.One of the things I really like about the game is that when you're telling a unit to move to a certain spot, the game tells you which units are in range. It's a nice feature that allows some tactical positioning. That isn't to say that you won't miss but you know who you can shoot.			"

												I've played the tabletop version of this, as well as Hordes. In my opinion, the game is heading in a good direction, trying to keep the tabletop experience as realistic as possible. Gameplay, I'd give a 9/10. Now, for the bad stuff. The game is hardly optimized, to the point of averaging ~12fps. While I figured there was a workaround, judging from the forums, this is not the case. The other negative is that they are trying to monetize their units in a simlar manner to the tabletop version. DLC consists of a couple units here and there, or sole units. This has been done to the point where the DLC outcosts the base game. Warhammer 40k seems to have found a good route, where each expansion has the full set of units available, without microtransactions. Customization is also non-existent as of yet, and you are pretty much stuck with the base schemes for each unit. If they want to release Hordes, they've got a long way to go.			"

												Warmachine Tactics has a lot going for it, and a lot holding it back.First, the negative: production values are inconsistent. A lot of still portraits, and in many cases, still models in cutscenes whose mouth's don't move while they talk. Various UI glitches that may force you to skip unit activations. Scripted events throughout the campaign make it less about tactics, and more about just getting through the mission. No saving mid-level (this means if you don't have at least an hour or so each mission, you are likely to lose a lot of progress if you have to stop playing).Despite all of that, there are a lot of good things about Warmachine Tactics. A unique world, setting and units based on the award winning tabletop game: WARMACHINE. The rules and interactions are very deep with many different things to consider throughout a match. There is an unlimited amount of replayability as unit selection and opponent choices make it so no two matches are exactly alike.If you are willing to look past various annoyances in the production of the game, this title has a lot of excellent tactical wargaming to be had. Anyone who is a fan of grid-based strategy games would be remiss to not give this game a chance.7/10 ""Good""			"

												I really, really, want to give this game a positive review.  Unfortunately, in its current state I cannot.  I love Warmachine, both the fiction and the table top game and this game could be among what makes this setting enjoyable if only the game mechanics weren’t such a wreck.  What makes this game so bad isn’t that it is an actually bad game; it is that there is a layer of greatness under all the bugs, poor optimization, needed quality of life improvements and just plainly lazy game creation.Many of the issues have been present since the games pre-release for KickStarter Backers.  The game is poorly optimized, sometimes needing you to be on the bare minimum due to some asset that is continuously renderings in the background and other levels you can crank it up to maximum.    The graphical bugs are many, from ‘dancing’ corpses to clip in issues.  One of the most annoying parts is the cut-scenes (if you can call them that).  They are literally just the characters on the battle map freeze framed.  Looks more like a picture than a scene, which would be fine if they worked with that as a basis but the implementation looks like a bug or at least accidental.  Some very well done RPGs use just character portraits and text to tell story and do it just fine.  But, it has been checked, this is intended.  What is even more frustrating is the tools used to help measure and draw lines bleed into these scenes making it even more frustrating.  The ultimate annoyance is that some scenes actual have animation and you see what could be…From a Turn-Based Strategy point of view this game needs a lot of help, tooltips are incorrect and many useful functions are hidden under layers of tutorials that the game never prompts and lacks any form of toggle options for things like range measurements, grid form or markers (common in all TBS).  To be fair, some of these things do exist but they are implemented more like a tech tool than a game function.  They are launched by shortcut control keys and their functionality is lacking.  Their appearance even looks like a tech tool or else something in beta.  Even worse is that these tools were not implemented with the terrain in mind, there are maps where you can’t see the effects or they are so poorly done (smoke clouds) they become invisibile.  This was later 'fixed' by creating colored grids... again this comes off as a tech tool or a placeholder but have been present for months.  Even when properly visible it becomes a glorified marker, again looking like a tech tool used for game creation and less like an awesome effect (the biggest violator of this is warjack debris).From a setting point of view the game is NOT Warmachine Table top in video game format, and I’m okay with that, I’d be able to go as far as saying I prefer it.   If I wanted that I’d go play warmachine.  They make some really good changes to make the game flow but it comes back to a screeching halt on some of the other decisions, infantry seemingly designed to kill other infantry struggle but suddenly become wolverine when in melee with a ‘Jack.  The developers appeared to understand that things had to change to make the game feel more epic but it was just too easy to manipulate, sending Jakes into a heavy warjack knowing I could heal through it or positioning my army knowing the AI would just run into melee with me.  I am left with a feeling that the AI is either poorly designed or intentionally neutered.If you are reading this and you are struggling with the single player all you need is:  Defender, Bandit (the Charger), and take stormblades and gun mages.  And you win, not because it is super effective but because the way the AI plays.  You shoot them until they ultimately run into range, your melee kills what is left and any real threat is just kept at arms length with your gunmages.Ultimately, if you love turn based strategy games stay away from this title, if you love the warmachine table top, again, stay away from this title.  I really wish this wasn’t the case, I trogged through the entire single player campaign and will play the expansion but so much needs to be done to make this game worth playing outside of just die hard fans.

												Where to begin. Probably with the Kickstarter. The game looked appealing since I play the tabletop game too, so what could be cooler than only getting to play the minis game once or twice a week? Loading up WM: Tactics and playing whenever I want! As a backer I got access to the beta and it was terrible. I ran it on a decent PC but the game was far from optimized, so there were a lot of graphics issues, bugs, etc. Of course I passed no judgment because it was still in beta, but once the game released, very few of those issues disappeared. Now I have a GTX 980, 24 GB RAM, and an i7-4710 but the game is still slow and not very user-friendly. Making selections on the battlefield is difficult, the camera is a pain more often than it's helpful, and the video clips are maybe PS2 quality. The gameplay itself is also very slow, and in the year 2014/2015 I expect a game to be snappy, responsive, and not a steamy pile of trash. Thankfully I got some ""exclusive"" sculpts for the tabletop minis the Kickstarter offered, as well as the gorgeous coins, but otherwise I have uninstalled the game and regret that it will now sit in my library, unused, almost like an open sore. You know it's there, it's painful, and you don't want to touch it...			"

												I am a huge fan of both RTS and Warmachine, but this game fails on both accounts. The game itself is very poorly implemented, with a clunky and primitive grid system rather than the more typical ""stand where you want to"" that is the industry standard for RTS games. Use of a hex system would have been better if the devs were unable to manage a non-grid. The display starts out fine, but every corpse, ability, spell and so on adds to the clutter and general poor presentation; this is amplified is the grid display is turned on (to allow counting of ranges etc), rapidly becoming a tangled mess. If there's a control-area spell or feat in operation the display is utterly useless, as it colour-fills every square the spell or feat is effecting. It gets to the point that the player cannot see where the various units are or even which ones are still alive. This game is missing basic functionality. The game only saves between missions - there is no option for saving mid-level, even in the single player campaign. This means that the player has to dedicate around an hour minimum, solidly, to each level. Need to go out in 45 minutes? Have something else you need to get done? Your wife/child/pet etc need you for something? In that case, you're either unable to start the level or, if mid-way, have the choice between ignoring the thing you need to do or loosing all the level and re-starting later. Very poor.The control system is clunky and can lead to gameplay problems. Changing the direction a unit is facing often snaps to the wrong direction (ie not the direction you clicked on), leaving problems such as being unable to shoot, presenting your back to the enemy or being unable to charge next turn. Lines of sight seem rather arbitrary, leaving the player guessing at who can see whom and from where.The AI is frankly laughable. Enemy units will sit where they started unless you get close to them or shoot them, meaning most levels are simply a case of nibbling away until the enemy are all dead. There's rarely any challenge. The level design tries to compensate for this by spawning more and more enemies, including heavy warjacks, but this leads to a very unsatisfying experience. As a port of Warmachine to the computer, the game also fails. For some reason, they've fundamentally altered most of the rules (eg Def and Arm, RAT/MAT and so on being 1-4), the feel of the game (infantry are unreasonably tough), the scale of the game (you'll have a handful of infantry and a couple of 'jacks - maybe 20 points on the tabletop) and the abilities of almost all the units. All infantry operates independently, with no units.Overall, I would call this game a failure, and give it 3/10. Do not buy.			"

												The potential is there, but there's a lot of shortcomings. My biggest issue is how clunky and unmanagable the map is. Buildings that are in the way, one axis to rotate the camera and movement choices require constant re-adjusting of the map. The combat is bland and its more resource managment then I care for in a skirmish turn-based game. Mission objectives are confusing and unintuative. It does do a good job of bringing the tabletop game to a video game... but unfortunatly the models/gameplay is just as lifeless. The immersion fails for something that should engage you as a spectator, more then a player (which the tabletop game does amazingly). Overall, I hope to see improvements over time, but right now it's not something I'd reccomend paying more then $10 for.			"

What is in the game (4 factions and 2 maps as well as a introductry single player map to let you get your feat wet) is good and I have played about 8 games with 2 of them experiencing bugs. There is so much potential here and your paying to help develop and bring that out when you pay for early access, not a finished product.			"

												I only Played the Demo so I don't really know much more about this game. I'll start with some of the things I liked before I get into any of the bad things. 1. The character artwork is great! I saw images of some of the mechs on zbrush central and I started looking for this game right away. 2.Controlling and allocating focus to warjacks was an interesting take on a turn based tactical game like this.3. I enjoyed the combat and gameplay mechanics. There are many games with these mechanics but the theme was very interesting and exciting for me.Now I'll go into some of the things that i don't like and again please understand that I only played the demo so my experience is only limited to the 3 missions in the demo.1. The camera is messed up in the city levels. Every time I would do an attack the camera would start rotating or something around the two characters fighting and the camera would go behind the wall and I would not see the attack or how much damage i did or if i missed.2. The dialgue was really lame. and to top it off the characters apear to not have any facial rigs. When your in a cutscene with two characters talking the mouths don't move and the camera moves around like its supposed to be a movie or something. I feel they should have gone to text because it threw me off so much that their mouths were not moving. It made it look like some college students last minute project where they had a scene and characters and only had to deal with camera angles. It was so annoying because the camera would even cut to the person talking but all that was happening was the audio but nothing else. I don't know maybe its just a thing that gets on my nerves personally. it doesn't change the outcome of the game in the end so i guess it doesn't matter.I don't want to put a recommendation out because I haven't played the full game. I will however say that I will not buy this game enless its like 10 dollars. I am interested and I want to play the rest of the game, but based on some of the issues I pointed out i feel it was slapped together at some points and the Camera issues I had in the city level were unbearable. I can't wait till i goes on sale though I really want to see the rest of the Warjacks and character art. "

												I Kickstarted this game a few years ago after finding out about the table top game and really liking the background fluff. When I first got to play the PC game the IU was terrible; there was stuff everywhere giving far to much information. There were also bugs and other problems. I enjoyed it but wanted to wait and play it later. Of course other things come along...I came back to it this year, about two years later and the UI is better but the bugs and graphical problems persistA few are:Killing enemies can cause their weapons spin around on the spot for a minute or two, or fly into space. This can also happen to the characters themsleves when killed. Some levels seem worse than others in level 16 characters seem to have built in rockets. More amusing than annoying.The explosion sound in mission 7 and 8 when Brisbane turn up seem to be twice as loud as others.Some times you will get a free strike notification pop up when your model is nowhere near combat which disrupts your moves.Terrain can often block your view and the camera will always reset back to default when clicking on a new unit. There are also many things I like about this game :The attack and weapon sounds and animations are satisfying and feel powerful.The units are well detailed and I like the still cut screens.There are a good number of units and factions from the tabletop game.They've certainly added lots to the game over the years and there have been loads of bug fixes but the problems still remain. I intend to complete the game now I have started it again and apart from the problems I'm enjoying playing the video game version of Warmachine.If you like turn based strategy games and Warmachine you might want to give it a go, if you can overlook the bugs and glitches that still persist in the game. Otherwise you should give it a miss. "

												It's nice to see my favorite models with animation, e.g, my cursader smashing the enemy warcaster with his firemace; but i wouldn't recommend spending time playing through the story, having to follow directions and stuff like that, i'd rather set up a skrimish match with bots as the protectorate and smash their faces in; instead of having to follow directions in the story. Sometimes it glitches my infantry to another part of the map, when im trying to get to cover and i end up getting killed because of that. All in all, good game, but could use some work.

												I would recommend this game but with a couple of caveats.First, it is still getting a lot of bugs out. The game is fun, but can be buggy which takes away a lot from the experience.Second, this is not Warmachine, but closer to FF Tactics with giant robots. Be prepared for that shock if you were expecting a video game version of the tabletop game.Third, the game is not worth its full price. The first person game is fairly short (only about 20 mission) and not that inspired so far (I'm about halfway through). The vrs mode is fun but is seem like half of the models are DLC's, which is ridiculous. It feels like the game is trying to penny pinch you and they're doing a good job of it.If you are interested in this game, wait until there is a sale where you can pick up the game and the DLC's for cheap. Otherwise, its not worth it.			"

												I played the demo because of a friend who adores the miniatures game who backed the kickstarter project but didn't have a PC that could run the game. i was kind of on the fence with the other reviews, and I'd also never played the tabletop game before. It's clear the game was SUPER buggy when it first debuted in Early Access and a lot of impulse reviews were responding to that. But I played it anyway, and I was pleasantly suprised. Mind you, there are still some bugs and glitches, but the game is quite fun. Even the voice acting of the campaign characters is suprisingly good, the graphics are great (with a few bugs) and I genuinely had fun playing. It even made me more interested in considering to try out the tabletop game.It seems virtually all the negative reviews are either about bugs in the game, or features that were late being delivered. The game seems to be in a pretty good state now and i would reccomend it to anyone looking for a new turn based strategy.			"

												Given the intellectual property of WarMachine, and the vast amount of backstory and creative development this game has, it is an absolute unmitigated let down.Really they'd be better off letting the community develop a tabletopia mod for the game, or actuallly spend some real money and quality on developing the actual game.Asthetically, the cut scenes are absolute rubbish, and makes the whole game look as if it was done as a mod project. They would have been better served by going with drawn animations instead of lifeless models that don't really interact with the world.I don't mind the basics of the turn based combat and there is some fun and strategy to be had, but seriously 20 or 40$ What were they thinking!!!I got this as a part of a humble bundle deal and at the 2-5$ price point, I think it's a good buy at that price. Anything more and it feels like you're paying for an unfinished product.And that's before talking about hiding units behind a dlc paywall on top of the base game.TL:DRGet it if it's below 5$ and you're a fan of turn based strategy. Don't get it, if it costs more.			"

The campaign has you playing as Alison Jakes, who is an actual character in the WarMachine tabletop game (as is Sturgis; both versions). You can also do skirmishes against the computer or against another mortal somewhere. This allows you to use some of the most iconic units in the game world.This game is fun, and immersive.

Early Access Review
								Hmmm...Where to begin?After reading many of the reviews of my fellow Steam users, I think I'll attempt to break this down into pros and cons for simplisity. Keep in mind the ""Early Access"" aspect is really more of an Open Beta, with units, maps and factions being trickled in in order to give them all a proper test period.PROS1. Like many users have stated, this game plays alot like XCOM: Enemy Unknown (another great game IMO)2. Beautiful models and scenery.3. WW1 tech + D&D = THIS4. 12-ton steam-powered robots of death.5. Mecha-zombies.CONS (so far)1. Limited map selection.2. Occasionally buggy AI (I SAID MOVE FORWARD YOU STUPID ROBOT, NOT RUN BACKWARDS!!)3. Glow effects a little too intense IMO.4. Profound lack of a chat feature. (so far)5. Mixed feelings about giving the basic grunts multiple health boxes.... (You mean my Winterguard survived being bashed in the head by a hammer the size of a small pony?)Only time will tell if Privateer Press and Whitemoon Dreams will be able to deliver on all those Kickstart promises....

												If you are looking for Warmachine on a PC, know that this is true to the table top game in spirit only. Familiar terms are used, but the game is fundamentally different. You are probably better off just trying to play a game an VASSAL.If you are looking for turn-based tactical squad combat, you are better off going to play XCOM, this game is poorly optimized, still buggy, and interactions within the game are not well explained.The price and volume of microtransactions make this game an even worse buy.I was hopeful for this game, but they strayed too far from the original mechanics, devoted a larger percentage of their time to modeling than they probably should have while under optimizing it, and even cut core concepts.I have not yet finished the campaign, but so far it feels far too much on rails and forced, what they want to happen will happen regardless of what you try to do to stop it (for story reasons). You get the units they give you, and must play according to what you are given to succeed. They don't explain things you are shown until they feel you need to know, in an early mission you are shown in-game cut-scenes of someone running around at least 2-3 times before they tell you anything about what you are seeing and why it is relevant and potentially too late for you to react. It feels like all of the events that occur are just sitting waiting for a certain turn number before it tells you about it, I was stuck on one mission waiting for a thing to occur because I'd done too well the turns before. The leveling mechanic was a great idea, but also felt very generic. I would have enjoyed earning experience on unit types and being able to customize my forces.Overall, it feels like this was wasted potential. There was a lot of money and support behind the game, but it feels like the developers went over budget in some early areas and were forced to cut back on concepts that they could no longer afford to develop, specifically lack of units, number of models on the board, size of the board and the campaign. At least I hope that is the case, because if the current product what the developers intended to make, I feel like that was not well communicated during the inital backing process.			"

												A game with a lot of potential but in the end I'm finding it lacking.  Don't let the fact that it claims to be finished fool you.  The game currently has no AI whatsoever, the enemy literally just runs straight at you both in the single player campaign and if you try a skirmish.  Also the game charges a full price yet when you actually look at the included units you realize that what comes with the game is a fraction of what is actually out there for Warmachine, and anything they add beyond the initial release is apparently going to be DLC... and not cheap DLC at that.  Very disappointing.			"

												So you can charge enemies further away from you, but not the ones closer?

								Hmmm...Where to begin?After reading many of the reviews of my fellow Steam users, I think I'll attempt to break this down into pros and cons for simplisity. Keep in mind the ""Early Access"" aspect is really more of an Open Beta, with units, maps and factions being trickled in in order to give them all a proper test period.PROS1. Like many users have stated, this game plays alot like XCOM: Enemy Unknown (another great game IMO)2. Beautiful models and scenery.3. WW1 tech + D&D = THIS4. 12-ton steam-powered robots of death.5. Mecha-zombies.CONS (so far)1. Limited map selection.2. Occasionally buggy AI (I SAID MOVE FORWARD YOU STUPID ROBOT, NOT RUN BACKWARDS!!)3. Glow effects a little too intense IMO.4. Profound lack of a chat feature. (so far)5. Mixed feelings about giving the basic grunts multiple health boxes.... (You mean my Winterguard survived being bashed in the head by a hammer the size of a small pony?)Only time will tell if Privateer Press and Whitemoon Dreams will be able to deliver on all those Kickstart promises....

												This game needs a lot of updates before it's an auto-purchase. Clumsy and inept AI, Micro-Transactions, 5 total maps for skirmish and mutiplayer after 2 years on Early Access, and game breaking UI and camera visuals all combine to make a game that a lot of people want to be a good game, but just isn't.The thing that makes this game unplayable for me is the UI and camera - they are obtuse, and very unintuitive - to the point that the camera usually ends up inside a building or a tree and the in-game interface gets in the way of placing and moving units. It's very frustrating when you can't move or place a unit where you want to because the INTERFACE IS IN THE WAY. The interface and terrain are two things that should never get in the way of functionality.There are die-hard fans that will argue these points to death, but as someone who is not vested in the warmachine universe, I can say that even at the current sale price of $23.99, the game doesn't offer much of a deal.

Posted: November 21, 2014
												So, I'll start off with my initial thoughts of the game so far given that the full campaign has only just been released.  *Warning* there will be some slight spoilers.The good: I've just started to get into the tabletop version of Warmachine and so far what I've played does a good job of keeping to the core mechanics. The graphics are pretty good for a kickstarter game, some CG cutscenes would have been amazing (especially of the duel between Orsus and Sturgis) but that's really asking too much of a limited budget. The gameplay is well done, with actual thought being required so that you don't open yourself up to enemy charges or block your own movement and/or line of sight with an ill-timed activation. That's one aspect of the game I've really enjoyed so far which is good because there are a lot of minor areas that need at least a little improvement.The bad: The story. The story is almost cringe worthy in its absolute lack of originality and, so far, bad presentation - I mean, another superweapon that could change the course of the war / end the world as we know it plot line? Really? Even the opening scene almost made me facepalm when Jakes stated that ""I...I killed Commander Stugis"". My reaction was no, no you didn't. I haven't even played the storyline yet and I know this, stop being a drama queen. Given the fluff available in the books I was really expecting better, even the game characters seem almost caracatures of themselves compared to their presentation in the books. There is one twist that might have been interesting but since anyone with even a nodding acquaintence with the game likely knows what happens to Stugis it's a moot point. I would have liked something more along the lines of the old Dark Omen game where your actions and decisions decided how the story progressed and what units were available.The voice acting isn't bad, not great, but somewhere in the middle and they did seem to match their characters. However the pronounciation of Brisbane as Bris-bane really irritated me for some reason.Since I haven't finished the campaign yet I can't say the storyline is difinitively horrible but I'm not hopeful for a turn around though if it does happen I will edit this review. The mediocre: A couple of small issues that will likely be fixed in future patches, the UI really needs to be adjustable with at least a scale though being able to move, fade or remove selected elements in addition would be better. Having subtitles not take up almost a third of the screen would also be nice. The cost is about average for the standard edition but considering there's a lot of DLC in the works that you'll have to buy seperately... well maybe the DLC will reasonably priced.I'd recommend this game if you're looking for something fun that will likely focus around multiplayer battles. I haven't come across many bugs at all so far, mainly just a few with speech and sound clips not playing or not playing quite right. Definetly no game breaking bugs which is great. Whatever you do you should not buy this game expecting a great or even good story but the gameplay is solid especially if you enjoy mulitplayer battles.  "

												As an original Kickstarter backer of this game, it pains me to say how disappointed I am with its execution.  I am not very familiar with the setting beyond hearing the name a few times in tabletop circles, but the story and world shown is execellent.  The graphics are also great for a genre where they are usually an afterthought.  I only wish the gameplay itself seemed like less of an afterthought.I have to wonder how much experience the gameplay and UI designers have with making games.  You have to manually select each unit before giving them orders instead of auto-selecting the next unit in the list.  There is also no easy way to move the camera so you can actually tell where you're moving.  While I enjoy seeing the action from almost any angle, can we include a consistent way to get an overhead view next time?  And the unit actions themselves can be confusing to navigate and are (again) inconsistent in how they are executed.  Sometimes you click a circle in the unit menu and other times you click on an enemy unit itself.  These are all pretty basic mistakes that should have been caught early on and make the game feel incomplete.There's a great game buried in here somewhere, but it's hidden behind the terrible controls and clunky camera.

												First, bear in mind that: I got the game from a bundle, so it was $1 along two other games. I haven't made it far in the campaign, as I've mostly played skirmishes. That being said, I like the game a lot. I'm into Turn Based Strategy games and this one whets my appetite quite well. The units are well designed and have special rules, the commanders have many spells and a powerful one-time technique, the  steampunk robots  warjacks hit hard and are more than able to withstand a good beating... So far I  must  recommend this game. At this point, I find the high number of negative reviews unfair. We'll see if, as I keep playing the game more and more, my perspective changes.			"

												Oh, I SO want to like this game. The characters are fine, the setting awesome, but there are just Too many noob mistakes and game breaking bugs to recommend it to anyone but the most avid fan of the Warmachine miniatures game. Much of the time it feels like you're trying to force the game to behave more than thinking tactically. This is due to a series of major annoyances: - The 3d engine cannot seem to understand which square you're pointing at, making you constantly 'misclick' and have your troops move to a wrong square, which can cost you the game if someone you need buys it to a free strike- Free strikes, while we're on it, do not seem to follow the same rules for the player and the ai. - When moving, the trooper will often turn to a random facing after finishing the move, which looks hilarious at first - the tropper dashes over barrels and walls, then turns around as if pleased with his little hurdles run, but is soon annoying as hell when you have to spend time turning all your troopers back to face the enemy after moving. - The game rules are explained only in a rudimentory sense, making it near impossible for a person who hasn't played the miniatures game to understand, and is then changed in arbitrary ways. Since when does a Bastion have a charge move longer than the range of a Trencher's rifle? Why no hit locations, systems to disable on jacks? And infantry have Lots of boxes, while jacks have not been significantly boosted. - Line of sight does not take object height into account; a jack cannot shoot over the heads of infantry. And it seems that if any los possible crosses a square with a friendly trooper, there's no los. - Scenarios feel forced; there seems to be little to no room to actually Play here; you pretty much have to solve the problem the developers want you to, or fail, to the point where overwhelming forces are put in to push you as fast as possible this way or that. And not reading the mind of the developers correctly the very first time Will cost you the fight. - No save. Which makes the next problem even worse:- The games take a Long time; a fight often takes over an hour even if you fail pretty fast, and I've yet to play one that could be completed in under 1½. This is Way Too Much Time, and feels very unnecesary. All in all, I am sorely disappointed. There is still hope, but this one needs Major fixes.			"

												This game has a number of obvious issues, the most damning is the horrible camera which every other review has already covered.  The gameplay itself is mediocre; activating units is clunky and the selection of units is unintuitive even after the (poor) tutorial at the beginning.  After 5 missions, I finally realized I could just click on a portrait to activate a unit.  The objectives aren't always clearly defined as far as exactly what you need to do to complete them.  The worst part of the missions is that the camera will instantly cut to an objective and then instantly back to a unit, leaving you no idea where the objective was on the map.  Panning the camera there and back would be a huge improvement to give a sense of direction.A few of the levels have impossible terrain to see what the hell is going on as far as the lines drawn on the ground for movement/spells/etc because the light blue or yellow lines aren't visible whatsoever upon the white snowcovered ground.  Also, it's hard to tell where the mission is trying to have you escape to at times because there's nothing differentiating the escape point from any other hard edge of the map.  Beacons would go a long ways in a few of the maps.It's also super frustrating when you go 98% through an hour long mission just to have one of the characters die at the end to cause mission failure and require you to play through the whole thing again (and again, and again, and again) because they don't allow saves in the middle of missions.  It makes gameplay feel like a torturuous chore and that they're punishing you for trying.If you're a fan of the tabletop game (like myself) and you want to know the fluff behind Jakes then you have to suffer through this game.  I've heard it's making strides in the right directions and I honestly think there's potential here but it's not polished enough yet to recommend and unless you love the backstory of the Iron Kingdoms I would wait for this game to get another 6-8 months of patches and fixes in before you play it because it's going to leave a bad taste in your mouth.

												Review based on demo.Nice graphics, decent concept, pretty interesting game mechanics. Everything is fine and dandy IN THEORY -- until you actually try and play the game.I would probably enjoy this game if it weren't for the UTTERLY HORRIBLE user interface. This is much worse than XCOM's designed for consoles ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t UI. It never does what you expect it to, and relies on some antediluvian interface design concepts like having large number of buttons on the screen you need to press to do anything. I can't even select unit, de-select it to select another and then re-select it again, as it somehows expects that I'm done with him or something. Really?! Something wrong with just using a minimized mouse-driven UI with context-sensitive actions, maybe context-sensitive menus, simple action point system that stops predicting what the player is trying to do, like when he's done with a unit, whom to attack and so on, and just let the player do anything he wants with minimum effort. Too much?If you're a game designer or want to be one, please do play this game and take notes on how to NOT design your UI and inputs.+ I like the free camera, once you toggle it on (kind of confusing to mention those free camera controls in tutorial since it's by default toggled off). Too many games restrict me to their idea of ideal camera angle, which is usually wrong.			"

												It's a fairly good game. It is not as good as it's tabletop counterpart and several key stats and rules have been changed, but it still retains the feel of Warmachine. It introduced me to the basic mechanics of Warmachine and because of it, I ended up getting into the TT game. It's best for those days where I'm in the mood for  Warmachine, but have no one around to game with. My biggest complaint is the AI. It has mainly one rule it follows. Run and engage in melee combat as fast as possible. If the unit is a melee unit, then fine, but units with ranged weaponry that close too fast. C'mon, it's headscratching and irritating.So my recommendation is this: If you like miniatures wargames but due to space, time or disabilities and can't play much, then this game could easily be for you.If you are a Warmachines fan and can handle the rules being off a bit and grunts having health and your warjacks missing easy hits, then you'll enjoy yourself.If you are a wargaming or Warmachine purist. Please don't play it. It won't live up to your expectations and you'll never enjoy the game for what it is. If you have no interest in miniatures wargaming, then stay away. The game is not for you. It is not fast paced, it requires (some) thought, not as much as against a real person, of course, and you have to understand the rules of the game to play it effectively.			"

												I've only played the demo of this and I have never played the board game (more of a 40k gamer) so this may render my comments invalid but just in case....I enjoy Warmachine. I enjoy turn based strategy and I really like the Warmachine ethos and concept. However I cannot recommend this game yet because the user interface is the CLUNKIEST GAME INTERFACE SINCE GAMES WERE PLAYED ON STONE TABLETS! Seriously this is almost unplayable! Whever play tested this for the developers must have had some kind of deal with a rival firm because there is no way this should have passed testing. It's not the size of the UI or the fact that the units move on a square grid (these are pretty much the same as XCOM and that gameplay is excellent) it's just the fact that it will often not register what the player is doing. Trying to change the facing of your units is best guess because often the arrow pointer just wont follow the mouse direction so you just press excecute hoping that the 25% chance you have of getting the orientation you want will come out. Also whilst the units move on a grid the curser option does not and so it is often pot luck which of the available squares your unit will move to. This could all be fixed witha  decent patch but it needs to happen before the game can be played.On another topic buildings block the camera and so unless you are playing on an empty map you can't get the camera into a position where you can accurately see what is going on. The entire second campaign mission is played through narrow streets and no matter where you place the camera it is trying to look over a wall. This can make the UI even more infuriating as you try to wrestle with the camera to get it to look at the squares you want only to find that the UI has frozen your unit so it can only move in the opposite direction!The other thing I noticed is that the game can be very tight lipped sometimes about which unit you should be using. If you have a unit that hasn't completed it's action you can't select the next unit even if all you can do with the previous one is end it's action but it often won't tell you which unit you should be selecting. This is likely something that will come with practice and as I said I only played the demo so maybe it is something I will get used to in time.As I said at the beginning I did enjoy the missions I played of this and I am going to keep it in my wishlist but until they patch the UI and camera I certainly won't be spending any money on this and I suggest you don't either.

												Warmachine Tactics feels alot like XCOM set in a different world. I flipping love XCOM and really enjoyed this, I love the mechanics within the game with controlling your Warjacks and the vast range of abilities across the board for different characters. I also love how ace the voice acting is and on point, even having a chuckle at times from some sayings that come out. Graphically the game is pretty sweet, no Crysis but its pretty detailed and the models of the units are superb. Dive in and enjoy an awesome turn based strategy and if you wanna see more check out the video.

I mean its in full release and still has SPELLING MISTAKES IN THE FKN CAMPAIGN TEXT!!!!The UI is ugly and tacky, the gameplay itself is painful with how bad moving your units is and the auto camera will have you looking through a building 50% of the time.Seriously you guys need to offer refunds to people who got this game. It is seriously the worst game I have played in a long time.			"

												This game would be amazing if it wasn't a pay to win experience through ""DLC"", which shoudl just be patches.I pay $50 AUD to access the game, then i am forced to pay an extra charge of almsot $10 AUD per unit i need to actualy be viable against people who play multiplayer. I was hoping to try this game out as i loved xcom and maybe even take up the table top version, but making me constantly pay for more and more parts of the game (just to play it) buying the game upfront just isn't worth it. this would of been amazing if they just made the units free and made me pay for cosmetics so i could give them money if i liked it rather then have to give them money TO like it. even if you gave the people who payed for the game all the benifits and then made it free to play (like HON did) i wouldnt mind at all. I payed money for a game not a prety poster that thinks its a game and constantly askes me for money just to look at it.you are killing the online comunity by making the people who can win the ones with the money. even the table top game is cheaper then this for me in Australia.

												its a good strategic game reminds me a little of valkyria chronicles and Warhammer: Chaos Gate if i need to compare it with previous games, even if it does many things automatically. never played the tabletop the graphic is good the video scenes you could say they are still images there is no mouth moving or character movement at all in them. only played the skirmisch in the demo don't know if you can set the difficulty. the campaign is good and has a good story so far. i like it.if you are indecisive download the demo you can play the first two mission and the tutorial and skirmish with 4 out of six races.in the skirmish the ai is plain dumb and if you can't set the difficulty in the fullversion than you only have a nice campaign.there are a few contra but if you make use of the discount that ends at the 03.04 it's worth it in my eyes.

												This game was released too early - this is the charge that most people level against this game, and they are right, I don't think anyone would really disagree. It was incomplete, buggy and not very well optimised. The majority of the negative reviews seem to focus on this.However - I would say it has come on in leaps and bounds since then.I backed the Kickstarter though I hadn't heard of Warmachine, let alone played the table top game, I like turn-based games and liked the sound of the theme.  When I first got access to it, all the points I touched on in my first paragraph left me frustrated, So I stopped playing it for a while, now though coming back to it, I've found it so much more enjoyable.WhiteMoonDreams have added a ton of content and have been releasing fixes and updates on a regular basis.The focus of the game, and subsequently the development, is on the Multiplayer which means that the Campaign is still lacking -The AI is basic and doesn't offer much of a challenge (this is slated for improvement in the future). The same can be said for Skirmish - however it's a good place to test out a list or a new tactic, albeit whihtout a sensible response from the opponent, before trying it in Multiplayer. My point here is that if you are more interested in the Campaign than the Multiplayer, you'll be disappointed.A Multiplayer (with limited unit selection) demo has just been released - it allows play against existing players as well as other demo users. I'd suggest giving it a try.The next feature that I am most waiting for is asynchronous play - being able to take a turn at a time when I can fit in 10 minutes without necessarily having to be online at the same time as my opponent will be great for me. By that time I also expect lots more fixes and improvements. I'll probably come back to this review at that point and give some more thoughts.			"

												Update: June 2015I honestly have been doing what I can to really be fair, and I really want to LIKE the game, but there's still so much that keeps it from being what it could be. The changes since my original review of the game that I have seen have been incremental and marginable at best. Small details that iron out rough edges, but still leaving large flaws that run through the game. Barring a severe overhaul of the game on every level, I still say to pick up the demo of the game and see how you feel with that, Otherwise, behave like there's still an 'Early Access' banner on the page.----- Original Review ----Despite what the site says, despite what the people promoting the game may say.... this game is still deserving of the term 'Early Access'... I'm hoping that maybe a glitch or error was made on the page that took that down, but I'm still sitting here and wishing that Steam might have the same 'return' policy that Origin has (yeah, that's right, I'm saying that this game makes Origin better than Steam, that's how far it's pushed me.)If you're hard-up for a turn-based strategy game to play, there really are better ones out there. Otherwise, if you're that much a fan of the tabletop game and wanna see (some of) your favorite warcasters out there actually move and do things, go right ahead.I'm just gonna delete this now, hopefully I can come back in a while and see a more polished product that I feel was worth my 20$			"

I enjoy it plenty right now, and it seems like it's going to be a must own for all fans of Warmachine/Hordes, and anyone who likes really good, tight, tactical gameplay.

												Want to play a game with intuitive camera systems, realistic requirements and game play that doesn't randomly screw up?  Play something else if you answered yes.White Moon Dreams has heavily disappointed me with this title, giving a black eye to the Privateer Press IP of Warmachine.  The controls are not intuitive and allows for background items like trees to block your ability to interract with the maps.  Occasionally a click to a specific square will instead rocket your selected unit across the map somewhere else.The part that is most frustrating was that during the time the game was being developed and kickstarted requirements, while never confirmed, were said to be within the normal performance for games of these era.  Guild Wars 2 at full effects or FFXIV: ARR, no problem on my system.  Warmachine Tactics however ends it.  Its been 7 months with only minimal improvement on the stability end.  If you have a modern gaming rig (8gb Ram, 3+ ghz quadcore processor, NVidia 900 series, etc) then by all means play the game.  I bet its great.  However the system barrier of entry leaves a sour taste in my mouth for the studio involved.			"

												Having only played the demo, forgive the limited PoV, However, I was a veteran of Warmachine Mk1.The gameplay certainly tries to ring true to the tabletop game, but has moments when you wish it was true, but isn't.Spells before movement: I can see why they removed this, they probably didn't have the techno know how to prevent a ""move, spell, moveback"" tactic. Instead they count spells as an action.DEF and ARM: there was moments when I thought ""how would that guy hit/damage him!?"" Like the normally POW11 Trencher rifles doing 5 damage to a Juggernaught. But, I do have to commend the designers, it certainly has alot to offer, but I don't think they have the know how to polish the final game. Pro'sGraphics are amazing, and bring the universe to light (it would be nice to have an army painter though, I did play a field grey (AKA green) Khadoran force)True to tabletop gameplayCon'svery clumsy camera tracking: I had my units go round a corner, not knowing their was the enemy mere squares away. Camera's getting blocked by scenary. Even at one put the same buildings took away all the scenery and units, but leaving the HUD and overlay, however the game returned to normal quickly.In all, a very good game, but does need a final polish for it to become an awesome game!

												I've never played table top Warmachine, but I hope it isn't as slow and dull, as this game. There is no good intro, no good tutorial or flow, it feels like I need to learn another language to play it. The UI is unintuitive (seems to be endemic of kickstarter games), it's hard to understand what's going on, and there is no sense of action whatsoever. Model quality is very high, but it's diminished by poor lightning, effects and animations. Perhaps it would have worked better to simply present the models in the game as actual immobile miniature figures, and keep graphics more stylized overall.I had no fun playing this game and I can't recommend it to anyone.

												I bought into this game during Early Access and it was ok.. but very buggy. I took part in some community topics and one of which was noticed by the Dev and said it was a good idea and they'll add it to the game. It's now been several months since i last tried this game and take note it is now OUT of Early Access.. The game is by far way too buggy for a ""finished"" game, the suggestion i also made to the dev wasn't added at all which is annoying. But for a ""finished"" game it's badly optimised and the graphics suck for the FPS you get out of it. Depth of Field is a very good example of why this game is badly optimised.Here's 2 screenshots to Depth of Field turned on.


This is DOF turned on.. This game is so buggy and it's been MONTHS since i last played it.. it's not only buggy but it's out of Early Access

I like many others backed it on kick starter and all that... but have faith they will fill the game out as they go. Privateer Press is pretty good at balancing out their games (with others will debate but are better at it than GW).The graphics are constantly improving along with the model motions. Alot of improvement since BETA, not nearly as choppy.At this moment I owuld recommend this game but ONLY IF ON SALE!!! and if you're a fan as stated before. Only because long term it will fill out well.			"

It is not the same as the tabletop game (there have been articles written about that), but it has its own charms. Even if you've never heard of the tabletop game, Tactics is a well designed squad based tactics game with excellent graphics and a sense of humor (see Christmas update with hats for all infantry, even zombies) and an excellent way to spend your money. It is and excellent game to spend 40+ dollars on and I simply cannot wait to see what it reveals in the future (please, please, PLEASE let it be HORDES)			"

												It's pretty good. Of course, this is early access or whatever you want to call it so there are a few bugs and the game isn't polished - the AI is very unpredictable and broken, the RNG is often massively frustrating, graphics are a bit flickery and so on - but the core is pretty solid.I play the tabletop game and I can say for sure that although this isn't a 100% rule-for-rule stat-for-stat remake of the tabletop game, it captures the spirit of it very well. A few things are different here and there and a few of the most popular units in the tabletop game are unfortunately missing (Though, with the promise of paid-for (boo!) additional units and characters later) but overall it's pretty faithful to the spirit of the actual game.The only thing that's not faithful to the spirit of the game is the very stingy microtransaction system that's being talked about. That's much more something I'd associate with Games Workshop than Privateer Press who are usually very good about being very inclusive with what you spend money. A bit of a shame but I suppose that's the age of gaming we live in. I will say that a Microtransaction system which will include characters and units, not just cosmetic items, is not something I would have expected to see in a Crowdfunded game and is not in the spirit of crowfunding.TL;DR - Game is good. People exploiting crowdfunding and microtransactions is not.Still recommended because it is solid. Might be worth waiting if you don't want to play an incomplete game, of course.			"

												5/10Warmachine:Wannabe X-Hammercom?At first I looked at the game and I thought that maybe this one has a potential, but few hours into the game I was disappointed.-The controls are bad and they feel sticky and cluncky-The UI feels unfinished and done in an offhand manner(Especially the ingame map doesn't tell you where you look from)-The camera is outright fecal and needs fixing,  lots of it(Weird angles of view when you zoom in\out, camera isn't switching to a unit that does an action[like when enemies come in out of the blue or attack your units])-The music is annoying and repetitive-The cinematics are terrible with characters that do not move their lips when they talk and the voice acting is dull and boring-DLC's from day one for a game that had his first PC port from tabletop? Hell, Mechwarrior didn't do these stuff until MW3(with their expansion packs).I won this game in a giveaway with its DLC's and I wouldn't had bought this game if I knew that it has game affecting DLCs.However, the concept of gameplay is great, the graphics are beautiful and it could've been one of those successful indie games if it had none of the issues above.In conclusion - WhiteMoon Dreams and Privateer Press need to get their s**t together and fix this game or even give this game a whole overhaul, without trying to hand out their hands straight up for cash - because this is not how games made.

												Its like they took the table top game and said ""ok write a list of everything that makes this a good miniatures game""  and then looked at fantasy computer games and said ""now write a list of everything that makes people like these computer games"".  And then they said ""now make a list of everything we could do better using a computer than a table top game"".  and then they took those lists, and put them into one list and said ""don't put any of these things in the final game"".They have masterfully combined a tabletop game with a computer game and somehow managed to take only the worst aspects of both, carefully dodging any positive aspect they might have accidentally picked up.  In fact, they did such a good job making the game terrible I think they might have gone the extra mile and made lists of everything they could make worse from the table top game.  And then they had a brainstorming session of ways they could make you less satisfied with your time.Tim:  ""You know how the miniatures game has you take turns because its really hard to simulate simultaneous movement in a miniatures game?Greg:  ""yeah, sometimes playing that game I wish there was a way to streamline that process so both players could have less time simply waiting for the other player to move""Tim: ""and you know how since we have computers that can simply work everything out accurately and in real time we could simply get rid of that problem?""Greg: ""... yes?  where are you going with this Tim?...""Tim: ""well I think we should not do that.  Lets keep it turn based so that players don't have to deal with enjoying the exciting combat""Greg:  ""genius!""Tim:  ""And not only that, but this way we can give all the characters completely static animations and have them stand perfectly still almost 95% of the time""Greg:  ""fantastic idea!  Having good graphics and smooth animations might allow players to become immersed in the game.  This way is much better, there is almost no chance players will feel any excitement during a battle""Tim: ""exactly!  It is definitely best to avoid capitalizing on the fact that since this is a computer game we could actually render out the battles instead of having the players imagine them like in the mini war game""Bob: ""oh hey guys, I just wanted to share my idea that for the opening cinematic we could have the characters talk about really exciting battles and interesting plot events""Greg: ""I dunno Bob, that sounds a little to interesting for what we are trying to make here""Bob: "" but thats just it, we wont ever actually show what they are talking about.  It will be a huge entirely empty room in which two characters discuss interesting events that the player doesnt ever get shown""Tim: ""good idea Bob, we could even go a step further by not bothering to animate the characters mouths and not giving them any interesting body anguage at all""Greg:  ""If we play this right we can take something that might have once been interesting and gotten the players excited to play our game and instead make it into a boring lecture that feels like it lasts for years""Tim:  ""hey bob, this is a turn-based skirmish level tactical strategy game which is almost exactly the same as the table top game, even using almost the same dice system""Bob: ""yeah...""Tim: ""well maybe we should consider changing the type of game slightly since the only people who are likely to get into this game already are invested in a better version of the same exact game?""Bob:""....""Greg:""...""Tim: ""BWAHHAHAHAHAA oh my god I really had you guys going there""Bob: ""Hehehe you sure are a joker there Tim""Greg: ""oh man thats a good one!  The game might have actually had a purpose if we did something crazy like that""Tim: ""for real though I think we should take it a step down even from the table top game and set everything on a grid""Bob: ""Tim, you always know how to suck the life and joy out of everything""Tim: ""aww you're flattering me ""Jeff: ""hey guys""Greg: ""[sigh] what is it now, Jeff?""Jeff: ""well its just that I looked at that old E3 demo where it was sort of a tactical third person skill based hack and slash with elements of strategy, third person shooter, and squad commanding/building.  It really seemed like a good way to let the players experience the 'no holds barred iron fury' warmachine is all about.  and whats great about it too is that this is a totally diferent perspective on the iron kingdoms that would be inviting to new players, perfect for people already into privateer press games, and not compete directly with the-""Tim:  ""shut up Jeff.""Greg: ""nobody likes you""Bob: ""please leave, we need to push this product out with almost no actual advertising now""Tim: ""wait hold on, we cant put this out in this shape.  Its not right at all""Greg: ""what do you mean, Tim?""Tim: ""well obviously we need to make the boarders showing grid distances jarringly bright and glowy.  as distracting as possible, sort of a garish neon cyberpunk looks that will do a great job of completely conflicting with the established fantasy steampunk theme""Greg: ""its these little attentions to detail that make you such a valued team member Tim.

												First of I am not a native English speaker + this is my first review so please bear with me.This game is a Good adaptation of the TTg and I really like it. It may take a few games for someone completely new to the setting to get used to but there are very comprehensive tutorials so it shouldn't take anyone long.

												This is a review of the demo. After playing the single player demo missions I cannot recommend it. The game is slow, has a clunky interface and has bugs which directly influence gameplay. A lot of the time nothing happens when I click on units, making me click on multiple units until one activates. I've lost units because I've not been able to do things in my own order. When a unit is activated it cannot be unactivated. This would be okay after the unit has completed an action, but why on earth are we not allowed to switch between units if they have not performed an action?The graphics are nice, but very unoptimized. Lowering settings have virtually no effect on the frame rate. The image is very blurry, making it look like an episode of 'Days of Our Lives' *shudder*. I've seen posts about this as early as july 2014 and it has still not been fixed.I like the Iron Kingdoms setting and the mechanics of the game, but in the end, based on the demo, I can't really recommend Warmachine: Tactics. There's a substantial amount of work to be done before it can reach it's potential.It makes me wonder: Was it really ready to leave beta/early access?			"

												TL:DR  Buy it on a massive sale or in a bundle... just in case.I found this game to be a fun ""meh, close enuff"" version of the tabletop game. The graphics and UI, and overall mechanics, are pretty horrible, but if you can get passed that initial disgust and find a groove where the mechanics don't annoy you, you can have fun, especially if you have some friends to play online with. THAT said... last time I played this online, there was a bug causing many matches to lock up at random times during the battle. I haven't heard if this was fixed or not. So, to a select few I recommend this game. To everyone else I say this game will die soon. At this point, I think the only way to save this game would be the devs opening up to mods, doesn't even have to be workshop. I'm not saying full mods that might interfere with any intellectual property of Privateer Press, but how about that army painter that was talked about way back during the kickstarter? Maybe let the community make some new maps and single-player missions or scenarios? A skirmish/sandbox mode where we can pick any army size, just to experiment. In fact, I would be willing to bet there's modders out there more familiar with the Unreal engine than the devs, and I'm sure it wouldn't take long for mods that could optimize graphics, UI, lag, memory leaks, and anything else brought up in negative reviews. Just some random thoughts...			"

												As a fan of the Tabletop and a KS Backer, this review kind of pains me to write.All the framework of a good game is there, and for the most part, actual gameplay animations run really smoothly and look amazing. A focus on smaller skirmishes as opposed to the large sclae battles seen on a tabletop has the potiential for an interesting game. Where everything falls apart however is the UI. It is so clunky, so user-unfriendly that it borders on ridiculous. Having to fiddle with a units facing just to get it to look in the correct direction as the thing you want it to kill, and then take 3-4 clicks from there just to make your attack feels frustrating and takes absolutely forever. Movement is a chore, having to constantly rotate the camera so that you can click the exact spot you want to move to, because a small rock was blocking it from vision, and hope to god you don't misclick anything and send your unit off in the wrong direction, with no option to undo (Which can happen freuquently because...) Selecting units is a huge pain. You can of course click on their name in your army list on the side of the screen... which is hidden from view most of the time while controlling a unit, or you can click the actual unit, which is as fiddly as it gets, if you accidentally select the wrong unit, you can proceed to accidentally move it where you didn't want it to go as you try to pick the right one.  Ultimately, Warmachine: Tactics is a game that could be great, it just needs more time and polish than even devoted fans are willing to give it.			"

												Beautiful graphics and unit detail. Very tough on the hardware though. Not sure if that's entirely justified.The camera flies through buildings, which kind of ruins the immersion. But it's pretty flexible in general, although you can't control the viewing angle, which is a shame.Clunky/vague unit control and UI. Sometimes random things happen, and for some reason I won't be able to have a unit perform an attack. And you can't switch to another unit after having browsed its actions menu, even when it hasn't performed a move/attack yet. XCOM did that better. I guess I find it bothersome having to plan all my units' actions ahead.For some reason it's very difficult or sometimes impossible to select a friendly unit. And I still haven't figured out how to select and view info on enemy units (might be me). There are these elaborate mystic circles to indicate a selectable unit, but they're more messy than helpful.No saves/checkpoints in the campaign. I don't mind not being able to save (i.e. cheat) during missions, but I sure mind having to replay an entire mission when I fail. Especially when there are multiple scripted events throughout a mission that change the situation in an unforeseeable way. And let's not mention all the random/endless unit spawns. Wasting literally hours of my time like this is a big con for me.Fairly decent voice acting and story (as far as I've seen).Yes, the missing animations in cutscenes. Guess they ran out of money. Not such a big deal when the gameplay itself is solid. However...I can't say I'm looking forward to finishing the campaign at this point. I foresee much frustration. So this will probably be it for me. Lots of potential here, but too unpolished to risk wasting hours and hours on.Get this (on sale) if you're a fan of tabletop games or specifically Warmachine. If you want a casual campaign experience, like me, just don't bother. I got this in a Humble Bundle, so no harm done, really.			"

												Fun and challenging game when playing against other players. The AI is decent enough to learn how to play and learn tactics. For the people complaining that it is not like the Miniature game. First off it is a PC version so no it is not exactly like the miniature game we all know. As for controls they can be a little confusing at first. But once you learn them they are fair and easy. Some units are little OP but that really depends on the use of those units and your decisions.			"

												Its not Warmahine. Remember that before you get this game. I have to say that I was well aware of that on the way in with this game and was still disappointed. Warjack animations and sfx are ok, I'll give Whitemoon that. Gameplay itself, however, just feels janky and off. The story in the game is as bad as the stuff in the books (unless you enjoy that lore, then by all means it will suit your tastes). Don't expect digital Warmachine. Don't expect rules to translate nicely between the two. Don't expect to not be punished for playing smart by tabletop standards. Enemies will spawn out of the blue in story mode and ruin what you considered a well defended area. Not in the ""oh man, sneaky assassin!"" kinda way. More like the ""the plot demanded this stuff show up here so we randomly threw it here."" That combined with the DLC setup? No mas!			"

This game had some issues around launch but it great now, don't let it slip by you for such a low cost, you can even try the demo for free. Not many devs do that these days.Honestly worth 20$ now and a small team like this deserves it, but if you're skeptical I'm sure it'll hit 15$ on sale sometime soon.

												Only played the demo, mind you, but I found the game to be enjoyable and playable, but not without it's faults. Been a while since I've played the table top version, but from everything I see, it seems to stay very true to the source material, and I feel that it captures the feel of the game well. The Warmachines feel satisfactorially weighty, and there is some satisfying moments when they smash infantry units into the next postal code. There are some problems, however, at least in the demo.  The biggest fault is the interface, which is a trainwreck. I had trouble controlling the camera, and sometimes even knowing what I was doing. Occasionally I would know what I was trying to do, but I couldn't seem to get it to function quite the way I expected, or I wouldn't be able to perform an attack with no clear indicator as to why not. Again, this is just my experience with the demo, which may not reflect on the full game. Another example of interface hijinx, is the camera positioning itself behind buildings when playing on urban levels. This happened mostly with the ""action"" shots of my figures doing things, so it was nothing I needed to see, but it was irritating.  Poor, shy camera. The AI also is nothing to write home about. They seem mostly interested in getting as close as possible, and don't often surprise you.If you enjoy Warmachines on the tabletop, I feel like this is worth a look. I don't feel like this game will knock anyone's socks off (again, based on my experience with the demo), but it is enjoyable to play, and the story seems interesting if not necessarily rivoting. Overall, I recommend this game, although I feel like the price is a little high, and will probably wait for it to go on sale before I purcahse it myself. As a final note, I really had no luck using a controller in any meaningful way. I know it says ""partial controller support"" but and it's true that it recognized and responded to the controller, but since it is not playable with one, it kinda defeats the point.			"

												I do like this game, but as a player from the table top its a poor comparison. I think its very hard to translate from table top on games but they did try. I rarely find multiplayer, the single player is boing and short. The DLC is ok cause that's the game type, you dont pay to win you get what you want in your faction. My main complaint id the AI is totally stupid. I mean it runs warcasters right at jacks with 2 focus and expect that they are 1 kill it  and 2 survive next round I have won more game sin turn 2 then I care to disclose. If you play the table top this game will make you shake your head, possible that non-warmachine/hordes players might like it more.			"

												If you were to ask me to describe Warmachine Tactics in as few words as possible, I'd describe it as ""incredibly lazy"", or perhaps ""cripplingly uninspired"".For those of you not in the know, Warmachine is a table-top miniatures game created by Privateer Press. It's pretty dang fun, even though I think the game suffers from some pretty severe feature/scale/unit creep. Warmachine Tactics fails to really capture the feel of the miniatures game, mostly because it's simultaneously obsessive and dismissive about the rules. Clumsily shoehorning in the control phase and facing because they're in the tabletop game, but then forcing everything onto a no-diagnonal square movement grid and giving mooks more than one hitpoint? Please make up your mind, game!As a result of the game's indecision about whether it wants to be Tabletop Simulator: Warmachine or Warmachine: the Video Game, the game in motion is completely uninspired. Animations are clunky and boring despite the good models and textures, the single player game features mostly acceptable voice work undercut by the least interesting and laziest cutscenes/storyline possible, and game just plays like dropping bricks off a bridge. And that's not even talking about the cluttered and poorly organized UI, which feels like someone looked at XCOM2012 and half-assedly copied their layout before throwing up all over the left side of the screen.It's pretty clearly Privateer Press Interactive's first rodeo, but Whitemoon is a developer staffed with (minor) folks from some pretty good games. Which leaves me wondering why Warmachine Tactics looks, feels, and plays like a bad XCOM2012 ripoff with extra steampunk encoggling.Regardless of my disappointment at this game's poor execution, a bad XCOM is still better than a lot of other shovelware and outright garbage games. And I got it though a Humble Bundle package that scored me some other games I wanted (Magicka 2, Grey Goo, The Shadowrun Game That Is Not By Hairbrained And Is Bad) for 12 USD, so I guess I can't be too hard on a game that's so desperately trying to go Free-to-Play to score some of that sweet, sweet League of Legends money.

They are so close to the actual game on the tabletop, but then they change things at seemingly random points.. Like instead of taking units with a set ammount of people to back the points they allow you to buy individual grunts.. weird. They also change the point costs for some of the stuff randomly. It's just so close to the table top they should have just stuck with it the whole way then we can just play WM/H on the computer without having to use VASSAL.			"

												You don't need to try anything more than the game's demo on Steam to see how bad the game is. By default the graphics are set to ""medium"" or something, which means all characters, the terrain and the characters' portraits are extremely blurry which stands in stark contrast with the pixel-crisp GUI. The game was probably optimized for tiny screens, like 640x480 or something, as on my 1920x1080 the GUI elements are tiny and are scattered in the edges of the screen. The level minimap, for example, is smaller than a single soldier when viewed from max zoom out. Even after I set all graphical settings to maximum and restarted the game, everything was still blurry. There might be something wrong in their shaders code or whatever, but all objects are too glossy and too bright, with large spots of plain white on many objects. The tutorial text is written in huge blurry font. Tutorial messages tell about what on-screen buttons do but at the same time the whole GUI is hidden, so you don't know what they are talking about. You will stop understanding the explained game mechanics about 1/3 into the tutorial. After that you will keep clicking the highlighted areas/buttons with no clue what's going on. Obviously the developers never tested the tutorial on anyone except themselves. The cutscenes are ugly and some of them can't be skipped. E.g. I wanted to exit the game during an endless cutscene, and the dialog to confirm exiting was there, but when you press ""Yes"" (yes, please exit) it just hangs. This was the last straw for me.My guess is that 90% of people who try the demo will exit it and uninstall it right after the tutorial stops showing its messages and lets you finish the first mission by yourself. Or rather, most will exit even before the tutorial shows anything, after seeing the super-blurry font.All that said, the combat system seems to be pretty interesting (from what I could understand) and feels like something between XCOM Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga. It's a pity that this promising system got such an atrocious implementation.			"

												Me and my buddy just bought this game having heard of the tabletop but never played it and we are having an absolute ball just beating the hell out of each other whilst we discover synergies and strategies from first principals. Sure the front end and UI could be better but the core system is wonderful. Blood Bowl is the only thing I would consider similar and it has a ravenous hard-core fan based in spite of its godawful front-end and UI. If you are a fan of head-to-head turn-based squad-based skirmish games then this really is a must. My only warning is that the online community is a little problematic in that it's quite thin on the ground and most that do play know what they are doing.  So my advice is train up against your RL pals then get involved. Devs seem active and committed too.			"

												If you enjoy Blood Bowl, then this game is quite a bit of fun. They are on the right track... this could be a great game. Need:- Frame rate issues need fixed- Forests/roads/diverse obstructions - MORE MAPS!!!! - More offline Game modes - capture & hold, assasination...etcHave:- A solid base game- Complicated units- Good graphics - Decent User Interface (U.I)- Fun gameplayWorth buying... but do not expect a perfect game... if used for fun.. you will get your money's worth!*Update:Since recent game updates this game is much smoother. A.I does not sacrifice warcasters anymore. User Interface has been greatly improved. Game still needs A.I difficulty settings!Offline Game Modes like capture and defend would make this game amazing. Great game, easily worth buying			"

												This is probably the most effectively done video game version of a miniature tabletop wargame I have ever seen.Miniature tabletop wargames have grown in popularity over the years.  Miniature tabletop wargames are games in which players can assemble and paint real life, scale miniature figures representing soldiers, creatures and vehicles of war and conduct army battles with them.  The best known example of this genre is probably Warhammer 40K.  Warmachine is a rising competitor to 40K, based upon warfare set in a steampunk fantasy world.  For many people the time and cost involved provides a significant barrier to entry to the genre.  Warmachine: Tactics represents a well executed video game realization of the miniature tabletop wargame on your computer, bypassing many of these difficulties.It will be interesting to see how this game develops as additional factions and campaigns are added in the future.  Hopefully this will also act as an effective springboard for people who want to give the real life game a try!			"

Honestly, they would have to bundle the dlc and the game together at under $20 to be actually worth getting since it seems they spend the most time on getting out new dlc instead of cleaning up wants wrong with the game as is. Its like they are being run by Activision with the ""new thing every year"" mentality.			"

												When I found out there was a warmachine video game I was syched. A cheaper alternative that I can just play whenever I want? Whats not to love? Boy was I wrong.I'll say right now that I only played the first demomission and I didnt even finish it. However I did watch what happened in the rest of the mission and the subsequent one after that. I'll explain why I didnt complete this later.I'll start with the good stuff-Gamplay seemed fine. I thought it might have been interesting and from my memory seemed pretty similair to the minitures game.-thats basically itNow the bad -The framerate is awful, and I have no idea whats causing it. It literally turned my graphics from low to high and saw little change in the framerate. This, unfortunatley, killed the game for me.-It looks so bad. Even on awesome mode It looks like an early 3d pc game. I dont mind this however,I dont feel this is right considering this was made in 2014.-The dlc. Though not as bad as the season pass for star wars battlefront, they still went overboard. Though I can go without the dlc and 2 extra factions and units, its never a good sign when your game is less expensive than your dlc.I do not recommend it in its current state, but with framerate improvment and maybe a graphical enhancment then I might consider buying the game.

However all the right set peaces are hear and they captured the game rather well. i would recomend only because now with the price down a little it's a little more wurth it and in the end if they make the impovement I think they will make then it should end up being a great little game.

Posted: February 23, 2015
												I just don't know. I seem to have the free demo of the game. I've played the tutorial and the first actual mission. This is where I stand:- No idea what the story behind Warmachine is. I have heard about the game, but that's it. The campaign starts of weirdly and the dialogue is infurating in my opinion. That the characters are not animated when talking doesn't help either. It's been 10 years or so since I last saw 3D rendered characters who couldn't move their mouths. If you don't want to animate that, fine, it's a strategy game, I get that, but zooming into their faces during every cutscene is a moronic idea then. Also the campaign is extremely boring so far. The dialogue, the characters, the ""humour"". It just feels off and not interesting at all.- The gameplay. It seems to have depth, I'll give them that. Your units are different enough at the start at least. Warjacks look awesome and have a ridiculous miss rate of 40% in melee vs basic infantry. Seriously? I was a bit underwhelmed. The pacing is wrong here. After introducing the warcaster as your hero unit and then almost immediately afterwards giving you your first warjack I've gotta say that that thing is just a big bullet sponge right now...kinda sad. Navigating the attacks and spells etc. is more or less intuitive. They have included tooltips why an action is not possible, which is cool. Unfortunately those tooltips are only available for some actions. Why? God only knows.- The controls. They are not that great. The whole game feels sluggish and partially unresponsive. At times you don't know why you can't commit an action...example in mission 1: You need to shoot at barrels with your warcaster. Well, ok. You select that woman, move her into position, click on the ranged attack button and the attack automatically lights up. Cool, works. You can also click on the barrels to shoot them just like with any other enemy - in theory. In reality when I got to the second set of barrels I could not ♥♥♥♥ing select to shoot them. I had free LoS, no enemies near me, yet I could not select to shoot the barrels. I realized a turn later that there are small next/previous buttons for enemy selection as well. Cycling through those I eventually got the barrels selected as my target. But why? Why make this such an effort?I think you can get used to that, though.- The camera. Oh my god the camera. People were, unfortunately, right about that ♥♥♥♥ing camera. I messed around a bit with the camera options, but none of the settings are satisfactory. Moving the camera is sluggish as hell (thank god I disabled motion blur...yes this game has motion blur, for whatever reason) and unprecise. You can move, rotate, zoom...blabla, but it doesn't feel natural, especially in free camera mode. Since it is a turn based game I can also kind of live with that. What I can't live with is the combat camera. I have disabled action camera, but as soon as the AI makes their move, the camera goes bonkers. Example: An enemy unit is selected, the camera jumps to that unit, the unit movies, the unit stops. The camera jumps BACK to your previously selected unit, then back again to the enemy unit as it makes its attack. It does this all the time. It literally makes me feel sick. Sometimes the camera just doesn't scrolls to the edge of the screen during such a move and then back again. Why? Why can't you just focus the camera on the unit that moves, but not actually follow the unit, but just show the area in which the move is being executed? The simple following every unit at closest zoom (yes it does that as well, zooming ♥♥♥♥ing in every time) makes my head spin...again. The camera is a mess.- The graphics. They're serviceable. They look good, but something feels off. It's all too blurry somehow. Even the written dialogue text is blurry. It looks cheap. The actual assets look good, but as a whole it's not quite there. Landscapes are ok, but they also could have done a better job with the UI highlighting actual units - friendly and enemy. At times they just meld with the landscape...pretty annoying.- Price: A 30 euro price tag for a kickstarter funded game is quite a lot. I'm not sure how much you get for that. I think 4 factions in MP and the campaign, the boring campaign with 20 missions. You will, however, only play the annoying red head afaik...boring, boring, boring. I guess they may do other campaigns for other factions, but at this point I'm not even sure they should. Additionally they want to charge you for upcoming content as well, of course. DLC, yay. Right now that is the ""Retribution"" faction bundle for skirmish and MP for whopping 15 euros and the ""mercenaries faction"". I think they are a faction, sold either as individual units or via 3 bundles for a total or 20 euros! I think you can use them to supplement any army...being mercenaries and all. I get it: You want to make moneyBUT! If you fund your game through kickstarter for almost 600,000 dollars (+ whatever additional funds you received), then proceed to sell the base game for 30 dollars with only 4 of the 6 (or 7) factions of the actual tabletop game, and THEN proceed to sell those same factions for another 35 dollars, while at the same time your game is full of bugs and needs to be improved in almost every aspect, I think you don't deserve my money at all. That is the deciding factor why I choose to rate this game negatively. A lot of things can be fixed or improved, but the pricing is a hit in your face. Not to mention that there will most likely either be more DLC or that's it...it's not worth it imho. If you're a Warmachine fan, chances are you're gonna play the tabletop anyway.			"

												This game is a perfect example to all the smaller game companies looking to expand into the digital world of gaming as to why they SHOULDN'T. It's just horrible in almost everyway, from glitchy graphics, horrible gameplay, almost no units and no real story line, theres not much to say. The sadest part of this whole experience is how many loyal privateer press followers actually kickstarted this game, present company included. Since I payed way more than I shouldve, well over a year ago now, I think ive received one lame pack of about 6 mercenary characters only usable in skirmish or online. Considering how many characters exist in this world and the poor choice of DLC content to date, im thoroughly convinced now that this game will NEVER be what we'd hoped for. After 3 long frustrating lvls with nothing but a couple entry lvl warjacks in single player mode and no real sign of anything cool coming later on (eg..thunderhead, stormclad, cyclones..etc) I was just completely done. A couple hrs of fighting the controls and camera more than the enemy was it for me. Privateer Press is actually a great company and I really don't mind paying these guys 30-35bucks for a three inch high plastic warjack kit that costs probably less than a buck to produce....BUT this game here.... they really milked us dry and left us for dead with this little adventure ...and that just sucks....Still waiting for a playable game Apr 03			"

Early Access Review
								Not a horrible game, but I think you will have to enjoy the tabletop version to enjoy it. I don't know why everyone expects an early access version to be feature complete and bug free- just wait for it to be actually released to play it. The one thing I can say for it is that the battles move REALLY SLOW, at least if you're learning everything like me. It is turn based and each game piece must be individually told what to do. If you've ever played Heroes of Might and Magic it's sort of like that but the maps are much bigger.			"

												Tabletop miniatures on your PC. No paint or modeling, but is that so bad? I am not an avid Warmachines player on the tabletop, but I might be after playing this game! ProsGreat models and textures that give the game a Warmachines feel.The campaign has difficulty. I am not just blowing through it.AI adjust well to your movments, Not always the same everytime.Massive potential for expansion more campaigns are allready in the works. All factions are supposed to have there own.A decent story in the first campaign.Missions vary from just kill everything.Multiplayer - Tabletop from home when you can't make it to your local shop.ConsCamera is unpredictable during opponents movements and requires quiete a bit of adjustment on your turn.Camera obscured many times by talll buildings and trees.FPS issues randomly during play. Not always, but definitely noticable.UI maybe a bit too simple. (It works)Can be a long wait for multiplayer gamesAt the time of this writing leaderboard is not working.Resource intensiveOverall this is a great game and I definitely recommend it. Just wanted people to know some issues they might run into. I am sure patches are incoming and that multiplayer will grow as more people buy the game. Have fun and enjoy!			"

												When Early Access began for this game in July, I'd been waiting almost a year to play it. Its features were heavily limited, it was full of bugs, and it was poorly optimised- all things you'd expect from an Early Access game.In the following months, the developers have shown that they care about both the game and the community- almost everything has been fixed in weekly patches, features have been implemented at an impressive rate, and a huge amount of our suggestions have been taken on board. For a debut game from a new studio, I'm mightily impressed.Warmachine: Tactics, as with the tabletop Warmachine, is about clever army construction, positioning, patience, ruthlessness, brutality and keeping your cool. A warcaster defines how his army functions, so the same list can play very differently with the change of a single unit, and there are currently around a dozen units and four warcasters for each faction, so there's a huge amount of customisation possible.If you've ever lost an evening to a turn-based tactical game, then I can recommend this.As for downsides? The UI could use a little work and Mac performance is a little wonky, but there's nothing gamebreaking. The learning curve is steep if you've never played Warmachine, but you'll be rewarded if you persevere.TL; DR: Wizards with guns throw robots at each other. 9/10			"

												I wanted to like the game. I wanted it to be good. I tried. Like a good friend, I put hours into our relationship, trying to make it work. Gave it tips to try and help it get its act together, brushed off comments from my friends that it wasn't worth anything. I remained optimitic, ""Tactics is getting better,"" I said, ""It's still working out some things. Don't worry, it'll get there. Its a lot better then it used to be already!""  But its not.I have to face the facts, at some point. You're not getting better tactics. You're still the buggy mess of a game you where at release. You're not making improvements. you're barely treading water. You're never going to live up to what you could be and its time, I'm very very sorry, but its time to just cut off this farce. We had some good times. Remember when me and that cryx player tabled each other, and Sevy killed denny with his stick? Or that time Butcher killed the entire army by himself? Heh. Was fun.I guess... I guess I'm rambling now. I'm sorry. I wanted to believe in you, and be there for you but the endless crashing, the broken mechanics, the lack of all the features from coop to asych multiplayer... its not happening. Its never happening. And you're not going to fix yourself. You're going to stay this piece of gaming... wreckage forever. And we'll always look back at you and whisper 'What went wrong?'I'm sorry Tactics. I'm honestly sorry. But its over.We're through.			"

Early Access Review
								>>For everyone whining about the price: This will get you: <<The basic game+ An entire additional faction (Mercenaries)+ 4 new Warjacks (Units)+ 4 new Warcaster (Hero/Generals)+ the opportunity to play the betaIf you don't want to pay now for stuff that will get added later on, don't buy it.If you don't want to play this game earlier then others and help with the development, don't buy it.If you want an already fully fleshed out game, don't buy it. It's very much beta, hold off for the release version.This is a review of the early access version, which is a beta. I will update it depending on my time played and upon release.Now then, the game:Currently you have access to one single player mission and a limited multiplayer. Judging from that the game seems very promising, but still lacks a lot of polishing. The current interface is atrocious for example. Apart from that, we have a solid combat system, that's easy to understand. If you are familiar with the tabletop game that is, since there is as of yet no tutorial only a bunch of vids. But the tabletop rules seem to be translated faitfully into the game. Combos can be applied in the same way. Warjacks feel nice and stompy. Infantry give great utility.The graphics are nice and very faithful to the originals. The sound effects are great and the animation looks nice, too.So if you are a fan of Warmachine and don't mind paying for an early access, or just have to start playing right now, I recommend you get this game.If you look for a tactical game, like steampunk and magitek and want to see the game grow, I recommend you get this game.If you are looking for a fully fleshed out tactical game that will get you your money's worth immediately, I remmcomend you surf over to humbledbundle.com and pick up XCOM. Or wait until WM: Tactics is out of early access and released.Updated: Price is now in line between € and $.			"

Early Access Review
								I'll keep the review part short:Gameplay is great, this game has massive potencial, lots of planning, stratagy etc, of course there is a slight element of luck/rng with the dice, but this is to be expected...The game is solid and im sure it's gonna be a big big hit, certainly within the group of people who enjoy this type of game, I hope they make it possible to have 2v2 matches, for some epic battles.Game atm is 3* due to content, but gameplay is 5*, when finished full package will be 5* all the way.Sigh.... So many people that are upset about the price.OK let me break it down for you.When a game that you are genuinely interested in is released at a standard price point, for example £30 both on the web or via steam, I don't see anyone whine or anything, if you want it you buy it, if you don't want it you don't buy it, simples. Take note of the above scenario, no whining, no complaining, no problems.Buuuuuuuuuuut.......on the other hand, the scenario below is quite different.When a game comes along that many people like the look of, they wanna play it, they are not sure if they would buy it in future or not, but regardless they still have some interest in it. Now in this case we have a game that is in late alpha/early beta stages of development, bugs, glitches and lack of content. During this period of time the game is open to those who wish to BUY INTO the beta testing phase for a higher fee which is matching that of the initial KS backers.On top of this the deal is sweetened by the addition of extra content after the final release.Now it must be made clear that the second option/scenario is INTENDED for one of 2 possible groups of individuals:1) Die hard warmachine fans who simply cannot possibly stand the time of waiting and cost is no object to them in the face of not being able to play their treasured game franchise.or  2) Those who do have some interest in the game, possibly not as much as a die hard fan, but nonetheless they are interested, however they have a very strong interest in shapeing the games continued development, learn more about the game, help find bugs and generally be part of the ongiong development process and are happy to pay the increased initial price of entry.Now when we look at those complaining about the price point of this game, they clearly are either trolls, or people who should be waiting for the game to be released at the standard £30 price point and at that point either choose to purchase or back out and play something else.However they are not.It is clear to to us all then, that those who are whining (trolls/patient release purchasers) are simply making all of these whine posts because they are butthurt, they want the game NOW, but are not interested enough to pay the premium price, and hence they whine because they have to live with the fact they have to wait.What can we take away from all of this?Well apparently quite a few people have some growing up to do, simples.

												I am really enjoying this game. I have just recently got into playing the table top game with a friend of mine and wanted to get this as a companion game to kind help learn some of the flow of the game. The games can have some frustrating camera issues sometimes. It is not fixed to 90 degree rotations like in X-Com you can move the camera freely in all directions. This is really cool as you get a look at the battlefield at any point of view and can help get some killer screen shots.Units really have some presence. When the jacks are walking about and attacking they really feel like they are giant metal constructs. Graphics are pretty good too, I run a GTX 770 4GB and I am pretty consistent in the 50-60 FPS on ultra settings (called awesome in the game)Also note the variety of faction units is pretty small at this stage of the game. Devs say they are trying to get all the units from the tabletop into the game when it's all said and done.Game still has some work to be done but the developers seem like they are pretty hard at work with frequent updates and interaction with the forums.Some of the work that needs to be done that really catches your attention is the cut scenes in between missions are not really animated at all. Characters don't move no facial expressions or anything, just still screen shots with voice overs. I found this strange because when you are in key battle scenes in game their faces are animated while these actions play out.The rest of the animations are well done.If you like turn based strategy games I would recommend this, even better if you are familiar with the game world.Already good game with lots of potential as the devs keep working on it.

												PROCEED WITH CAUTION: This is most likely one of the worst games i have ever played from a graphical and model stand point. I play Warmachine in tabletop battle games and i must say this game feels very unfaithful to the original game. It does incorporate the same rules as the tabletop game but the A.I is flawed, a Warcaster designed to shoot stuff walked up and tried to fight my Heavy Khador warjack, safe to say i turned him into paint, for anyone not familiar with Warmachine, one of the key goals of the game is to keep your 'caster safe and secure their longevity. Furthermore the models once killed have been flying all over the place and clipping through the scenery which in truth is too busy and does not make it easy to understand the game. This game does have a few good points to it, the models are in truth very close to their resin and metal counterparts but in truth i'd take a functioning game over one that just about passes for aesthetically pleasing... I have high hopes for this game but to be selling it at anywhere near it's marked up price is ludicrous. I'd wait for ALL of the updates and the price to hit rock bottom before purchasing it.			"

												Has the core of a good turn based tactical game, but sadly is technically awful.----+ Cool setting- Clunky gameplay- Hideous UI- Annoying performance issues- A ton of smaller problems----Playing this game made me realise how much I really want another Final Fantasy Tactics style game but in a shiney new graphics engine with a fully realised story and beautiful 3D animations. This is not that, though.The ""Steampunk with big robots"" theme is a good one, and the graphics hint at the core idea of the game being decent, but unfortunately it's mired in an absolute myriad of technical flaws and poor gameplay choices that make it painful to play.

												Overall fantastic game. It is definitely grounded in the same play style as the tabletop game, while also being changed and adapted for the video game medium. If you're a fan of tactical turn based strategy games, it's absolutely worth picking up.In addition to the quality of the game, the community is also particularly strong (in part from great involvement from the developers) and new players can easily get advice and feedback from the forums.Highly recommended, especially if you like the steampunk aesthetic.

												I thought I would give this game since it was on sale and I'm glad I waited to buy it (feels and plays like like a $19.99 game not $39.99). For the one hour that I played, I wasn't all that impressed as I thought I was going to be. I thought the graphics would be a little better (still pretty good though). The controls are simple and simlilar to a lot of RTS games I play. I will update this review as I continue to play the game when I get around to it (I wasn't really drawn into the story as it seems very similar to a lot of other war games). It might have been just me, but I noticed some minor grammer and misplaced (punctuation marks). I would still recommend this game, but not at full price.UPDATE:After 5 hours of gameplay in campaign in multiplayer, the game is quite enjoyable. I'm still sticking with my statement that this game is not worth $39.99 (maybe $25). I know they are improving this game with each patch, but the game is still buggy (stage 5 and 6). I also noticed that some of the characters run ackwardly (moving sideways and such when walking forward). Keep in mind that $1.5 million was invested into this game via kickstarter (you would think that for $1.5 mil this game would be super badass, but it's mediocre). I don't know maybe I was just expecting better cutscenes and a not glitched filled game. My opinions all sound negative, but I still enjoyed the few hours I put into this game. If you want to try this game, wait until it goes on sale again.			"

As someone who played the tabletop alot and pretty successfully (Woo, 2 Menoth coins, 2 champion coins, 1 champion league badge), it captures alot of the gameplay from the tabletop as closely as is possible with a grid system, which is nice. I couldn't rebuild my favorite army lists because pretty much only one or two units from the tabletop are available from them, but it seems like it would be easy to put in more. I just hope they don't go the route of 'every single unit is DLC'. That would make me sad, since I friggan already bought all the metal real life versions. I dunno, maybe include a DLC code for each unit in this game when buying one of the actual table top units? That'd be pretty rad.			"

												I have only played through four skirmeshes in this game but am ready to post a review. I have to say first that i love warmachne the miniatures game and have been collecting and playing it for years. I also understand like all irl games made into video games that this was not going to be the same as the tabletop, however I did expect something close for non campaign modes. I was very dissapointed by privateer and all else involved here. the graphics are decentish and I enjoy seeing the models I've loved move with some with animation. Gameplay is were this game truly hurts me as a gamer and fan. the gameplay is terrible right now. I would love to see something more of a guide or stat card set up for the game because while im playing i feel like any strategy matters little and im just clicking one guy to move then do whatever action it recommends. My W/L is 2/2 and hinestly I can't say really why i won or lost, it didnt really feel like a victory when i won and losses just felt bland i didnt feel like i had lost anything.I dont know how much money was invested into this game by privateer or the kickstarter, as a backer id give it more time before raising the refund army. yes this game was released way to early in development and should be called an alpha but if its really worked on i believe this game could be fixed.NOTE TO PRIVATEER! please pull out from whitemoon and switch developers. please put more serious work into this game. i would love to see it succeed.

												The only negative issues I have with this game are the lack of mouth movement in the unskippable cutscenes and the fact that the AI doesn't play like a Warmachine player.  Normally, if I leave my warcaster standing around with nothing between him and the enemy warcaster, I've lost the game... but the AI isn't smart enough to go for an assassination, unfortunately.  That said, in multiplayer, the other players *are* smart enough (of course), and I think multiplayer is where the game really shines.  There have been a considerable number of patches to the game, and several partial factions added, plus several waves of additional units added.  It's going to take awhile for the game to catch up with the 10 years that Warmachine's been around in terms of variety of units, and they're likely going to need to add larger maps if they ever want to add colossals... but for a game that is trying to capture the spirit of a tabletop miniatures game on the PC platform, it does a good job.  Since I play it fairly regularly, it must be a pretty good game.			"

												Has the core of a good turn based tactical game, but sadly is technically awful.----+ Cool setting- Clunky gameplay- Hideous UI- Annoying performance issues- A ton of smaller problems----Playing this game made me realise how much I really want another Final Fantasy Tactics style game but in a shiney new graphics engine with a fully realised story and beautiful 3D animations. This is not that, though.The ""Steampunk with big robots"" theme is a good one, and the graphics hint at the core idea of the game being decent, but unfortunately it's mired in an absolute myriad of technical flaws and poor gameplay choices that make it painful to play.

												Not Quite worth 20.00 bucks, but a very promising game, from crushing masses with a spellcaster, or supporting your troops, to protect the train or find a ruin in a feild of artifacts, its worth your time, also, great graphics, might be laggy on some computers, so be warned! "

												Polecam zakup tej gry na wyprzedaży (ja trafiłem na Humble Bundle za 1$). Pomimo wielu niedoróbek uważam że można zabić za jej pomocą wiele czasu.Minusy <Cons>:- niedopracowany interfejs (nie rozumiem czemu nie używają ikonek: poruszania, ataku wręcz, strzelania), <No interface icons (just add simple ones: MOVE, RANGED ATTACK, MELE ATTACK etc>- niedopracowane SI; <dumb AI>- kamera nie pokazuje automatycznie ruchów przeciwnika, <no ""OnEnemyAction"" camera>- mała ilość jednostek do wyboru, <Small variety of units>- brak możliwości zapisu rozgrywki w trakcie walki, <no ingame Save>- słaba kampania, <dull single player game>- miał być HotSeat, nie znalazłem, <how to play HotSeat session?>- w menu głównym, żeby się cofnąć, trzeba kliknąć na strzałki których rozmieszczenie jest mocno przypadkowe, Esc, Backspace nie działa <user UNfriendly menu>Plusy <pros>:+ miła dla oka grafika, <good graphic>+ działa, można pograć szybkie mecze ze znajomymi <multiplayer is working>+ to jeszcze beta - może będzie lepiej, <Still BETA, patches on the way>Bardzo trudno jest zrobić dobrą turówkę multiplayer, dlatego XCom ma tylko kilka jednostek (szybkość oddawania tury) a Warhammer 40k wyszedł jako RTS (1 tura figurkowej rozgrywki na ok 500pkt to 20 minut na osobę). Moim zdaniem WARMACHINE to ciekawy tytuł z którym warto zapoznać się bliżej.			"

												I usually keep to the rule ""If you can't say anything nice..."". I'm going to break it this time. In theory this should have been a game I would have enjoyed but it's not. The makers may have had a great vision but were clearly way over their heads when it came to execution. Abysmal performance, The only game I have found with worse performance is ""Legends Of Dawn"" and that is saying something. Abysmal presentation. What passes for cut scenes is a joke. Holy cow even 'comic sans' would have been a better font choice. Abysmal UI and camera. If one or the other had been even acceptable it may have made the game somewhat playable. Patch after patch has come and gone and I've waited to see if the game would get sorted. It's mind blowing they would add DLC to game that's practically unplayable. Advice to devs; If you're going to persist with this game. Fix the performance by about 300%. I'm sure you crippled the camera to hide the fact the game frame rate will slide into single digits. If you actually have a graphic artist (which I doubt), fire them using kind words and hire a real one. Have a look a few tactical combat games and find a UI that works and copy that. Alternatively; Apologize to your buyers and shut the game down. I am not a bitter person, I am not going suffer after  losing my money on this game but an apology would be nice.Update: I've been rethinking this review as being overly hash. I get what the dev was trying to do and if it actually worked it would be pretty awesome. I like the idea of it being more a tabletop conversion than remixing the license into a game with it's own mechanics. I sincerely hope the dev can get the UI under control, improve the performance and AI because I would reverse my negative review in a heartbeat.			"

												They shouldn't ought to give this away as a free demo if they want to go on selling it. Five or ten minutes playing the thing is enough for anyone to see how very Not Good it is.Nothing like the trailer, which leads you to believe that it's an action game with big robots. Instead, it's an X-Com style game with ordinary units, and nowhere near as good as X-Com itself. Very clunky, bad graphics, bugs and drop-outs galore. Trust the reviews on this one, or better yet just download the game demo and see for yourself. Once you do, you will not want to give them any of your money...			"

												In a marketplace where strategy and tactics games are making massive comebacks, I would have really expected this one to be damn good. Here's a great license with a ton of lore already written, and the coattails of xcom and banner saga to follow and learn how proper tactics games should be controlled and handled. Instead we receive a poorly executed idea, with nonsensical controls, terrible voice acting, and overall a just bad feeling game. I expected, and WANTED more from this.			"

												People have mixed feelings about this game, understandable. It is buggy, glitchy and some of the systems are downright broken, but does that mean a game as fresh as this should be hated so badly? I sure as hell shouldn't think so. Brand new and green as grass, Warmachine: Tactics is a great RTS game, a turn based strategy set in the wonderful steampunk universe of the Iron Kingdoms, in particular detail, the amazing boardgame WARMACHINE. Whitemoon Dreams have evidently researched their stuff, or they've got a couple of players in their dev team; cos the attention to detail in the characters, scenery and system is fantastic.Warmachine: Tactics has you play as one of the 4 main factions- The imperial Khador- The nation of Cygnar- The divine Protectorate of Menoth- And the nightmare empire of CryxEach with their own skills, attributes and tactics. WT has you re-live the game in digital form unlike any FPS could ever do. Gameplay-wise, it is fun, being turn based, you really need to think about placement and formation. No take-backs and you can easily be steamrolled by simply facing the wrong direction. This promoted challenge makes every game fun, and makes you feel like a boss once you've rick-rolled your opponent. The game brings to life all the aspects of the boardgame; hardass infantry, magically skilled warcaster and most importantly, the 12ft tall, steam-driven (soul-driven if its Cryx) and EXTREMELY p*ssed off mechs we lovingly call warjacks.You create your own loadouts, out of any of the factions, assign it a controlling warcaster, then load it with whatever you want. Want loads of fast infantry? Go speedy! Want slow, but heavy dudes? It'll take weeks to advacne, but the effects will be so worth it. And if you want a list featuring only warjacks? That's the way to go; paint the map with scrap. The game has a great and simple interface system, allowing you to choose movement and combat actions and special abilities (if they have any). Warjacks even have power attacks from the board game too! That means you can push, slam, headbutt and even throw whichever target your warjack is in combat with and doesn't particularly like (which should be every one of the sorry b*stards). Graphics are unreal, I mayself play them on a lower setting so my PC can cope, but it can still run at 25-30fps. being a TB RTS, its kinds your saving grace, if it was like DoWII, you should have bought a new PC before getting this, but wither way, WT uses the Unreal 4 engine, making the game beautiful on my brother's PC.The campaign is...meh. But then again, I haven't seen much of it, so I'll correct myself, its started off meh. Multiplayer is great and fun, and every player is known to be extremely friendly. Speaking of ciommunity, Whitemoon is literally commiting EVERYTHING to this game, meaning weekly patches, confirmed DLC units and armies even months before their release, and hundreds of FAQs answered and bugs treated per day. This game has been slandered as broken, unfinished and a misfire, I consider it more of a developing project, that will in time be absolutely outstanding. I myself have had no problems, so I can count myself lucky, but to all those Tacticians out there, just hold on, the game you deserve will be done soon.Being a Warmachine player on the tabletop, along with my brothers, this game was an absolute steal. Even if you aren't a fan of Warmachine,. but have a love for tough, satisfying turn-based action, then this is for you, this is no-holds barred brutality! This is adrenaline injected metal-on-metal grinding hopped on steroids!This is WARMACHINE: Tactics, the game that kicks so much a*s they had to name it in capitals!(so far) 7/10			"

												I've played this game a few times, and I have a few problems with this game that I think need to be addressed before I'll think about playing it any further.1: Infantry. Those of us who play the actual game know that infantry come in the Unit variety and Solo variety, and that warcasters have spells that are designed for units of infantry such as Arcane Shield or Iron Flesh. In this game though, each infantry model is treated as a solo, which is a huge problem for casters like Stryker1 who depends on Arcane Shield to gain advantage. 2: Clumsy UI. This is an issue that I suppose will be fixed over the course of development because it's a vital and integral part of the game, but it has definitely screwed with me doing exactly what I want to do with my 'jacks and infantry. It hasn't even really been improved over the course of the beta, so I'm not sure what to expect from the final version. 3: Shrouded game mechanics. WM is an easy to understand game on the tabletop with concrete stats and open game mechanics. This game for some reason decides to change the core concepts of the tabletop game into some hazy system of unexplained stats and not quite clear method of RNG. This combined with the change to Infantry (5 damage boxes instead of 1 damage box) brings on a noticable balance change that I'm not on board with because the spells remain largely unchanged from the tabletop version (arguably balanced for that format and not this one). I have no idea why it was decided that the game would change the core mechanics of the game so drastically when they were entirely functional and successful in the tabletop version. Unless the game is changed back to a totally faithful reproduction of the TT version, I'm not coming back to this game because that's what I wanted out of this game. For those of you who aren't TT players, the game might be better for you, but I as a TT player am definitely not on board.			"

												I think there is some misunderstanding about this game, this is not your typical strategy or tactical game. Warmachine Tactics is essentiantially the Tabletop game put into a videogame. I bought this game because I used to be a Warhammer tabletop player and was looking to get into tabletop games again, I heard about Warmachine and Privateer Press. What this game does is essentially introduce you to the world of Warmachine and the playable races. This is absolutey fantastic! Rather than go out and spend hundreds of dollars on models and books and hours of painting models as a new player only to learn that you didnt like the faction you picked this game is a great introductory into the rules, spells, abilities and over all combat doctrine of each race. I see complaints about UI and all sorts of bugs, I got this game, created a unit list, and started playing quickmatch and figured it out in about 5 minutes.  The game is lacking in unit rosters but has enough variability for each race that you can build your battlegroup any way you want to play. It isnt the most emmersive or the most well-toned game but for a digital tabletop this game is fantastic considering it isnt a AAA title.I reccomend this game to anyone interested in either the tabletop or just want to play around with a Stratego on Steroids. Remember Stratego? that game was the♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												[Review based on Demo]So I am an old strategy game player, I grew up on Final Fantasy Tactics (PS1 and on) as well as more modern ones like X-Com (new version).  Ive also played the tabletop version and the Iron Kingdoms RPG.  So how does this game stac kup?  At this point not very well.  Graphics are alright, with Warjacks looking nice and they have the feel of the clanking powerhouses they should.However controlling things is a little frustrating, and I had several instances where units had no line of sight to units directly in front facing.  Camera issues, as mentioned in nearly every review, are a constant issue.  Game preformance chugged once in a while and I had an odd issue where once in a while when selecting units, that their movement grid did not show up, or in one case showed the movement grid of a different unit.  The cutscenes are decently voice acted....but the models are not animated, which is made obvious when the game zooms into their statue-like faces, talking without so much as lip flap.  There is potential here, but this is still early access, even if the label is gone.  For the price, even at 40% off, not worth it based on the demo.  Warhammer 40k Dawn of War or X-Com are far more polished.Maybe after 4-6 months I will revisit this game, or if a more significant sale happens.			"

The controls and camera views are a complete disaster. I could not pass of the third mission, you have to keep rotating the camera to see your units, and change the facing of you unit and bang it consumes your last movements and you do nothing more.I recomend the programmers of this game to take a look at the game mechanics of XCOM and other good turn-based games like Wasteland2.

												First stage review, 27.dec.14.I've had a basic familiarisation with WM:T now. Eight hours is enough to do the tutorial, a couple of missions, and a couple of skirmishes. Initial impressions:Pluses:-Great IP, faithfully rendered.-Simple, but deep-Excellent range of units already in-game-Graphics generally pretty good-Game never feels like it's 'cheating' as it does in games such as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, where you can miss a 100% shotMinuses:-Blurry graphics-Awful dialogue-Hard on GPU's-Terrible dialogue and voice acting-Camera panning is clunky-Dialogue and voice acting in single player campaign is utterly horrible and can't be skipped-No in-combat save system-Dialogue and voice acting are criminally bad, can't be skipped, and will make you want to kill yourself-Additional units as paid-for DLC (although I'd let that slide if they'd fix the voice acting and dialogue)-Doesn't look like you can cripple jacks by damaging components (ie a lucky shot blowing out a Jack cortex)-Lt. Allison Jakes is possible the most annoying character ever... and I've been annoyed by the annoying orange-Multiplayer/skirmish should have a range of points values, not everyone is looking for a 'big' gameNeeds:-Map/module/scenario/campaign editor-Better scripting and voice acting-Camera movement refinement-Serious optimisation of graphics-Better tutorial, covering things like combined ranged attacks and unit facings-Better AI as opposed to simply 'more enemies'-Custom warcasters who gain skills as they level up would be a work of genius-Unit customisation/cosmetics (paint schemes, weapon shapes/sizes, slogans etc) even if pay2paint-Multi-multiplayer (3, 4, 5+ players at a time with a turn time limit)Overall, as a turn-based tactical (TBT) gamer, I'll give this game a 7/10, 8/10 if you're familiar with the IP and the tabletop version. It's a good game, it's just a little clunky. I have every confidence it'll get better.I'm looking forward to the next patch.			"

												The UI is definitely a sticking-point, but that is possibly because representing the thousands of options from the tabletop game in a few buttons must have been a giant challenge.The camera can be awkward to get in position, but that is often because the terrain is in the way. Which in a TT war game its kinda supposed to be, so I can understand that difficulty even if the solution to it is rarther inelegant: Move the camera manually.I would like to see:More single player campaigns for other factions.The ability to save-scum.

												I think too many people are not realizing this is an indie game from a small group of developers. And apparently some people are trying to run the game on a toaster. Tip: your toaster will not run this game. Try a computer.Haven't suffered a single crash to desktop, did once get a freeze, but considering the state my OS is in, that's generally fine :P at least it wasn't a CtD or a blue screen.Gameplay is fun, although some of the scenarios can be kinda brutal. I wouldn't say the AI is smart or dumb, but it's generally competent. Occasionally I saw it miss out on a prime charge opportunity but I think that's a part of the way their priorities are weighted - typically the AI will try and kill your warcaster rabidly and sometimes it can be a little less than defensive if you take advantage of that behaviour.BGM is majestic but unobtrusive. It's appropriate without being distracting. Ingame graphics are decent, so far no animations for cutscenes, which is a shame but I can live without. I generally enjoy the voice acting, occasional incidents of ""nope, try again"" but generally good and excels in some places. Not a game where I would go ""THIS VA IS AMAZING"" but not also one where I'd be like ""CANNOT PLAY BECAUSE OF THE VA"".Occasional problems with the interface. Sometimes I'll attack the wrong thing because it's tricky to line up the target, but not that often, frankly. Still could use a little work. Don't seem to have had a problem with the camera as other people do. But yeah, definitely a game I can recommend for people who don't mind an indie title. I don't play for just the graphics so I'm willing to overlook them for the sake of fun, and I have had fun, that's all she wrote!			"

												Half-baked at best. I'd try back in a few months maybe, or wait for a demo. The game itself might be fun save for the performance issues, UI, camera and controls. But truthfully even then it feels cumbersome and monotonous. Moving my soldiers felt like a chore - and I was happy in later rounds when a lot of them had died off.I think they tried a little too hard to stay a tabletop game, and the result is a game that plays 2-3x slower than it should. (And that game is still months away from being a releasable product IMO).			"

												If you play the tabletop version of this game it is a gigantic slap in the face. The producers of this game swore they were going to stay true to the actual game and I can only see where some of the tabletop elements remained. If you enjoy the tabletop version of this game don't waste your money on the computer version. Even if you are new to warmachine I would advise you to go spend the $50 to get a battlegroup and play the true game over this piece of crap.			"

Downloads took FOREVER.  Hogged a lot of computer space but the worst part was.Function.  UI hated the over head cam display than trying to change the view down to the ground (had to scroll).  Grpahics were all bogged down.  And then I got really bored really fast trying to do the first match or just frustrated with the lag from trying to play.Gave up on it fast.  Last I knew Steam constantly wanted to update this game  I tried for a little bit but than cancelled the DLS.  TOO LONG!  I just wrote off the $60.  Basically a total waste.			"

												I watched the steady stream of negativity that seems to follow this game. I've been an intermediate players of warmachine, and really love the world/theme that the Iron Kingdoms titles have to offer. When the game came on sale, I decided to give it a try (despite the enless pages of negative reviews). I gave myself two days to try the game before writing the review. I really wanted to see how the game took me, and not just offer my initial feelings. So... the pros.Pro's:-(Gameplay) The game is a great computer adaptation to the warmachine franchise. It gives you a real sense of strategy and tactical requirement to play.-(Gameplay) The units are very well modeled and armed after the tabletop. This allows a player who is familiar with the game world to get an immediate feel for how the units are supposed to play.-(Gameplay) Above all else, once you learn the UI, this game is FUN. That's right, FUN to play. This isn't a CoD style action game, but more a kin to UFO style combat. Your decisions and dice rolls will have immediate consequences in your battles.-(Campaign) The landscapes of the game are fantastic. It's crowded and but believably built.-(Campaign) The characters of the campaign are diverse, offering a variety of witty, funny, and serious moments to the game.-(Multiplayer) I really wish the game had co-op featuers. If not for the campaign, perhaps for larger multiplayer matches.-(Multiplayer) I played a single match between kador and cignar. The match was very pitched and until the end, we weren't sure who was going to win.  Ultimately, an assassination run by my charger clinched the victory (combined with a disruption pistol on my opponents dreadnaught).-(Multiplayer) The range of units and unit synergy are fantastic. And they keep releasing new units, which will further change the dynamics of the matches. From disruption bolts, head-butts, and stunning lightning bolts, there's seemingly dozens of combinations to change a dire situation into a chance!Cons-O.K... There are a lot of cons. As I'm sure you've all read. But the one things that I'd like to point out. These Cons can be FIXED. This game feels EARLY, like a beta. Hopefully, the developers will continue to smooth out the engine.-(Gameplay) I really wish that you could CHOOSE the upgrades your units/warcasters get at the end of the mission. It would be a nice way of customizing the hero to your own preferences.-(Camera) The camera is terrible. You frequently find yourself needing to change your angle and rotation to get a good view of whats going on. Sometimes, things are going on that are obscured by terrain when your opponent is moving. I found the arrow keys better for moving around the battlefield than the mouse commands--Objects(Like buildings) can get in the way of your issueing move orders, even if you do not SEE a structure in your way. It's due to poor clipping during object creation. Measure twice, move once. You may need to change your angle before continueing your move.--WHY does the camera rotate around beneath your god-view feet, and not rotate around where your focused? Developers, please fix this...-(UI) The UI is also... horrible. It's takes a while to get used to, and offers little to no explaination as to why things can't happen.--There is no seamless change from your turns movement to out of turn movement (energize or quick work).--There is no explaination to which unit you are currently ""stuck"" on (untill you've ended ALL it's phases/turns). There may be a slight hue to the circle below it, but that's not much to go on.--The UI takes up too much of the game screen. It may have pertinent information (it usually does), but it also impedes the atmosphere of the game.-(Grapics) I realize you saved a ton of money by using still art for the cut-scenes... but really... you think it would kill you to have moving mouths and a believable conversation going on?-(BUGS) The game is very buggy...--Units sometimes graphically face the wrong way.--The game will crash if you complete conversations or objectives in the wrong order (In your very first mission, I crashed my game when I ran to activate Bandit with my warcaster earlier than the game wanted me to (Since I know in game that warcasters can activate jacks). I bypassed the first conversation (about being attacked) by fleeing straight to bandit (where is bandit conversation) and when the first conversation finally happenned, it crashed the game. So please, treat this game like a story, and follow the flow of the game.Conclusion: I'm recommending this game. It's a diamond in the rough. Some very... rough... rough. The problems that exist in the game are superficial and can easily be learned and avoided. The core mechanics of the game are still very fun, and if you're into this style of tabletop emulation, I highly suggest trying it. It's all the better with friends. And please, wait a day or two before writing a review out of anxiety. The UI isn't impossible, it's just not intuitive.			"

												I'm a HUGE fan of the IP - have been following Privateer Press since before the tabletop game when the setting was first introduced, so nothing but anticipation from me when Tactics was announced. I did not jump on the bandwagon during the early release because the price tag seemed a bit high for me when those early reviews weren't very favorable. Same story when the game was released.Finally tried out the free demo. I'm very sad to confirm that everything people have said is true. The game isn't unfun - it's just an unpolished mess that wouldn't be considered finished by most standards. Lack of animated dialogue is a glaring example. Not a deal-breaker, but how can Whitemoon really expect us to pay full price for a game where so many obvious corners have been cut?At half the price, I'd still be very hesitant to buy in because you're only getting a core list of units. We're expected to pay an addition $2-$3 per extra unit type that we want to add? Nice try - give us an entire expansion worth of units for $10, work on the animation issues, and then I might consider purchasing the game... if I can get a good sale price.			"

												Disclaimer: This review is soley based on the Demo Experience, but im convinced that the problems transfer into the full product, as i read some other reviews. I purley judge the product as is, without prior knowledge of the boardgame, from which it seems to originate.After almost 100 hours spent in XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within i was desperate for another squad oriented - turnbased strategy game, and suddenly there was WARMACHINE: Tactics.Within the first two missions, fatal problems with the game become rather obvious, making it a real act of patiens to play the game.The game just suddenly freezes sometimes, it seems like some animations or certain hit-FX are just badly coded and making your PC randomly freeze on certain actions. Which is odd because the game runs perfectly fine else. The motion blur is sickening, but can be disabled.The camera is a absolute mess, on 50% of the actions it clips through walls or buildings, and it randomly jumps between your previous location and the current action of your enemy. Instead the camera should stay on the enemy, if its the enemies turn.Hotkeys for ability seleciton and general UI seem unfinished. As an example: sometimes you can boost the attack (aka chance to hit) or the power (dmg) of a selected skill, sometimes boosting attack does both, but the UI shows a total useless ""power"" button too, instead of having a third kind of button ""attack + power"".Unit selection progress is a mess, and the game doenst communicate basic rulesets to you, for example choosing combined range attacks on normal soldiers will only allow you to move and attack with normal soldiers, until the attack is finally executed. Another example would be out of turn actions. In general you are never sure in which ""phase"" of a turn you are in, or which units actually still have moves/actions left to perform, and why.Another problem, in direct comparision to XCOM:EW, you cant move units while others are still in their movement, even worse, the game forces you to watch a action cam of every unimportant action you take with any unit (third person camera follows basic foot soldier on a simple move command). A game like this should only highlight important actions or at least give you a option for it in the menu, thats pretty much standard. Instead it unnecessarily makes the game slow, and you are often just waiting for your own units to peform ,rather then thinking about what to do.Its a shame that there is so much negative to say about the game as the basic idea is actually pretty good. You can only use your mechs when your hero is in range of them, making it vital where you position your character. Normal food soldiers are uterly useless if not used in the correct way. Further you have to think ahead and decide if you want to do more with your hero or your mechs, as you have to divide focus points between all of them at the beginning of your turn, which are a vital resource for power attacks, spells and boosting chance or damage of your attacks for either of the units.So my final verdict of the game is the following, it has a really good base concept under the hood, but the lackluster UI, the very limited camera, and the forced action cam, as well as unclear mechanics make it to much of a hassle. The game simply feels unpolished and unloved on everything it does. I'ld love to, but i cant recommend it.'nuff said.			"

I have ran into multiple problems where I am not able to activate all my units.  I've also ran into issues after using spells like Energizer that it will actually end the activation of both my warcaster and my warjack without being able to use the rest of my warcasters activation and my warjacks activation (The END TURN button will be red, showing all units have been activated).  It's an interesting spin to the board game, but the functions of the game were not ready for launch.			"

												The game can be buggy and sometimes you will find that a unit will activate and move with a misclick and kind of screws you over. The game can be pretty diffciult and some times objectives arent clear so you can stuff about and have no idea how to move on. I had to walk a couple of friends through one of tyhe early levels as the objective is far off in a corner and isnt marked in anyway except for a stock solider standing there. The story line has some missions that shine but the online community is pretty dead so unless you have firends to play against online/skmirish mode is useless. The AI in skrimish mode is pants and bascially throws the match. I enjoy this game but I would not recommend it to anyone that doesnt play the tabletop game. If you are a fan of the tabletop game be aware that the mechanics are different. Infantry have more hit boxes than the tabletop and can surive attacks that they would in the tabletop game.			"

												Warmachine Tactics is a thrown together mess. If you plan to buy it, wait for it to be on sale. The campaign is hardly worth the effort as it is broken rather than genuinely difficult. The skirmish matches are OK, but the enemy AI leaves much to be desired. Think of this game as a multiplayer only rather than any kind of fulfilling single-player experience.STORY:The campaign is arduous and the difficulty mainly comes from the game being broken rather than genuinely hard. The campaign flip flops on which characters are critical to your success and nothing is more frustrating than seeing ""Keep Jakes, Sarge, Rourke, and your Warjacks alive."" However, several missions throughout the game only have ""Keep Jakes alive."" as your main objective. It gets incredibly frustrating when you have taken the enemy units apart and their one remaining unit runs past all our others to critically strike one your five or more essential characters, causing you to instantly lose the game after you may have put an hour or more into it. Though the campaign claims to sport an ""extensive, story-driven experience""; I felt that it was sloppy and the story is one-dimensional and dull. Your character, Lt. Allison Jakes, proves her worth as she makes the worst tactical decisions possible and costs countless lives of her loyal men as they die for her petty revenge quest and foolish mistakes. Multiple times in the story, she defeats an enemy warcaster who then begs for their life causing her to stay her hand, only so that they can attack her while her men stand idly by. So many of the ""story moments"" in the game involve Lt. Jakes forcing her men to charge into completely avoidable conflicts causing them to die in droves as she celebrates her tactical genius. I hated Jakes by end of the campaign. But worry not all you fanboys, all of the other characters will constantly yammer on and on about how amazing and brilliant she is.PRESENTATION:The game has nice animations and I really enjoyed the look of each unit. However, glitches abound and many times the enemy characters can run straight through walls to attack you when you thought you were safe. During the enemy turn, the camera bugs out like mad, crudely snapping back to an overhead view of your troops before being wrestled away from you to watch an enemy character stroll towards you and snapping back into overhead again. The process can be nauseating and since you will usually be hilariously outnumbered (in the campaign), prepare to watch the sickening camera jolts for a good 3-5 minutes each enemy turn.All who have played Warmachine know the importance of unit facing. If you haven't, then basically you get a higher chance of damage by hitting units in the back; also, you need to actually be facing a unit in order to attack it. Warmachine Tactics seems to think that it knows where your units should be facing better than you do; often crudely spinning your units to face a random direction after a completed movement. This forces you to micro-manage your units' facing after every single move.Sometimes the textures and colors of the terrain completely blot out your unit movement graphics (the little colored halo on the ground that indicates where you want them to move to). This makes viewing countdown timers, movement grids, facing arrows, and many other essential graphical cues, nearly impossible in some levels.The game also feels the need to prevent you from pausing it, ever. You can bring up a pause menu, but the game continues to run in the background. This can be very annoying even though with a turn-based game you don't need to worry about being attacked during your turn.SUMMARY:There is a lot more I could say about this game, but in the interest of brevity I will hold off for now. Just know that for $39.99, you will be getting little better than a late Alpha or early Beta stage game that is riddled with issues. Yes, the units look pretty and there are plenty of different units to choose from (go Stormblades). Unfortunately, this game shames its table-top counterpart by being sloppy and bug infested. I do enjoy playing the Skirmishes and the multiplayer is not bad. If you really love Warmachine, pick this up, but only when it's on sale.			"

												I'll echo what others have said about this one being cumbersome. I won't mention the tiresome and lengthy un-skippable introductions or the overly complex instructions right from the start (forget about being eased into the game). Neither will I talk about the plodding speed and uninspired nature of gameplay that feels like you've seen this done elsewhere (and better). What I will mention is how this game captures the same feeling of walking into a Game's Workshop store as a complete newbie and being put off by the clerk and kids playing in the back who won't look at you twice because you don't know what colour underwear the Necrons use.

												I am a Cygnaran. I play Warmachine table top and I love me some swan lightning. This game however, even having the story mode based around my faction is complete garbage. It pretends to play like the table top game. trying so hard to keep the inches feel with a grid layout. But you know what this game really is? ITS ♥♥♥♥ING XCOM WEARING MY BELOVED WARMACHINES SKIN! The RNG system is so broken it makes a joke of the real game's balanced system. Things that shouldn't miss miss turn after turn and people that should not be able to kill warjacks can crit them into the ground. This game just leaves me with a very bitter taste in my mouth after it lured me in with hopes of being able to play warmachine. Now im waking up on the street in my underpants with a sore bum wonder why? Why did you do this?! You were supposed to be the chosen one! Bring new people in not destroy them!			"

												Of the 30% of players who beat mission 1, only a third of them get as far as beating mission 3. It's just... kinda missing life to it I guess, the mission design as far as I've seen is nothing special, the UI is clunky and bizarrely shrunken, and the mechanics don't have many satisfying gotcha moments to them. A strategy game should stimulate you with feelings that you have done something really clever, or made a totally stupid mistake, but aside from accidentally letting your giant robot get too far away from your character, there wasn't much of those things in the short time I played it before losing interest.

												Warmachines: Tactics is just what I thought it would be. A solid indie game with a lot of heart - and some awkward choices. The UI looks like it was done by the coders who have become so use to its appearance that they have just accepted it. Which is a shame because it is the game’s biggest flaw. However, once you accept it yourself the game is just what I hoped it would be. The game creates an excellent representation of playing a table top game (TTG). I myself was not a Warmachines veteran, but I have played other TTGs. So not being able to judge the mechanics – only the experience it is very successful. Part of how this is done comes from the lack of mechanization a significant amount of what you do is left completely up to you. So if you move a character and he is facing the wrong way and you forget to adjust his direction (there is a button for this) that’s too bad. A HUD will not prompt you or attempt to fix it automatically. Do you see what I mean just like a TTG. This sort of infraction during a traditional game happens and can be exploited.I found the best way to understand the strengths of the various factions was to use the skirmish mode. This is the heart and soul of Warmachines: Tactics after you finish the campaign and is the only repayable portion of the game. There is no option the replay the campaign under a different faction, or other campaigns for other factions. Oh well, I’m sure the developer will offer them as DLC (which is no worse than buying campaigns of physical models) but for some reason the fan boys are crying over this idea. Whatever. I like that they are offering more models, more environments etc. It means they are still involved and looking to grow the idea. Well done fellas.			"

												At a glance this game needs a lot of interface work.-Selecting unit can be hard for sometimes -Your units don't face enemies or even the direction they are moving sometimes-Facing is extremely important which they fail to mention in the tutorial-I didn't really know how many action points i had ( Im sure it was there I just didn't know where to look)-when rotating the camera in the demo mission there are angles which you can't see from which forces you to use a bad angles-When fighting enemies it tells you chance to hit, crit, and range of damage but doesn't tell you the units armor rating (there are units that will take no damage if armor rating is too high... kind of important information)- When abilites like ""sprint"" go off you just have to know what they do and use them after activation there are alot of other abilites so I assume that you would just have to memorize them all (which would happen eventually but at a glance...)From a mechanics perspective It has lots of good elements It would be interesting to see the rest of the game. So I might check out the table top version but if the demo is a reflection of the actual game this thing should still be in beta.			"

I won't mention the tiresome and lengthy un-skippable introductions or the overly complex instructions right from the start (forget about being eased into the game). Neither will I talk about the plodding speed and uninspired nature of gameplay that feels like you've seen this done elsewhere (and better). What I will mention is how this game captures the same feeling of walking into a Game's Workshop store as a complete newbie and being put off by the clerk and kids playing in the back who won't look at you twice because you don't know what colour underwear the Necrons use. It feels quite out of depth for newcomers to the universe (like me) and does nothing to gain your interest.

I have played the new XCom game and this also has dicerolls in it. But at least you can influence somewhat how the dice fall. If you do things right dicefails push you back, but they don't ruin you.

												Even a while after release it still needs major polishing. There isn't a campaign function like that in the core rulebooks which is really dissapointing.  Still fun but a far cry from the table top and likely never to be fully complete. Some of the rule changes make sense for mechanics purposes, some really ruin the magic of some armies.Multiplayer is interesting but suffers from the lack of unit diversity.			"

												I originally had some problems with the graphics for this game as changing them from anything other than the default settings produces a strange blurry effect that distorts everything and produces headaches. Not deterred, I came back to it recently (using those default settings) to discover a very nice little TBS. The graphical style is heavilly influenced by Warhammer and some of the characters will make warcries such as ""for Sigmar!"" which emphasise this effect. Regardless of the sneaky copyright bending WMT has a lot going for it in the gameplay stakes and the way 'focus' points are distributed in controlling your main character and your bots adds an original extra tactical level. It has a decent sized single player campaign with an acceptable storyline as well as a multiplayer option but the skirmish mode is all but useless other than familiarising yourself with new units (of which there are many) due to extremely poor AI. Characters lips do not move in cut scenes which is a little irritating and this, along with the strange issues with the graphics optimisation, shows that WMT is a little rough around the edges. Despite these minor flaws it's a nice game that anyone interested in TBS will likely be pleasantly surprised by if they give it the chance it deserves.*edit* The DLC's are definitely worth picking up for the range of new and heroic units. Unfortunately, unless you have friends to play with you will never really get the use of them since the multiplayer is currently all but empty. It should also be bourne in mind that most of the negative reviews this game has are either from disgruntled fans of the tabletop game or people who have only played this early on before the continuing good work of the devs made massive improvements. A good example being that the graphics are now fully optimised.			"

												Well, I've been playing  this game until the last mission in single player and after everything I've choose to change my recommendation. I still recommend it for the multiplayer, but I believe that is only one part of the game. The single player campaign is terrible. There isn't a difficult level option, and no option to save/load. The AI is stupid. And I have serious doubts if the percentage values of the attacks is correct. Every mission is the same thing, stupid and unclear objectives and waves of enemies. You are in a perpetual disadvantage in comparison with the machine. I'm mean, the disadvantage is unfair, is not like Xcom where the enemies begin with the better position and know the terrain, but you gain better equipment and the soldiers really develop. No, not in warmachine. Here your unities doesn't, your caster improve from the weak warcaster to the regular warcaster. Different of the Xcom, when the enemy have a fixed number of unities, here the machine just doesn't. In certain missions the number of enemies is infinite. The last mission you take damage for the enemies and from some evil machine, and not a low damage. No, is more than 50% of health of your unity! Thats stupid, thats unfair. That's atari level of design!  Even the last  mission of Warcraft 3 and Frozen Throne is not that level of difficulty. Seriously, after xcom that game is a shame! So, there are better games of turn level strategy in steam. Don't buy this game only because the graphics look cool. They are, but the gameplay, eve in the multiplayer, still broken. All the attacks and magic look the same, doesn't matter if it is an electrical attack, or fire attack or ice attack or a shot or a explosion.See, I really like Iron Kingdoms, a have minis, books and all, but that game just doesn't do justice to the scenario.

												As strategy games go, this game still needs a lot of work, in my opinion.  The control interface is clunky and unresponsive, it's too easy to give the wrong command to your units without any way to undo them, actually activating your units gets exponentially more tedious the more units you have under your control, the maps are difficult to read in terms of where you can and can't go, even the distances your units can move becomes impossible to determine on certain maps because of the color schemes, the minimap is almost unusable because of how little information it gives you and how difficult it is to navigate around, mission objectives are revealed to you either very obviously or way too obscurely (there is no middle ground), and for some reason shields seem to be more effective weapons than spears, swords, and guns.All that said, it's a decent adaptation of the miniatures game, but unfortunately the mechanics slow the game down, rather than enhance it.  Smaller games are the most fun, which is really unfortunate given that they keep adding more and more options for you to use, with the end result I imagine being that one would be able to pit sizeable armies against one another.  In my experience, though, I can't even imagihe how slow and tedious activating a large-scale army would be, whether against the PC or, I shudder to imagine, against another opponent.The game has potential, it's just not there yet... and it's already been in development for a long time now... I don't think it's worth the money in its current incarnation.  Maybe... hopefully... they can fix it and soon.			"

												As much as I love my Cygnar, and I love Warmachine, I have to mark this game ""No"" because I can't give it a ""depends""If you want a more tile based version, with a limited selection of units, casters, and solos of the tabletop game.  Then this game is for you. Maybe you don't have acces to a decent gaming community.I kickstarter this game because I was originally under the impress this was going to be something a little different. Maybe a  little Company of Heroes, or Dawn of War 2 mixed with what we got set in the Warmachine Universe.Since I play a very focused  warcaster, (Captain Caine's Sons of the Tempest Tier List) that I can even field within the game I also end up feeling very limited in my options.So, What's all this mean? Keep these things in mind. If you have never played Warmachine, but are interested. This is a decent introduction, gives you an idea of the scope (from the minutae of the individual character dramas to the grand scale of the nation conflicts) If you are fan of Warmachine as a whole, this if a fairly faithful reproduction of the the tabletop experience (and I guarentee you won't have terrain like this on your tabletop unless you are mad ballin') If you a very Caster or faction focused Caveat Emptor. Your options might be very limited or might not exist at all (yet?)			"

												To be honest, I am shocked that this is considered a finished game.  This plays far more like a reasonably far along early access game than anything.  Graphical and sound glitches are everywhere.  Campaign cutscenes are just character models standing *completely* still while the camera pans.  The HUD is atrocious, with no clear way of cycling through troops or immediately telling which troops are still active.  The screen is constantly marked with the version number and framerate, insisting that this isn't even a 1.0 release.  The list continues.If this game was in early access, I would quickly overlook these problems.  After all, the core game is here and it is pretty solid.  But to call this a finished product is ludicrous.  It's too bad, too.  If you are willing to look past this, the core game is worth a few dollars and a few hours of investment.			"

I'm mean, the disadvantage is unfair, is not like Xcom where the enemies begin with the better position and know the terrain, but you gain better equipment and the soldiers really develop. No, not in warmachine. Here your unities doesn't, your caster improve from the weak warcaster to the regular warcaster. Different of the Xcom, when the enemy have a fixed number of unities, here the machine just doesn't. In certain missions the number of enemies is infinite. The last mission you take damage for the enemies and from some evil machine, and not a low damage. No, is more than 50% of health of your unity! Thats stupid, thats unfair. That's atari level of design!  Even the last  mission of Warcraft 3 and Frozen Throne is not that level of difficulty. Seriously, after xcom that game is a shame! So, there are better games of turn level strategy in steam. Don't buy this game only because the graphics look cool. They are, but the gameplay, eve in the multiplayer, still broken. All the attacks and magic look the same, doesn't matter if it is an electrical attack, or fire attack or ice attack or a shot or a explosion.See, I really like Iron Kingdoms, a have minis, books and all, but that game just doesn't do justice to the scenario.

												I hate to post a negative review on what should be a very interesting game -- but after 2.5 hours, I am fed up with the interface.THE GOOD: The premise of the game is great, and the combat system (which I assume is true to the tabletop version) is refreshingly original.  I especially enjoy the ability to combine volleys of ranged attacks, as well as the dynamic of focus allocation.  The units are sufficiently diverse, and it seems to have all of the elements needed to be great.THE BAD: The view/interface is terrible.  An ability to see the battlefield is CRUCIAL for this sort of game, but the zoom feature doesn't allow you to zoom out to a level that would be strategically useful.  You're stuck in tunnel vision.  It sounds like a small thing, I know, but it's integral to gameplay.  It'd be like if an otherwise brilliant shooter only allowed you to play in the third person.  No matter how cool the guns are, the game's a flop.THE UGLY: A handful of annoyingly simple bugs show that not only was this game unforgivably unpolished, but its developers clearly don't care about addressing the issues.

												This Game does NOT play like the tabletop at all, DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A REMAKE OF THE TABLETOP:- They have removed STR and POW and replaced with DMG (same for melee and ranged)- There is a MAG stat (I have no idea what this does, probably same as MAT or RAT for magic)- Infantry (not solos) do not behave as units and instead play like solos (and even have health)- There is a box grid for movement and range checks that allows for full pre-measuring- No damage grid for Warjacks, just health- Warcasters ""Level Up"" apparentley- The base stat values have been changed, e.g. 2 - 5 ARM base- There is no ""dice rolling"" everything is just straight up decided by a % chance, this changes how boosting works as well as removes critical misses (rolling all ones) and perfect hits (rolling all sixes)- Criticals have been changed and now just deal extra damage instead of applying critical effectsI'm sure that there are more problems to be discovered, if you want to see for yourself download the demo. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT'S TERRIBLE. If you like the warmachine universe go and buy a battle box, some glue and paint then go to your nearest wargaming store and have fun there, it will be much more worth your time and effort.			"

												Well, I've been playing  this game until the last mission in single player and after everything I've choose to change my recommendation. I still recommend it for the multiplayer, but I believe that is only one part of the game. The single player campaign is terrible. There isn't a difficult level option, and no option to save/load. The AI is stupid. And I have serious doubts if the percentage values of the attacks is correct. Every mission is the same thing, stupid and unclear objectives and waves of enemies.

												As strategy games go, this game still needs a lot of work, in my opinion.  The control interface is clunky and unresponsive, it's too easy to give the wrong command to your units without any way to undo them, actually activating your units gets exponentially more tedious the more units you have under your control, the maps are difficult to read in terms of where you can and can't go, even the distances your units can move becomes impossible to determine on certain maps because of the color schemes, the minimap is almost unusable because of how little information it gives you and how difficult it is to navigate around, mission objectives are revealed to you either very obviously or way too obscurely (there is no middle ground), and for some reason shields seem to be more effective weapons than spears, swords, and guns.All that said, it's a decent adaptation of the miniatures game, but unfortunately the mechanics slow the game down, rather than enhance it.  Smaller games are the most fun, which is really unfortunate given that they keep adding more and more options for you to use, with the end result I imagine being that one would be able to pit sizeable armies against one another.  In my experience, though, I can't even imagihe how slow and tedious activating a large-scale army would be, whether against the PC or, I shudder to imagine, against another opponent.The game has potential, it's just not there yet... and it's already been in development for a long time now... I don't think it's worth the money in its current incarnation.  Maybe... hopefully... they can fix it and soon.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played a few games and its quite a lot of fun. It captures most of the elements of the tabletop while still having its own unique feel. The amount of warrior health and lack of warjack systems is weird at first but you get used to it. Warriors have a nice dynamic of having useful buff/debuffs while still being fairly weak. The beta is fairly rough, but it is coming along nicely from what i've seen. I've seen a number of community suggestions be implemented, which has improved a lot of the gameplay. The price is high but that is out of fidelity to the kickstarters. It is also an obligated purchase of the deluxe edition which comes with the mercenary faction and Apotheosis casters and jacks. The base game with full campaign and all four full factions will likely be much cheaper. If the current price is too high, I suggest you wait.			"

												I backed this game right away on Kickstarter. I want to like it. But I just can't. As others have said, they had the rules from the tabletop game already so it is puzzling that they just didn't translate them into this version. Instead they have gone with a different system, which while it feels vaguely like the tabletop game just doesn't get it right.  Add that to a clunky UI, poor tutorials, clunky controls (camera and game), and poor AI, and the result is disappointing.I wanted this to be a game I could play Warmachine in with my friends all over the world (you know, the ones I can't play with in person anymore because they live half the world away) and while the models are there, and look amazing, the game isn't. It feels unfinished and not well made at all. A real dissapointment.			"

Now how i see it is why is it getting so many negative reviews. Most of the Negative reviews are coming from people that kickstarted it or who played the Tabletop version of this game. So there opinions are Biased and they was probably hoping for something greater. In other words they are fan boys that are upset that the game creators didnt deliver more of this world. Which i totally understand im a huge fan of Warhammer 40K and there are more than enough times where i was excited for another Warhammer 40K game and it didnt turn out to be what i wanted it to be. BUT that is no reason for me to slander a game for wanting more i should be glad that i got a game in the first place.			"

												Ok. So lets be honest. There's a big ol tide of people that say 'DON'T GET THIS GAME!! RAAAAARGH' and I can understand why, they got it on early access and forgot the fact that its not finished and its a work in progress.. There's also a number of people out there that, like me, play the miniatures game.. and they don't like it because its not the computer form of the miniature game. And there are probably the small minority of people that got it later, dont play the miniature game, but dont like something about the way it works or something..Now while all these points are totally understandable, and in some cases, correct.. I like it. I kept in mind its not the finished, polished end product.. that its not a direct pc copy of the miniature game and that there had to be limits to what it could do. because well.. lets face it the miniature game has an infinite number of possibilities in how its played.. The campaign is pretty cool.. I'm not a Cygnar player, I dont know loads about them.. but I'm enjoying it. It's a little clunky at times.. there are levels in white snow where your direction and movement markers are in white.. so its kinda guess the movement.. but largely the game is fun and its well thought out.. I had a go with Cryx on skirmish mode the other day and that was pretty cool too.. I'm looking forward to my first multiplayer game soon. I would recommend this game to any one that wants a turn based steam punk ish strategy game and is happy to know that its not 100% perfect, but its close enough that it'll keep you entertained for some time.. Don't buy this if you want an exact copy of the tabletop experience, you'll never get the same from a pc game as you would looking across the table at a friend/nemesis. :)			"

												This is one of those games that are obviously indie in all the wrong ways - the lack of experience, budget and skill is clear in everything from the numerous bugs to the non-sensical design decisions (why make three versions of the same spell, with different cost, instead of allowing players to set it manually?) to the parts that just feel shoddy and unfinished, like the infamous camera.I love the tabletop game and I was very excited about a computer version. Sadly, the only thing that really makes it worth playing is the single player storyline, which is decent, and the atmosphere. The game mechanics have been redone to the point where it's a completely different game system - so different that my interest in the multiplayer is quickly dying. It's not a game for WM/H gamers, it's a generic computer game based on Privateer Press IP, and it's not a very good one.For people who aren't into the tabletop game, there is little point in buying this. I enjoy it mostly because of my love for the setting, I doubt I'd have played more than a few missions otherwise. The camera is annoying and takes a lot of work, the interface is clunky and inelegant, the game is riddled with bugs (including crash-bugs and bugs that allow both the player and the computer to do things like walking through walls), there are still minor problems that should have been gone long before launch (like the colour of various important lines and markers being too light to see on snow, or disappearing under landscape features), the default settings for sound and graphics are way off (I had to reduce the music volume to 2/10 to hear voices), you can't skip cut-scenes (adding to the irritation when you have to restart a mission - there is no option for saving during missions)... the list goes on forever.In short, this game had a lot of potential, but it is so far away from being what it could that no amount of patching can fix it. I regret buying it at full price, and would caution others against doing the same.			"

												As someone who plays the tabletop game and tactical strategy games in general, this is aweful.  From a strategy game perspective the controls are horrid in every respect(camera, unit control, etc), fps rarely goes above 40 even on the lowest setting, randomly chugs when the computer does anything, and the story mode has no real hub or mission select that I can tell, it just starts and goes from one mission to the next with no down time.  As for its relation to the tabletop, it's complete crap.   They had an entire game system laid out for them, quite literally all they had to do was make a dice rolling program and movement controls, but no they decided to go from scratch and just borrow the name of stats rather than using the tried and balance numbers given by the game.  ""Units"" are broken into solos that take far too much to kill and do far too much damage to a 'jack to be reasonable(the point of casters is to feel like a badass who controls mechs that can stomp people to dust, but apparently these are just paper mache replicas of those mechs).Other little things that annoy me are the volume levels in the game(I had to turn the music down to 2 just to hear any people over it) and the lazyness in the 'cutscenes', they didn't even animate any of them, they didn't animate the mouths moving or even just a simple walk animation.  The quality of the game compared to how much money they got from the kickstarter for it is just appalling.  I would advise any sane person to stay away from this and just get vassal if you wanted to play warmachine online or Xcom if you need that strategy fix.			"

												The Iron Kingdoms are a great intellectual property to build a game from, and WARMACHINE: Tactics is a reasonably faithful interpretation of the Warmachine and Hordes ruleset. It's hard to transition a good tabletop game into a good video game, but Whitemoon Dreams and Privateer Press have managed to make it work.What they haven't managed, unfortunately, is to make the game run. Even at minimum settings, my framerate has been absolutely awful, the action is choppy at best, and textures don't load until halfway through a given scene. The controls suffer, too, from the close resemblance to XCOM's grid-based movement, and more than once I found myself moving a unit into harm's way simply because I clicked what I thought was a safe square but was actually somewhere else.The game is still not to release quality, and I'm heartened by the fact that WMD and PP recognize this. I'm excited to see what improvements and additions they make to this game which has so much potential.			"

												I like the graphics and the animations and it does an adequate job of representing the table top game on the computer, although some of the rule changes from TT to computer feel awkward and confusing.  The real reason I cannot recommend this game is the AI.  It is absolutely atrocious in the skirmish mode, and pretty weak in the campaign.  It is a waste of time to play against the computer in skirmish mode as it constantly makes ridiculous moves that make the game a pushover.  Those of you who have played tabletop will understand what I mean with a simple example: in a recent skirmish game, the computer ran Severius (a squishy backline caster) up to be adjacent with my warcaster, who happened to be the Butcher (actually Butcher3 from the minis game minus his argii/arguses).  Didn't attack or anything else.  Just ran him up base-to-base with what may be the deadliest warcaster in the game.  Another example (and even those who haven't played tabletop will understand this): Cygnar Gunmages.  They have the word ""GUN"" in the name of the unit.  So what do they seem to do most of the time in the game?  Charge into melee.I've played to mission four or five in the campaign and maybe it shines there, but I doubt it.  I also have my doubts about DLC.  It didn't affect my recommendation, but I feel like this game is very expandable.  However, they're going to nickle-and-dime it, most likely.			"

												biggest let down no Retribution of Scyrah.... one of the most fun factions and its not there.............. Besides that fun game but more unit options and warcasters need to be added way to limited in units. For 40dollars with the animation in the campaign talk and the limited unit options and not having that 5th faction at the momeny i would not recommend the game.  "

												I have played the desktop figure-game and am familiar with the figures and the gameplay. But I am disappointed. There have been to many yells of dismay as the game did something wired, like took a path to close to an enemy and provoked attacked of opportunity and ended up looking the wrong direction.Then there is the difficulty: With many errors due to control and visibility (and my own stupidity), I still manage to win the battle.I am uninstalling.

												Just plain BAD. I really wanted this game to be awsome as Im a big warmachine fan but its not. I paid $65 for early access to this game and In its current state I wouldnt even play it if it was free. I have owned the game for 4 months now and have a grand total of 4 hours game time.......I just cant stand playing it. Its slow and clunky and the story sucks.....there is nothing good about this game.			"

												I really thought I would like this, I was one of the original kickstarter backers.  But honestly it's just...not great.  I'll try not to  repeat what everybody else has saying (and yes, the other complaints here are pretty valid), but I will say a few things: - It is just soooo buggy.  I checked in every couple months to see if there had been any improvement, and I still can't through the first mission without something breaking (I got to the second mission...once).  My hardware is well above the minimum specs. - The story seems pretty bad (though that is based only only being able to play the first two missions).  These games aren't known for story...but I wish they had just not done it at all and spent more time fixing the bugs.  Who needs to sit through another utterly derivative ""those red guys with the flame motif are advancing, THIS MEANS WAR.""  There are just so many other great games out there...this might have been worth it for some people once upon a time, but not now.			"

												Sadly the game is still a technical mess with blurry textures and just wacky massively glowing borderlines (which were fine in the tutorial mission). From lowest to highest settings the game still looks broke and bad, even after full reinstalls twice over the last few months, each time hoping something has changed/improved.Combat is downright silly and uninspired. Having to transfer focus each round to your telepathically controlled robots or boosting your attacks im sure sounded fine on paper, but in practice it doesnt seem right or even entertaining. I think the devs need to play some Valkyria Chronicles to see what proper turn based strategy looks like.			"

												31/03/2015I am a tabletop player, I have more than 2,000$ worth of model from Warmachine. I love the tabletop game, I was more than excited to get a PC version of the game.What I got is a boring, ugly and alien game.The UI is so disgustingly designed(improved a little), it hurt your eyes. They made rule changes from the tabletop game that made units and some spell completely foreign to the game, single hit point unit now are solos with lots of HP...damnit all. Warjack without system is stupid.No one is playing (almost) except from the devs who sometime decide to play themselve. The AI doesn't nothing more than rush at you then lose.Single player is boring, the dialog are meaningless and poorly done. With all the vast lore from Warmachine, I don't get it why they had to go with this unstructure and blant campaign story.Avoid buying, even on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								This is not in any way a full review. Simply my early impressions with all the usual caveats. I will not be commenting on the EA price controversy here, enough has been said already. So far, really liking it. Played the single player tutorial mission, and 3 multiplayer matches. I lost the first 2 and won the 3rd. Each battle was exciting, involved and at times very intense. The last battle, in which I was The Protectorate of Menoth and my opponent was Khador, was really a lot of fun. It took a long time to resolve, as both of us were playing smart. Victory tasted sweeter for being hard fought and hard won. When you start to understand the synergies of your units the gameplay feels very satisfying; you feel like you have to earn victory against a competent opponent. It is also easy to see that there is plenty of depth to be had here, once you start to absorb the subtlties.There were a few minor issues, but nothing game-breaking and no crashes or disconnects. Everything looks good and works well.Looking forward to many fun and exciting battles to come. "

Early Access Review
								Positives first. Graphics are OK. However I don't reccomend this game at early access. There is extremely limited functionality at this stage, it's hard to even call it a beta. The gameplay is clunky, Even for a turn based game. It is difficult to figure out when you can and can't fire for example. Also there is virtually no-one who is playing multiplayer which means all you get is 1 small level. Hopefully the full version makes up for this and people get onboard for multiplayer. If the gameplay is tweaked a little, you can play the campaign and you get to select your own units the full version could be worth buying when it becomes available. The timeline indicated seems a little unbeleivable considering where the game is at now. "

Early Access Review
								Stay away from this game in its current state!!The camera controls are bad and unit selection-by-clicking is atrocious.The UI forces waaaay to many redundant clicks and comes across as needlessly slow. The UI is also counter-intuitive and leaves you frustrated from the very start of the mission. Just moving a unit can be an ackward affair as you struggle with tile-selection.The first mission was very boring and ended in a stupid fight with a Warjack that had 5 armour - Needed a critical hit to damage it. It had 27 hp and I was only hitting for 1 or 2 hp, which meant I had to hit it around 45 times! To add insult to injury the game crashed upon first completion meaning I had to restart the mission.Finally you cannot turn off the background music without turning all the sound off! That's just clowning!If I knew it would do me any good... I would ask for a refund.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a review of the early access version. That being said, I suspect that the Steam price of $65 is highly inflated and not at all worth the price of admission from what I have experienced so far. Assuming that everything is released, even with improvements, there will invariably be comparisons made between this game and other strategy games: Starcraft II being the most likely. If I were to compare Warmachine Tactics to Starcraft II at the price point at time of release, Starcraft II wins.The performance of this game on my PC is fairly poor. While my PC is not a high end gaming machine, it beats the low end minimum specs while failing shy of the recommended specs. I have to play at the lowest resolution (1280x720) and low graphic settings to get 18 FPS. Compared to other strategy games, where I can get 30+ FPS, I'm a little troubled. Starcraft is real-time; Warmachine is turn-based. My performance is currently halved and that's at minimum quality. The UI is cluttered, though that isn't aided by playing at the lowest resolution the game allows. Which begs the question: how can an older RTS like Starcraft II perform so much better than a modern turn-based game? Were new DX features implemented because it was new and shiny?All in all, as a (disappointed) backer, I get the game for $20.  Had I waited for release, I would pass on this title at full price, even when completed, because there are games out there with a lower cost of entry. There are _free_ games out there that perform better than the currently available game.""That’s what we want you to experience in WARMACHINE: Tactics, the turn-based tactics game that, with your help, will bring the award-winning WARMACHINE miniatures game from the tabletop to your desktop PC or Mac.""

												Overall impression: released a little early, worked on and improved, currently good. When I found the first trailers and teasers for this game, I was very eager to play it. Having been playing Warmachine for years, it looked like a good adapatation using the rich and detailed setting. As an advance graphically on previous games I've played, I did purchase some hardware upgrades, which had been overdue anyway. I'm afraid I did not back the kickstarter, as it really didn't look like I was needed. Nonetheless, I kept an eye on the development logs and awaited it coming into open beta. I purchased it when the price dropped from the deluxe £60 to the standard £20, as I really didn't need or want the extra shinies offered.What I got in beta was a game that was very much in beta. The multi-player game worked with a few bugs, but it did seem to roll along.  There was a certain scarcity of players, as several backers I'd talked to offline said they'd be waiting for it to be finished, while others were scared off by reviewers with higher standards than myself. I played the multiplayer games on and off for months, reporting the occasional bugs and making new friends. When the first (of four?) single-player campaigns came out I was pleased, although the decision to then declare the game released was a little surprising. There were still a few bugs, which cropped up as I played through the campaign. Given the lack of an in-level save function (and a new baby at home) my progress was slow, but I encountered 3 crash-causing bugs in 20 missions, the first two of which were down to performance issues on my PC, and the last was swiftly fixed by a patch. For a game still in development, I am happy with this ratio. After many hours of play, and reading the forums for this game, I think that White Moon Dreams has built this as a labour of love. It was a little premature onto beta, and again onto release, but it's now running smoothly, and WMD continue to work on it, add features, and interact with their players.If you'd asked me when I puchased this game, I'd have said ""wait a few months"". A few months later, and I would reccomend this as an interesting and characterful game, with a lot of playability. For the standard price, I have already got my money's worth (in hours of entertainment) from this game and look forwards to the extra (and free) campaigns to come. The multiplayer side of things is also getting new content, bigger maps, etc, for those who focus on that. I look forwards to seeing where this game goes next! "

												I love the tabletop game and setting, and while the game does a decent job bringing the setting to the game, all of the ""game"" elements drag it down and make the game incredibly frustrating to play. I have had to force myself to try to play this game because I keep wanting to give it a chance.The interface in this game is one of the worst I have ever seen, with a non-functional camera that is incredibly clunky and difficult to control. The camera is so bad and frustrating that it has caused me to rage quit the game several times. I can only take so much of the stupid camera clipping into terain/walls/etc. Also, whoever did the programming for movement indicators on tiles really messed up with how they show up in snow. In the 4th mission (escape from the train) I cannot even see the movement markers against the snow terrain because the colors are so oversaturated.Also, unit movement is really a pain to manage, and I am constantly making unintential moves. For whatever reason, the game also seems to redraw the scene everytime it moves across the map to show different sections. This results in huge fps drops and freezes every time a new unit moves. Major pain to watch. I have very good system specs, so I know it is not the issue, looks like just bad coding. Honestly have no idea why they decided to make this thing in Unreal...if it was simpler it would probably be a lot more playable. Cutscenes so far are all still images and not animated...feels very cheap and unfinished.Compared to other tactics type games, this one is pretty bad and definitely feels like it was done by amateurs, especially when compared to games like xcom. I want to love this game, but it really needs a lot of help and definitely is still in an alpha/beta stage.			"

												First: I heartily recommend this game for fans of tabletop wargaming and tactical wargames. Take note though, if you are into fast paced action this game will not be for you.Warmachine: Tactics a a very accurate PC conversion of the tabletop wargame Warmachine. If you know and love the tabletop game, you'll love the PC version as well. Any tabletop wargamer will instanly feel at home though. The game takes place on a fairly small map where you depploy, move and fight with your Warcaster (general), Warjacks (mechs) and Infantry.  The game feels well balanced at the moment. The single player campaign is reasonably fun but more importantly sets you up well for the multiplayer part of the game. That is where the true heart is for Warmachine, facing other players. That's also the only real downside. Since the game is turn-based you are dependant on how fast, or slow, your opponent plays. Be prepared to stare at your screen for minutes while your opponent does nothing. On the positive side though, Warmachine is an enjoyable game. Terrain and use of skills is critical an conveys the feel of a true tabletop game. The game looks nice and runs quite well. The UI isn't very pretty but does an adequate job considering the fairly large amount of options each skill and sub-skill has. It prevents the need for cumbersome menus. It also feels pretty inituitive to me.All in all you cannot get closer to tabletop gaming than this. The game isn't for everyone but if you enjoy this sort of thing you can't go wrong with Warmachine.			"

												When I saw this game released I was so very excited, I love wargames but I don't have a venue nearby to play, the massive income required to keep up nor the prerequisite skills and time to paint tiny plastic men. I really enjoyed the first dawn of war game and the second was... Fine i guess, but I had really gotten into the Iron Kingdoms, so this was it, my chance to play some Warmachine. The first issue arose immediately, the price, a kickstarter game should not be so ridiculously expensive, but that was OK, I'd just wait for a steam sale like I usually do and play some of the demo while I waited. The second issue peaked it's ugly head above water while playing the demo, the gameplay was an entire city constructed primarily of klunk and the unit selection was puny, but it was only a free demo so I just (incorrectly) assumed that there was a veritable cornucopia of content just behind the locked door, what a fool I was. Even with access to the full game the unit selection was pitiful and the klunk city limits stretched into the horizon, but maybe patches will fix it, thought I, which is where the third issue burst forth from the ground like some horrible cyclopean beast, the same beast which has strangled so many potentially great titles in their cribs, I speak of course of DLC. As other reviewers have no doubt mentioned the DLC is overpriced, even with the newly announced ""price cut"" each clocks in at $10 and while this may not be as egregious for the Mercs or Retribution bundles (it still is) the Warcaster and Jack bundles are simply ludicrous, 4 units for $10? I would rather not sell my home, but thank you for the kind offer.So the question still remains, is it good? Is it worth my hard earned dollars/pounds/euro/whatever? The answer, in my opinion is an emphatic but remorseful no. If this game wants to be anything other than a floundering, half funtional cash grab it needs a lot of work, the klunkiness needs to be reduced considerably, the factions need to be expanded and the DLC needs to be added as regular content available upon purchase and expanded as well. If they do enact these changes I truely believe we will have a game which both promotes its source material and allows enthusiasts without an outlet (such as myself) to experiance the world of the Iron Kingdoms. Until then keep an eye on the reviews, you never know, the creators may decide that they don't need to bleed their creation for every cent and give us the game we crave and deserve.			"

												So far I see very little reason to be angry at this game. It does have some memory leaks which cause lower frame rates and has a very high demand on your graphics card but over all low glitching, highly customizable and over all a great translation from table top to PC. I will reevaulate it after I spend some more time with it.			"

												I enjoy the tabletop game immensely and I've been following the development of Tactics for a while now and finally decided to give it a try through the demo they have available.The voice overs are hit-or-miss (Good for Cygnar and Cryx, awful for Khador), the UI is absolutely miserable, the camera is simplistic, and the animations can be a little wonky, but I'm enjoying the crap out of this game. While it has the polish of a half-baked Early Access title, the raw gameplay of Warmachine Tactics is downright fun, and the animations and voice acting are just good enough to enhance it. It is a fantastic adaption of the tabletop game as far as the gameplay itself goes and while I was at first turned off by the lack of polish and sloppy UI, I keep coming back to play just one more match. I can't recommend it at full price and I'm not sure if I'll purchase it myself at its current sale of $20, but if they fix the UI and add the action cam as promised I would certainly change my mind. In the meantime I'll just wait until next year for it to go on sale at the $10 mark.			"

												I want to love this game. I already play Warmachine, so I was excited to be able to play an electronic version of it, so I have options when I can't play with others. But sadly, I can't recommend this right now. On the Mac version, the framerate is so low, even with lowest graphical settings, and lowest resolution, that it is unplayable. 15 fps, not even consistently is pretty bad. It freezes often, especially if you rotate the view and it clips into a terrain wall. I'm frequently waiting for it to return control to me. This is especially frustrating when it tends to lag and skip graphically, and you find the view takes off out of your control, and then your stuck waiting for it to catch up. The developer has admitted that they have not optimised as well for the Mac, and this is pretty apparent. I have a high end machine, with 20Gb of RAM in it, and have no problems running other games full screen, with all the bells and whistles turned on. I'm hugely disappointed. I just hope they will be able to fix this, hopefully not too far in the future. Don't worry about adding more features, get the basics right first please! Till then, avoid.			"

												I love Hordes and Warmachine. I played like tons of matches and it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. This game tho. Oh god. It's ridicolous they published it this way. It's the opposite of polished. This game will have 15 fps even on a ♥♥♥♥ing gtx980. It's unplayable. And that's not the worst part.The UI IS THE MOST AWFUL THING I EVER SAW. Every thing not in the game scene is ♥♥♥♥ing ridicolous and horrible. Camera controls are freaking awful and you will misclick every time. Whining: And this game is so stupid that you will lose a mission one hour long cause you clicked to move a unit but you couldn't see where you clicked cause the ♥♥♥♥ing interface is UNDER the snow textures and suddenly you clicked on a wall where there was the ui visible but you cant click there so the unit go the other direction, dies and you lose the stupid mission.Short version: Gameplay is good but you can't play the game so don't spend your money cause whitemoon are a bunch of noobs at their first game.

								I know, its an ealy access Game, but to take Money for that game, in that state, is just an insolence!!!!I have tested some games in Beta and alpha, that where all free for the Testers, an did a lot better Performance. This i would say is barely a bad alpha version. There are so many things i think that need to be improved from the controls to the grapic. Spending Money for that game now is a waste. I know and have played the Tabletop to the game, it seems to be similar, but at the moment i would disargee that ist has the same Fun Factor or Quality. So dont buy it know!!!! May be if there is a good playable Version but definitely not now!!!!			"

If you dislike unfinished products then stay away from the game for now, otherwise you will just hate it and never give it the chance it deserves when its ready.			"

Early Access Review
								The game's current state in beta is better than alpha and may have a high price tag atm but with getting 20 units free and being the equivalant price to Beta access backers might be beneficial later. As it stands would like it to show a list of players waiting on game instead of having to find a host in multiplayer. Follows the rules for the most part to the miniatures game and thanks to it learned some rules real life players have been nerfing. The Focus allocation at the beginning of each turn is better now also than it was before as well just wish it had a chat window but personally could make games take longer.Long story short as stands limited but updated regularly. High priced to match Beta level backers of the Kickstarter but at least Early Access buyers can get 20 units free. Some graphics are buggy but I've seen worse in betas and some rules nitpickings but that's betas. As it stands content and can't wait for the actual release.It's not on here to give them more money only but if you want beta access with some freebies then by all means otherwise they announced a base game will release at launch so no need to worry too much now. With being backed on Kickstarter and a parent miniatures company of over ten years will be glad to see it finished in a month.			"

												Wow, just wow. I certainly wasn't ready for this.The only thing going through my mind after the first 5 minutes is how somebody could have made this... ""game""(???) after a positive and pretty well-presented kickstarter. It is like two separate entities altogether. To put it mildly, what we have right now is a tech demo. - uninspiring voice acting (no facial animations whatsoever in 2014)- looks ugly at maximized settings, makes you wonder where some of the screenshots were pulled from- horrendous design, both UI and subtitles (god, THAT FONT)- awful camera controlsAnd to top it off the ""game"" crashed 5 minutes in (yes, I didn't get an opportunity to quit it by myself).There is absolutely no doubt regarding its quality control and playtesting. In the end, serves people right for kickstarting these uncontrolled monstrosities.			"

								Terrible. A complete departure from the Tabletop game, which wouldn't have been awful it had been done well. Turns are slow, very slow, it's not unlikely to be waiting 15 minutes for an opponent to take their turn. The 5 star stat ranking system is an awful idea, it makes no sense and gives no real indication of the ability of a unit. Basic units, Winterguard, etc, have up to 12 hit boxes which serves only to slow the game to a crawl. Two Jacks are manditory in every army. There's a cap of 16 models per army. UI is clunky, unintuitive and ugly. This is just a bad game and a real shame because it could have easily been a great one. Perhaps if they'd adhered a little bit more to the source?			"

								I give this recommendation with an enormous caveat: DO NOT BUY if you are expecting anything close to a complete game. The current build is barely playable, and I personally can't stomach more than one or two matches of it at a time. That being said, I still recommend that people pick this game up if they want to support the final product. I love the tabletop game. I think that the final product will live up to my expectations when it comes to capturing the spirit of the tabletop game. That is why I paid $65 for an incomplete product: because I have faith that the final product will be worth it. If you aren't really excited about the game being built, and want instant gratification, please save yourself a lot of pain and don't buy this game. Hell, don't buy ANY early access game. They're works in progress, and if you don't understand that when you buy then I have no sympathy for you.			"

								If you payed for kickstarter then you really shouldn't be giving this a negative review just for price point... you know what's going into this game and what has already been implemented.  People are claiming this game will fail just for a price point?  This is silly, it will do well if the game rocks and suck if the game sucks.  X-Com is expensive with the dlc but a great game, so why should this be any different?  Why must everyone want everything for free almost?It has fleshed out mechanics that are constantly being fixed or smoothed out, the company is very vocal in the comunity and is working around the clock on this.  I find that heartening because this makes for a great game.The game seems slow to those not used to the tabletop but those who have played its tabletop cousin know this can be a slower game however it gives great satisfaction.  The movement can be tricky at first but after a few games or playing the campain you'll get used to it.  If your uncomfortable with the price don't worry it will go down but i don't see what your getting with it as all that bad, its a collectors edition after all.Give this game a chance, it's very rewarding and give it honest reviews not just about price.

Many of the rules were shifted to enhance online play, even though they could have just been essentially a fancier VASSAL and keep everything the same.However, I am a huge Warmachine fanboy so this isn't enough to keep me from playing it. The developer obviously had a lot of respect for the source material; the models are lovingly recreated and the animations are fantastic.If you've never played Warmachine before, it's well worth a purchase if you enjoy turn based strategy. If you HAVE played Warmachine, this review probably won't help change your mind.			"

Early Access Review
								Warmachine Tactics looks to be a potential great turn-based strategy game...if done correctly. The game is still in beta and is looking to be released in a month's time.My gaming rig has a Intel i7 3770 @ 3.4Ghz, 16GB DDR3 1333MHz Kingston Value RAM, Gigabyte GTX660Ti 2GB, runs off a 1TB HDD 7200RPM. (I am getting a EVGA GTX780 very shortly so I'll edit for the difference in frames per second.)Pricing: I'm not a Kickstarter Backer. When Warmachine Tactics was released on Steam for Early Access, I brought it immediately, didn't really care about the price. I had read what the game currently has for content. For a Digital Deluxe Edition, £49.99 is a decent price point for what players will be eventually getting when it's fully complete. I've paid more for other games but they were complete games, all content was there except for the future DLC with Season Passes. I didn't do any tutorials or play the Multiplayer yet, I wanted to see what the game could potential offer.Game Performance: Moving onto the actual game itself, I pumped the settings up to max as high as they could go and played the Single-player scenario. The game was soild, running around 25-40fps @ 1920x1080 @60Hz, this is still beta and is subject to change until the release date for further optimization as well as future improvements. It played very nicely, no crashes or errors while playing the scenario. A bug with the units running through market food stands at the beginning of the level but that can be sorted out.Visuals: The game looks very nicely crafted, the game models are very accurate to their original tabletop models and can individually pick out what warcaster or unit is. The map for the single-player scenario is beautifully created and solid representation of the Warmachine world, with the weathering effects are good so far, something you'd expect for the winter feel.Interface: The UI is decent but large on a 1920x1080 though boarders and such aren't polished so they don't fit the role. I hope they are refined later on.Sounds: As you'd expect, the sound effects for melee and range thus far a good. Background music is fitting.Disclaminer. Just a reminder I've only played the Single Player scenario, that's all.So the important question, is Warmachine Tactics worth it. Personal opinion, with the price now at £37.97 (£49.99 previous price) with the current content and now with an update (have yet to play), it feels a little more worth it but I'd rather wait till all the content for the Digital Deluxe there. So I'll say I do recommend the game but with a 'Buyer Beware' caution solely on the content to price ratio.---- ---- ----Side Note:After tweeting and posting a message on Facebook. I really would like to know why the price changed since I did buy it for £49.99 from the developers and those who brought it for the higher price. Is there a possible chance of getting the difference refunded to the Steam Wallet?			"

												Slow paced, but very close to the table top system. If you are a fan of the Table top game and have the time to invest in a 30-45min battle pick it up. I have quite enjoyed it as a time killer. The Solo story mode is good enough it kept me playing as well.HUGE DOWNSIDEThe Game constantly feels unfinished. It looks like they just gave up towards the end and put it out with out a final polish. not to mention the games AI is dull, and the skirmish mode is mostly pointless with no custom option.Despite that I recommend it for fans of the TT Game for the multiplayer. Get it on sale. Don't play full price for 80% of a game.			"

												I don't generally write reviews based on only brief play-through, however this game deserves an exception.When a person armed with an axe, does 8 points of damage (not even critical hit) to a metal warmachine and the said warmachine crashes an ugly looking huge hammer on the attackers head and does an apocalyptical 2 points of damage....Add to that poor controls and camera, add to that X-Com and Mordheim in your games library... well conclusion is obvious, not worth a buying, if bought, delete to save some disk space.

								This game is for sure a recommended game for anyone that plays either the TT games from Privateer Press or anyone that enjoys tactical games like X-Com.  While the game has bugs (this is beta after all) WhiteMoon Dream has always been very transparent about what is going on with the game.  Player issues are addressed, bugs are taken care of, and input is welcomed.  The game looks great and even with the current issue of low frames, its not choppy enough to be a deal breaker.  AI for the missions seem a little to hard scripted (very limited awareness) but we have only been give access to one mission and its the second mission of the campaign and I feel they are going easy on us.  The heart of this game is around the Multi-player mode.  Playing against real players with a diverse set of units and skills lends itself to making each MP game unique.  Replay will be very high even before all the DLC comes out in the months to years following(for those don't know the TT Warmachine has MANY MANY times the units currently planed for release).A review for the game would not be complete without a comment or two about the current price of the game.  At $65 many people complain that its too much.  WMD has addressed its reasoning for the price and will not be changing it till after the game it out of Early Access.  The only important question left then about the price is this, is there VALUE of the game.  The short answer is Yes! How do i justify it beyond my above comments? Three little words...""Collectors Edition Release"".  Many of us, myself included, have and do pay far more then $65 to pre-order collectors editions that don't have half the DLC that is being offered here.  Stop trying to look at this as a pay to play Beta and start looking at it like a Collectors Edition that happens to offer Beta access.  So if you are not a Collectors Edition buy just kick back and wait till normal release or a steam sale in any case it will be money well spent.			"

												It seems to me like the game is trying too hard to be both faithful to the tabletop and different at the same time, so that no one is happy. They should have gone entirely one way or the other. As it stands now, we have an unfinished and very cumbersome game that did not deliver on a vast number of the promises made. I am a HUGE fan of Privateer Press and Warmachine/Hordes, but the more of this game I experience, the more I regret kickstarting it. I really wanted to love this game, but I'm just left disappointed.

												Update as of 8/22/2015:I have never had fun playing this game.Just played a game with a friend.  let's forget the idiotic game mechanics.  The game, after nearly a full year OUT OF BETA, is still full of bugs.  Focus allocated to my jacks just dissapears.  Activations just end on their own.  Performance is still as good as slow mollasses.  Please do yourself a favor, if you want to spend money on this, burn it instead.  The small pleasure you will get from watching the flames has more value.Performance is not optimized.  Gameplay is horribly unbalanced, graphics are a pile of dogshit, fps runs between 4-15fps.  abilities don't make sense, or have been changed but don't openly tell you how.  Promises were made when this was on kickstarter which were total lies.  Do not bother buying this game, if you want a tactical game, get blood bowl, or xcom.  Not this pile of garbage.			"

								This game is obviously in beta.  If you're not comfortable with actual testing of the game and interacting with the developers to try identifying bugs and helping with ironing out any kinks, then just wait for the full release.The $65 price tag is for the base game, plus a ""season pass"" of sorts for Mercenary units that are planned for later release, as well as the Apotheosis 'casters and 'jacks.  If you don't want to pay that much, wait for the full release, and don't get the mercs or Apotheosis units.All that being said, the game does show a lot of promise in it's current stage.  I feel some balance tweaking is needed, particularly in that I think the warjacks need to do more damage to the regular infantry.  More optimization also needs to occur to smooth out performance.  However, from the little bit I have had a chance to play, the game has been pretty fun.			"

								It's expensive, yes. I got it because I love tactics games and enjoyed the tabletop game. The early price isn't for k-mart shoppers it's for people who want to be a part of the development of this game. I truly can't understand why you would expect a game in beta to be fully realized. It's irrational to expect a polished, complete product. The extra money will also serve to unlock units which will cost more later. So far I like the direction I see them going. Anyone criticizing about differences between the video game and the tabletop game should unclench and accept that it's a different medium. I'm happy with my decision on this game and look forward to the changes ahead. PM me for a match!			"

								Let's get the obvious out of the way: I understand that this is a beta, that they have yet to go through all the optimization steps, and that games on a mac usually don't run as smoothly as on the same windows machine.So I know not to expect this game to be perfect. Yet I am disappointed. First off it runs incredibly slowly, meaning I have to lower the settings to abysmal levels in order to play. Then many standard features are lacking (like deactivating the hot corners in full screen, or having the escape bar unselect the current selection or close the current screen BEFORE it brings up the menu) which immediately give a first impression of amateurism. And finally the options are very scarce as it isn't possible to play a standard practice game vs. the AI.Essentially this is the beta of a beta. Showing it to the public now satisfies the cravings of hardcore Warmachine fans who do not need any convincing to begin with, disappoints those who like the universe enough to know about this game and give it a shot but aren't necessarily blindly enjoying everything the company makes, and will definitely turn off gamers who know nothing about the IP but usually enjoy this kind of game.

												Note that the review is not based on the gameplay experience, since I could not get to the point where the game is playable. This might change if developers test and fix engine for Mac Book Pro.Absolutely unplayable on Mac. I had very high expectations, based on video on Steam, but the graphics rendering is totally inadequate. Models are 'shakin' as if they play a frame of some animation for the fraction of a second and then return to idle state. Polygons go way beyound the bounds. The game looks like someone was playing with 3D math and messed up few formulas. Not recommending at least until there's a fix.			"

												Ya, this has been on my wish list for a while because I just plain thought it was over priced, especially for a game that was (at the time) early access, ESPECIALLY since it was also kickstarted apparently.I just played the demo and I have to say that I hate interface.  I mean it seems like a really cool idea, cool mechanics, and I'd love to get into the control of a squad... but the interface had me screaming at the screen.  Like you have to use your move to turn to the target before you can attack, why isn't that just part of the attack action?  If you want to be fickle about controlling the move fine... but as long as I have the move why can't it just let me do that as one click?  And the units... okay the warcaster is cool and the warjack thing (although I found it to be useless I'm sure it's cool)... but what do I have to look forward to beyond that?  just stock troops?  Do I get a couple of these casters eventually atleast?  Maybe instead of setting up a story in the demo you could give us some of the gameplay?Maybe I'm just too demanding or maybe I just didn't play far enough into it... Or maybe I'm just used to games that want to be video games and not just ports from a tabletop game.			"

								As the game sits it's not worth the 65.00 price, but remember that we are purchasing the Digital Deluxe Edition. When the game comes out we get 20 additional units and the early access. Right now the Beta has 4 armies and they are pre-built. This is not the full game by far. Yes there will be a cheaper version of the game at release. As a Mercenary player at the tabletop version I can't pass up getting a bunch of Mercenary stuff. Nobody should be surprised by the content as it sits. They spell it out in the description very clearly as to what you are getting. I'm giving it a thumbs up and I hope the rest of you who actually do the reading will follow suit so that the game doesn't get unwarrented bad reviews. This game has been supported by Warmachine fans since the start with the Kickstarter. Let's make sure they get their just dues for providing a game that actually feels like a Warmachine tabletop game.			"

												Some interesting mechanics buried in an unfinished game. It plays like most turn based, grid based strategy games. You have zones representing your move distance and your ranged attack distance. Attacks have a percentage chance to hit. Your ""warcasters"" have an interesting mechanic, where they have a limited number of action points per turn, that they can choose to spend on extra attacks or attack boosts for themselves, or give to their golem-like ""warjack"", which is big and powerful, but has to stay near them.However, you probably won't care enough to learn more about the game than this. If they didn't claim otherwise, you'd think this was an early access title. I have never seen a worse camera in a game; half the time you won't be able to see your own units. The action camera will switch back and forth between normal view and zoomed in view every time an ally moves or attacks, which results in it flickering back and forth multiple times for every single unit. Everything looks like a blurry, pixellated mess. Attack ranges are unclear from the interface, and unless I am missing something, there's no way to undo a move after realizing you've moved out of attack range.Not worth your money unless they release some pretty major patches in the future.

You don't need the DLCs though - only if you really want some different choises in Multiplayer. And if you play the Multiplayer you can spent 10€ more on DLCs and it's gonna be worth it. So: 15€ singleplayer is accaptable (20 levels = 20 hours fun)+10€ for DLCs if you want the Multiplayer (see it as an Add-on)			"

												I never known this game to ever a board game, so this game review is based completly on the game. As for the game it's buggy, has performance issues, and is simply not finished. Moving your avatar or the camera can be more of a challenge than the enemies you face. This game is not worth $40, I was hoping for something like a fire emblem or fanal fantasy tactics, but this game in its current state comes no where close. In my opinion one flaw I do not like is Pre rendered level ups, I haven't got to far into the game, but it seems only your main avatar will level up one stat at the end of each level, i think the stat that levels up has all ready been chosen, there is no exp in this game as far as I can tell. The game does do some things really well, use strategy to move your characters into places to trigger more powerful combo attacks to defeat powerful ememies in one turn. Until they patch this game more it is not worth $40, and selling it for $40 is the main reason I'm giving it a negative review.			"

								While there are still a lot of bugs in the game (even for a beta), its just plan fun. Especially if you play the table top version (becuase then you already know what everyone does). Little hint: Caster Assassination is the way to go. Can not wait for them to release Caine :)			"

												IT SHOULD STILL BE A BETA VERSION. Too buggy actually...Warmachine is a good tabletop game but this digital version just ruin it. I played it on my new mac book pro 13 inch. The performance is so bad that it keeps crashing. It crashes a lot....I can't even finish one level. The game UI is not easy to use and confuses me a lot. 3D render looks bad...I think some of my old games' 3d graphics are better than this one.			"

When it did work, broken textures rendered it to seem like a pre-alpha game that need months and months of work.  Super sad about this.  I hope I get to edit this review and make it more positive, but as of right now, I'd love a refund for this waste of a game.			"

								Ehh people people. Read the huge text at the top EARLY ACCESS.plus couple paragraphs of text explaining price what will final product contain etc.As for the price there are two reasons.1) Remember when Planetary Annihilation went Early Access ? Remember their reasoning? Same thing here. Price is dictated by amount of money which people from Kickstarter had to pay for this stuff.2) This is Early Access AND Deluxe Edition! Not standard edition. Not simple preorder.This is for Premium package. And of course you are not getting this deluxe stuff now.You don't even get all the basic stuff. This is EARLY ACCESS. In other words BETA.I don't say this game is awesome as it is. But nobody said this is complete.If you don't want to wait or be a part of process simply wait for final release (around august).			"

								Beta/Early Access Review:If you are a fan of Warmachine table top game, or looking to get into a new tactical game with elements like X-Com, then this is a great game now, and going to get better.Current build is a feature light, but everywhere you look are the signs and evidence that it will be feature strong. The game play even as it stand in this early build is, in my opinion, a perfect mix of the spirit of the table top rules combined with the realities of video games. I am very much looking forward to watching this game get better and better.Side notes:The $65 is a reasonable price point. That is the price point the kick starter had that provided beta/early access. It's also the price point for the digital deluxe edition of the game which provides extra content upon release. I'm happy to pay it and play it, both help the developers make this a better game. If you dont want to pay $65 to play an unfinished game, thats fine, dont pay it. "

												I never played the tabletop game, and I don't know much about the setting.I got the game because I like turn-based tactical games. Warmachine is certainly rough in several features and probably made with a quite low budget, but the mechanics are very solid. I am having fun playing the campaign. I wish there were more single player campaigns. The Multiplayer is solid as well, but repetitive since there are just a few maps and once you know which army you like, there is tendency to keep using the same one. Overall I like the effort and I hope the developers will continue to expand and support this very good game.EDIT: Unfortunately I cannot support a game that is releasing micro-DLCs by the dozens with an outrageous price. Do not buy until the game will be feature-complete.			"

												Good looking with depths tactical turn based combat game. Customisation grants it immense potential.I would like to point out that despite the overall disappointment towards the game by many reviewers, the patches fixed a lot of issues over time as well as adding new stuff, even though some glitches and bugs are still out there and the performance of the game isn't at its best yet. I am therefore quite confident that in time this game will become what it should be, which is an excellent turn-based tactical game, since the devs really put the effort in it. besides the universe is simply fantastic :)Edit : sadly after so much time it is now very hard to find any excuse for the result. Plus most of the promised stuff is still not out and, we're in 2016, this AI design level is simply a shame to the human brain.			"

												If you are coming from the tabletop version of the game you will notice that some of the rules are a bit different, however it seems to work well for the pc game.  If you like the look of warmachine on the tabletop and have always wanted to see the units animated this is the game for you.  I haven't finished the campaign yet, but what I have finished has been enjoyable.Pros:Awesome character modelsNice animationGood (if not slightly repetative) soundtrackWarmachine on PC!Price (currently 19.99)Cons:Janked up camera (my biggest complaint)Factions don't have access to the complete tabletop choicesrules are not a carbon copy from the tabletop (can be confusing to the tabletop veterans)TLDR:  This game brings the Warmachine feel to the PC and is an enjoyable skirmish strategy game.  While some mechanics (poor camera controls/functionality) create some minor frustrations, overall it is a fun game and well worth the current price.			"

												Overall the game is okay mainly the play time experience spoils it.What I love about this game is- Because it's a turn-based game (who doesn't like Final Fantasy Tactics?)- Game being difficult and require some thoughtsHere are my pain points.- Movement isn't smooth, bad camera angle makes you make the wrong move.- Bad performance! Game can be sluggish which requires further of tuning.- Cutsence could be better, not engaging enough.- No skip cutsence option or fast forward enemy turn.- Game keep crashing on certain maps.Recommendation?- Worth getting it when it's on sale.

												Solid tactical game.There are imperfections thats for sure but those can easily be fleshed out with a bit of efforth.Im quite a big strategy fan and turn based strategy games like these are my bread and butter. if i got paid for them.The biggest crime this game managed to commit is its flat out ugly UI design.People have been complaining about this for a while i noticed and i agree that its ugly and does not relay the information you require at all times.Its hard to deselect units to see which ones still has actions to perform and the fonds used for everything just does not fit at all with the theme of the game.Its second crime which is a very minor issue i personaly have.when ya move your characters and units they change the direction they are facing in towards the objective.which forces you to manualy change the direction to face your closest enemy to take a swing or shot at them. this is outright anoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥Outside of these two things the game is quite solid. it has not crashed on me at all and i even began to like playing with diferent factions. Campaign demo is limited to 4 missions but give you free access to the Skirmish battles. this alows you to make your own squad to clash against an AI opponant. (i have not tried multiplayer as of yet) Its not an super impressive looking game but it shows each and every unit quite clearly for what they are.multiple weapons are visable aswel as some important information hovering above everyones head. i plan to buy this game alongside its DLC once my wallet decides to stop leaking and i sure hope everyone atleast check out the Demo.that alone should give you a very good indication what the game is all about.

												I think this game is really fun, especially after the update. You can play as your favourite faction in the online multiplayer or watch the story unfold in single player mode. The camera is a little weird to use at first, but you quickly get used to it. I look forward to seeing more for this game, and I hope it's not forgotten going forward.Full metal combat!			"

												The table top wargame is the reason I tried this, however, this game uses a grid layout which limits the scope of play. The graphics and sounds are reasonable for a game of this style and could use some more development love.			"

												I love WARMACHINE and I think the character/jack and scenery graphics in this game are great. Unfortunately that's all I really like about it. It was fun to have a few games because I miss being able to play tabletop and I tried to like this, but gameplay feels too clunky and the menu feels very unintuitive.			"

												Same as most of the other reviews except that I don't know anything about the table-top game.That being said, this game should be much better. The core tactical strategy concept seems pretty good, reminiscent of ""Valkyria Chronicles."" I like the mind-controlled mechs too. Instead it's an amateur, unfinished mess. If the developers fixed the myriad issues mentioned by others, such as the infuriating camera, terrible UI, abysmal performance and laughable AI. (Amongst other things like the disconcerting cutscenes that should have been animated.) This could be a very good game.			"

												Ever play a tactical game like chess and not be able to lose half the pieces you play with? Well, needless to say it isn't very tactical. Ever play a tactical game where you get new objectives and opponent's randomly as you play with no warning? Needless to say it isn't something you can be very tactical about.Ever play a game of Warmachine or Hordes where you could at least take joy in your friend winning? Well, this is an AI, cause no one wants to play vs. in this game... No one. So you get to see the the look of joy on the AI's face at least once per mission cause you will have no idea what you are supposed to be doing the first time you play most any mission.This is a disgrace and I find both comfort and sadness knowing that this has put the nail in the coffin for warmachine video games.This game can't hurt anyone anymore.

												I've played this game, on and off four a couple of years now and honestly it's a good title. Yes development has been slow, but it is a small team making the game they have come in bounds.Though I liked the single player campaign, for me it has to be about the multiplayer. When you know most of whate every unit in the game does and you're pitted with someone who knows the same, it can be a true confrontation of minds as you squeeze every last spell, feat and abillity to make your plan work,  Sometimes though, it can only end with Warcaster against Warcaster as the dice gods determine the victor. It can be tense is what I'm saying.There are now 6 factions, 22 Warcasters in total when counting dlc and they all play differently. If you like chess and think it coul do with more steam punk robots and ombies, give this game a try. Performance wise, its the best so far and there is still more content to come. Can't wait for army painter and my pink elves of death.If you like tactical games, give the demo a try. It might just grab you.			"

												Honestly, this isn't a bad game, but you need to see it in the context of the games that exist. I.e. if you've played all the awesome, possibly story-rich and complex-without-being-boring turn-based strategy games out there these days and STILL need more...well, this could be for you. But compared to X-Com, Mordheim etc. pp. this game just seems second-rate, unfinished and bland. The controls are lackluster, the story is told in a way that makes Mordheim's look good (and that has many different factions and is mostly told through text between missions...), the visuals aren't great at all...the steampunk thing could be alluring to some and some ideas about the units are kinda nice, but that's to be expected of a game that's based on a tabletop strategy game akin (some would say ""ripped off of"") Warhammer.TLDR: Buy only if you're a steampunk fan and you already finished all the REALLY good turn-based strategy games.Not a big loss for me though, it was part of some humble bundle...

												So about halfway in the single player campaign and the game still don't feel finished. The animations buggy, the fps dips. At it's current shape it still should not be a fully released. (Even the patch version says 0.9). Still it's strategy turn based games which we have few good ones to chose between. Alot of missions is hard the gamplay intresting (When the animation not convicning you you are turned the wrong way or you managed to deselect a unit thereby skipping a turn) and the mulitplayer is decent. My recomendation for now for anyone waiting to buy it. Wait for the release patch to at least say v 1.0 and the game is on sale.Update, So completed the Campain after giving them ample time to fix it. Gotta say it got a bit of story still not fixed yet. Bad optimization and considering the amount of effort the developer put into it it's sad. Can't reccomend it to anyone that's not really into Warmachines Tactics or have a desprete need to find a turnbased strategy game and can't take som eyesore bugs.			"

												After playing this game more, I had to change my review.YES, im bummed that they dont have hotseat added yet (and now ill shut up about that)....and sure there are good bad things about this game.  but i think you have to look at the little details the developers put in and take into consideration the fact that they are frequently updating the game, which is awesome because no one likes to feel as if they are stranded playing a crappy game.the graphics still throw me sometimes.  LOS takes a little getting used to.  sometimes the hit ratio will make you want to pull your hair out.  but overall, it all evens out.  theres something very cool about watching a warjack with a flail pound the snot out of the enemy.  or the way their bodies fly when hit with a strong, killing attack.  there is tons of variety - units, attacks and so on that it should keep you interested for quite some time.  at this point, most of the people playing this game either love it or hate it and i dont expect to see a lof of new players.  but if your are considering buying this game, id so do it.  buy it and play a few times using a stronger caster than the ai just to see what your guys can do.  i think once you really grasp the game and why things happen as they do, youll like this game.  it may not end up on your favorites list, but youll definitely get your moneys worth.

												I play the real tabletop game, $65 is pocket change compared to owning a legit army.After playing it alot more there are some nasty bugs but the development team is constantly fixing and updating this game and putting more units out.  I love it.  Its alot cheaper than buying actual units for the tabletop game and the games are very good.  Very happy with how this game is coming out.UPDATE - Still amazing game with lots of progress being made.  Lots of great units added and the combat is much more even now.UPDATE 2 -  They gave up on the game, they are horrible developers that didnt stand by their word.			"

												11/01/2017 EditThis game after a long time still remains quite broken, poor ai, not a terribly good main plot.But the thing is i keep playing it, and the reason i do is because it's based on the warmachine Table top game, which has all sorta of fun power and tactical potentials.now honestily i don't disagree with the negative reviews, this game could've been amazing and it's just okay.
