												[For the lazy ones: Skip the text for pros and cons.]Well, this game really looked interesting to me so I bought it. Unfortunately it's not quite as good as it looks. Why? Let's see.You are thrown onto that map with a chosen ammount of money and you buy stuff to produce energy and earn money for you. Nice start.Some of the buildings affect the pollution of the map, like gas plants or oil refineries and some don't, like solar panels. But clean energy takes forever to produce money. Does it even produce money? I get a little ""3"" on my oil drills to tell my something happens, but my clean energy just keeps looking fine... however.If you earned too much pollution accidents start to happen, like lightning, meteors or a giant worm randomly popping out of the ground destroying everything in range. When any of these desasters destroy your building the pollution stops and... yes, that's it. You rebuild it, pollution starts again, and hello Mr. Worm!You are able to clean the pollution by planting trees, but I was not able to see any difference so far. So I'm not sure how or whether these trees affect the pollution...So in fact you could just build a lot of solar panels and hope you reach the goal. Oh, ""what's the goal?"" you might ask. Well, there's a little ""?"" in the top left corner to tell you: ""To win you must make 1.000.000 Dollars"". Oh my. And all that with a solar plant that... I don't know, does it work at all!?Besides that the interface is minimalistic. Building menu, money and that nice little ""?"" top left. It would be great at least to know how much pollution my buildings produce just to plan how many trees I need to plant. But nope.Next thing very annoying is the lacking possibility of erasing the enviroment. There are trees everywhere on the map, mostly in positions that block nice building grounds. And you have a wonderfull bulldozer-tool. But guess what? You cannot erase trees you did not plant by yourself. That's somehow nature-friendly, but come on... Don't cut my choices where I want my trees! At least they got different colors for map-trees and self-made-trees. Makes it easier to remember which ones to cut down...What else? Graphics itself are really nice, I like this retro-Pokémon-look. On the other hand the music sucks. It's like a cat walking across a keyboard. With a lot of reverberation. And a bit of rhythm. Annoying to me. Well, at least you can turn the volume down from the options. That's one of three things you can do there. Sound and music volume and fullscreen-toggle. Wish there were at least some more graphics options. Or the scroll speed toggle. It's sooooo slow, jesus!The last thing is the lack of progress in the game. Yes, you can unlock new buildings, but the world itself doesn't change (except when you have problems with leaking oil... :s ). Also it would be great if you could upgrade your buildings with better filters to produce less pollution, but that simply isn't possible. In fact you can't do much more than build things. This game is called EVOPOLLUTION, but all I get is POLLUTION, where's the EVO?Guess that's it so far.Pro:- great idea- many building possibilities- making money. Who doesn't like making money?- cute worm-monster- nice retro graphicsCons:- repetitive- hard on every setting- no feedback on what you do (how does that tree affect my world?)- no instructions- always the same goal (reach 1.000.000 Dollars)- cannot bulldoze any map enviroment (like trees, seriously?)- annoying music- no growth (besides the new buildings you unlock)- would be somehow catchy, if it wasn't that hard (""Yai, I build a gas plant! ... Oh, the worm destroyed it..."" YOU JUST CAN'T STOP THAT THING!)- lack of options (sound and music volume and full screen on/off)- incredibly slow scrollingConclusion:I gave it a chance and it just didn't convince me. All in all it's a nice idea, but not much more than that. This game needs a lot more work to make it an enjoyable game you would play and also re-play. So far it's mostly frustrating. But maybe we get an update, that would be great!Until now it's a no, I do not recommend that.			"

												Right now, this game is not in a good state. (TL;DR at the end)The aim of the game is to reach 1,000,000 credits, starting with a custom amount of credits, up to 25,000.You can affect your weekly income by building different kind of power sources, including polluting types (oil, gas, etc) and pollution-free types (solar panels, wind turbines, etc) which all generate credits. Pollution shall be the main difficulty of the game:If you build too many oil drills for example, your randomly generated world will suffer from pollution, causing e.g. lightning strikes that destroy your buildings. In order to fight pollution, you may chose to plant trees. Two types of them.This balance system is however not transparent at all. You don't get to see, how much you pollute and how much your trees help, making it hard to find a proper distribution. The only feedback you get is when catastrophes are happening, nothing else.The plantable trees are the only units that cost credits. And once again, you have no indicator showing how much you earn and how much you lose per week. The biggest downside though is how damn easy it is to win this game, even on hard mode (not the expert mode, have not tried that one). If you don't want to be spoilered, don't read the following passage.All you have to do is build wind turbines and power storages. That's it. They don't cause pollution and give you a steady income. You build them. Wait, build more, wait more, and - magic - you have 1,000,000 credits.Basically, what this game needs is a downside to the pollution-free ressources, so that the difficulty lies in finding the correct balance between fossile fuels, 'green' ressources and vegetation, instead of just.... waiting.Moreover, the whole game (featuring music, menu, interface) needs more love. It all seems too minimalistic. In the end, this game is, without further work, no fun.I really hope that the creators will rework the game, i love the graphics and the general concept and idea of the game. There is potential. Unfortunately, it's still sleeping.TL;DR: Game needs more love, gameplay way too easy, lacks transparency in terms of credits and pollution level making it unenjoyable. Not recommended. "

												At first you might think this is somekind of strategy/simulation game. But it's nothing like that at all. I'm happy that I got this game for free and didn't wasted my money on it.===PRO================-looks very cute with its 16bit graphics===CON================-no real challenge (instead of building oil, gas or nuclear buildings you can simply build solar or wind energy with no pollution and therefore no penalty)-this is a waiting simulator-no tutorial (couldn't figure out some buildings)-no explanation on how pollution or purification works-no indicators at the GUI for pollution/purification level -only one music track wich loops over and over again-illogical (You need to pay fees to maintain trees; oil is the least polluting resource while gas has medium pollution and a nuclear power has extreme pollution)			"

												I myself enjoy this game. I think the graphics are very clean and clear. If this game was rated with stars I would give it a 3.5, and here's why:-(According to other reviews and posts) The game NEEDS a gauge showing the amount of pollution and the amount of purity. Personally, I think there should be a mode or a button to reveal that information; areas being affected by pollution, areas clear and 'healthy', etc. And these areas should be color coded to the effectiveness of the buildings and enviroment. (in this special ""mode"", it would be good to include the amount your buildings are making.)-A lot of the gameplay is very inaccurate, for example the ""Nuclear Plant"". In a real life situation, nuclear plants are in favor of the enviroment, not against.-More buildings would be GREAT! and the ability to technologically advance your tools, buildings, enviroment, and custom would be a smart decision. This would allow for a more diverse gameplay experience.I do love the game but it is missing a lot. If the devs are still with us, please see what the community has to say. Thanks! :D(I will turn my frown upside-down when I see improvement.)			"

YouTube™ Video: Evopollution - Feng's FIrst Impressions 

			Views: 703		

			Evopollution is a bus(s)iness strategy game by Atapki, that has a strong emphasis on the impact of the environment. You must make 1 million dollars while trying to do as little damage to the...		

So, this game looked pretty unique. We haven't come across many ""business"" management games that have a emphasis on the impact on the environment. The retro graphics style caught my eye, as did the fact It was also nice to see a game on steam that wasn't in early access or shovelware from the 1990s.The game itself seems solid in theory, try to make money whilst maintaining the environment. If the land gets heavily polluted then weird stuff starts to happen, like meteors falling from the sky, or giant worms trying to destroy your precious buildings. The fact that there is random generation in the 5 maps you can choose from adds to the replayability (although the only thing I really noticed this have an impact on is the number and location of Oil Nodes).First thing I noticed, there is no tutorial to explain how to actually play the game. There is a small ""?"" in the top left which you would assume would give you some kind of help or options, but instead it just tells you that you need to accumilate 1 million dollars to win.The UI feels clunky, you can only scroll the screen with the mouse at a painfully slow speed. Good Luck finding the scroll speed on the options menu, all you get is music and sound sliders (oh sorry and full screen, can't forget that). Perhaps my main gripe with the game at the moment is the lack of display information on the buildings and such. OK, yes you can see how much a building costs, how much weekly profit you get and it's (very vague by the way) pollution output, but how much does it cost to maintain? Is there maintenance costs? The system feels very basic.It would also be nice to see some graphs of some sort. I'd like to see what my monthly profit (and expenditure) is, or how polluted the land is on average. This is the only business management game that I've come across that doesn't even have that basic functionality.Considering the game is centered around the idea of keeping a clean enviroment why can't we upgrade our buildings to produce less pollution via installing (costly) filters and such?Edit: So after playing for alittle bit longer I've found the game to mainly reward the playstyle of building nothing but buildings that cause no pollution. Apart from the fact that it takes alittle longer to reach the money goal there is no downsides to it. This seems flawed as it then gets extremely repetitive to just do the same set-up over and over again. That's rather disappointing.Most of these problems could be patched. ""If"" it does, I'll happily re-review it, until then though I won't recommend it.			"

												For the price I figured it couldn't be so bad that it'd be a complete waste of money, but unfortunately I was wrong.  I made the mistake of looking at the images and description of the game and seeing perhaps a newer version of SimEarth or something similar, and as I love simulation games figured ""what the heck"".Lesson learned, always scroll down to the reviews.  Absolutely would have avoided this if I had, as everything that was pointed out in the first few I ran into almost immediately.Oil rigs are the first things you build, in order to unlock oil tanks, then refineries, etc.  You have to build one of each building to get to the next level, although solar farms appear to unlock but you can't actually build them (bug?) without perhaps building gas plants first (which I refuse to do based on the ""VERY HIGH"" level of pollution).Oil rigs have a low level of pollution, yet within minutes the ground is brown and trees are dying, and even planting a medium tree or two (which more than take up the tiny amount of profit from the rig) makes no difference that I saw.  Clearly something that's ""VERY HIGH"" or in the case of the nuclear plant ""VERY VERY HIGH"" would just obliterate my map in seconds, right?The correct strategy is to build a number of cheap solar plants, then stack the rest of the map with power storage facilities.  No roads, no trees, just stack them.  This gives you the maximum amount of profit, and then Alt-Tab for 15 or 20 minutes and you win!Clearly this is less a game and more of a propaganda piece, as no matter what you can't actually win by using polluting types of profit, since cost of trees offsets the profits and without that you get worms and meteors up your♥♥♥♥♥			"

												While the learning curve is low (and there is no tutorial), it doesn't take long to realize that if this game had a mechanic to speed up time, it wouldn't be a challenge at all. Yeah there are moments where you frantically try and fix the pollution problem but once you find the right balance, all that's left to do is afk for an hour or so, or stare at your screen as your wallet slowly fills up.It's really frustrating how slow paced this game can be. Morever there's no sense of progress once you beat a level. Nothing new to unlock, no new buildings, just more of the same sitting and waiting and tweaking.			"

												To be honest I kind of feel cheated by this game.I bought not sure what to expect and loaded it up thinking little building sim with cute graphics. When all I got was what was essentially a one screen flash game I was more than just a little disappointed. I think this could best be summed up by an impulse buy without doing the proper research and I hope to save other people from that impulse.If you're looking for what is essentially a phone or flash game this game might tickle your fancy. If you're looking for any kind of depth or strategy...might want to look elsewhere.			"

												Have you ever heard of ""propaganda games?"" Hopefully not.Evopollution may not be a full-on propaganda game, but it's the closest thing I've seen in awhile.In evopollution, your aim is to earn a million dollars, and you accomplish this by building structures on your little island.Of course, as the name suggests, most structures also generate pollution. If the environment gets even a little bit tainted around your structures, the environment will rise up against you, in the form of comets raining from the sky and giant worms coming up from the earth to devour your structures.Once you play for a bit, you'll find the only solution to this madness is just to set up the strucutres that generate no pollution, and just leave your computer on until the game proclaims that you have won. It's that thrilling.Building anything else results in swift and terrible punishment at the hands of...giant worms.Oh, and can we talk about the fact that the ""nuclear power plant"" creates more pollution than any other structures in the game? No...just no...if you're going to have a little propaganda-fest, at least DO IT RIGHT.I mean, short of blowing up a reactor, nuclear power plants have very little impact on the environment.Not that it matters. Those giant worms will eat any nuclear power plant you place within moments.So yeah, Evopollution is basically saying, ""GO GREEN, OR DIE!""They should show kids this game in schools, instead of ""The Unfortunate Truth.""I mean, global flooding has NOTHING on giant worms!I get it, evopollution. I'm not fond of big oil either. I promise I'll recycle from now on! Happy now? Can you stop with the propaganda now? No? Well then...			"

												Unfortunately unfinished. What seems like a misguided attempt to lecture the general public on how great solar and wind power are turns out to be merely misunderstood. Still, there is no real gameplay here besides waiting it out while you are either being shelled by the Dark Energies of the Pollution Planet, with meteors and space worms destroying your buildings, or choosing not to produce any pollution and then waiting it out while nothing whatsoever happens. After the unannounced goal of hoarding up 1 million snazzy space credits is reached (presumably to claim a flight ticket to a place not beset by space worms?), the game ends and you get told how jolly you were. In my case it was an E, as I just tabbed away and did something else after building a few wind turbines and solar plants.Only consider this if the developer returns to make it a real game.			"

												There's more strategy in some free to play, browser-based ""clicker"" games out there. The music is chirpy and annoying for a game that requires long and considerate attention in a gaming session. Mechanics are interesting albeit shallow, also trees cost money over time to own, which is not intuitive and not obviously explained. There are 5 maps to play on, but you can plumb the depths of the gameplay on a play-through on the easiest settings of the first map, then proceed to the hardest settings on the last (mars) map and touch on everything there is to see while skipping the middle 3 maps. TL;DR Not a waste of time, but not really worth it either.			"

												As a big fan of city-builders and goals in games besides 'kill this' and 'destroy that,' I wish I could like Evopollution. But I can't recommend a game on its concept alone. There's not much content or gameplay; it mostly involves just sitting and waiting for your money to pile up enough to advance, with very little planning or strategy involved. I feel Evopollution would work much better as a free social media game.			"

												What a terrible game. After about 1min of gametime, I figured out how to put myself in a state where victory was assured, and after that, the question was just ""do I have the willpower to see this through?"".  After 5 min of gametime, I was making a good profit. After 6 min, got annoyed with the music and turned off the game, looked up if there was any chance of me losing if I had kept playing, and then knew that this game was a waste of time.Graphics & SoundEvopollution has a simple pixelated art-style, somewhat similar to that of the 16-bit era of consoles (the way the game looks actually reminds me the typical SNES action/adventure game, minus all the characters & creatures). It's a simple, but not a bad look. Some things are animated, and the animations are simple, but do the job well enough.The background music in this game gets annoying fast. It should have been more low-key and soothing, that would have fit this game a lot better.GameplayThe idea behind Evopollution is that you're supposed to generate profit without destroying the world around you. This is done through building some different buildings. Some generate more profit, but more pollution, some less profit and less pollution, and some does not generate pollution at all. Trees take money, but remove pollution. If pollution gets to high, then disasters starts happening.If you just build low-pollution buildings (solar powerplants & windfarms), put some trees between them, and then build some power storage (pollution-free profit based on the number of solar plants and windfarms you have), you can't lose. It might not be the absolutely most effective way of winning, but you can't lose. If you would really want to make things as effective as possible, I guess there's some room for staying with the game, but there is an optimal mix, and it's not going to be very hard to at least get near it.Closing thoughtsEvopollution is a terrible game. It's simplistic, repetitive, and it's very easy to put yourself in a state where you can't lose, and all you need to do is wait for the game to say that you've won.I get the message the game tries to convey, we need to find a sustainable way of living, producing things, and generating power. The issue here is that the way the game portrays this is just flat out wrong. To the developer: Please look up what a lifecycle analysis is. Because if you intend to make another game about sustainability, then having a basic understanding of that is needed (and time to get political, because the internet loves that ;) Politicians, please also look up these concepts, because otherwise you end up making misguided efforts that cause more harm than good).

												Evopollution tasks you with gaining one million dollars by setting up polluting and/ or clean energy sources: you'll have to keep your pollution levels under control or disasters such as lightning, comets and a big worm will destroy your assets.Too bad the actual game is sadly marred by technical problems, weird design decisions and a truly dull gameplay, thus failing to live up to its interesting Store description.PROS:-had an intriguing premise-seeing pollution interact with the environment (with bushes and trees getting bare, then growing again if you purify the zone)  was interestingCONS:-soundtrack gets grating fast-save game doesn't work, I tried several times on all levels but I'd never save my progress, forcing me to restart each time-unbalanced gameplay, a polluting asset will damage its surrounding area in seconds, summoning all disasters in a quite wide area: you'll have to spend 3x the asset's cost in trees to balance it out and hope a random disaster doesn't destroy what you've built right away. The various energy sources also have skewed price/ profit values, with some being quite useless-even when it works, the gameplay is simply dull and boils down to building a few assets then wait for a LONG time until you get enough cash to build more. There's no way to speed up time so your best bet is running it windowed and do something else -weird controls, you can close certain menus with a click while others only react to you pressing Esc, the map only scrolls with the mouse etc..-incomprehensible design choices, beginner mode is actually harder than normal mode due to the fact that you have to unlock assets yourself, certain buildings do nothing at all and only cost money and waste space on the small map

Evopollution's biggest sin is the fact it turns into a waiting game in a matter of minutes as you start up a game, spend your starting money and are then supposed to wait 10 to 30 minutes to get enough funds to build something else while starting blankly at the screen. This simply isn't fun and makes the game feel like one of those mobile apps you run in the background and check a few times a day.Add to this its skewed pollution model, where most assets require you to waste several times their purchase price and land space to counteract their environmental damage, unrealistic objectives (one million $ will take ages), extremely low production values and a broken save feature: you'll quickly realize why Evopollution feels like a badly programmed flash game at best, one that'd not be worth playing even if it was free.The only reason you'd start up the game is to get its cards if, like me, you got it on a bundle: everyone else can safely skip this one.

Trees cost a constant flow of cash for upkeep... Scored an F- but wasn't told why (time? because they hate teh idea of nuclear so much that they just straight up fail you if you use it? Some hidden goal that isn't ever stated?)...

												I really wish I could recommend this game.  I really do.  The premise of it sounds really interesting, and I'm glad I got it when it was on sale (though after playing probably 90% would be more worth it instead of my 75%).  The only real good thing was a 5 card badge.  Yay badges?The premise is simple.  You have a land map.  You are to earn lots of money (1,000,000 for each map).  You can adjust difficulty and starting money.  And it seems that each one is somewhat randomized.  To get your money you have to balance the buildings you make with the pollution they create (and add trees to counteract it).  Sounds like a good start, no?However, from there it gets...awkward.  The map control is really funky (move mouse to edge of screen to pan, hold mouse wheel for faster pan, no zoom).  The difficulties don't make a lot of sense to me.  There's Beginner and Normal...but I feel like they should be switched as Beginner makes you build through the 'tech tree' (not much of one) and Normal has it all unlocked.  I've seen in other reviews a harder difficulty but not sure how to unlock it.The pollution balancing is...interesting.  You have large trees and small trees both with different upkeep (like you're paying to maintain them) which balances on your profit (other buildings) and the pollution offset.  There's no real clear indicator how much it's acting...but you can eventually get a feeling of the radius like coverage.  Easiest way I noticed was on the final area where you need to start with trees...and you see a clearer look of its effect before you can start to build.The sound/music is...attempting at a sense of ambience but it gets a little old.  The graphics are fine for cost.  They're actually kinda cute in a way.Basically, you have a Simcity without the Sims and all the pollution...and some natural disasters.  Well, somewhat natural-ish anyways: meteors, lightning...and a giant worm like from Dune?I've got no idea how the grading scale works for when you complete a map and get the 1,000,000 dollars.  Best I've done as of this review is...a D+ (lowest was an E+).  Ouch...If you get for cheap, it's an ok way to pass the time and get cards for a badge.  However, there REALLY isn't much to the game and like others have said the science is...biased, extremely biased.  I'm sorta tempted to see what the ""Hard"" is like if I can figure out how to unlock it...but I'm really not expecting much more.			"

												Evopollution is a great idea, a great concept, and even because of the mostly bad reviews, I bought this game. But even if the idea is good - it was badly executed. The game is just plain boring, you wait - and wait. And wait And wait. 'Till you have a million bucks ingame. There is no fun goals to aim for, no replay value, and after 30 minutes you are already sick of the game. But the graphics are well made - and with more objectives, more gameplay value, and other additions made, this came could become actually better. Consider making changes to boost the game's fun, and I will consider turning this into a positive review.			"

												Evopollution has a great concept, but it has terrible execution. In the game you produce energy by building things like oil wells, gas plants, solar panels, and windmills to make a profit. However if you allow your island to get too polluted, accidents happen and destroy your oil wells and gas plants. You can try to mitigate this pollution by planting trees, but since the game doesn't give you a solid number on how much pollution you are producing and how much each tree can counteract, it is nigh impossible to make a decent profit with anything but solar panels and windmills.Another problem with the game is that once you have optimized everything to make the most profit possible, there is absolutely nothing left to do until you reach your goal of $1,000,000. When you reach this point, you can pretty much leave the game running and do something else until the goal has been reached.Overall I would not recommend buying this game. It is not fun, it is not engaging, and it is not worth your time and money.			"

												Though I do think this is a good game fundamentally it is flawed. The concept is pretty cool. Here are my thoughts and make your own decision.1. It should be more options for buildings, there are other methods of green energy other than solar and wind, so that should be expanded upon (unless it occurs in later levels im still just playing and going).2. The Purification vs. Pollution mechanic needs to be elaborated on, trees are pretty crappy at removing pollution and the pollution can accumulate really really fast! There should be options to eliminate it better.3. Nice weather and daytime mechanic for the green energy. But the night time lasts pretty long compared to day time so take that as you will.4. Pollution is difficult to control even on the easiest settings, this relates to #2 but still. There should be a gauge to allow the player to see the balance between how you pollute vs how you repair the environment.			"

												A very strange game. Not what I really would describe as a business stratergy game myself. Its more of a puzzle game. I did have fun trying to workout what I had to do and seeing how the game worked but I dont think its got lasting appeal.It in my opinon seems slightly unfinished and could have been alot more should the actually buisness side of things been deeper.Overall I enjoyed my time with it and would suggest its something to pick up during a steam sale certainly not worth more than a couple of pounds.

Trees cost money to maintain, buildings produce income, game is over when you get to 1,000,000.  You get a grade depending on how quickly you get there.Honestly, there are free flash games that are better than this game in everyway, probably best to spend your money elsewhere.			"

												Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to earn $1,000,000, while not destroying the world in the process. Build power plants and manage your pollution levels; if your pollution levels get out of hand, sandworms and meteors will come to destroy your hard work.There is no fast-forward, so all gameplay is real-time. This isn't so bad as most reviewers make it out to seem, as all you have to do is build a power grid with sustainable pollution levels, and then let the simulation run. I managed to earn $1,000,000 in about 40 minutes, so the amount of time you have to let the simulation run is trivial. Just turn it on in the background and let the money pile up.I enjoyed this game. It's a casual simuation game, and you really don't have to worry about enemies destroying your progress unless you build an unsustainable power gid.			"

												I turned the music off and it stayed on!!!!Not much to it, you place buildings and the natural disaster detroy them, you play until you run out of money from rebuilding. Or you place low income building that have low pollution and let the game play itself. Really, that's the best you devs can come up with?Only way to reduce pollution is to plant trees, and you can only plant one at a time. Then you have reselect it and plant another one, etc, etc. Wow, excitement there.Map is really small. I played beginner on easy, was bored after the second game.Achievement earned --> Game deleted forever!			"

This sim game challenges the player to earn a million dollars by using various power generating buildings.  While at the same time avoiding over polluting which will bring ruin down upon the land with meteors, lightning and sand worms.The lack of supply/demand for resources, the tiny landmass and infinite time create a game that offers little to no challenge.  All that is required for success is enough patience to wait for the money counter to go up.			"

												Evopollution is a neat idea. You come across those games every so often; the premise is sound, it's presented well and gameplay seems solid, but in this game's case, it was very poorly executed.Evopollution is not just another piece of shovelware bs, so I'm giving it a reccommendation, but don't spend more than 50 cents on it.The basic premise is to make a million dollars. This is poorly explained by the game so just trust me on this. You're given multiple different ways to generate power to sell, including green options and more damaging options. Oil, gas and nuclear make money faster, but generate pollution, which you have to keep in check with trees (or random disasters will destroy your buildings. The faster you make your million the higher of a score you get. Good premise, right? Well yeah, there is a really good game hidden in here somewhere. Unfortunately the game is either a very poorly executed propaganda project or the developers had no idea how to balance a game, because filling your map with wind turbines is literally the only way to win. All polluting power plants have hilarious side effects which make the game harder, and kill everything around them with just immediacy. They also will almost never give you any return before being struck by lightning or a meteor or eaten by a sarlacc or whatever.Evopollution is cute and well designed, and worth a quick play, but there is very little game here. I find it hard to believe that a developer would present a project so well only to fail at balancing its gameplay styles, so the only conclusion here is that they are trying to convey a message though a tissue-thin veil. Unfortunately for them, they didn't make me feel anything, all they did was make me strive to win with the most polluting build I could manage, and that's a scary accurate representation of real-world pollution policies if I ever saw one.

												Simple game, hard to master.  Evopollution might seem rather difficult to play at first, but it will rope you in with indicators that you are doing fine, however in one fell swoop, you will see the lost of your industry vanish ever so quickly.  This is a good game and contains similiar elements such as Banished, however it isn't polished as it's counterpart.  It's an overall great buy for a similiar gameplay expierence for the cost.  However lacks any real connective emotions since there are no people involved in the game.			"

												So, I got this game on sale, and honestly, it's a good thing too. I don't feel too cheated for spending money on this game. First off, there isn't a tutorial of any kind, when you start a game. It just throws you right into it. I, personally, like the graphics. Pixel games are the best, in my opinion. The music is alright. It gets old fairly quick, but I tuned it out. One mechanic of the game that I really didn't like was how long it takes to build up money. I get that's the object of the game, to reach $1,000,000, but I feel like you have to wait too long for even $100 to build up. There's nothing to do while you wait for your money to stack up, so you can buy more things. Pollution stacks up quickly, and it seems hard to recover from.It's a neat concept, but it needs refining.			"

												What a deal. for the price of a softserve from McDonalds, I was gifter this game. My main problem is that the earthworm monster would eat trees which is ridiculous, as worms dont even live in trees, so why would they be eating them. I would also likee to know why I cannot build solar farms on the eay map as this would have sped up my game play time quite a bit. Lastly the fact that I recived a D- for my wonderful green powered production of my $1,000,000 makes me think that this game was developed by fatcats who don't understand the complexity of long term damage to ecosystems as a result of fossil fuels, and do not factor in the detrimental eeffects of green power either. Windfarms produce a lot of noise as is highlighted in the more graphically developed, but similar game, Cities Skylines. Unlike Evopollution, within Cities Skyliens you can also build houses so that the power you are producing goes to use instead of just sitting there doing nothing in these giant battery buildings, which somehow produce no waste.I would give this game a 4/10 as it is on the right track to being a good game, but is just missing those crucial elements of interesting gameplay and click to play dialogue with the characters within. I would love to converse with the earthworm and understand what I can do to help him, since he is so hungry that he's eating my windfarms and trees. He clearly has some sort of body image issues as only his head and neck come out of the ground. What lies beneath must be helped in any way possible. "
