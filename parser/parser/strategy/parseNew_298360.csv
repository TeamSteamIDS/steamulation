												I purchased the original version of Immortal Defense quite a long time ago, and I'm glad that it has finally made its way to Steam. ID is one of the best Tower Defense style games I have ever played.On a mechanical level, the towers are not the formulaic set you find in most other games. You know, the ""weak but fast"" tower, the ""long range and slow"" tower, the ""splash damage"" tower, etc. You won't find that here. Each of the towers has vastly different behaviors, making you think more carefully about placement. Behavior can change as you upgrade them, and they can also interact with your cursor as well (which is a weapon in its own right).The game is also very challenging - experienced Tower Defense players will be tested here. But, the difficulty can be adjusted along the way, so if it's just too hard, you can dial the difficulty down a bit - for the one level you're having trouble with - and come back to it later if you want.Visually, Immortal Defense is fun. This is an older game but it still looks great. It's somewhere between a dream, a laser light show, and an LSD experience all rolled up into one. The visuals can also be dialed up and down as needed, though, so if it is too much for you, you can get back to a more ""sane"" experience. I recommend keeping on the higher side.The music is great too - it has a delicate, mystical quality that fits very well with the art style.Generally, tower defense games have at most a token storyline, something that is easy to throw away and ignore. But Immortal Defense delivers here, too - taken as a whole, the story of Immortal Defense gets into some interesting philisophical questions about immortality, good and evil, what is really important, etc. The towers (called Points in the game) come out of the story, and their names and functionality are drawn out of it as well. It might be a bit too cerebral for a lot of people, but it won't interfere with the gameplay.For the Steam version of the game, there are new challenges that you can complete for additional bonuses during gameplay. There is also a leaderboard.Overall, I rate this as a very strong buy for anyone who enjoys the Tower Defense genre and is looking for something a little different. Visuals aside, I put ID on the same level as other TD greats.Disclosure: Studio Eres provided me with an advance copy of the Steam version for the purposes of play testing and review.			"

												""Wa-a-a-it a minute, is this another one of those tower defense games? How many of them do we really need?"" - you're probably asking yourself at the moment. Why yes, indeed, it IS a tower defense for PC - a platform already chock-full of various games of the kind. You might have already played Defense Grid, spent some evenings grinding Defender's Quest, maybe partied in the co-op mode of Dungeon Defenders with a couple of friends... So, why waste time on yet another game of an exhausted genre?To put it shortly - yes, we do need Immortal Defense. Right off the bat - when playing ID, you're not just an omnipresent authority figure (c), you ARE the guy who actually shoots stuff in top-down perspective. That little mouse cursor on screen that lets you build your towers? That's you right there, or rather your soul, personification of your willpower - whichever you prefer. It's the embodiment of a player in the game, and one of the signs of its unorthodox approach - combining the control mechanics with the actual gameplay, making the player a major part of the action while removing any unnecessary medium. Very few games do this (""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"" comes to mind, check it out when you can), and to see this from a ""mere"" tower defense? Not bad, not bad at all.But then we move beyond the interface and controls and look at the game itself, and... Geez, is that a plot segment I see in-between the missions? Some kind of a mystic space opera? Why do I even need a plot in a tower defense game? It boils down to shooting unremarkable enemies throughout a hundred of levels anyway, right? Right?... Well, not in this case, it doesn't. From the very beginning the game makes you feel responsible - you are not just a figure behind a computer desk, consolidating some defense force around your planet. You have been chosen to leave everything you knew behind and transcend into a new form of being - the form no one really knows much about. It's the sacrifice you made for your loved ones - and each message from them, received after successful battles, reassures you in the righteousness of your task. To become a god of space between worlds, to be the last hope of your home planet - what's not to like?And yet, the Universe operates on a different level, and not every action has clear consequences. Concentrating your will to create needle-sharp ""points"" - your line of defense against the invading armies - you fail to notice how decades after decades run by. The Universe is engulfed by war, and there's little time for you to think of what the future holds for you when you finally turn homewards. But when you do... will there really be home to return to?There are many other beings like you, created with the same mission in mind - to protect, to defend, to repel. And yet, as you soon realize, not everyone can bear the centuries of loneliness. For that matter, can you?..But the transcended existence has its own benefits - with each passing day, your memories shatter, but your will gets stronger. Learning more and more advanced techniques, assembling more and more powerful points, you manage to overcome the limitations of spirit once imposed upon you. What lies beyond? Will it be paradise for those who rely on you... or will you only descend deeper into hell?To put it shortly, Immortal Defense is not an easy game to review. The controls and mechanis are closely intertwined with gameplay, and the gameplay itself depends heavily on the story. There are no decisions per se, no roads to take, but the final result still doesn't disappoint - in the very end it feels like you walked your own path, made your own choices. Complicated relationships with your family's descendants and the ones who you once thought your enemies only make it harder to progress, and the game itself becomes more and more complex with each mission, never forgetting to introduce yet another enemy pattern or some dimensional trick to keep you off guard. Overcoming those and using every available ability to your advantage - that is the measure of a true Ghost of the Path. And trust me, with the Steam release, the game has obtained a LOT of new shiny toys for you to experiment with, as well as a real sense of an almost RPG-like progression - just take a look at all the bonuses that achievements and medals provide!I first played ID when it was released years ago, and I still play it to this very day. With each playthrough, I feel as if I learnt something new - not just about the game, but about myself, too. Is there anything else to wish for? Well, maybe some cool graphics effects and nifty tower designs - in which case you'll find those here aplenty. ;) Happy hunting, Great Ghost! And never forget where you came from.			"

												This is an absolutely fantastic little tower defence game.It's mechanically sound and the tower interactions (and limitations) lend themselves to requiring interesting strategies on most of the later levels. It's never a case of ""the slow tower + the aoe tower"" always assures victory.Let's be honest though there are hundreds of tower defence games out there so what sets this on apart?The story.The story is a fantastic exploration into what it means to be immortal and explores such themes as loneliness, betrayal and insanity. It's astoundingly deep content to have in a game of this genre.It's hard to say any more without spoiling the experience so just go play it yourselves!			"

												At this point, I'm likely to ignore something that's described as ""a tower defense game."" There are a lot of them out there, and many don't ultimately have much to offer. But Immortal Defense is an exception, and I'll likely use this new version as an excuse to play through the game again. Immortal Defense has a unique style, engaging mechanics, and an evocative story. You might not expect the writing to be a strength in a game of this type, but that's one of the elements that set Immortal Defense apart. I'm also looking forward to Studio Eres's other upcoming release Saturated Dreamers.			"

												Immortal Defense is a pretty interesting tower defense game. It touches on some odd topics for a video game but it sure made me think about things that very few games can manage.The story itself is pretty enjoyable and the game takes awhile to run through. So it is a decent investment on time I found. With six different plot lines that take place over sixteen missions a piece. And a bit of extra content if you can find it. It certainly kept me occupied for awhile.It follows the adventures of an almost unnamed protagonist as he becomes his worlds only defense against an alien menace in what they call ""Path Space"" Which feels a lot like hyperspace, to me. And that's what it plays as, it is a short cut from point A to point B in space. And you are there, looking down at the ships trying to venture through. And this gives you a severe advantage over them. But in this state you are incorporeal, and seperate from your body. Time passes differently. How do you handle this, all the presure of so many lives depending on your constant vigiliance and being seperated from everyone you know and love. The story touches on this in many ways. And also friendship and betrayal as well. But I'll leave those for you to discover.It's also quite atmospheric and charming. I haven't seen any tower defense games where your towers talk to you and have their own personalities. It's very interesting to see what all they have to say as you play the game. And how they respond to the things happening o nthe screen.One of the things I like most about Immortal Defense  though is the music, it really draws me in and makes me feel there, in the moment and I think grabbing the soundtrack is worth the price of admission by itself. But that's just me.Music aside, the visuals are another strong trait the game has, falling somewhere between a rave and some sort of bizzare drug trip, they are certainly something to see. Though on higher settings might be a bit much for some people of more frail constitution. But that is easily adjusted on the main screen via slider.Anyway, This is a game that I absolutely adore and have played through multiple times. Twice for fun and once to get to the secret stuff! Worth the money I spent, way back before it got on steam. And I will be buying it again now, for friends to enjoy!Overall, I would say, if you like tower defense games, or games that touch on philisophical things, this would be a very strong buy. The musics and graphics are great, for the games age, and it is really more about the aesthetic amyway, at least that's how I feel!Disclosure: Studio Eres provided me with an advance copy of the Steam version for the purposes of play testing and review.

												Whether you're new or old to tower defense games, Immortal Defense is a good buy. With tons of unique mechanics but still holding together what makes a good tower defense a good tower defense, and on top of that all a great story considering it's a game where you're shooting geometrical shapes flying on a line... Immortal Defense is amazing for what it is.In Immortal Defense, you play as a Pathspace Defender whose goal is to defend your home planet by literally becoming a god and shooting invisible hellbeams from another plane of existence at people who are invading you. You do this by what else- placing towers! While the story and gameplay get more complicated than that (and bring all sorts of delightful twists and turns), that is the basic premise to the game.If you're new to the game, you might be pleasantly surprised by the gameplay and strange quirks it has. Each tower is more unique than the usual tower defense tower, with every single one having completely original properties and not just ""the splash damage tower"" and ""the one that shoots fast"". Not only that, but you have a stake in the action as well; you use your mouse cursor to charge up attacks and interact with some of the attacks of your nearby towers to efficiently take out harder enemies. The strategic depth of the game gets pretty crazy later on, with enemies you have to pinpoint and ""snipe"" with your cursor or else they'll buff other enemies to the point of being unstoppable. You'll also find that although the story starts out a bit slow it picks up very fast and perfectly placed cliffhangers keep making you want to play more.If you're a returning player, why buy the steam version? The non-steam version is currently pay what you want on the site (unless it's been taken down). The steam version has all kinds of great new features, from almost doubling the length of the base game with side missions and campaigns to giving you permanent ""upgrades"" sort of by completing weird challenges to make the notoriously harder levels a tiny bit easier. Not only that but there is a more in depth graphical system (with widescreen support finally) and leaderboards/steam workshop integration so you can play other people's levels that they made with great ease.So would I recommend Immortal Defense? With an overwhelming response, yes. It is one of, if not the best and most unique tower defense game I have ever played and the story is also seriously great (even though it can come off as trying too hard a time or two). For 9-10 dollars this game absolutely deserves to be checked out. "

												I find it difficult to put into words how I feel about this game but here is my best attempt.In 2007 (2008?) I was beginning to gain interest in, ""indie games."" One of the games that I saw was the most highly acclaimed was Immortal Defense, reborn on Steam after 8 years. I was never very good at tower defense games, and to be honest I'm still not good at them. Back then I tried to get through as much of the story as I could (on difficulty 00 never the less) but I think my brain stopped being able to handle it around the half way point of chapter 3. The game is difficult and can take a lot of thinking to fully understand. Part of this is because there doesn't seem to be an, ""optimal,"" strategy for each level. There are ways that don't work, but especially later on you can figure out many different ways to beat them. I ended up cheating my way through a lot of the game from that point. Sorry Paul, I did it back then and I might have to do it again. I'm just not clever enough for your later levels.The visuals, while simplistic, make up for it in terms of color, style, and how fitting they all are. The game looks really damn nice now. Still simple, but even more juiced up with all kinds of interesting effects.The music can range between infectious and grand with some great melodies but you can definitely hear that it was a bit of a budget affair. I spotted some midi bass that seemed out of place.But the real thing that makes Immortal Defense so special to me was its story and how it affects the gameplay. You play K, a person who has given up his body to defend his home world from invaders, detacting himself from the physical world to defend it from pathspace. K left all he loves physically - but not mentally. In pathspace, K uses parts of his being, mainly his emotions manifested into towers to destroy enemies in pathspace. They speak out in the middle of the game with character, making the battlefield feel alive.K's journey is a philsophical one that tackles a lot for a game: what matters to a person, what drives them, what the nature of reality is, what the nature of truth is, how powerful you can become and how it influences others, and how it would be like to live alone, forever in a place away from any mortal eye. The writing is very well done. It is never these huge philosophical rants, rather the characters give you information and story through the use of subtle phrases that you can put a lot of thought into.Not only that, the levels range from abstract to very purposely made symbols that represent what is happening in the game.The point is: The story and mood of Immortal Defense seems into every crevice of the game. Every element in the game seeks to bring you into the story of K. His story is a hypothesis on what might it be like if you, the player, were to embark on this grand journey a million years long.I finished the game long ago in 2007 (2008?) early in the morning. It made me think about my own place in the world, made me feel profound emotions and has given me a quote to live by to this day. Rethinking about the game gives me chills and to this day fills me with the feelings of...I can't really put them into words.Maybe it was me being naive and being sensitive. I'm a sensitive guy, what can I say? But this is my experience from the game. Even if no one else feels the way I did, this game hit me hard and inspired me in many ways.When you have nothing left, you must create your own reasons for existening. Some people cling to the past, others surround themselves in their own creations. Here are two quotes that have stayed with me all these years.""There's one thing you can rely on in this universe: being as wrong as often as you are right. So whether you're right or wrong -- Be exceptional at it. That's morality.""and ""I love you grandpa.""Thank you Paul and the rest of the developers behind Immortal Defense. I'll never forget this.

												Immortal Defense is one heck of a tower defense game. It has a fairly well-written story, interesting towers, and psychedelic visuals. It seems to have some trouble with balancing difficulty for the 6th chapter. It also suffers from becoming a visual mess at times when enemies and bullets are all over the screen. Still, it’s far from a traditional tower defense game which makes it worth a look if you enjoy the genre.Let’s start with the story. It’s delivered with character portraits and text at the beginning of a level. It covers a wide range of different themes including loneliness and finding purpose in life. The villains are as interesting as the protagonist’s own character development and oh boy, do you develop. You see, you were a person once, but a gargantuan invading force became stranded and started to wreak havoc in your space. You sacrificed your humanity to become an immortal “Path Defender” in order to protect your family and planet from all threats by placing towers to interfere with enemy space travel. Only after becoming a path defender do we see the kind of toll it takes on an individual and it’s an interesting and long journey to behold. The characters that you meet along the way grow with you and the events that unfold take place on a grand scale. It’s not a Disney movie and aims to be a more thoughtful, sobering experience. It’s like a very long fable. All unlocked story bits are filed under History, just in case some of the longer levels cause you to forget what’s happening. I just wish the writing didn’t keep on driving the point home towards the end after becoming fairly obvious. It felt like the writer was saying, “Do you get it yet? Do you? Well!?” Other than that, it’s probably the best story I’ve experienced for a tower defense game.I enjoyed the different towers (Points) this game had to offer. Some of them were strange and took some learning to use. Each tower has seven levels and the last one tends to act as an ultimate form which can drastically change its behavior. For example, the Circuit Point draws a line to another Circuit Point which damages enemies that pass over it. They can also connect to your mouse cursor if it’s in range. At level 7, they have virtually infinite range and can attach to each other across entire levels. In addition to that, the medals (Achievements) that you unlock can enhance specific towers or make other changes like a faster charge-up time for the mouse cursor abilities which include bursts of bullets or gathering the bullets of your various Points into a specific enemy cluster. In the Circuit Point’s case, it’ll connect to Love Points for half-damage which can result in deadly laser grids for enemy spaceships.As another example, the Limited Point targets the highest HP target available with a rapid fire barrage. The medal you can earn by completing a side-quest causes the projectiles of other Points to home in on targets within the Limited Point’s range. The Courage Point fires a piercing projectile with each level adding another projectile except for the seventh which causes it fire rapidly instead. Its projectiles can also wrap around the screen. These towers make you think about placement differently than other games in the genre which usually results in a fun time and one eye-melting light show.The bullets fired from all Points, the mouse cursor, the enemy ships and projectiles, the Path lighting up, and the level being near the end all contribute their visual effects which can make upgrading towers or just seeing what’s going on difficult at times. The pause button takes you to a pause screen instead of letting you look at the map which I didn’t like. Even if you tone down the visual effects, it can still be a mess, but more manageable. Keep that in mind if you’re having trouble seeing what’s going on when there are hundreds of things on the screen.Since we’re on the topic of settings, did you know the game has an easily adjustable difficulty slider? You can make changes between levels and the game is set to 50% by default which provides a pretty smooth experience for the campaign. I had to make some severe adjustments when I started nearing the end. The last 6-7 levels of the final chapter were very difficult, even with the slider all the way to the left at 0%. Some of the side-quests were also brutally difficult. I had more trouble with those than anything else. On the bright side, there are dozens upon dozens of levels for you to conquer which resulted in around 18-19 hours to beat the game.Finally, I’d recommend hitting up the Confused? section to read the backstory. There are plenty of helpful tips in there about the game’s mechanics too which is great since some of them aren’t very obvious. I’d definitely give it a look periodically while going through the first chapter. I’d also like to revisit medals and say that I definitely enjoyed the impact they had on gameplay. You can only activate a limited amount of them at a time though which made me sad since I love obtaining obscene amounts of power, but the developer seems to favor “balance.” Psh, whatever. I should also note that the developer has been making careful updates to the game to make it more balanced and better over time which I appreciate. I was going to mention that the Endless levels were taking so long to resolve that I had to sabotage myself, but then a recent update was pushed out that solved that problem. Very nice.If you’re looking for a non-traditional tower defense experience, Immortal Defense is a strong pick. It’s not a perfect game and the visuals might be an acquired taste, but I enjoyed the wildly different towers and the game’s plot. I hope Saturated Dreamers turns out just as well. "

Immortal Defense has become my new all-time favorite tower defense game. Why? It's totally original, got a great story (which never happens in this genre), and has a great indie game feel. I will also add that the music is fantastic, and there is a ton of replay value here. At five hours in, I think I'm probably through 15% of the content. I'm not even considering the level editor.Essentially, the core mechanic is the tried-and-true tower defense system, but there is a layer of abstraction that ties into the story line. Trust me that it plays *much* better than it looks in the trailer. Also beware that there is a learning curve to figure out how things work. After reading the detailed notes, you will find there is a bunch of stuff going on under the hood that you wouldn't expect (almost has that 'knowledge is power' thing going like in roguelikes).Pros:+Totally original take on the tower defense genre - and it's all done remarkably well+Mouse is the only thing you need+So much content that it's kind of mind boggling, plus a level editor+Story is fresh and engaging+Music is outstanding+Runs on a toaster+Part 2 is in the works!!Cons:-There is a learning curve; for the first hour I was pretty confused (and am totally still learning stuff) so I'd recommend clicking that 'confused' button in the main menu if you are scratching your headAny fan of tower defense needs this in their library.

												It doesn't look like much, with graphics that would be more at home in a game made on the turn of the millenium, but I struggle to imagine how the bizarre setting of pathspace the game is set in could be presented another way.This game is Tower Defence at its WEIRDEST. And this always sounds corny on reviews I read but boy is it story driven. Like, basically as advertised.Great game to drop in and out of, the game boots quickly and each individual stage is less than 10 minutes (barring the tiny handful of 'endless' stages) and no sound-only cues, so you can play it on the fly between stuff.I'm not some kind of Tower Defence conneisseur, I've only played a handful before playing ID, but it has more space for unusual synergies and complex mechanics than any lauded TD game I've played previously.

												A good story in a well-balanced tower defense game.The story takes a while to get going, and you'll never see the whole thing if you're not interested in the gameplay. But the late-game twists definitely make the game worth a look. In a nutshell, the plot explores the difficulties that go along with immortality. The writing never feels particularly artificial and it's well paced with regard to the gameplay.The gameplay can get a bit repetitive toward the end, but I think it's novel enough to keep going. Your 'points' (towers) take the names of various emotions or mental states. There are about ten points-- of those, I think that four or five are truly unique among games of this genre.Your currency carries over from level to level, so you're incentivized to perfect a level with the least possible investment. This means that there's reason to repeat levels, and if you're like me you'll find yourself doing so over and over again. There are also difficulty levels (with higher difficulty resulting in more currency), tower-specific challenges, and a badge system.Overall, I'd certainly recommend this to any fan of the tower defense genre.

												Such an odd game, but in a good way. As a fan of tower defense games, or as this game calls it pathdefence or pathspace, this is a refreshing one. The towers or weapons have personality and say things throughout the level. Like most other tower defense games you gain points, or cache, by killing enemies and use them to place more towers or upgrade them. Probably the most important feature of this game is how you kill, or mostly slow enemies down later in the game, by shooting them with your cursor. It will shoot the enemy closest to your cursor but you can click on specific enemy once to lock on to it. Awesome visuals, great characters, dank story. A refreshing twist on tower defense that I recommend.			"

												Some of you have probably been waiting for this game to pop up. I considered about where to put it for a little while before eventually deciding to have it be at the very end. That's because, in my opinion, Immortal Defense is the best tower defense on Steam at the moment.The peaceful planet Dukis finds itself under attack by the evil Bavakh empire, a war-faring race of red, devilish aliens. Their armadas are vast, and with no notable army of their own Dukis is no match. However, they have one trick up their sleeve: Subject K, who has volunteered to be a Path Defender, a process that involves separating his soul from his body and sending it up into space. It's unclear whether K represents one of his names, or whether he's the eleventh person they've tried this with. Once up there, K gains the ability to see the Bavakh's ships as they move through Pathspace (basically hyperspace), and the power to attack and destroy them before they reach their destination.You control Subject K's essence in the form of the cursor, and bringing it next to an enemy will cause him to shoot at it automatically. You can also hold the right mouse button to charge up a bigger attack. That's all for the first two levels, but then you start getting access to Point's, this game's version of towers. All of them are some aspect of K's self - your first is Fear, for example, which shoots at enemies to reduce their defense and stun them. Simple enough, but that's about the only straightforward Point of the bunch. Courage will spray inaccurate, piercing shots which wrap around the screen; Pride starts off weak, but gains damage as it destroys enemies until it's powerful enough to one shot almost anything. Orthro is inexpensive to upgrade and deals splash damage, but only fires in the cardinal directions. The store description says you haven't seen towers like this in a game before, and that still holds up almost ten years after the game's release. All of them have some use, and in the late-game it feels like you're on the other end of a bullet hell shooter at times.Your enemies are also unique, and dangerous. Several of them buff others or mess with your Points' shots, requiring you to snipe them personally with your cursor's damage and other abilities. Some levels can be quite difficult thanks to them, but the game has a large difficulty slider; at zero things are pretty easy, while at maximum the levels show everything they're capable of. The game balance is designed to make you use the slider often, as the resources you have on hand to place points persists throughout levels. That's meant to encourage you to find more efficient ways of beating them rather than just spamming points everywhere, but if need be you can set a level lower and come back to it at another point; beating the previous level with higher resources changes the amount you start the next.Immortal Defense is split into six campaigns, each of which have fifteen stages, and tell a particular period of K's time as a Path Defender. I haven't talked about the stories each game has had in this series much, and that's because they're generally unimportant and not memorable. Immortal Defense's story, meanwhile, is shockingly good. In a lot of other games that premise would just be an excuse for the gameplay, but here it's examined quite thoroughly. Up in Pathspace, K has no-one to communicate with safe for brief messages from his home world, and other Path Defenders. All he knows is destruction, with the knowledge that if he fails, his home may very well be destroyed. What would an existence like that do to someone? Would they be able to stay true to why they came up there to begin with? It asks these questions with simple text at the beginning of each level, and does it well.In the audio-visual department, Immortal Defense also excels. While only made in Game Maker, the levels have a lot of special effects and touches to them to really emphasize how otherworldly Pathspace is; the path itself will appear to bend and stretch depending on where you move your cursor, and enemies will appear transparent until you move close. The game's soundtrack is quite varied, from heroic and uplifting to quiet and mournful, and will play randomly in levels, which is neat. Throughout levels your Points will also make commentary when they destroy enemies or get upgraded by you.With all the main levels Immortal Defense is quite a substantial game (the store says it's about twenty hours, but I think that's underestimating it quite a bit), and there are also several mini-campaigns featuring your Points which test how familiar you are with their strengths and weaknesses. Those, among many other things, unlock medals, in-game achievements that apply bonuses. Some are minor, while others, such as ones that affect Points, can give you a major advantage. I'm about finished with the game after I went back to redo levels at max difficulty, and I have about ninety hours, so it's quite a good value at ten dollars.Overall I'd say Immortal Defense is pretty close to perfect. The gameplay is enjoyable, it ties into an engaging story, it looks great despite it's age, and does a lot of unique things. I'm not sure how many people own it, but that number deserves to be much higher. Out of all the games I've talked about this month, if I had to pick one I'd recommend the most, it would be this one.			"

Place towers along a curving path and assist your towers during each wave with your own ship-cursor's regular and high-power shots.  Many towers react with each other, or with your own attacks to deepen the gameplay.  Each level has an evocative introduction that casts new light on what you're doing.			"

												TL;DR: Immortal Defense is the one of the best, if not the best game in the tower defense genre.ID is extremely well designed, the towers (called points) are diverse such that each type fills a particular niche, and the gameplay is compelling and challenging. For example, you amass the resources you spend to build points by beating stages. When you start a stage, you can decide the difficulty at which you would like to attempt the stage. Increasing the difficulty makes the stage harder, but also increases the amount of resources you earn by completing the stage. Playing the stage at a lower difficulty is useful for advancing the story and unlocking new abilities. There is no strategic disadvantage to playing stages at a lower difficulty, as you can go back after the fact and replay those stages at a higher difficulty. Rewards that you earn will be retroactively applied to your current resources, if they are higher than your previous high score on that stage.The game has really interesting visuals, resembling some sort of psychadelic screen saver when all the effects are turned on. The soundtrack is similarly interesting. The background music is mostly a moody and dark orchestral score. The different types of points and enemies have unique sound effects when they interact. The combination of these causes particularly busy stages where you build a lot of points to sound like the product of some mad composer. The story is also compellingly weird, and there were times I found myself motivated to complete stages in order to discover more of the narrative (which trickles in bit by bit at the beginning of each stage).I don't know if Immortal Defense was a labor of love, but it definitely feels like a lot of time, thought, and effort has been spent on refining it. If you're a fan of the tower defense genre, you'll definitely enjoy Immortal Defense.			"

												Oh gods. I cannot recommend this hard enough.This is the best tower defense game there is, hands down.  Not for its mechanics--there are other TDs with more interesting mechanics--although ID's towers are very well desgined.  No, this one is the best because of its *story.*I'm so glad this game made it to Steam, I bought it ages ago almost before Steam existed.  It was deep, entertaining, thrilling, and compelling.  Everything about this game comes together in a way that makes any individual element absolutely neccessary: you couldn't remove one thing and have the same game or a better game, no you'd be missing a vital element.Try the demo, its pretty good, but that's basically ""Act 1"" (of four or five).  It wasn't until somewhere near the end that the story hit hard and made me go ""wow.""			"

												Such an odd game, but in a good way. As a fan of tower defense games, or as this game calls it pathdefence or pathspace, this is a refreshing one. The towers or weapons have personality and say things throughout the level. Like most other tower defense games you gain points, or cache, by killing enemies and use them to place more towers or upgrade them. Probably the most important feature of this game is how you kill, or mostly slow enemies down later in the game, by shooting them with your cursor. It will shoot the enemy closest to your cursor but you can click on specific enemy once to lock on to it. Awesome visuals, great characters, dank story. A refreshing twist on tower defense that I recommend.			"

												One of the best and most unique games in the Tower Defense genre. The story and gameplay mechanics are thoughtfully melded together, the towers are each unique and fun to use, and your mouse cursor attacking enemies gives you something to do during waves without too much pressure.This steam rerelease modernizes the graphics a bit along with making the game work at all with newer versions of Windows. For some reason the options are set to extremely low graphical fidelity and you can almost definitely enable maximum on every setting on whatever computer you have today. The UI looked dated when Immortal Defense was originally released, and it unsurprisingly still does, but that's a very minor quibble that you won't even notice after a few levels.			"

												Yeah, it's tower defence, and yeah, the trailer and screenshots are all kinds of 'I have no idea what's happening here' [Edit: I think the trailer's been updated and is clearer now], but trust me on this: if you like TD, this is a no brainer. If you don't like TD it's still absolutely worth a look.It's not only my favourite tower defence game, but it's one of my favourite games, full stop. I loved it back in 2009 when I first played it and this new Steam version comes with a raft of improvements over the original, hence why I'm playing it again. It still holds up beautifully.In Immortal Defense, you have given up your world and physical body to become an immortal defender in 'pathspace', a dimension above phasewarp. There, you are but a ghost to the Bavakh, one of the most tyrannical races in the galaxy, who are using hyperspace to attack your home planet Dukis. As a path defender you focus aspects of your will -- fear, love, courage, pride, precision and others -- to form 'points' (the towers of ID) to stop the Bavakh. This is how the game begins, but it's far, far away from where it ends.So what makes it special? It's many things. It's the haunting story, the turns it takes and the themes it deals with. It's the hugely inventive and unusual towers. It's the way the mouse pointer is used as its own tower; shooting, charging shots and synergising with other towers in powerful and unexpected ways. It's the kaleidoscopic visuals, the warbling, droning sounds and the crystalline shattering of enemies as they bleed and streak light across the screen. It's the strange enemy designs and their unusual abilities. It's the rousing and understated soundtrack. It's the many challenging levels (and the new challenge stages which restrict what towers you can place, encouraging you to use them more effectively). It's the little things like kill counts per tower so you can gauge how effective your layouts are, or the recycle value of a tower degrading over time so a quick placement mistake won't punish you-- and mass end-of-level-selling won't help. It's your cache rolling over from one level to the next to encourage efficiency. It's the endless simulated assaults bookending each chapter, testing what you've learnt and ultimately determining how much cache you start the next chapter with. It's the level editor and the bundled fan levels, the detailed in-game manual, the leaderboards (if you're into that kind of thing), the ability to slow down time when things get manic (or speed it up if your line's holding)... and more.At £6.99, or $10(ish), it's an absolute steal for a game this unique, heartfelt, evocative, clever, challenging and brimming with content.

												Don't let my lack of time on this game fool you; I purchased and played it long before it was Steam. But once I learned that it was, the creator of the game hooked me up with a key right quick. Good guy. This is one of my favorite indie games, and here's why. It's not because I'm a big fan of tower defense games (I am, mind you, but that's not why.) On a purely mechanical level, this game is a very unique take on the TD formula, so it's worth a try even if you're not, historically, a fan. But it's more than mechanics that make this game memorable to me. No, it's the story. Immortal Defense contains within it a phenominally-written science fiction story. Deep, intense, and positively heartrending. After completing this game for the first time, I had to go and have a lie-down to process what I just experienced. It left me completely and utterly drained in a way that few stories have before. And that, combined with the above, is why Immortal Defense is worth playing, and why it will reach deep inside of you with just four words. (When you finish the game, you'll know what those four words are.)			"

												Immortal Defense is an amazing tower defense game that's only gotten better over the years.  It's has a very unique story along with beautiful motion visuals and hours of great gameplay.  Instead of plotting through mazes, enemies are taken along a pre-set line, and you must use a series of incredibly diverse and cooperative towers to dispose of the various waves.  Like many other modern tower defense games, your player (cursor) also plays a big role, except this was added before the feature was common, yet still has more complexities and uses than the others.  Additionally, the story is probably the best ever in tower defense, there are plenty of levels and challenges, and it now has added badges/achievements to obsess over, which give you significant in-game bonuses along with bragging rights.I really don't have anything negative I can add about it.  There is a demo around somewhere if you'd like to try it first, but it's easily worth the full price.			"

												Decently fun tower defence game, story drew me in well enough. Gameplay is quite creative and you're actually involved enough as a player that it doesn't feel like you're waiting inactivly after the towers are placed. The game does bog down slightly towards the end once you've gotten every variety of tower and most enemies have been introduced, especially noticeable in the very end campaign. The variety of both towers and enemies up until that point kept the game very fresh, it's certainly a game I would recommend giving a go if you have the time, certainly if you're a fan of the genre; It does have the distinction of being the first tower defence game I have actually played for a decent amount of time and finished. A final mention is that I quite liked how achievements were handled, actually getting something concrete rather than a useless note on your game profile.			"

												While there are no shortage of tower defense games in the steam marketplace, if you enjoy the genre then you should give this one a go.The visuals and story feel like an old sci-fi serial, with nonsensical names and trippy colored backgrounds creating a vibrant space as you play, the tower types each add their own personalities into the story... it all works pretty well to keep you engaged.The cursor acts as a tower as well, firing a steady stream of damage that gets larger as the round progresses, allowing you to prioritize the enemies at your door instead of feeling helpless.The tower types are fantastic though, with firing patterns that match their personalities and they cause you to think about where they should be placed to maximize effectiveness which is one of the tennants of TD as a whole.Overall, this game is well priced for the experience, has a ton of customization and creativity involved (Custom levels and diffficulty settings) and is chock full of enjoyable content.

												Immortal Defense is a complex yet rewarding tower defense game. The story is unusual and i would go as far as to say the best i have seen/read in a tower defense game to date.Once you understand the gameplay mechanics and what the ""towers"" do this game comes into its own, its fast, furious and fun all at once.The visual style is great yet simple and some of the particle effects are mesmerizing! The music is really great too, I especially love the hub screen music!Highly recommended			"

												Amazing Tower Defense game. The screenshots might make it look like some mess of a bullet hell shooter, but it's actually easy to keep track of what's going on (usually, some levels are intense).The towers all have their own unique gimmicks, much more than the standard Fast Tower, Slow Tower, AOE Tower, etc.Your cursor shoots, so you're never sitting back waiting for the level to end, you get to be involved!The story is weird, but believable, and there are great twists and turns.

												I just can't continuing play this game.The graphics and UI design remind me games from 80-x. It hurts my eyes. Music is annoying. Sounds effetts are terrible. The sound of attack of the main unit which repeats every ~0.4s made my ears bleed.Probably there is a really good story. Probably, there are challenging levels and a nice level design. I just can't play this game anymore because this game makes me suffer. I don't recommend Immortal Defense.			"
