												After having played this game for a fair share of hours (~300 by now) I feel like I am able to give an acceptable review.Updated: With the major update for Wakfu on the 9th September 2014 there was quite something added and I will try my best to include it as well.What's Wakfu?Wakfu is a turn based Strategy-MMO that, to me, feels like a love-child between Ragnarok Online and Fire Emblem. And I love it.The player is able to impact the actual economy of the world, meaning that animals, plants and trees have to be taken care of and replanted to keep the natural balance.If that is not the case a species will go endangered or even extinct. Each nation's political system is governed by players that were voted into their ranks by others. They set the law, breaking those will result in you becoming an outlaw. Players joining the guards of their nation can hunt down outlaws and put them in jail to atone for their sins. Justice!The graphics may seem not up to date on first glance, however when playing the game one will notice that there is actually a high level of detail in everything.To sum up what I like and dislike:Pros:+ Free2Play: There is a Cash shop, however it only sells cosmetic items or Sidekicks that can also be acquired with ingame gold (Kama) instead. You can get your hands on anything without paying a cent as there are many players that sell cash shop items or currency.+ 15 classes with three elemental specialisations to choose from.+ 17 professions and you can master them all in one character at the same time if you want to.+ Strategic gameplay as your composition and line-up can determine success or fail.+ Up to two mercenaries (sidekicks) that can help you in solo and even teamplay to substitute missing players/friends+ Economical System depending on players (Fun fact, the money that circulates through servers is player crafted too)+ Nations (4) and a political system governed by players (Nations can wage war against each other)Updated - There is now a fifth Bandit Nation players can join.+ Many secret places or recipes(!) one can discover in the world that will reward you handsomely.+ can be played casually+ It's damn cuteCons:- The starting area (lvl 1-10): Astrub is not a fun place. You can get out of it luckily in less than an half hour and join a nation. However it wants you to do a few quests that are not fun to do in my opinion and probably put-off a fair share of people before they even really ever started the game.Updated - The whole starting Area was revamped into something much better!- Steam and Wakfu: If you wish to play the game via steam, you do not necessarily need an Ankama account, HOWEVER I highly recommend one to you. As you will not be able to play Wakfu whenever steam has connections issues to your server.Updated - You are now able to login with your steam account on the Ankama website that allows you to have all conveniences Ankama Account users have. The server connection problems however may remain.- Region bound servers- Java: the game runs on java and everyone who played minecraft knows that java's RAM allocation is not great by default for games and you will need to allocate more by customising yours under your system settings. Else after hours of gameplay your wakfu client may slowly start to lag more and more until you relog.- Positioning and Terrain: in rare occasions certain big tiles of the map like pillars or similar make it hard to actually click ""behind"" them to position your character there.- Support: Even though I have had an okay experience with the support myself so far, everyone that I have met that had/has severe problems ingame has huge troubles with the support, to the point it feels about non-existent.- Grindy: Not a problem to me but I know there's a fair share of people that dislike grinding.I personally love it and have to admit I have not yet had a game like this and thus it is nice to enjoy something different.So I would give it an 8/10p.s. It has a great anime-like cartoon with two seasons that you should watch!			"

												As a particular lover of turn based games and role playing games in general, I decided to give a try to this MMO. Once he landed on Steam, I got into the beta and started to enjoy the universe of the World of the Twelve.Despite having few hours compared to many other players, I can say this game is actually enjoyable and well made. However, there are some factors that could lead some people to avoid this title for various reasons. Let's analize every detail of the game. If you want to skip the wall of text, just go to the end, where there's a short version.GRAPHICSThe graphic is 2,5D Cartoonish - Style, similar to animes. I like it, but somebody may not appreciate it. Colourful environments, characters and enemies (aka mobs).However, sometimes you'll encouter a bunch of graphical bugs like invisible enemies, sidekicks not appearing, your avatar being nude (yes, you heard it right!) or colors that make your eyes to cry blood (phosphorescent enemies).At last, talking about the active parts of the game, while the enemies are well made and be distinghuished between their gender, the characters (not including npcs) tend to be more feminine. If you give a try to the game, you'll notice that even the males look like females.SOUNDThere isn't so much to say about the sound. Each sector has its own, enjoyable track, including islands. The only bug you may encounter is an infinite loop after the dungeon of Zeppelantern.GAMEPLAYHere we come, in the longest part of the review. Let's start with the choice of your avatar. You can choose between 15 different races, each one with its peculiarities and abilities. You can even decide if you want to have a male or a female, with the exception of the foggernaut (it's a robot!).Regarding the gamestyle, it's a turn - based game during the fights against the mobs and the other players, while it's in real time during your journeys, explorations, harvests and crafts. Yes, because in this game you don't only get experience by killing tons of monsters or by completing dungeons you may access with specific keys and after you reach certain levels, but you can also produce your own items by collecting the resources in the environment and by crafting them in specific workshops.You can also decide to group with some other people (or recruit up to 2 sidekicks) to face evil forces or stronger enemies that you couldn't defeat if you were alone.Now the negative aspects of the gameplay. The tutorial itself is kinda crappy, made not properly because it teaches you only some parts of the game. It's useful just to know how's the interface, how to fight and how to collect and plant the enemies in the field in order to generate a wave of monsters to fight. Ah yeah, also to get the starting experience when you'll start with the real game itself.The second most negative aspect is the interface. It isn't intuitive at the beginning, you can't move nor rotate the camera while you're in real time (but you can zoom in and out), while in the turn-based combats you can move it in a way the game doesn't explain. In fact, it doesn't tell you that holding the right button of the mouse and moving the cursor on the borders of your screen will allow you to see the entire battlefield.And, at last, the quest system of the main missions is kinda...lame. You don't get involved in the main story and you do just some random quests in order to get experience and your first and only free sidekick. But, considering how's the game, you don't play it surely for the main quests.GAME SYSTEMThe game is totally f2p. You're granted access to every part of the game (with the exception of the last 2 islands introduced not long ago), you can choose a nation at level 18 and do every kind of job. The nation system will allow you to player versus player fights and each nation has its own peculiarities. You're granted a free sidekick you can keep forever with every single character you make (until 5 per account) plus a free additional sidekick with a weekly rotation system.The real money allows you to buy the sidekicks and keep them forever, cosmetics, costumes and booster packs that let you drop more loot and get more experience (in a small percentage however) plus the access to the last 2 optional islands. However, these zones are reserved for characters around level 140+.SHORT VERSIONPROS- 15 races to choose from, with possibility of gender changing, that can reach until level 200.- Different zones and islands to explore, with a huge variety of enemies- 4 Nations to choose from, each one with its dominant element and peculiarities.- PVP, Guilds and PVE system- Huge quantity of dungeons, with specific dungeons you may find only in a certain nation- Rewarding system well made- Great variety of jobs, in harvesting and crafting, letting you to get your own items and to collect kamas (the game currency) fastly- Colourful graphics- Good sound system- Mobs having ehm...sex?CONS- Shabby tutorial that teaches few things compared to the real potential.- Not-so intuitive interface- Main quests system not involving and realized superficially- Might be boring if you focus only on getting experience- Requires a lot of time and patience, 2 things that most people don't own...unfortunately.I recommend to try this game at least once to every kind of afficionado of rpgs/mmorpgs. However, if you are included in one of the following categories I'm enlisting, just don't play this game:a) You don't like turn based gamesb) The story and the drama in a game is everything for youc) The graphics is the most important thing for youd) Anime haterse) Average Call of Duty player			"

												I have put a lot of time into this game. I admit, it does speak to an extremely small crowd due to the nature of the genre of game + the amount of grind you must devote. I still have a long way to go before max level (Current level 144, max is 170) So you see it does take a LONGGGG time. If you are fans of disgaea/fire emblem/other turn-based strategy game it MAY or MAY NOT be for you. You must not enter the game with the wrong mindset, and you must find others to play with. The content of the game becomes very difficult and without other players to team up with you are going to have a bad time. The community driven aspect of this game is amazing and this game has one of the best communities I've been a part of. THE BAD:If you are starting this game you are going to become overwhelmed in which skills to level, and which specialties to level in which order. I admit that does suck, but there are plenty of guides out there for each class. Another thing you should do is actually read the skills instead of just blindly following a guide. I still learn new strategies/perks on my character everyday!I hope this gives a good representation of the game; My hours speak for me and I love it!			"

												A great game, ruined by non-existent support and a capricious developer team.  Everything about the game is completely fantastic and thoughtful and fills a niche that no other multiplayer game really captures.  I couldn't say enough nice things about it.All of that comes apart though when you encounter any problems.  Did a glitch eat your stuff?  Tough.  Sending a request to the support group will result in nothing.  Did your class get nerfed right out from under you with no explanation?  Too bad, buy a class change scroll from the cash store for $40, it's your own fault for having played the class.If the game's developers had any kind of meaningful dialogue with the players instead of acting like the invisible hand of an angry god, if the community staff actually fostered some kind of two-way communication instead of just passing on the sparse edicts from higher-ups, and if the support team had the people and resources to fix problems for players, Wakfu would be amazing.Instead I warn people against investing their time or money in this game, and it's a terrible shame because it has brilliant potential.

												The game is decent, but Ankama is probably the worst game company i've ever dealt with. Their support is horrible, and they blantantly rob you. If you are thinking of purchasing anything, don't! Their ''security'' system will ban you within 24 hours, and Ankama will say ""Your account was banned for an unauthorized payment. Please provide an arm, a leg, and sacificed 50 virgins and we will consider processing your request.""That's if you can even get a reply out of them. Good luck.If you don't believe me, check the forums. This has been happening to people for 2+ years, and ankama still doesn't g.a.f.Good game, ran by idiots.			"

												Wakfu is a brilliant game. Wakfu has its own taste, its own style. All characters are different, all builds are reliable, all groups are potent. It have some problems today, like economics breaches and balance issues, but all of them will be fixed sooner or later. Graphics, musics and so are just perfect. Wakfu is a game with soul. Yes, this soul is full of grind, but even coop grind is fun in Wakfu. This game has very good potential.			"

												Don't let the words, free to play MMO fool you. This game is pretty unique.I've been playing this game for about 4 years (closed beta) and have sunk in hundreds, if not thousands of hours.This game is like Final Fantasy Tactics, to a lesser extent Fire Emblem. If you're a fan of Tactics games or SRPGs read no further, Play the game!I guess a big deciding factor on whether this game is worth your time is the ""pay to play"" question.The sidekicks can be bought but are on a free rotation in game, a sidekick largely just makes the game more fun to play alone and you'll be using them to fill unfilled spaces in groups. They may save you if you get attacked by another player and you're alone but otherwise their purpose is largely convenience.XP boosts are pretty self explanatory, however premium members get a large boost on alt accounts.There used to be an armour/ weapon set but it seems to be gone now.Items are otherwise cosmetic.So, the game?Amazing.This is about as high standard as I could possibly ask for a 2D game.Combat is played out on a grid, players move their characters on the grid and use abilities to carry out attacks, your weapon is essentially 1 customizable ability. If you've played Final Fantasy Tactics. you're at home.The game gives you control over a single character, you will most likely be playing with other people. Seriously, go get yourself into a guild or get some friends together, this game is best played with others. It's all about teamwork, and few games do it so well. You'll quickly learn strategies for the different people you play with, and that moment when someone is just about dead but you pull them through by a thread, using some crazy tactic that only just worked. It's beautful.The game is still fun alone, but much less so. You'll want to use your alone time grinding professions, though as far as grinding goes Wakfu certainly isn't offensive. You've always got something to do.Levelling can be slow though, this is probably less of a problem now and should continue that way as they add new content. It can get a bit samey, but find a good bunch of people and you'll be right.I think this is Wakfu's biggest strength, it's great at creating a friendly atmosphere and having fun with others. You take turns in fights so you'll be spending the rest of the time co-ordinating the team in chat or just having a laugh. Wakfu is the only MMO i've found that really gets the social aspect right.The ecology can be a real pain. People don't care about killing off species so be sure to carry animal 'seed' with you, but doubly so if you want to get into logging or herbs. Despite the annoyance the fact the game takes ecology into account at all is fantastic, you can hunt animals to extiction and level forests.You get respecs every so often but be careful with the stats you level, they're permenant. Chances are this won't be a hassle, you'll be given a respec at lvl 30 which is about the time you'll have worked out what you're doing.The classes are really interesting, 15 classes but each has 3 elements. The elements act as sub-classes and they have drastically different roles. Water = support/ healer, Earth = Tank/ slow DPS, Fire = DPS/ Nuke, Air = Crowd control, fast DPS; but this varies a lot between classes. It's best to specilize in one element, sometimes two. You'll have about 9 spells you'll likely be working with, the classes do a good job of being simple yet deceptively complex.Pretty soon you'll be in a guild, it's really the only way to play. The PvP is pretty fun too. There are disputed territories players fight over and people can just attack others on the street. These situations are where you'll be really pushing for every tactical advantage, it's often less about min/maxing like in other MMO's and more just getting together and responding to a situation with whatever you've got.There's a political system but you'd have to have played the game a hell of a lot to get into that. There's weather systems and a very in depth crafting/ proffesions system, from handymen who make dungeon access keys and inventory upgrades to chefs who give buffs and weapon smiths.So cons,The game in steam launches a launcher which downloads updates. Would have been nice to remove this. Steam ID's work in game though so no signing up to third party garbage.There's a lack of quests, the game is meant to be player driven but that can mean less to do for people playing alone.you'll likely level your character faster than you'll level your proffesions which can mean it takes a while before crafting has a benefit.Level up points are permanant and if you're not careful you'll be caused some grief on your first character.No female foggernaut.Balance has been a bit shaky in the past, things are fairly good but some classes are definately more useful than others.Not quite a con but Ankama have been dragged kicking and screaming to the free to play model. They seem to have things fair currently but let's hope they don't screw it up again.I absolutely recomend this game			"

												I would love to give Wakfu an amazing review...I really would. And I would have a couple of months ago, when I was glued to the screen leveling up my Osamoda. Unfortnately, after over 1500 hours, I've come to the conclusion that Wakfu is a huge time-suck with no true, fulfilling end-game. I have created a huge assortment of characters, trying to figure out the spells and play-styles that suit me. And while I love the handful (five) I have ended up with (Osa, Sac, Masq, Sadida, Elio), they just aren't enough to hold me to the game. Starting a new character means reliving questlines over and again...some of which have not even been finished by the developers...but which sit in your quest log and stare at you...day-in and day-out (the developers are apparently working on these...but who knows how long the questlines have been waiting to be finished up. Instead, they release new holiday material and conveniently ignore gameplay that needs to be addressed). and the monotony of the quests becomes unbearable. Your char is sent across different maps to collect items and talk to various NPC's, and it's a never-ending pace of back-and-forth-back-and-forth. Nothing changes, even though your characters do. Still, quests are all a must-do if you want your char to have special items or open up new areas that are inaccessible otherwise. So, if you take on another character...and then another...expect that you'll be bored to tears speaking to Pappy Pal and chasing after books across Astrub to obtain your dragoturkey.Speaking of monotony...grinding is almost mandatory if you want to get anywhere. Professions can be ignored for only so long. Leveling each profession up takes a *lot* of time and patience. However, if you want to make kamas, you have to chop wood, pick herbs, trap animals, mine rocks, etc...as selling these items, or crafting with them, is the only way to really make kamas at the market. And the market is difficult to navigate, as searching for a particular item brings up only the cheapest for sale, instead of a list to choose from. This is frustrating for the simple fact that equipment is element based...and you're forced to spend kamas on equipment that you have to change to suit your particular elements...which also requires kamas. Dungeon runs gift you special coins with which to purchase new equipment, but the gear is often so expensive that it's not worth the time it takes to complete said dungeon the twenty or thirty times it takes to acquire said gear. And once acquired, that gear is linked to your character...so forget selling it at the market in hopes of upgrading to something else when the time arrives. Instead, you are forced into a grind of dun-runs. Quite often, the monotony becomes mind-numbing. Who honestly wants to pick 250 herbs or trap 250 animals just to level up a solitary profession one level---especially when each profession has 100 levels.Each new area opened quickly loses its appeal after battling its monsters and dungeons. I hit level 120 with two of my characters...and I am *still* awaiting something new to come along at level 132. Who knows when that will be. Probably never. My time with this game is quickly drawing to a close.PVP is, oftentimes, hugely unbalanced. Characters fifty levels over you can attack you (even if you have PVP deactivated), and there is absolutely no chance at making it out alive. And forget fairness. If you manage to combat a character around your level, and win the duel, you can be sure the player will log in with a much higher level char just to hunt you down and attack you---or call their higher level friends to do it for them. And you can be sure that some of the higher levels are strapped to the teeth with the best equipment/gear...courtesy of the cliques formed within guilds and groups. Also, fair warning: during PVP, you will be insulted, and often. If your enemy doesn't like your character or playstyle, expect to be called a plethora of rude names. And forget if you need help from Ankama. You pretty much have to sacrifice your unborn children to accomplish reporting a technical issue. They want detailed reports and multiple screenshots for each and every problem (no matter how small the problem is), and even after complying...very little is done to fix the problem(s).I loved this game at first. The graphics and music and spells and char classes are brilliant. But more thought needs to be put into the game and the gameplay. Because, as is, the hours spent in front of Wakfu are just not worth it when all is said and done.  "

												(3000+ hrs on their own game launcher)If you decide to play any of this company's (Ankama) games (Dofus, Dofus Touch, Wakfu, Krosmaga, Krosmaster, etc.), do NOT invest yourself in it.While the games are unique in their genre and quite fun, Ankama will not hesitate to f*** you over big time. I was simply addicted to their main MMO, Dofus, and I could just not take it anymore. They're the worst company I have ever seen.Support is non existent, for once. If you issue is more complicated than a password reset, support will NOT help you. You will often have to reopen your closed tickets several times for the support to actually read your message. Most of their answers are some copy pasted crap that does not fit your issue at all.Second, and it's not so bad in itself compared to the other stuff, their updates don't make any sense at all. Tomorrow they might decide they change the whole game without consulting the community and they'll just roll with it. One ''funny'' moment was when they lost half of their player base deciding to switch from version 1.29 to 2.0 on their main PC game, Dofus. There was no options to stay on the old game, they just switched everything over and RIP. Let's not talk about how they willingly ruined 1v1 PVP, or how they keep making the same mistakes over and over without ever improving (rollbacks, awful class changes, awful mechanic changes, etc.)Which leads me to my third point, which made me delete their games. They sometimes throw events out where you get 2 times the xp, drop, etc etc. Pretty cool, uh? Everyone makes sure they barely sleep at all to play as much as possible and farm like hell. But what they did recently was just too much. A player found a way to generate their in-game cash shop items for free (please note that the items in themselves were not generating any value outside cosmetics and that they were linked for 3 months to the account that bought them). This was on Tuesday, and was noticed by the staff on friday. The issue was leaked in the whole community, and Ankama was well aware of the issue. No communication on their end, however (like usual) and the double week end went on. Everyone played the game like mad monkeys, my friends and myself included. We didn't sleep. We did some incredible things, pushed several characters to the ultimate level and generated for $1500 worth of in-game currency (legitely).Well, when the week-end ended, they rollbacked everything up to friday morning. Not only did they wiped, without warning, all the player's efforts, they did not wipe everything that was generated because of the bug. No apologies, and they did not answer to alternative ways players bringed up (which were pleeeentiful and legitimate ways to fix the bug). They do that at least 2 times a year since they exist. If you ask for a compensation for a very specific item that dropped when you have 1% of getting it, and worth $400... The support will say too bad for you pal.They're just lazy, and don't care about you. They only care about what you're going to inject in their cash shop. There's so many games out there that are great and are worth your time. I don't recommend you give it or any money to Ankama. You can google their reviews yourself, starting with ''rollback'', and have a good laugh.Oh, that and Wakfu's dying with no plans on reviving it.RIP.			"

												Ok so when I saw this was free to play my first thought was 'Oh great... here we go again, another pay to win or donate your life savings into this game to be decent', but its turning out not to be the case at all.   This game is grindy and takes time, but if you want to just push buttons and feel good about yourself immediately, then this may not be your game and that's OK.  Sometimes however, effort required to do something makes it have more meaning, and if this is your thing you may just like this :DThe fact that I can do more in this Free to Play MMO -without restrictions- than I can when I buy a full version of a Total War Game which then gives me the 'chance' to buy a bunch of DLC, is a commentary in itself (on both games, despite different genre / game type and I am a HUGE Total War fan).*Items- lots of sense of humor with pets, armor, and misc items.  Sort of like the humor of Borderlands, but not quite.  (There's an NPC in a sewer named Donallangelo who essentially is a pun of Ninja Turtles, and pets like a Ghast have descriptions which read 'I ain't afraid of no ghast!' and so on)  Also, importantly, no restrictions on items that I can tell so far if you are free to play.*Great community - helpful and teamwork is essential.  Let's face it, many MMOs don't care to pretend about requiring teamwork - it's just login, get achievements, and feel good about pressing the level button.  This game is not that.  It's teamwork, has depth, and requires thought.  If that's not your thing - great!  Don't play.  Leave it for people who do because this makes for a great community that works together.*Graphics - pretty charming and actually really awesome artwork.*Class system - did I say there were what, 700 million classes?  Well maybe not THAT many, but at least 16. Yes 16, which if you can count as high as WoW classes, well then this is a LOT compared to many MMOs.  Beyond that, yea it's complicated ""Oh noes! Don't try! Too hard!"", wrong!  A game with some complexity is a great thing, its not going to hand you things, but its not going to stomp your face in either by giving you experience debt you need to clear by using item shop items (Runes of Magic).  Butt weight, there's more! (and yes those awful wrong use of word errors got your attention!):  You pick a class, then you have 5 tabs of stuff to put points into, so not only are there a ton of classes to pick from, but there's a very custom way you can build your char.  If you're not sure, look it up or ask someone.  Find a guild -*Guilds - did I say find a guild?  Find a guild!  Guilds matter in this game, and apparently there's even complicated politics with certain Nations owning certain regions etc.*Crafting - there's several paths to take, and you can do all professions.*It's free, and they give you a House, 5 character slots, you can wear all the gear, they let you use the AH, you can sell items remotely too apparently by dropping a bag and selling.*Gathering - there is this very cool anti-bot system, where if you are gathering it comes up like a 'fight' with this npc, but actually you and it just stand apart from one another and you have to select the same images around you as it has.  If you do this correctly, you get bonus resources and not just a few either.  Pretty sweet and easy!*Biomes - I don't even know what this is and I'm excited!  (:S  review pending here)  Also plenty of environments it seems and cool stuff in each.*Nations- player driven, can elect govenors of Nations, collect taxes, set foreign policy, control regions, etc.  Like Eve but without the crying about how broken capital ships are.*Pvp is a thing, more to come (tm).I'd say overall, having not spent any money on it, having joined a guild where folks are really helpful and kind, I would say check this game out.  It's free, all it costs you is bandwidth for a bit and you may find you like it. If not, you tried it and can move on to other games.Update:  still awesome :D			"

												Wakfu is...an experience. I am still going through my experience but from what I've played of it so far I can give a fair and detailed review of it. I will cover it in four sections; tutorial, gameplay, combat and community. I would also like to mention that I used to pay for and play this game when it was still in open beta about four to five years ago.Tutorial:The tutorial for Wakfu reminds me very much of the character actors at Didney Worl; they never break character. Your UI can give you all the information you need to break the fourth wall but when it comes time to learn from an NPC they will talk to you, the player, as if you are your character. The NPCs outside of the tutorial follow suit to this.Ankama has made one class exclusively for the tutorial which, in my mind seems rather pointless. Back in beta the reason I bothered going through the tutorial areas was so I could get a proper feel for my actual class before I committed to playing it. That said, you can opt to skip the tutorial. I wouldn't advise that if you are a brand spanking new player.Gameplay:Wakfu is what most people call a grindfest, but there is reason behind it I like to think. Monsters will drop items that are guaranteed to end up being used for something, no matter the level. Gear can either be combined into sets to be sold, worn or even ground into powder which can be refined into runes to improve the gear you use.Killing mobs and running quests aren't the only thing you can do in this game, you may also pick up professions. All of them in fact, conveniently located in the starter area known as Astrub. With this in mind a lot of players tend to lean towards one or the other based on their mood at the time. I personally rarely fight and would rather just go farm wheat fields.Combat:The combat in Wakfu is unique, something I've never seen in an MMORPG. Ever played Final Fantasy Tactics? This is it. You (and your teammates if you brought any) as well as monsters have a set initiative score, which is a stat you can increase. Those with higher initiative go first and you follow along a grid-based system to fight your enemies. Your character has access to a plethera of passive abilities (able to swap them out between battles on the fly as you unlock them), class-specific utility skills and three skill trees, each one has an element (meaning that you will have access to three of the four elements, I advise you to look through them when you make your character even if you haven't unlocked them).The player versus player content this game provides comes in some different ways, but ultimately ends up the exact same. There are four nations that you may pick from to be your home upon reaching level 15, with the option to join an outlaw nation at level 30... I wouldn't recommend this though and some people get confused. Let me break this down real quick, if you play this game and hit level 30 you'll recieve a quest called ""Riktus for a Day."" Do not complete this quest, you will automatically join the outlaw nation that only has one outpost in the ocean and are free game for anyone wherever you go. Aside from this, at level 30 you can opt to become a guard of your nation, sworn to protect the land from Riktus, eco-terrorists (will cover this in another section) and PKers.Another feature to note for combat are sidekicks. They are NPCs that can act as party members you control. They aren't as powerful or versatile as players but they get the job done when you need it. Part of the beginner quest is going through a dungeon, rewarding you at the end with an Astrub Knight. This is the only sidekick you get for free, with the addition of the free trial sidekick. Out of Ankama's list of sidekicks, one is chosen every so often as a free trial. Kind of a try before you buy sort of thing, this gives you the option of not only playing as yourself and the Astrub Knight, but a third teammate once every...I wanna say three weeks but I honestly never noticed. These guys don't offer what other players can provide and you can easily solo your way the entire game with a little patience, the sidekicks only offer you some help along the way.Overall the PvP in this game is pretty fun so long as you don't get stacked against someone much higher level than you.Community:As far as I've seen, pretty dead. I wish I could say this, but in the town hubs (Astrub and nation outposts) there are people everywhere. The further out you go you see less players though, most of them are hidden in small haven bags (which act as a portable home and player shop) either afk selling their wares or just plain afk. That said, if you're looking at only the game's point of view then you are sadly missing out, the wiki for this game is regularly updated and the forums always has people poking their heads in to say hello. That said, if you plan to play this game for a while then get into a guild ASAP, I suggest you head over to the forums to find one to your liking.Before I finish, I want to add that this game does have a cash shop. Is it pay to win? Not really, most of the things you can buy are either cosmetic or do really minor things. You can buy weapons but they don't compare to the gear you can find and make. You may also buy extra sidekicks which can help out, but aside from your Astrub Knight you have access to a different free trial sidekick every once in a while.Overall:Steam is asking me if I recommend this game and do I? I'm a little torn, but yes I do. This is a very fun game with combat mechanics that require you to actually think when things don't go as planned. The community is there and very friendly but only if you take the time to actually look for them. When you're feeling bored of grinding mobs, go grind resources! Its tedious but addicting after a while.TL;DRGame is fun, try it out. RTFR.			"

												I played this game for a couple years before it ported to steam.  The entire time I played, all I ever noticed was players leaving.   Every guild I was in, went defunct.  People stopped playing.  If you had followed the conversations on ankama's own forum, you would have seen alot of unhappy players complaining about things that never got changed or fixed for ther better over the years.  The games population bled out.  The it came to steam, and some new players showed up.  But not enough to replace the lost content.  The game was still empty.Many people who wanted to buy the games currency were unable.  Many peoples credit cards were being rejected for no apparent reason.   Popular content was being changed or nerfed or removed, and new, unpopular content was being added or built upon depite many complaints.   No explanations, no understanding of the ankama logic was to be had.Grouping for dungeons became obsolete with the return of the token system and people could just use their own store bought NPC groupies when they changed the loot requirments to allow NPC group members to count in the prospecting totals.  No longer needed a full group of actual players to get the best loot rolls.  They did that so everyone could compete with the multi boxers.Some people think it was a good thing, but it was actually bad.  They wouldnt just ban multiboxing....they should have.  Instead they embraced it.  Real players didnt like it, and quit the game.If you started playing the game now you would quickly discover how unpopulated the game is.   There once was a time when merhcant bags dotted the landscape and hordes of people hanging out at the temples.   The time has past and gone forever.Servers have been combined several times because their populations were so low.  Its only a matter of time before the game is finally put in the grave.  Its a tragedy.   This once great game is a mere shadow of its past glory.   The game is free to play of course...   waste your time on it if you choose.			"

												I am in now way a veteran or anything in Wakfu, but I did play enough during a reasonable ""quit & return"" period to have a say in the game's state.Wakfu is old, dying, and worse than all, run by what seems to be unqualified to do so individuals.Half the game's quests are missing, they simply stop, there isn't a progression, by what I understand, the game has been ""reworked"" a good bunch of times. It is buggy, grindy(excessively, you literally have to spend days clicking mobs outside of battle just to level necessary professions). The moderator team is... terrible, characters go missing, items get lost, people get banned for following mod's false instructions. The population is dwindling, most of them are vets who refuse to let go. The game is so barren you either need to find yourself 4+ friends to level together, or pay the subscription to unlock a system which allows you to control 6 characters yourself(such mmorpg like, woah). And I wont even go further into how unbalanced classes are.The game is a incomplete, unbalanced, bugged, money grabbing corpse of what it used to be.			"

												One of the most innovative and fun mmos I have played/seen EVER. I can't name a single other rpg where I even slighly cared about the economics or in-game politics, both of which were done so even the casual player easily understands the situation your country is in and even motivates you to get involved for rewards. The combat system, while generic, is fun enough with cool animations, decent enemy AI, and the large variety of skills you had at your disposal. However, the game is a buggy mess, the devs never listen, and somehow most updates make the game worse. The update that finally turned me away was sometime last year when the enire skill tree and progression system was gutted. Previously you earned skills in a certain tree by using skills in that tree, giving you freedom to build your character however you want and experiment. This update took that away and instead you stiffly and slowly go through all of the skills in all of your trees as you gain player level instead of the level of your skills. This basically doubled the level you need to be to get the skill loadout you want. Overall the game can be described as a mountain of wasted potential that continues to rot. But at least its free.

												I have been playing this game on and off since before it even came to steam, so my steam record is NOWHERE near what it should be if we count it all up. So, it is safe to say that I am a veteran player to this little tactical rpg.ProsCute, fun graphicsPlayer controlled marketPlayer controlled environmentDecent MusicLarge amount of contentDecent craftingIndividual housesConsANKAMA support has a reputation for being badNA servers are given no love everPlayer base only peaks on weekendsLeveling solo is a SEVERELY painful experienceConstant revamps of classes and HUDCash shopArguably, the market being player controlled and the environment being player controlled can be considered as both cons and pros, because there are just simply more people that will hack down trees/flowers/crops/mobs and not care to replant as opposed to those that attempt to regulate the environment. The market was fudged over by a duplication bug some time ago and well, you can add that to a list of bugs the developers haven't fixed since it happened.Most of the content updates over the last few YEARS has always been LATE GAME. So if you aren't at least level 140, don't bother looking it over, because you still have literal MONTHS of grind ahead of you if you just started. In fact, ANKAMA has made it to where the leveling system can cause even veterans of the game to simply quit because of how unfair it is. The game still has bugs in it from after they went from sub only to free to play, but you know, that content update is more important.With the recent changes to Astrub, it should be a lot friendlier to those just starting out, but it is more like it is preparing you for the other nations and the festival of non-stop grinding. Also, I have seen several times where the areas are completely erased of their resources and had my chat spammed by their ""helpful"" guide npcs screaming for someone to replant.I have watched this game revamp and revamp and revamp again, changing areas, leveling, classes, crafting, hell, they even changed out armor elemental stats to some form of praying to RNG Jesus that you get what you need and don't have to either grind out the resources to craft something to play the RNG on it again, or go look at the over priced market and hope someone is nice enough to list it reasonably.I could go into depth and detail of how FUN and EXCITING this game used to be, before it went free to play. Back when developers LISTENED and HELPED us actually get better at their game. When political wars MEANT something, and crafting was pretty damn USEFUL. When our classes weren't so CONFUSING and NERFED to the point of only three or four being actually viable to unkillable. PVP is so unbalanced that I would rather beat my head into a fence post than actually do it, as are most of the late game boss battles. They DESTROYED what used to be a new and exciting tactical rpg, and instead replaced it with whatever scraps they could patchwork together from their constant taking away and altering.This rant doesn't even begin to cover how broken you can become through the pay to win system. No, you can't buy armor sets or weapons from the shop, but you can get sidekicks or a hero system to bring in your other character's, so you wont have to bother with other people for leveling. You can buy special mounts and pets that will boost your stats to apoint where it might not matter what class you are playing. And if you don't like your class? Well, they have a solution for that to. Don't want to wait for that free reset after hitting a certain level, or grinding out the reset quest? Yep, they even have a fix for that. Want to level faster and get better loot while doing it? Also in the cash shop. Feel free to break your bank on the game, but oh don't forget, you can only do it through steam because the site's exchange GIVES OUT BETTER BUT IT HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR YEARS.TL;DRThis game could have been great. Instead it is a broken system split 90% grind, 5% accepting Ankama's bull*hit, 3% sitting in front of Pappy Pal's with the other veterans, 1.9% either fixing or breaking the ecosystem, 0.1% hoping it might one day get better because you haven't yet realized it never will.If you want to try it, go for it.I just can't recommend it in this state when I have played what could have been.

												Pros:-17 classes that feel 100% unique-Meaningful choices for leveling up-Fantastic lore that leaves much to investigate-Amazing combat system-Anime styleCons:-Devs don't speak English-Game has been stagnant for years-Things are constantly erased/replaced almost randomly-Continually dying playerbase-Highest populated servers (french) are locked from other countries-Can be buggyI've only clocked 131 hours on Steam, but I played for years on the normal client, and I've been on/off alpha/beta testing this game since 2006. I'll go into detail as to why I think this game is good and why I think the devs killed it years ago and are just milking what's left.Pro:The game is amazing. Period. If you like Fire Emblem or Tactics Ogre, this is the game for you. The characters are a bit cartoonish and anime-esque, but that just adds to the fun. The character designs are relatively unique and you feel a serious sense of accomplishment when you finally get the awesome-looking gear you want. You can choose out of 17 classes and, believe me, each one feels so dramatically different than the next that you'll be begging for the ability to just play them all at once.When you level up, you notice it. You'll constantly debate leveling up one stat or another to benefit you more. What's more, you have 15 elemental spells to choose from. You can be a single element, duo element, or tri elemental as you pick and choose your favorite spell tree(s). The game is less about grinding out levels to finally unlock a spell and more about slowly learning how to play the game, then unlocking all of your spells and choosing from there.The combat is spectacular. Unlike most turn-based strategy games, you have to constantly consider your position to the enemy's, even once you're engaged in melee. The myriad of movement and area damage can make your whole team wipe in two turns if you're not careful. Because it's a MMO, as well, you can simply out-level the enemies and go back to wreck their faces. The choice is yours. This isn't a ""plan to whittle them down with ranged fire then melee them"" like most other turn-based games, either. If you want to get into a boss' face, get into their face. They might have a wreck-all spell that turns you to mush, but most tank classes have something they can do to prevent it for a turn or two.The lore is spectacular. It leaves a lot to find and compile, but it's there (or was when I was last active). Each bit and piece you may find tells a small bit about the history of events going on. From there, imagination takes hold and you can create your perspective of the world. It's an anime-styled game. The women are busty and the hips are extremely wide. The graphics are a little cartoony, but the subtle vulgarity and brutality make up for it. It is really one of those games that you can let your kids play while still enjoying it yourself.Cons:The devs... Don't get me started on Ankama. They are, by far, the worst company I have ever dealt with. Their first priority is to appease the French playerbase, period. They do not care what the English-speaking players have to say. Your opinion will be moot if you do not speak French. I've played in several of the game's alphas/betas, and they ignored the English speakers like myself through and through. Things that were just added to the game last year I had been talking about since 2008, which is just sad and annoying to watch.The game was running off of promise of content to the level cap. The ideal level cap being 200, just like in the previous game, Dofus. The problem? The level cap has been hit. The content now will satisfy people to that level cap, and nothing more. The game is slowly churning out meaningless updates that give little/no substantial changes that were promised years ago. It's more or less stagnant, even though they are still adding bits of content.There were more systems in place when the game was released. There were even more before that. Things were added and removed because the developers didn't want to un-bug them. Governors, for instance, were elected and managed all things in the nation from the tax rates to the laws, given options in the dozens on what is legal/illegal, as well as challenges in each area, which were small tasks you could compete against other players to get unique gear. The government positions, now, however, are almost aesthetic. They can make some things illegal to do, but it's almost insulting and redundent on how they can manage it. The player base is constantly dying then picking up again once something new comes out. Honestly, the game would be very nice if more people would play it. But, sadly, it goes through ups and downs, with the downs being extremely, extremely down. Finding someone to do something with that's not end-game or very early on is difficult and hording friends so you can play with them is common-place.This goes back to the devs again. They locked the two French servers to anyone not in France. It didn't used to be, but there were a lot of issues with arabian players spamming the chat. It's understandable, but the population on either of those servers is almost always higher than every other server combined.There are bugs in the game. Some of them are game-breaking. Most of them are annoying at best. If you run a decent system and don't try to push the limits on what you can do in the game, you will run this game almost entirely bug-free. These bugs, however, have been present for years and will likely continue forevermore.All in all, I can't recommend this game to anyone. It might be worth a try if you like Fire Emblem or Tactics Ogre, but the developers killed it years ago. I want to like this game, I really do, but I can't. It's a grind fest once you hit level 100, for anything from gear to experience. The redundency is constant and unforgiving after a certain point. The most fun I've had is playing this game at the lower levels with people, but after a certain point it just becomes tedious and annoying. They will try to milk money from you. I will tell you now don't do it. It's not worth it. If this still appeals to you, then go ahead. Don't say I didn't warn you though.			"

												Hi there! I've been playing since closed beta and I promise that this game hasn't always been this terrible.The game overall is so very unique, I loved it. The character classes, the environment, the stupid politic shenaniganry. The fun stuff back when this game was fun. I don't think there are or will be any games similar to it, unless someone actually wants to put forth the effort.I have to say that steam release brought in droves of players, but the lack of Ankama caring enough was something that killed off the player base. They're so focused money, end game content, nerfing every class ten times over, and their other games,  that they don't really realize what's happening here (unless they just don't care?). I used to love this game, but now it's just super depressing. The once full streets and markets of the nations are now completely devoid of life. Nothing is geared towards new players or keeping them, everything is for high levels and end game content. The creativity has seemingly vanished over the years and I have watched this game go from an amazingly unique and thriving game with a great community to... whatever it is now. I have noticed with my return that most of the players above a certain level tend to treat low level players as though they are the scum of the Earth instead of welcoming them or answering questions. I don't know if this is just on Nox or if other servers have the same issue. The customer service from Ankama is absolutely terrible. It takes them ages to answer tickets, if they even get to them at all (they just recently closed a ticket that I've had open since 2013 that no longer even applies to the game or class I have, they didn't even answer the ticket to begin with). I do understand that they added heroes, but they also charge an arm and a leg for ogrines or any means necessary to actually buy booster packs. This is basically pay to win, the exp difference if pretty bad when playing with friends. The community is... fairly toxic now. A lot of people will randomly gank you, so having the heroes system is almost a necessity. I'm mostly upset because of how fast the game died and how little Ankama actually did to prevent that. No advertisements like Dofus had, nothing. I know some of you guys still love the game, but it's just... depressing.I still play every once in a while to check up on old friends that refuse to abandon the game, but I really wouldn't recommend it unless you have the time and patience. I know this whole review has been all over the place, but I will always have mixed feelings about this game until Ankama starts caring again.			"

												6/10I won't go into all the details or I'll be here all day.Wakfu is a beautiful turn-based strategy mmorpg with some sandbox elements. With 15 classes that can be built in many ways, you're bound to find one with a play style that you enjoy. Team up with up to 5 others to run dungeons and Ultimate Bosses! No friends? Ankama have that covered too! With a couple of sidekicks by your side nothing will stop you!There are 10 craft professions (not including Kama minting) and 6 gathering skills all of which, with some effort, can be leveled to maximum.  The enviroment and politic system are maintained by the players. Everything that happens within these will affect other players in some way. For example, Governers of each nation are players themselves and are voted in by you, the player. Planting too many mobs or plants in an area will disrupt the enviroment, as will killing too many of them. Distrupt the enviroment too much and you'll become an Outlaw! You'll be fair game for any passing Guard or regular Joe to aggro you...As the game is still in development. There are A LOT of things that are going to be added or changed fairly soon™. Guild verses guild, a revamp of its guard vs outlaw system, a couple of class revamps along with a lot of other brand new content. The game is extremely grindy at times but that's what you expect of an mmo, and there IS still a kind of subscription system in play, which has been recently renamed to ""Booster Packs"". Subscribers get access to the newest content, a shared chest, +10% drop rates, +30% kama drops (the currency) and +30% exp along with some other minor things. As to why I only gave it a 6/10. That is solely down to Customer Support themselves. The game, has had and still does have major bugs and issues which may make you reconsider playing. Things such as complete inventory/haven bag wipes and/or characters dissapearing combined with Customer Support ignoring tickets can be very disheartening. Saying that, these are rare cases and the charm of the game will likely outweigh this. The game is very playable as f2p and I highly recommend playing this game. Oh Snap xXx2 years Wakfuing			"

												Been playing for about 2 years.It's not bad, but three things bother me immensely:- Community is very cliquey, very hard to just play with others without them trying to recruit you or straight up use you as a loot wh**e. Which means, they bring you along, but you give them item drops in return to come along. This is probably the worst thing about the Nox (North American) community.- Ankama in general ignores the North American region in terms of feedback and communication. Which is always hard as foreign companies based in foreign countries have a harder time bonding with the community. The moderators and staff very rarely visit the NA forum. In fact, other than Sabi, we have little to no interaction with them at all.- Very grindy gameplay; this has been improved a lot very recently, but it is still unbelievably painful to get anywhere. This ties into the first point a lot as well. Progression screeches to a crawl after level 100 and without a dedicated group finder, you're basically solo (unless you have friends that also play) 90% of the time. People even go so far as to multibox 3-6 accounts just to not be alone. Which I suppose is an entirely different level of alone.All in all; it's not a bad game, it has its moments, but dear god after 2 years, they are only now starting to fix a few glaring issues that have been prevalent since day 1.My score as a standalone title: 6.5/10.Compared to most other MMOs: 7.5/10.Warning: They will try to milk you for as much money as they can get away with.My reply to their support after being denied for another thing I needed help with. My last request was years ago and they still didn't help me, so it's not like I constantly harrass them for assistance. You win again Ankama, hope that 20 dollars was worth it.			"

												As someone who has spent many hours with both MMO's and Tactical RPG's, this was a pleasant find. I spent many years playing WoW, Star Wars:TOR, and DCU, but I had come to find myself tired of the formula that MMO's had fallen into. I had basically given up on the genre, as there is very little variation beyond setting. When I saw Wakfu on Steam for the first time, I overlooked it. The artwork was not my favorite, and the name of the game itself didn't draw me in at all. It wasn't until a few days later that I was looking through the games again that I decided to look closer.What I saw reminded me of when I'd spend hours at a time playing one of my favorite games of all time, Final Fantasy Tactics. Most Tactical RPG's do that to me, as their style is so distinct in comparison to other genres. The grid on the floor is a dead give away to any one remotely familiar with the genre. Armed with some nostalgic goggles, I dove deeper in to the game Wakfu.Wakfu is a mix of Tactical RPG combat, with MMORPG sprinkles to top things off while you're not in battle. You'll find your usual culprits; Proffessions split into gathering and crafting, Taxi locations for fast travel, an Auction House in the form of a ""market"", and Mounts and Costumes to show off how cool you are, just to name a few of the things you'll recognize from the MMO genre. Most of the activities within the game are easily recognized standards that even people who have only played something like Minecraft should be able to pick up quickly. It also tries to do it's own things, like a completely player run government, and an eco system than can give bonuses if its in a good shape.The battle system is also pretty standard as far as Tactical RPG's go. Veterans will be able to pick up the battle system quickly, as soon as they understand the some times confusing tool tips for their spells. Combat takes place on a field created when you start the fight with monsters in the world. Each participant is put in order based off their ""Initiative"" stat. The batle then goes by in turns. Each combatant is restricted by how many tiles on the grid they can move, how far their spells can hit, and how much those spells cost. Of course this sounds simple, but like any great Tactical RPG, there is a lot of depth in this simplistic system, than can only be found out the longer you play. The classes range from simple to complex. RPG veterans will be able to pick up classes like Cra, Osamodas, and Sram, and easily identify them as your typical Archer, Summoner, Assassin. Then they will look at classes like Feca and Foggernaut, and scratch their head a bit. What you'll find seems to be missing is the quests. After storming through the opening area-Astrub-you'll be left to your own devices. Sure there are quests you can do, but they can be hard to find, since there is no mini map, and no indication of who gives you these quests. This can make leveling very unfocused until you learn how to recognize where these quests will be.Wakfu has a very light hearted atmosphere. Jokes are common in dialogue and most of them worth a chuckle, especially once you start to understand the games lore. Enemies have idle animations and will use in game emotes, that allow them to be their own characters rather than just another random creature for you to mow down. The artistic design fits well, its very animated and colorful, adding more life to the world they've created. For those really enjoying the Wakfu setting, theres even an Anime now, allowing you to see the world in a more cinematic presentation.Unfortunately, the Music and Sound is lacking here. The sounds can get downright repetitive and annoying. You'll know what I'm talking about when you experience being stuck loading up your character select screen and you hear those cogs for 10 minutes straight, or someone is spamming emotes near you. The music on the other hand, is just all together forgetable. I couldn't tell you what one song on this game sounds like, because none of them are memorable at all.The other strike against this game, is how much is locked behind a paywall. The game itself is free, but there is a lot that you have to pay for, that I don't think you should. For one, the mounts. You can get a mount in game for free, but its terrible. If you want a good one, you gotta pay. The other thing, is many costumes and emotes are up for purchase. Costumes I might understand, Vanity items are often sold in free games, but why emotes? Most games let you have all emotes from the start, but this one forces you to unlock them. Or in some cases, buying them is the only way to get them. Its not all bad, some of the things offered in the shop are very good, and I understand why you must pay for things like Nation Changes, or Class changes, even if they are over priced in my opinion.While I recognize this game wont be for everyone, it is for me. The blend of an MMO and Tactical RPG is right up my alley, but I'd say you probably have to enjoy Tactical RPG's more than MMORPG's. I could easily see fans of Ogre Tactics, Disgea and Final Fantasy Tactics enjoying this, but if you find yourself more of a WoW, Rift, or Old Republic fan, you might find this is an overly simplified version. If you're relatively new to either genre, this is a great place to start.			"

												Lots of great things in this game, but sadly I can not recommend it to others. This is from the perspective of a F2P player, I have not spent a penny on this game.Pros-17 unique classesGreat combat system (tactical but not overwhelming)Crafting and gathering professions feel rewardingEcosystem changes based on what you plant and what you cut down or killGuilds are great (have buyable bonuses, haven worlds which are like a base for the guild players)Art style is different from all other MMOs that I've seenMany special mechanics for different mobs and dungeonsBeginning of game is rather funCons-Due to cheaters market prices are ridiculously inflatedGrinding is very tedius. To get a guaranteed relic you have to run a 1-2 hour dungeon 200 times if you are F2P, 100 if you have purchased a booster pack.With the ""Heros Update"" people can now play as 3 characters at once. This means less people getting together for a dungeon group (dungeon groups are 6 people). In my opinion this is what killed the game. Before you would gather at  temple and shout out ""Looking for group _____ dungeon"", or ""Looking for 2 more ______ dungeon"". People dont want others running dungeons with them because it is much easier to just duo it with your friend who also has 3 characters. Oh, and you need a booster pack to use more then one character at a timeVery few new people are joining, 95% of people are levels 175-200. You want to run lower level dungeons, good luck finding a group.PVP is very unbalanced and you can be attacked even when you turn your ""wings"" down. (if you have wings up, this means you want to fight. Wings down means you dont, but some greifers will attack you anyway)You will not see 90% of the low level areas because you are trying to rush to max level, where everyone else isMany people are leaving the game. Guilds are being abandoned, and even some of the most popular ones are made up of 3-4 people with alternate accounts (many have 6 different accounts to play as a full team)Extra: Back when the game was released on steam there was a huge flood of new players. The only reason I was able to stick around this game for so long is because of this. I found some buddies, we made a guild and played together. Early levels were great, but after level 120ish things became very grindy. My buddies left, but I kept playing. Now, I have also quit playing. I stopped at lvl 172, and the current level cap was 175 (has now been raised to 200). I saw end game content, and it was just do this 2 hour dungeon 100-200 times, maybe less if you got a lucky drop (.01%)TL;DR: Has some great features I wish other MMOs would use, but due to immense repetetive grinding, a dying player base, and nothing to due once you reach end game, I can't recommend this game.

Overall Review/TL;DR (7.5)Overall I give this game (as of 8/5/2014) a 7.5/10. I'm primarily more in to the FPS and MOBA genres, but the visuals of this game were enough for me to give it a try. To start, the art-style is beautiful, the soundtrack is pleasant and gives the game a nice ambiance, and the animations are amazing! The gameplay (from what I've played so far, which is the tutorial) feels a bit slow, and I feel like the tutorial was unnecessarily long (although I believe you can skip it to begin playing the game), and the controls took a bit for me to get used to, but other than that I feel like this is definitely one of the better MMO's you can find on Steam (not to mention it's free!). I'd say download it, try it, and see if you enjoy it.Full ReviewThis is the first MMO I've played in a long time, and it's probably one of the first turn-based strategy games I've been able to play for more than an hour. My opinion is more focused from the average FPS/MOBA player's point of views, please keep that in consideration while reading my review.Visuals (9)The only reason I decided to try this game when I got a hold of a closed beta key was the visuals of the game, and once I entered the game they really, really impacted my overall thoughts on the game. The game is beautiful, and the art style is perfect. Not to mention the game's animations are amazing, they truly and firmly ""say what needs to be said""... if that makes sense. Not to mention character customization is great and makes you really feel unique. The only reason I didn't rate the game's visuals 10/10 was because majority of the playable characters all seem fairly feminine and cuddly, while my goal when I was creating my character was to be masculine and fairly intimidating. In the character creation, I didn't realize there was an option to switch from male to female and actually thought several of the male character choices were supposed to be female! Regardless, the game is GORGEOUS and fresh, there's no doubt about that.Controls (6)When I first tried the game, the controls weren't really what I was used to. Being a primarily FPS/MOBA gamer, it definitely felt weird left clicking to where I needed to be and right-clicking on things to interact with them, and one thing that really bothered me at first was the fact that there wasn't edge-scrolling and that the camera wasn't centered on my character the entire time (although I have suggested on the forums to add edge-scrolling and/or the camera focusing on the charcter), and a little bit in I felt a bit tired of clicking everywhere I went, so I feel like the controls weren't the greatest but still worked enough for me not to give up completely.Audio (8)The game's soundtrack is great, it has this... warmth to it I guess, and it really makes the experience pleasant for me. The sounds are good too, and I feel go almost perfectly with the visuals! A few sounds are a tad bit annoying to hear, like these little rabbits (known as ""Woodlets"" I believe) that did this sort of... giggle, and it slightly bothered me after hearing it (or a certain variation of it) every time I attacked one of them. Other than that the audio is great and well-fitting for the game's style.Gameplay (7)The game plays fairly smoothly, from what I've played (the tutorial) it seems like the game is mainly just accepting tasks and engaging in them (like most MMO's), but the tasks aren't always the same thing over and over, so it doesn't really get stale. The game is a bit slow-paced though, which I'm not very used to. The combat is good, and the spells are unique and fun to use and learn. The only reason the gameplay got a 7/10 was because the tasks seem slightly boring and overall not very exciting (to me). Regardless though, I feel like I'll definitely be coming back to this game to play several more hours.Try or nahhhh?Definitely try, it's a quick download and is a great experience, I'd highly recommend this game to any gamer (besides my brother, the only games he plays are those of the Call of Duty franchise... that poor, sad little man.)Thank you for your time, consideration, and for reading my first review! Feel free to comment anything you have to say about it and/or questions you have for me about the game!Sincerely,Your friendly neighborhood (not to mention 15 year-old) Sweatshirt.			"

												Wakfu is an ok game, full of bugs and a horrible community.If you dont mind being harrased, player killed, lose ur progress thanks to bugs, grind for hours doing the same exactly boring tasks to achieve nothing at all, being ignored by the developers/support/moderators/community managers, feeling like ankama is laughing at you at every moment, etc.... then play the game, you will regret it. Also dont be fooled, the game isnt free, you have to get a subscription if you want to achieve something... and by the way, the game is almost always empty. Good luck. I wasted 4 years of my life playing this piece of crap, dont waste yoursEdit.Just uninstalled it, Nox have the most toxic players you can find in any game. Last patch also made the game unplayable, the small balance the classes had is gone, is a cash grabber... dont be fooled by the cute graphics, this game is worst than a second job... you have to work EXTREMELY hard for no rewards at all...

												Update: Server Merge postponed till the end of the year, as usual 0 discussion of how they are going to deal with the economy after the merge... Let's see if they finally do something right or  screw the few people left that are still playing the game..They had an amazing game with a unique concept and beautiful gameplay. Sadly like others have said they are probably one of the worst developers around, they don't listen to anybody unless it's too late, they focus on the wrong stuff most of the time and frankly they don't care if you love the game only that you buy stuff.For quite sometimes the  game  is only plagued by bad decisions so overall not recommended as long as ankama is behind it.

												This game was almost everything I asked for artistically and combat wise and was an extreme upgrade from playing Dofus (which I also loved). I started late; last year and had a beautiful time where I met a very friendly guild, new people, and learned how to do everything up to Present dungeon with the help of many friends. Although, everything changed when DDOS' were happening where relics were duped and things were magically bought off the market for absurd amount of kamas and everyone became rich. This did not help when the promising new update of Moon Island and Heroes where it basically made everyone play by themselves and did not have to rely on anyone else to do dungeons anymore. Things became very introvert and very independent.Overall, I would not recommend this game if you start this year and on. The community is very small, but polite (once you get to 175s+) and is very heavy on finding a guild. You will NOT survive alone. As agreed with many people, this game would have gone a lot further if they listened to the community.			"

Product received for free
haha wow look at these nerds around me giving this game bad reviews over playerkilling and bad customer support and whatever like every other top MMO review on steamHowabout a review that looks at the game itself? I've poured enough hours into Wakfu to make it feel worth my salt, so stay awhile and listen.Final Fantasy Tactics/Disgaea/2.5D-Turnbased-Game meets French Anime: The MMORPG.If you're not sold by that phrase, then this game probably isn't for you.If you are sold, then prepare for a good co-op experience.That being said, this game mostly shines with its' co-op play. Unfortunately, there seems to be a big void between starting players and end-game players.If you're starting out in this game, do your best to make links with other people. Make friends, bring friends along, join a guild, anything like that. It'll make the journey from new to end-game all the more pleasant, enjoyable, and certainly easier.I'll put a + next to pros and a - next to cons.ahem+Wakfu's player side of combat consists of over 15 classes that can straighten down into four roles: Damage, Tank, Support, and Field Control. Albeit, some are a mixture of these.Wakfu's classes are diverse, and each have a level of complexity to them to suit most, if not all players. Want to learn a class quickly so you can get to smashing things up, whilst being as powerful as any other damage class? Iop's for you. Want a class that's difficult to master and has tons of things to learn about and with synergies to discover? Xelor might be your pick. I had to cycle through nearly all of the classes and test them out before I decided to settle with Rogue. or you could just be a fat stinky lazy Cra and shoot arrows from the far back all day i mean geez+The game also has a virtually completely playerbased economy, with little to no ""pricing metas"".That means you can sell whatever you want at whatever price, and if someone thinks that's pretty legit, or even a steal, they'll buy it. At-least, I haven't seen too much of a meta other than higher level stuff = more money, and pets/costumes/emotes/all that = a high price.+There's 15+ Professions to choose from which can help this economy out.There's lots of demand for people who are high-enough level in professions, and some people will pay kilograms(tonnes?) worth of cash to just acquire the stuff they can make. From the Baker, who bakes bread(duh) to heal health and give small maxhealth boosts, to the Handyman who can make dungeon keys, crafting workshops, and more. Speaking of...+Haven Bags / Haven Worlds and Guilds, your own little slice(s) of the worldHaven Bags are basically transportable 'homes'. You can decorate them, expand them out with Haven Gems(acquired through multiple means that don't cost realworld money), craft using purchasable workstations(at a hefty price, those things don't come cheap), and even grow crops inside of your bag.Yeah, that's right. You can carry a farm with you. Crazy stuff.Haven Worlds, however, are Haven Bags but on a much bigger scale, designed with big guilds in mind. You can do everything a Haven Bag can do there, and even more. Set your spawn point there, spawn mobs(usually penned up to stop them rampaging everywhere and breeding wildly), and probably lots of other stuff that I don't know about because I haven't done haven worlds too much and I can't be bothered to look at a wiki.+Woah, this game isn't Pay 2 Win?Not exactly. More like ""Pay to make everything grindy a little easier"", or ""Pay to look cool"". From EXP bonuses to emotes/costumes to restat scrolls to class switches. (The last two have 30 day cooldowns, I believe. Don't worry, Ankama has standards.)Plus, costumes/emotes from the store are tradable, which means people can sell them on the market. No need to fork out realworld cash when you can earn it with blood, sweat, tears, and mostly time. Definitely a lot of time.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Which brings me to my first con:-The grind is real.Literally just that. Both your level /and/ your professions are going to be a total grindfest. I feel like lots of people are deterred by this, and it makes some essential professions(like Trappers, who spawn in mobs because most ecosystems don't spawn mobs themselves)an endangered species or something. It does, however, pay off. Perhaps you can even make some money from it.Wakfu does try to ease combat grinding with 'Challenges', though. Things like 'Do not get hit from the back', or 'Kill two enemies in one turn', which awards a bonus EXP/Loot percentage/chance/whatever. Only slightly eases it, though. It'll feel like a chore to some. I believe this puts a lot of people off from continuing to play the game, too. Especially if you're soloing.-Solo play can feel boring.Wakfu's a 2.5D turnbased strategy RPG. These kinds of games are usually pretty boring on their own, and more allies/characters/players makes the game more engaging and fun, /especially/ when there's diversity, which Wakfu shines at with its 15+ classes. It leads to another problem, though, which I discussed at the very beginning.-There's a void of players between early and end-game.Naturally, joining a Guild fixes this, though. Lots of guilds like recruiting at Astrub, the starting hub of the game.(Past Incarnum. That's the tutorial level.) Don't be shy! Ask a guildie to invite you. It'll be worth your while. (Certainly was for me. Big shoutout to 'The Secret Society' people, especially if they're reading this 'u')And one final thing.???This game certainly isn't for everyone, especially if you rush people into it.If you want friends to tag along, do your best to be nice and slow about it. Let them grasp the game by themselves. I find Wakfu to be a very 'learn at your own pace' kinda game. You can not know the inner works of your class, but you can still play it and win battles. It isn't like Dota(oh boy im gonna get flamed for this) where you have to learn an entire character to play them successfuly and win, otherwise you get flattened out.---SUMMARY AND WHAT I THINK OF THE GAME---Even with  its' flaws and its' grind and its' poorish solo play, I still enjoy Wakfu and rate it one of the best MMORPGs I've played. Compared to every other standing MMORPG on the market, I'd say this is an amazing little gem in the rough that needs more attention. The server populations are always low, and never full. I'd love it if we could get Wakfu a thriving community again.Do share this review, or even the game with your friends! Who knows, they might've been looking for a game like this. Thanks for reading.

												Not a review, but I just wanted to point that this is probably the most f2p game of the whole steam MMORPG library.You will go to lvl 1 -> late game only depending in the hours you spend in, and you can't be better than someone just paying.Paying of course will give you something (skins and furniture for your ""house"", and you can buy sidekicks, secondary chracters that you control).Definetly, give it a chance. Any action though, slow combat sometimes.			"

I did like this game a lot in the earlier stages but as time went on it became more of a grindefest than game. I literally thought I was working for one day. 10/100Only get this game if you have 5 friends and love grinding.EDIT:If you are gonna play this game just remember the only place that isn't a ghost town is Dathura (French Server) and Elbor (Spanish Server). The entire game gets around 5000 logins everyday across all the servers and they have started to shut down a few. Hopefully Ankama will save this game.			"

												I can no longer access this game, despite spending in game money. My account has been put in to ""protected"" status. The cause is, most likely, from suspicious IP addresses trying to use my account. To recover, I have to submit: a valid form of identification (driver's license, passport, etc), the date of purchase (I purchased before Steam, so this is a bit harder), and a new email address that isn't the same as the one they have on file. I enjoyed Wakfu prior to this, but their protection mode is quite the opposite. The game is linked to Steam, but that's not enough to verify ownership. If I could do a charge-back or refund, I would.			"

												This is the best MMORPG I have played in a while, despite the buggy state it more often than not sits in.I think what I love the most about this game, is the fact that there's a whole animated series that is based in the same universe as the game, which goes by the same name as the game. They did the same with their last MMORPG, Dofus, which also had an animated series, even though that was more 15 minute short stories instead of a whole storyline of events per season.All in all, this game is one of THE most unique experiences out there, if you're patient enough to bear with a bug or two every now and then.I'd recommend it to anyone who is willing to try out something new, as you'll probably never run out of classes to play with the 16 classes already in the game, and the new class coming early December.

												The number of hours I played this game before it launched on steam by far overshadows the 277 hours I have recorded here. It used to be a great game but was ruined by many poor decisions and a bad dev team. Every time I try to log on now, another basic game function is broken and I can't play because of whatever they've most recently broken.They keep revamping the same things over and over and it's still missing features that were promised when it launched in 2012. Worse is that they half put in features then never finish them. Some features have been put in game then removed.I made many friends playing it but I absolutely cannot recommend the game in its current state. Something drastic would have to happen for this game to be playable again.			"

												2 years ago I would have gladly recommended Wakfu. It had great graphics, fun gameplay and it was sandboxy enough for things to not seem too linear. Unfortunately it kind of spiraled into a huge mess after Ankama rolled out changes that completely split the playerbase. Some people really loved the changes. Others, like me, really hated them.While I personally wouldn't get back into the game in its current state, I wouldn't turn anyone away from checking the game out if only for the novelty. It IS a good-looking game with good-looking mechanics, unfortunately marred by excessive grindiness and a not-so-nice playerbase.			"

You can join anyone and help them out in a battle as long as they are still in the setup phase and they can do the same for you. The survivability of species' in the game relies on the players ability to plant their seeds and hence, rebirth the creatures you kill and so much more.

												Did you love Final Fantasy tactics?Do you love that feeling of accomplishment despite the hellish pain of constant death that rivals even Dark Souls? Do you love deep tactical rewarding strategy based combat?Then Wakfu will probably be the game for you. On its cute and pristine exterior, there's a huge amount of depth and punishing dungeons and temples. This isn't your average MMO, you wipe in a temple that can take nearly an hour to complete? Well that's too bad, you'll have to start from the very beginning. This isn't some game you can get away with spamming. Positioning, timing and execution is key. Even basic battles against mobs have a strategic depth to them that feels foreign to an MMORPG. This game runs on turn based grid combat, you level your character like any other in an RPG, however each element has its specialties. Fire is typically AOE (area of effect) , Earth is typically direct damage, Water is usually healing or mobility debuffs or buffs with some damage mixed in. Air is usually knockbacks or line telegraph attacks. But that's only typically, each class feels extremely different. From manipulating time, to picking up your foes and tossing them, to entirely relying on lady luck in combat. Wakfu brings a whole new fresh style to combat that I've never experienced in an MMO before.Words of warning, if you like questing, you'll find it extremely lacking on quests until you reach the out-lying islands of the nations of the World of Twelve. However they continue to work on updating the game with more quest lines that guide you into areas. I say your first real challenging quest chain is on the Wild Estates, where a mixture of puzzle solving, challenging battles, even sports and an Indiana Jones style hunt for an artifact will take center stage. Did I mention its really hard? Because, it's really bworking hard! There's a large slew of crafting professions, an entirely player run economy, and the most challenging PVE MMO experience I've ever had. As for the PVP I haven't experienced too much of it. It depends on the server you join but the economy has been somewhat at a standstill and it's more likely you will get trades from your haven bag or face to face than the market. Kamas, the games currency aren't all that hard to get however, especially considering you can mint them yourself.Wakfu is a beautifully designed, deep and well made game that is literally the most challenging experience I've had in an MMO, rivals even what I experienced in my days of EVE in terms depth of combat. There's really a whole slew of possibilities you can approach a battle based on your class and playstyle, those possibilities yet nail biting, hair pulling difficulty is something I do have to admit that I love. We need more games like Wakfu, not MMOs, just games period. This game is the XCOM: Enemy Unknown of MMOs, it's about as tense too. Give the game a shot, add me on Steam if you'd want to party up, don't be afraid to ask questions to the community either, they're quite understanding and helpful, there will be a few bad eggs I'm sure.  In closing, Wakfu is a generously made game, with a lot of love and hardwork put into it, down to the extremely artistic style handcrafted areas, and lovable design			"

												In one word: obsolete.As you can tell from my hours played, I used to play this game. A lot. And this is only the hours logged on this character on steam, I had probably double this overall. However, I haven't touched this game in over a year. It runs on an obsolete version of java and the creators show no real intentions on updating it anytime soon. When I first started, it was a very vibrant game, full of excitement and fun. However, like so many others have commented, it's not what it used to be. The fighting system has been revamped over and over, so much so that it's just not fun to learn a new system every three months. It's not fun to deal with terrible support and a system that barely scrapes by. It's a shame, because this game used to be amazing. The music for this game is incredible, to this day I still go back and look up my favorite songs and listen to them on youtube. Like everyone else has said, the creators have pushed themselves into a corner by alienating the fanbase by removing exciting features, putting crap into the game, and punishing players for the actions of the few. I wish I could recommend this game, I really do. There was a time when I could; that time is gone. This game is on the downhill slope, which is sad considering where it has fallen from. That being said, if you want to give it a try, go for it. It's free and you can always use this as a time sink. But this game had its glory days, and those days are passed.			"

												[English at the end]• Wakfu é o MMORPG mais F2P do mercado.Começo com essa frase para você ter certeza de que ele é grátis de verdade, não há limitadores sobre o que fazer, e justamente por isso faço questão de apoiá-lo comprando itens que gosto no ogrines shop.• Wakfu tem fortes aspectos de sandbox.Se você jogou Ragnarok Online, então já está treinado para Wakfu. Imagine um RO evoluído: com controle do ambiente feito pelos jogadores; itens super diversos feitos por jogadores; política feita por jogadores; risco de deixar seu personagem ruim se não pensar direito na build, guerras e tratados de paz, etc. Mas também temos o grind, que se você não diversificar fazendo outras atividades (que não são poucas) te deixará entediado.•  Wakfu é muito bem desenhado.É um jogo bonito, não se pode negar. Seus equipamentos são realmente usados por personagens carismáticos, que começam usando coisas ""fofas"", que transparecem bastante o ""newbie"", para um dia ficarem imponentes e ameaçadores. Os locais visitados possuem características fortes, que deixam claro, por exemplo, a nação daquele território, e visitar os mapas é sempre agradável.• Wakfu é estratégico.Há muitos elementos estratégicos em Wakfu, do combate (que é feito por turnos) até como você lida com o ambiente com seu personagem. Há estratégia no craft, na política (que oferece diversos cargos para os jogadores), no estilo de jogo dos personagens e na interação entre eles, nos itens que você usará, nas habilidades, enfim, falar em Wakfu é falar em estratégia.Então se você chegou até aqui, dê uma chance ao jogo. Uma vez nele, leia, entenda-o, sinta-se livre de verdade, sem um caminho pré-definido a seguir. Não se prenda às missões, faça-as quando quiser, se quiser. Use a janela de archievements para guiar seus objetivos e viva o mundo de Wakfu à sua maneira.E faça o tutorial!______• Wakfu is the most F2P MMORPG in the market. Beginning with this phrase for you to make sure that he is really free, no limiters on what to do, and rightfully so I must support him by buying items I like in Ogrine shop. • Wakfu has sandbox in his veins. If you played Ragnarok Online, then you're already trained to Wakfu. Imagine a RO evolved: the control of environment made ​​by the players; various items made ​​by players; policy made by players; risk of build your character wrong, wars and peace treaties, etc. But we also have the grind, if you do not diversify doing other activities (which are many) that leave you bored. • Wakfu is very well designed. It's a beautiful game, one can not deny. The equipment is actually used by charismatic characters, who start using ""cute"" things, which are reflected quite the ""newbie"" for a day become imposing and threatening. The locals visited have strong characteristics which make it clear, for example, the nation that territory, and visit the maps is always nice. • Wakfu is strategic. There are many strategic elements in Wakfu, the fight (which is done in turns) to how you handle the environment with your character. There are craft strategy, politics (which offers various positions for the players), the game style of the characters and the interaction between them, the items you will use, skills, finally, speaking Wakfu is speaking strategy. So if you got this far, give the game a try. Once there, read, understand it, feel free indeed, without a pre-defined path to follow. Do not hold on to the quests, do them when you want, if you want. Use the window archievements to guide your goals and live the world of Wakfu your way. And do the tutorial!			"

												It's kinda rare to see Turn Based Strategy MMORPG.Wakfu is one of those rare gem. The gameplay kinda similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, but you only control 1 character, well. with sidekicks though, but still not much.Now on to the review.+ So many different class to choose of.  Each class have quite a lot of skill, you could make your own unique build.+ There's a profession system in this game, so apart from the main game itself, you could become a farmer, a blacksmith, tailor, and many more.+ Community oriented game, you can't sell your stuff to NPC, this game is really community based game, you must actually sell it to people, or... just throw it out. There's Region president election, Guild, and many more. You can join the bad guys, or become a guard instead.+ For people who prefers playing alone, there's a sidekick system. At least, there's someone to accompany you. Though, i recommend you playing with actual players.- The community is almost non-existent, many people said this game is still alive, but that's not applied in my case.  I'm playing in asia server, not sure about other server though.- Grindfest, and it's even worse than other MMO in general in my opinion.- Customization, There's costume and stuff, but... well, it's not rare to see people with a same face.- Progression, this game had quite an interesting story, but to progress in the main story is really hard. The level gap to actually progress in this game is really high. If you have a friend to play with you, i really recommend this game, It's really fun to play wakfu together. If not, find oneright away, join a guild, and have fun. "

												This game is great... I mean it.  One of the best and most unique games you will ever find.I've been playing this game for years now (before it comes to steam) and I was in love with it.  I had many charecters at cap level... But one day.. my account got hacked ( I mean all gamers know this would happen to them once or twice in their gaming life it's not a big deal right??) SO I did what anyone else would do and opened a ticked... but guess what they will do for you? NOTHING! ya they might reset you password if you want, but other than that NO... NOTHING.so imagine playing for few years in this game and some hacker come in steal all your cash, spend all your cash-shop currency to buy stuff and give it to his main, sell all your rare armors and weapons.... so I basicly ended with 8 max level charecters naked with no cash... just nothing.  And they will not do nothing for you.  If you don't believe just go to their website and check it for your self.Link to their ""account theft information"" : https://support.ankama.com/hc/en-us/articles/201609246-My-account-was-stolen-what-do-I-do-and you will find this warning at the begininga ""Warning: although Support is able to help you regain access to your account, they can do nothing about any losses and modifications resulting from the theft. All stolen items or kamas are permanently lost.""So ya... Go ahead and play this awesome game... invest all your time (AND MONEY) in it... but if your account got hacked one day... you can kiss it goodbye.			"

												I would recommend this game, but there are certain things about it that different kinds of gamers may or may not like, I'll try to sum up some of the specific qualities.1: Like most MMOs it's a long grind to the higher levels, but it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over, generally you get to go through different dungeons and fight new monsters the more you level so you aren't always doing the same thing.2: You have specific skills you can build, everything from Farming/baking to being a jeweler there's lots of stuff you can do other than punching monsters faces all day, you don't absolutely have to if you're the kind of person who just likes fighting, but it can be helpful and even fun to learn these skills, some sidequests involve using these skills as well.3: There is a story to the game but it's really not the main focus until you level up drastically, but even so there are plenty of other things to occupy your time in this game, really half of it feels like you're making your own story with other players, which moves me on to the next topic.4: Politics, yes I said politics, there is a political and economic system in the game world that is run by the players, you can vote for elections or even become governer yourself, laws are set to keep the economy well (or to leech off of other players if they're a dirty politician) not to mention if you break the law you will be labled at a ciminal that other players will attack, and if you are caught then you will have your character sent to jail, also laws are in place to keep the ecosystem in order, which once again moves me onto the next topic.5: Ecosystem, yes there's indeed an ecosystem in this game, you want wood? Plant some trees but don't cut too many down, want to hunt some monsters? Make sure too many of them don't get killed but also don't let there be too many ect ect. There are generally laws in place to help keep it balanced.6: Character Classes, there are a total of fourteen different classes to choose from ""Damage dealers tanks and healers oh my!"" There's tons of variety in terms of how each class plays, each have their own mechanics making none of them truly ""useless"" Yes there's one that's overpowered but even that one has a down side, so in terms of classes you won't be dissapointed.So if the things I just mentioned sound interesting and maybe even fun I would highly reccomend trying this one out, it has a beautiful art style and TONS of content to keep you playing!

												EDITI played this quite a bit since I wrote the review and even got some friends to try it. Thing is, I don't like MMOS. There is something about it that just doesn't work for me.That being said, this game is an amazing turn based strategy game. If you like MMOs and turn-based combat, do try it!If you're like me, it's not unlike any MMO. It gets boring too fast.Original review-----------------------------------------------------------------------This game has one of the best turn based combat I've ever played. All playable classes have 20 spells and 5 passives you can skill and level up, allowing you to build it any way you want to suit your tastes. There is a lot of ennemies and they all feel unique.But that's pretty much it. There is no drive to level up, very few quests beside some for the intro, some milestones and the dailies. That's enough for me but it makes it hard to get friends into the game.Also, the politics, crafting and environnement things seem like useless or almost useless gimmicks to me.On top of that, the game have a lot of issues. The Steam achievements are not working (and at this point, I doubt they ever will). When my friend created an account, he got locked into a different region than mine and he gave up on the game.Give me a propper coop RPG with those classes and ennemies and I would buy it any time.

												I believe this game is worth your time. You can choose to invest money in the game, or you can choose not to. Either way you will have a fun time. This game is like Capitalism in a game format. You always want to make more money and increase your businesses and professions. The story is incomplete at the moment but it's a very beautful and interesting gaming concept. I reccommend it to everyone. It may not be the right game for everybody, but it deserves a chance. Too many people read the reviews and think this game is a waste of time. So just take the reviews with a grain of salt, and play the game and give it your own thought. Thank you for reading(:			"

												The developper has a shotgun approch to balancing, for 3 months the class I played was unchanged, then suddenly the dev nerf'd dmg output, healing and summons per turn by -50% making it not even remotely viable anymore.To be clear: that's half the summons and half the damage, so only 25% the original damage potential.Accoridng to rumors, all because of 1v1 pvp, in a game where pvp is barely even a thing.Aside from the asinine balance, there is an unbelivable amount of bugs and performance issues. The game is coded in Java and has memory leaks that make the game stutter real bad. A lot of content introduced had been disabled because the dev couldn't figure out how to fix it.Community seems really young and rude with very few exceptions. There's a lot of ""white knights"" that defend the dev's changes for no good reason and seem to advocate worse conditions for their fellow player. Most likely because they're subscribed and wouldn't be affected by the changes.			"

												Wakfu is a phenominal game filled with an innovative turn based battle system. Very similar to final fantasy tactics and other games of the genre. The tutorial is long and tedious because it has to be. The battle system is complex to those new to the genre, but once you can look past that; it's a game that you can tell lots of love and creativity was poured into it. Classes~ They're so many classes to choose. They vary from the typical archer and warrior to flying faeries and time robots.  Each class has it's own individual spells and abilities. For example, I have an Eniripsa. The Eniripsa is a support/healer class that can spec into fire, air, or water abilities. Without getting too much into this to prevent spoilers, (and because of my ignorance considering I have only played around 20+ hours) I can assure you that each class is innovative and will be fun to play.People~ People fuel everything in this game. They're no npcs, not too many quests, yet why is this game so fun? Because people make the combat system REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING FUN. You find a party of about 5+ people to do this exceptionally hard dungeon or invade another person's territory ( at level 18 you pick a civilization to live in) and after 25 hours I'm still having so much fun. Professions- If you want to plant a seed. Plant it ♥♥♥♥ing anywhere. If you want to mine a rock go build a bomb and blow up the rocks to find the rare minerals within. If you wanna go trample on someone else's freshly planted seeds (♥♥♥♥ you btw) then go do that. There's total free roam in this game. ZERO RESTRANTS. Art style/music~  Wakfu is very colorful. Has pretty good mustic, and a flowing animation. Don't be fooled by it's cartooney style though; this game is ♥♥♥♥ing bloody. If you wanna go kill a cat and cut off it's fur go ahead. The blood will be on the picture in your inventory. The games completely free~ That's right, it's free. Go play it you nerd.			"

												Dude, how is this MMO NOT more popular? Yeah, it has that kid freindly aesthetic that might turn off some potential players, but for those who can love that cartoony vibe will find a game with a lot going on and a lot going for it. An wide expanding world with nearly everything being player run: the factions have a player leader, the mobs must be spawned BY PLAYERS, resources must be renewed by the players, you can only purchase items made by other players on a free market system; All of this just jazzes me so good. The combat is an absolute joy and endearing as well, being a turn based strategy MMO. Who does that!? Wakfu, that's who. It's free, man. C'mon.			"

It is fun for both free-to-plays and people who buy stuff for the game. I love the character selection. I was so curious I had tried all the classes. I love the game. I especially love the show. Anyone who has, or even hasn't played the game should go and watch Wakfu on Netflix or something (I suggest watching it in subtitles) . It can help understand reasons for updates in the game like the Eliatropes that were just put in. This game is just loads of fun. Very fun to play around with friends. Just download it and you will have no regrets.			"

												Wakfu is a gem. The game is amazing but its not for everyone. The game play is turned base so by nature it is slow. The game is grindy as a korean mmorpg so western players may find it unbearable. The graphics is cartoony so that also rules out the people who like realistic graphics.For me who likes to consider himself a hardcore mmorpg player finds this game amazing, you gotta use your brain, its no hack and slash, the grind is rewarding and also as a dofus player, this was perfect.7/10, I would have given it a 10/10 but its riddled with unbalanced classes which made pvp terrible, and as a pvper, thats bad.

												Now I played Wakfu before it came out on Steam, and it was a very fun experience to play through, along with the lore it had and each class having a unique style in their own right. When I got this game and started it up, I was abit skeptical about how it started off. But later in the game I got used to it and I felt right at home. It's a great MMORPG RTS game that I reccommend to those who want to have a fun experience. It's not meant for everyone, but it's something that I will keep coming back to when I feel down. The graphics in the game look pretty nice, and the world is VERY huge aswell. The fights are fun to, having a tile based fight, and each move counts as you try to figure out what to do. And if you have your friends, you can try to come up with more strategy. I was really impressed on the execution, and it's something that I will continue to love until the end of time. Not the best, but it's still unique. I would give this game an 8.67/10			"

												I played Wakfu a couple years back, then tried to get back in recently with a Freshly made character for testing purposes.They made Xp earned through fights terrible as hell now.In the past say, 30% of the Xp earned is gated behind Premium, which is cool, I think its a fine system which keeps the game free, yet rewards Premium purchase.But now, 70% of the Xp earned is gated behind Premium. Literally makes the game slow down so much for free players. Not sure if this is an action to severely gut the people who Power Level up to past 100 with help from friends, but this hurts newbies trying to level.Scaling is also terrible too, because while every other dungeon can have the difficulty level reduced to Rapid for faster clearing, Quest dungeons (Bovis) can't be tuned. The worse part is that the end boss of these type of dungeons usually aren't even hard, they trounce the player (at the recommended level) through pure stats and damage. If yur starting out in Wakfu, please get someone to carry, or there is little to no fun from Level 1 - 100, and even then, who is to say yur not already burnt out.			"

												After having played for a good month or so, I have to say, this is a rare find among rpgs. Albeit starting the game is mildly difficult, it's a fun and interesting game to play! For what it's worth, I love this game mostly because it's all about the player.The economy is not run based on a setup from the developers, it's completely player-based, meaning you can set up shop in the little customizable bag you are given at the beginning of the main part of the game. Not only that, but there are a bunch of balanced, customizable classes you can jump into depending on your play style! Couple that with spells you have to use to improve, gear you can craft/find/buy from others, and all sorts of bonuses like Clan Member bonuses and Guild bonuses, you can increase your stats and quickly find a build for yourself! If that wasn't enough of a hook for the gameplay, you have several opportunities to ""Restat"", or change up all your spells and ability bonuses!There are a few major downsides to the game: There are NO NPC characters that are useful. By this, I mean there are no shopkeepers or helpful questline helpers, it's all based on you and your groups. This might be bad for some people, but this means you can literally cut through all the crap with hirelings and stuff, and just find like-minded players to work alongside!+ The game is simple to work with, using mostly the right and left mouse buttons to control your character and your surroundings.+ You control the environment! You can decide what crops to take and what all is removed from the area, like herbs, trees, and even the monsters!+ The economy is easy to understand, you sell anything at whatever price you want! It's up to the player that wants what you have to pay the price.+ The graphics are good, as well as the sprites and animations!- There are bugs, as with every game. If you spot something, report it, please, the devs will want to know what is going wrong.- Guilds are at a downside, as there are what are called Haven Worlds, or a World for your guild members to use. Others can slip in and steal stuff from it if you aren't careful, and you'll want to realize you probably WON'T be getting one for a long time if you're a new or semi-poor guild.- PvP is included, so those of you who are low-lvl with high professions, beware other players! Some will want to steal all your crops and leave you nothing in return!- You have to reintroduce anything missing into the environment. If there are no more Ash Trees, to name something important, then if you have the seedlings for it, you'll be forced to replant.There are ways around all the farming/environment stuff, but until you get enough money to buy the Haven Gems needed, it's a bit much to go after. Alot of the players love to help one another out, so ask questions if you want to know something. That said, enjoy playing Wakfu, and hope to see you in the World of Twelve!P.S. if you steal my crops, I'll shoot you. It's as simple as that. D:<			"

												I am not very experienced with Wakfu (as of this review) but I have got to say I was excited to hear that it was coming to Steam, and was free to play. Wakfu is a pretty good sized media franchise from France, there are currently 5 games ""in universe"", 4 released, they are Dofus, Dofus Arena, Islands of Wakfu, Wakfu, and Krogmaster (a tabletop, digital tie in involving minifigures). There are also multiple animated series and movies, including the animated Dofus and Wakfu series. Overall there is alot of lore to take from, and the universe is rich and fun to look at.Wakfu itself however is a pretty good game in my book, It feels like it has alot of strategy, combat wise, compared to most modern mmo's. The level cap in the game is pretty darn high though, so it may feel a bit grindy at times. But with the large and varied amount of classes and builds, I have got to say you wont run out of things to try!Overall I recommend anyone who is a fan of mmo's or turn based strategy games to take a look at Wakfu, and I recommend everyone take a look at the series as a whole!Edit: The game has been released on Steam for a while now, so I have a few additional notes.1. The player population seems to have increased, and is pretty lively compared to what it was before (at least in my opinion.)2. I just realized that the Steam achievements no longer unlock, I dont know what the deal with that is but it should not cause any real problems, its just a minor nuisance.3. have fun!			"

												Terrible. I've been playing it since the beta. Apart from the weird gamaplay and mechanic's decisions which is another big (but subjective) minus, the app is completely bugged out. You see people complaining about bugs at beta and these bugs are still there at the 5th anniversary. Multiple times their database glitches out leaving you without gear, throphies, costumes, materials and other stuff which took weeks to acquire. Best you get - some silly gift from Ankama as a ""compensation"", other times you're just completely being ignored by support.Game community keeps shrinking and that's no surprise. Comparing to what it was years ago, it's just dead now. Disappointed people log back in hoping something had been improved and abandon it again.Also there's no way of disabling unbearably lagging effects which makes you watch spells slo-mo and not being able to do turns in fight. And that's even on new computers with unsupported graphic cards. For instance, my 10 years old laptop with a supported graphic card runs it easily while on the new one with 8 gigs of RAM on the board the game lags out at you big time in fights.			"

												At first, Wakfu is a fun game. It has a really unique gameplay style and fun characters. However, once you get farther into the game, you notice problems that start to pop up. Its starts with small things. Maybe your character bugs out a little, or your spells don't work the way they should, and it isn't too big of a problem to begin with.But then these things stack up. And up and up and up. The development team is horrifically slow when it comes to fixing issues. Well actually, I take that back. Whenever there is a bug that HELPS players, it gets fixed very very quickly. But if you've got a gamebreaking bug that halves the damage you deal? Well, maybe they will get to it in three or four patches. And you get a patch once every two months if you are lucky. Whats that, your class is broken? Don't worry, you can always buy the 30$ class change!And don't even get me started on the support, oh lord. I sent in an issue, and a week later, after not hearing anything from them, I tried to contact them again. Again no response. So I tried to contact them a THIRD time, and finally, after almost a month, they contacted me back and said they had looked at the issue, and decided to do nothing about it.You'll notice I have a lot of hours on this game. That isn't counting the time I put into it BEFORE it was released on steam. Its because they keep promising to fix things. Every patch that comes out I think, hey,  They continue to try and put more and more things into the game without ever fixing the old stuff.  And I hope you like doing hours of research in order to play games! Many stats and spells are ambiguous, and there is NOWHERE in game that explains what they do. So, you have to scour the forums, hoping that your question has been answered somewhere, and that if you do find an answer, it isn't outdated.TL;DR this is ""Wasted Potential: The Game"". The base concept of the game is great, and so much could have been done with it, but in the end it just leads to bitter disappointment.			"

												I have played Wakfu since the first beta. Since the very start of the game. Since 2011. I thought Ankama Games had the right idea by combining their great game with a great video game company like Valve. Since Ankama Games is a French game company, creating a connection with the United States and other countries really helped the game with one of the problems it had, population of the English servers. The things that make this game great are the ideas introduced into the game mechanics itself.The grid-based strategy aspect of the game, combined with the different ways of stat growth and play made this game trully creative with the way players enjoyed the game on a fighting aspect. Another great form of the game is the creative design of the world of Wakfu. Every city, every character, every monster is unique and beautiful. One more great feature of the game is the way real people manipulate with the enviornment, the government, and the people who play the game. Wakfu shines with the idea that people have everything and anything to do with the world in which the players play in. The player can manipulate the mobs in given areas. The player can vote for government officals to enact rules for the country to follow.However, no game is perfect. Wakfu has problems, and unfortunatly the problems happen to be fairly large.Because Wakfu is a game made from a French company, support is not the best when something happens to happen, whether it be in the game or in real life. Although the content is large and the world of Wakfu is large, content seems to be lacking for people who don't want to 'level up'. There aren't many different ways to enjoy the game to its fullest, and although Ankama Games has tried to include ways of enjoying the game, it doesn't seem enough to really keep the players they recieve.I believe Wakfu is a great game and it should be looked at for players who want something different in their MMO. However, Wakfu lacks the ability to keep the players they recieve and although I greatly enjoy the game, and everything it provides, I can't help hoping for more of the game. 7/10 "

												I played this game when it still came out in closed BETA around years ago. The game once really great and enjoyable to play for hours. Too bad the developers make it even worst. Iz still kinda gud, but there's some changes that really hits me...Pros :> A turn based tactical game like no other> Really cool concept> The systems really nice... not just for fighting and looting whiches you can really bussy over something > Sometimes can be relaxing for some reason...> The deck system is nice, you can choose almost limitless possibilites to maintain your skills and build> Respect system <3> Free sidekicks!! ( but reroll every week...)> Unique crafting systemCons :> grinding grinding and grinding...> grind more until that 0.5% relic items drop> The government systems sucks, sometimes they corrupt the country and makes everything bad> Service system really costly to pay for items, (it even has items that drops in the game that you can find easily and they    price it almost 10 times from normal in the OG shop!! whices♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off (x_x) )> Unbalanced classes (sometimes abandoned, like the dev's has no interest in class development(especially unpopular classes) > The XP systems sucks, you cant almost play solo for XP grinds and its hard to get a good party member...> Slow levelingOverall Wakfu has a lot of potential they just need to keep fixing it...

												It can be enjoyable if you got enough people around you to play it with, as many things, but get ready to fall heavily behind while playing with anyone if you aren't using a booster, they become a must after reaching level 80, that's when the idea of exploration and a world of content infront of you closes down to a linear checklist of grinding, running the same dungeon 20-30 times to get an ""almost"" needed item is something that most of the people still playing it seem to consider acceptable or have to put up with, and after reaching it, all that is left is doing it again somewhere else, again, the boosters help alot there too, putting enough hours in trying to ""get good"" at the market eases the burden alot, but then, it's a dying game, if you still haven't played it you are probabbly too late and alot of empty areas and people full of despair await for you, unless you are French, I suppose their server is alive.There is pretty much zero costumer support and alot of unimplemented content or just stuff that were never finished, might as well try runescape.

""STEP INTO A LIMITLESS UNIVERSE"" - WakfuWhat is Wakfu? Wakfu is a limitless universe, with 15+ classes, cute graphics, an amazing amount of content, 17 professions, nature management, government and politics, turn-based combat, player-driven markets, and most of all, 99% of all content is FREE.Wakfu lets you play as a character in a vast universe, to travel it, to traverse all kinds of terrain, to explore, to meet new friends or enemies, but most of all, to enjoy.You can choose amongst 15+ classes (that's a lot!), each with their own unique skills and way of combat, and you are also able to learn and master 17 different professions, from farming, cooking, baking to even tailoring. You can have all of the professions, but it's up to you on what you want to level.This game has a dynamic environment; this means that the world isn't fixed. It's up to us, the players, to plant if the environment lacks plants and to reap if there is too much. It's up to us to decide what will become of the environment.With that being said, a player can lean towards being beneficial (Wakfu) or destructive (Stasis) towards the environment. Wakfu and Stasis are paths you can choose on how you interact with the environment, planting plants, trees and monsters seeds makes you lean towards Wakfu, while cutting down trees, harvesting plants and others make you lean towards Stasis. Most people misunderstand this as Wakfu being good and Stasis being bad, but the proper statement is that: Wakfu is growth as Stasis is regulation. We can't live in a world with a tree in every grid cell, right?Economy is also purely player-driven, you won't find an NPC buying your items for Kamas (the only currency), you'll have to find other people to buy it from you, or sell it in the outpost, where other players see items for sale, easier and in a more convenient way. There are 4 nations that a player can join upon reaching a certain level, each with their own respective territories, laws and government.Politics also play a role in the universe of Wakfu, every 2 weeks, there comes an election wherein a governor is chosen by the players. It's up to the Governor to change laws, pick members for the government and handle relations with other nations.Conclusion? I don't know if you'll like it as much as other people and I do, but just give it a try, play it and you'll find out.			"

Strategic grid based combat, unique classes, a beautiful art style, and a magical story are all found in this game. Try it out for free with a couple friends. Form a group. Have a laugh. Try to beat a dungeon. Specialize in a craft and trade with each other. Propose Friendly dual or attack a player and become an outlaw. This is truly a multiplayer game.			"

												Great MMO Clicker, I highly recommend this if your looking for a relaxing but still challenging game. Beautiful graphics, very  fun but serious story line, an ok class system, and most of all, friendly player base. It's not hard at all to join a guild, players manage the ecosystem, politics, and economy, and they do it well. It is not a pay to win, but pay to play is available. I never used the p2p but I certainly would if I didn't have bills to pay! Although it is a major improvment from Dofus, there are a few bugs that can interfere and hurt your experience on the game. The game is java based and the game client tends to leak memory causing your game to lag or ""stall out"" and even disconnect you. Some players can take the game too serious and PWN players that just unlocked pvp or players that forgot to turn off their pvp. The reason I make that point is because the players that PWN are not just PKing but are rude and nasty. One last thing, the story is not complete and continues with updates every 4 or 5 months from what I have seen. I consider it an up and a down; It keeps you coming back, but who likes a cliffhanger.Overall, This is definatley a must play. AND IT HAS STEAM TRADING CARDS!			"

												I really the game. The classes are pretty unique and amazing. BUT The game trips on itself. With loads of bugs (quests not counting, quest objectives not appearing, monsters being untargetable) and some inconsistencies in translation, the game just feels like its still very much in beta. They just released the Hero System, which in theory is awesome- you can create a team of your own characters. However there is a catch- 10$/month to max your team at 3 AND the really weird restriction of requiring the characters to be of the same nation AND guild. I don't get that at all. Until these are fixed its just a sad thing to watch such a promising, gorgeous, innovative game ruined by its own creators.			"

												3/10It's fun at times and the references can be clever. However, it does not retain my attention for long. It grows rather repetitive and the constant grinding is tedious with little reward until you're well into your 60s-70s level wise(which can, on estimate, can take up to 2 weeks. If you don't care to sleep.).I, personally, also don't care too much for the grid battle style, which, in no way to me, makes it more difficult, only annoying. This game bores me and really offers no great difference from any other online MMORPG. For the download time I suffered (I have unreliable internet at times), it really was not worth it in any means.I have certainly played many MMORPGs, having been playing games since I was eight, and this is certainly not a ""best"". It goes more along the lines of ""Those Generic MMORPGS with a relatively simple and boring plot"".Don't get me wrong. The art was great. The strategy involved is wonderful. It is really just the whole ""Grindy-grindy until you're whiny. Waste your time and lose your mindy.""I've always been a picky person when it comes to plot and grind. I just can't stand it.			"

												Pros:+ Amazing when playing with friends (feels like you're part of a team/party in something like final fantasy)+ Good game design decisions all around+ Some classes offer WAY more difficulty then others+ Classes combine well with eachother in combatPro/Con:+-  You get all of your abilities very early on (You get to do stuff in the early game)+_ You cant sell things to NPCs, everything is done through the ""auction house""+_ Can be very grindy (alot less with friends, but still grindy)+_ Alot to learn (for sure if you take the more difficult classes)+_ ""fast-travel"" is basicly free aslong as the distance isent super longCons:- While everybody gets their own drops in a fight, harvesting materials (like trees or ores) are not instanced, thus making it a race for resources if alot of people are around (thankfully they do grow fast and in the case of trees you can replant them yourself)- Alot less fun solo, you do get a companion that you control yourself, but still way less fun then an acctual playerOverall, this is the first game to make me quit out of time consumption and not out of boredom, highly recommend it, for sure once it acctually hits open beta.Beta keys:  https://secure.wakfu.com/en/steam (not always there, but you can give it a shot every now and then)			"

If you like being ganked by ppl twice your lvl constantly or you're one of those losers that gets a kick out of it give the game a try, as for me i'm out.			"

												ANKAMA BANNED ME BECAUSE I TRIED TO SETTLE A PAYMENT DISPUTE! Ok so I heard tons of stories of how terrible the support for this game is, but I didn't want to believe it was a common thing. That it was just a problem with a few unlucky players and maybe there are just a couple bad employees. Boy was I wrong. I went to buy the drheller and the krosmos harness for the week 3 wakfunding campaign and I only received the confirmation email that activates the in purchases in game for the krosmos harness. I sent a ticket to ankama support as well as PayPal, but they BANNED  ME because apparently the drheller was a ""fraudulent purchase"".  Aside from my personal experience, if you want to talk about the actual game itself, I definitely know now why 80% of the veteran players from years ago abandoned this game like a sinking ship.A lot of complaints I read about are pointless nerfs, next to NO support for North American players, updates are exclusive to end game players and they NEVER fix or expand on the current content for the early game players. If you do try to play the game just to check it out keep in mind that the world supposedly has a LOT less players than it used to from what I've read in the forums, and there's a TON of grinding involved, I didn't mind this because I do enjoy tactical RPGs and I loved the class system, and I started playing about a month ago so I wasn't personally affected by these less than stellar updates.But man, this is completely ridiculous and a freaking shame considering I'm a big fan of the Dofus and Wakfu TV series and comics. I really wanted to see more of this game to make a decision on whether or not it's worth the time, but I guess that's not happening. Season 3 of Wakfu better be worth the money I lost.EDIT I got my response to my ticket, and before they'll look into my case they want to see my birth certificate, passport, or driver's license... I guess this is common practice for most mmos when it concerns your account but I'm still not too keen on giving away crucial identity information to a foreign company. Despite my saltiness I do recommend checking out Treasures of Kerubim and Wakfu, as well as the tie in comics. You can find English translations on brotherhoodoftofuv2 on tumblr.			"

												I was planning since long to start Wakfu, now that it landed on steam I picked this opportunity.I'm really enjoying it so far. Turn-based mechanics are very interesting, the game is group-focused and community is nice compared to other MMO's. Sandbox elements are also pretty interesting. The player-driven economy is a bit broken, but anyway with the new players who joined on steam release there is market and trading for us new players as well.Definitely a game to pick if you are looking for a good turn-based mmo (you have only Atlantica as second choice eheh) and especially the feeling of being rewarded with your hours of gameplay. There is no rush to endgame or max level in a week like almost other MMO's nowdays. "

Then all of a sudden my data kept deleting itself, and then the game wouldn't even open. After repeatedly contacting customer service and being told to do the equivalant of ""turning it on and off"" , they finally agreed to actually take a look at my game data. Lo and Behold, after a month of back and forth they realize that it's nothing that I did, but the games issue. They then promised to fix it soon, and to have a bit of patience. Apparently patience means 3 months of waiting, because that's exactly how long it's been since I was able to do anything with my game. Don't even bother starting.			"

												A really unique MMO that uses a system akin to that of Final Fantasy Tactics.However the support for this game is nonexistant and it's not at all player friendly. It came out almost a year ago on steam from when I'm wwriting this review and they still havne't even fixed the steam achievements. For a game with 149 achievements it's rather unfortunate when you can't unlock over half of them due to an almost year long unfixable bug.If you don't care about achievements and don't mind a game where if something goes wrong you will get no support then by all means this is a pretty great game. The world is fun to explore and the combat is just as fun with lots of interesting classes. However due to the lack of support from the dev team and the fact bugs just aren't getting fixed I can't recommend this game.Update: Apparently the achievements have been fixed finally.			"

												I like the unique look of the game, the unusual character classes, and the turn-based combat.I don't care for the open world system of advancement. With no specific quest line to follow, it leads to a lot of time spent searching for quests, or grinding to advance.The world intrigues me enough to want to play it, but actually playing it feels like a chore when it's so hard to find quests.So for me this game is a ""no"", but it does have a lot going for it. If what I've described above doesn't put you off, it's definitely worth checking out.			"

												This game is for fans of turn-based RPGs and also for the fan of Dofus, another game by Ankama that very much inspired the world of Wakfu (most locations return from Dofus but in a different layout). I've played this game in beta a few years back and I can say it got alot better since then. Give it a try if you're a fan of the genre/of the Dofus-Wakfu Universe.			"

												Visuals - This game gives rather colorful and diverse artwork. Every place you go in this game will be different from another place. I'd say the developers spent a lot of time making the open world as beautiful as 2D can possibly get.Gameplay - As many people will say, this game plays similar to Final Fantasy tactics. You play as one hero in a turn based setting with a series of Action Points to use for spells and a series of Movement Points to walk around. There are large assortments of unique classes and no class plays the same. What makes this game fascinating is how creative every class is.Players - This game has a surprisingly low population for how fun it is. There are many friendly and unfriendly players like in any Massively Multiplayer Online Game. Since the populations are so low though, some higher level players tend to become localy fameous within the servers.Story - I have to say, i haven't even touched the story. It seems kinda iffy to begin with. You incarnate into Astrub and do some mercenary work. Than a giant tv face guy tells you that you are the chosen one to defeat the mighty Ogrest. I'd have to say the story for me is the weakest aspect of the game.			"

Curious, heavily strategic combat system, mounted audiovisual and overall quality will impress many players but...The more you get into it , the more complicated it becomes, after some time appears grind, and micropayments quite clearly show numerously restrictions. It's a shame, thus we miss a lot of joy. Wakfu could be great, and it is just good. Personally, I was not convinced to this position, but maybe because I'm not a fan of this type of game. I found this very good position to be installed on the laptop, because during frequent trips, I can quietly play the levels in Wakfu, instead of playing sapper. On the other hand, you can't fail to notice the enormity of work involved in the production. Drawn graphics, dozens of statistics that describe your character, hundreds of skills, equipment, thousands of quests, in one word good job. Ultimately, this is a niche title that is unlikely to made an international career, but certainly appeals to maniacs of turn-based games and drawn the world.			"

												Again and again I find myself returning to this game, only to encounter a diffirent disbalance and same broken AI. One would think that since the game came out, developers could adress these issues. Instead, we get alternative questlines and new cash shop items.The gameplay is enjoyable. The artstyle is good. But the world feels very, very empty.The game was originally intended to have a community. Players run faction politics, entire economy and even location ecosystems. It has now gotten to a point where people jump to another server, just because it has a spike in population. Many people who return to the game after a long time seem to be bewildered by the state of affairs.There is variety of classes, each with their own, unique abilities that grow stronger as you use them. This is great, except because of the aforementioned imbalance, which in turn leads to a class getting nerfed or revamped. Remember that character that you played a while ago that you really liked? Here, have a totally diffirent one.Crafting is a grindfest. If there was an active economy going, this would have been easier. But if you want to create a good item, you have to personally collect all the components required for a specific item and craft it. Both of these require a good amount of time to get the skills for. And the list of required components can often be quite extensive. This repeated process is the only way to advance in a crafting profession.There's an extensive list of unique enemies, who often come in matched groups, so as long as you advance in level or just travel a lot, you get to face various new challanges. This only lasts until later levels, when the grind sets in, or when you just need to acquire specific components or a piece of armor. This uniqueness also causes AI to frequently do random things. And woe upon you if you picked a summoner class - healers who prefer full health targets over dying allies, melee summons who decide to just step back a bit and skip turn...I wish the game would do better, I really do. But so far I've come to be repeatedly dissapointed.			"

Rating: 6/10What I like about this game is that its a turn base strategy mmo game.Could have been a decent game but there are some reasons why i only gave it a 7/10 ratingbut with the recent update its 6/10.Will I recommend this game to everyone? Read the PRO's and CON's then you decide if you want to play the game.PROS:* 17 Playable classes each with its own unique set of skills.* You can create up to 5 character per server although you have to pay for 3 more character slots.* Customization for gender, eye color, hair color, skin color, hair style and default outfit.* Eco system which lets player control the environment per map* Haven Bag that lets player create and customize his own house/place where in he can do garden, crafting and also sell stuff.* Lots of things to craft and do.* Lots of dungeons you can explore.* You can join a nation and colonized a territory or even vote for ruling governor(for booster users only).* You can create/join a guild and get world haven where in you can create your on place to farm, fish, mine, etc...* Hidden treasures and secrets.CONS:* Achievements on steam does not work.* Bugy, not just few but lots of them* some environment buff dont work properly you will have to relog to fix this problem* when you trade with someone sometimes you wont be able to cancel the trade or close it, again you will need to relog.* sometimes when you are in a battle there is a bug where in you can't attack properly, again relog.- when you have a poor connection sometimes the sprites are missing, broken or mixed where a    fish turns into a box.- and so much more... isnt that fun exploring bugs? ^_^* Some updates and events are not announced on time.* To much grinding and farming.* Player Base is getting low.* PVP is not balanced.* There are things that only a booster pack user can do.Recent Update 1.52PROS:* added a ranking system for dungeons* added new crafting itemsCONS:* They changed the repeatable quest in maps where in now it gives you less exp, you will need to be a booster pack user to get the max exp reward bonus that it use to give. This game is already a grinding game and then you make decisions like that and the best part is that you dont show that in your updates hiding it to players. Way to go anakma you'll defenitely going to lose players with that, keep it up. ^_^			"

												Visuals----The one thing that's still great about this game. Ankama took their existing universe of Dofus and expanded on it. Everything is nice and lovely and vibrant, the setting is very consistent with itself. It's a great example of worldbuilding making a game notable and able to stand out above the crowds.Gameplay---I can handle most turnbased things, Xcom isn't a stranger to me in any way, but the turn based style does not lend itself well to multiplayer in this fashion. The gameplay doesn't change that much between level 20 and level 100. There's no real defined niche that you can build your character to fill that can't be filled by someone else of your class with 5 minutes of free time. All in all I think they kind of lost sight of what made the game good in the first place and decided that it was easier to update Dofus than it was to flesh out Wakfu more.Tech-----Somehow, a PC that runs Overwatch at 1080p at 100fps constant has terrible jitters in this super simple java game. I'm running 16gb of ram but the game chugs even when I use launch paramters on the standalone client and feed it up to 12gb of ram. Overall, the game is a 3.5/5 for me if you like turn based tactical games. I'd suggest something else if you are looking for an MMO to play with friends however, the community is just about nonexistant(on Nox anyways, the North American server)			"

On the positive side charming graphics, great music, and unique gameplay.  On the negative constant class revamps, stat revamps, lack of crafting and gathering revamp (crafting is utterly pointless), and duplication bugs that ruined the market.  Honestly feels like the game has never left open beta.			"

												If I could give a mid-ranged review? I would. The game had and still has a lot of potential and nostalgic feel to it for those of us especially who enjoyed games like Final Fantasy Tactics.The Crafting and Gathering system is huge; big enough to be it's own thing really. You could almost make a Wakfu version of Stardew Valley out of all the stuff you can craft and the things you have to gather, how and where. For my inner crafter and explorer.. it's great! I love teh fact you can transplant not only plants, but animals and mobs into different areas.. though the current system still gets abused, the way they discourage that abuse is a creative addition to faction gameplay I simply didn't expect.. and still appreciate. Multi-level maps are lots of fun to run around on usually, though there are some drawbacks.The downside hits when you get into progression through the rest of game. It's slow, really slow after you get through the opening city quest. And I mean this is crawling a mile on your belly through a corn field not knowing what direction you're even supposed to be going, slow. Getting anywhere with dungeons is a pain alone unless they're severely underlevel, or you manage to find a party (good luck with that!) And actual quests are so few and far between on the slow grind, or worth so little that it actually makes it feel slower at times. Combat is fun but difficult solo at times, and the overall health loss when you die doesn't help encourage solo players towards the story or content at all in my opinion. The maps, while fun to explore especially when they become more multi-level? Can be very confusing for that same reason, as the way up to a higher tier of the map or down to a lower one isn't always clear: wasting a lot of your time running in circles only to find out you can't even get to X place from where you're at or without crossing some bridge a zone over.Don't get me wrong, it's lots of fun if you have one to three people to play with all the time.. but otherwise main progression and catching up if you get behind your group can be really tough. It's incredibly easy to have double the level gathering and crafting, from what you have as a battle class, if that tells you anything. Which, is fine with me at this stage. As I said, that part can be a lot of fun on it's own. Still grindy after a certain level, but fun.Overall, I do reccomend this game if you like crafting and gathering, or especially if you have a friend (or more than one preferrably) to play it with: but definitely take this into consideration. If you're not up for a grind of any kind, or want to play through the main content on your own sometimes? This probably isn't the game for you past Astrub (the first City.) If you do enjoy crafting, gathering and exploring though? Try it. You can get lost in this game for hours if you do.			"

												Updating This Review from formerly Nov 7, 2014Wakfu is a unique game like most have already told you, it mixes MMO with turn-based battling ALA Final Fantasy Tactics and to a lesser extent, things like X-com, though the visuals may seem cartoony the game is still very complex in my opinion and you need awareness and quick-thinking to fight some higher level enemies with specific mechanics and priorities in battle. The sad thing about Wakfu is that it has changed several times in the past years, some for good and some for bad. I still stick with my original belief that this is a fun game with the potential for enjoyment for a lot of people.The Good :Character builds and customization are great, although the last change to the system limited potential, I still am able to make builds that are to my flavor and effective in combat past level 150+ where I currently am.I use the heroes system they have to play my myriad of characters who usually complement each other in some way. The Heroes system was in beta for some time, and essentially just allows you to play three characters on your account for a fee. (Booster + Heroes System costs around the same amount as a standard MMO sub).The Challenge system in this game adds much needed variety to farming, though some challenges are left better suited to particular characters in the game. Being turn based, you're able to effectively ""backstab"" enemies for more damage on your turn by being behind them. Some challenges require all enemies be killed this way for a bonus to exp and drop rate. Sometimes its worth it, sometimes its not, choose how to spend your time and you may cut your grinding in half.Dungeon System in this game is interesting, and it is good for the most part, being able to set dungeons to an easier difficulty for less rewards or making them extra hard for potentially double the rewards is great for people who need to learn a boss mechanic or feel up to overpowering a boss/groups and getting a better chance at those rare/unique items they seek so desperately.The community in Wakfu has always been an interesting one, somewhere between hospitable to passionate individuals who try their best to work with Ankama and revive this dying game. They love the game, and so do I, and I wish to see it thrive. It shows when I login and people are hanging out, talking about strategies, calling for dungeon runs, selling their stuff, and generally just wanting to have fun together.The Bad :Wakfu is a hard game to get into past a certain point, while being visually welcoming to those of a young age, you will quickly understand the elemental system and either learn to memorized enemies weakness/strength or grow frustrated as your damage is abyssmal because you forgot X monster was strong against X element.The customization for the game as far as battles has become a little more limited since the changes, and you will see optimized builds (like any other game) are almost necessary with the lack of choice. Though you can skimp on one or two skills, always having the core ones assures near maximum potential for damage/survivability especially against enemies who may have strong resistances against two of your three elements which each character has access to spells for.Grinding can be pretty bad unless you have friends to run dungeons with, and the shame is that the heroes system while making it fun for soloers, makes going in with randoms more unnecessary as well. With just yourself and a single other friend paying a premium subscription you can practically do all dungeons in the game, or six box accounts like some have in the past.They somewhat recently changed how gear in the game drops, claiming it was for more ""unique builds"" with elements being rolled out randomly with gear but this has just made rerolling stones more valuable and frustrating. Now you can't simply get a set and use it, you have to get the elements for your build correct as well. Just a chore, really, along a lot of other systems in the game unless you nibble at the grinding of mats, tokens, and crafting a bite at a time.Ankama mostly puts out cosmetics while delivering small trickles of actual content, changing the game seemingly with no input from the community (Though you see when Flat responds in the forums all the time) and its moreso they can't seem to filter the ""bad"" suggestions from the ""good"". Bugs still exist in the game for 3+ years ago. Oddly enough its their birthday for this game as of writing this and I feel like the cake is a little stale.The Overall TL;DR VersionWakfu is a game I love, and this review is probably biased as hell, but I am aware of it. In saying that, would I recommend this game to new people? Yes, for a while, levels 1-50 might be fun to dabble in but once you get 80+-100+ is when the game ""starts"" and thats when it will either make you or break you. Do I think its worth playing right now? Maybe? Depends on how much you can tolerate. Bugs, graphical issues, optimization problems, class balances, promises both delivered poorly or well, or not at all plague this game. It has its faults. THIS GAME IS NICHE AS **** AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT GOING IN! Besides that, I enjoy it, I put away my 13 dollars a month for it, even when I don't play, because some days its just fun to hop in, say hello to my guild, kill a few things, bake a couple of loaves of bread, and then go on about my day.The game features 17 unique classes, all with strengths and weaknesses, healing or tank, positioning or dps, and mixtures of both. Not gender locked, lots of cosmetics to buy, emotes to find, places to explore, and all set in an open-world environment (For grinding mobs). There are a handfull of big ""Quests"" to do at certain levels such as 50, 100, 110, etc that will boost you a few levels.Heroes system allowing to play 3 classes/combos at once. Guild level up system, pvp (Haha don't), and a few other things you'd come to expect quality of life wise like teleports and lore. While the game is not pay to win, the premium sub makes this ""easier"" to deal with. The typical 30% ""faster"" for premium sub, but if you don't want to invest, you can still eventually get there...albeit in a car with one flat tire.I have stockholme syndrome, its a terrible drug. =/			"

												Personally, I feel like the game is too rigid, and it doesn't give enough space to socialize or explore the NPCs and towns freely at your own pace. Perhaps it's like that after only spending a few hours playing it and not exploring other places. However, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would (these reviews give you too much to hope for). Leveling up even at low levels is slower than I'm used to. (So, if you don't like grinding all day everyday then stay away. Although that's mostly what mmorpgs besides the quests are all about. Let's be honest, lol.) I feel like there could be room for improvement in the structure of towns and NPCs that surround it, better introduction than just tutorials about how to fight, etc. Although I may just be giving a hasty generalization as I was expecting more from many positive reviews.

												A suprisingly entertaining game that deserves a try by anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games! Obviously similar at first glace to games like Final Fantasy Tactics and the Disgaea series, but with it's own twist and features for online multiplayer!A few hours in and I still have quite a lot of learn about how to play Wakfu, but that's part of the fun! The medium strength learning curve means things may feel familiar to you from other games, but not entirely. One of the best designs is the classes themselves. A large number to choose from and not the standard, boring names and designs like Warrior, Mage, and ...well actually there is a Rogue, but it's cool! The artistic design of this game is fantastic and also adds to the familiar, but fresh feeling that Wakfu brings!Oh, and you get a crate for your bag....house...thing! :D			"

												(ignore the hours; I play on the actual client)So I played Dofus briefly in 2011 and only recently downloaded Wakfu. My main is just a level 25 Pandawa (I'm taking my time) and I think I'm in love. This game hits many points for me; it's cute, turn-based, and it's got loads of content. Score!Also, part of the reason I like it so much is because it reminds me of Spineworld, an old MMO on miniclip (2007-9)... Gosh I'm feeling so nostalgic right now, haha. Kind of wish I downloaded Wakfu sooner... /grumblesSeriously, if you're a fan of 2d turn-based games, try this one out.Overall: 10/10 ☆彡			"

												Great game, fairly addictive.Addictive how? I don't know how to explain. It's just a personal preference thing.If you enjoy games that are slow and casual, you'll want to try this out.You'll spend most of your time harvesting resources you'll probably end up selling.The combat itself is turn-based, so that's self-explanatory. If you want a fast-paced game, you're looking at the wrong place.The first 12 levels or so, you'll find yourself with a bunch of interesting quests, but pretty much after that the story kinda disappears. I've only played till lvl 50, but so far I haven't had any storyline quest after the intro.At any rate, the most appealing factor of this game is probably its style and art. The grind itself isn't hectic, but farming for resources might break your sanity.Personally, I think this might be more of a social game.Also, this game has no problem showing animals mating.			"

												Hello all! Finny posting here, some of you who are reading this might want a brief review, some of you might just be looking at another Hardcore Wakfu players opinion so I'll give both. Played hours here 600 odd actual? 3.3k (no life)1st things 1st, this game is extremely unique i've never played a game like this, a game like this is truly amazing and so is the fact that the game is available on the Mac platform (what i'm using). TLDR: Game is amazing but VERY VERY grind-y, lonely and un-sociable (Read bottom paragraph). Would recommend :]Story: This is extremely limited, this is newbie friendly but is very short and only links to Ogrest which is still yet to be incorporated into the game (I think this was going to be level 200 content) once you progress to mid 100 content (level 50) the newely revamped islands (currently 2 out of 5-6+) you then get new quest-lines which feature ways to get Kamas (In game money) quicker through even more exploration of the game, this is tedious but can be fun for people who are casual and don't mind spending 20 hours+ running around the game. The story then jutters and jumps to mid game content (level 100, 118, 120 and 125) these questlines again feature kama making methods and are EXTREMELY fun and give an insight into the story of the game and the Ultimate Bosses (weekly bosses, sadly no challenge what-so-ever) you then have the section of the game which is the most grindy, intensive, game quit feeling inducing moment ever, this is the jump from 120 to the next 140 quest, this is the most boring and lonely grind experience ever, this puts most people off the game. From here you have more quests more frequently and you would have probably found a guild and start to have some online Wakfu friends, you then lead into the high level content, I won't speak about this since you'll probably have a basic understanding of the game and some good friends etc.Guilds: This is all down to preference but the size of the guilds aren't huge and you are basically forced into high level guilds just to see anyone online, there are a few English guilds which are really nice and newbie friendly (notice how I said few, it really is hardly any guilds that are newbie friendly) when entering this game it's not advised to ask high levels for leeching I will give you a quick run down of why:XP is grindy as HECKYou'll be on 0.5-0.75x XP meaning that someone grinding you a few levels will feel like a life time, period.Fun factorIs it fun for high levels? Yes and No, depends on their mood and what you're like as a player etc.Language Barrier Hit and miss remember this game is multi-cultural so be wary of whom you ask for help due to language barriers!In game revenue / money methodThis is called 'Kamas' you gain some each fight and with chests that you open from completing a respective Questline, this is tedious but you get quite a lot of money, awesome! On Remington you have quite a nice economy meaning that while some items are crazy high they are endgame and so you'll only aim for these once you have complete knowledge of the game and dungeons etc. Majority of other high level stuff is dirt cheap so that's cool!Dungeons:Fun and grindy you don't have to run it 1,000 time for an item to have 1 chance of dropping it but instead....! You can run it 1,000 times to get enough tokens to buy it huzzzah! So it's all down to your opinion, there's also major awesome guides online showing you how to complete these dungeons as-well as other players that you'll be running with experience!PvP:Completely broken due to only a select amount of classes being revamped and overly powerful, unless you follow the crowd with new classes i'd advise against it.Classes: Old ones are much weaker and often not taken/ accepted as much in dungeons compared to newer classes, same with other games but sad really R.I.P Sadida ;w;Bugs:This game has a fair amount of bugs in it but these seem to be ironed out fairly quickly, until recently where dupers have been duping end game items and selling them for very low prices, this has in turn kinda ruined the economy and the player base due to not trusting the market and other players, a lot of people such as my self feel slightly cheated that new people pick it 1-4 of these duped 20million each relics and I spent months farming 1 worth 4 million... This is a major problem as of May 26th 2015 so if you're reading the review take this into account!			"

												Honestly the tutorial and opening quests were so horrible that both me and a friend trying it for the first time couldn't stand it and quit. Shame I did really like the combat. I mean there was some weird pizza quest that took so long we just quit. In general I wouldn't recommend playing it until they revamp the beginning of the game. To start the forced tutorial needs to be optional, the game isn't that complicated and having played many tactics style games it was absolutely painfully slow.			"

												I was really looking foward to play this game!It looks nice,I love these grid turn-based rpgs so i was expecting a good time.I throughly disappointed! I did the tutorial and then bam!! I was dropped in a world with no info!No clue what stats i should be investing my points,no idea what my skills did,the quests were scattered and the constante mob noises were trully annoying!Still i kept on going,but i soon realized another important issue! This game is impossible to play alone! Half a dozen quests in and i'm stuck fighting mobs way above my level!I either missed something or you need to grind a ton inbetween quests!I thought the interaction with the biomes to be interesting and was looking foward to explore the politics meantioned in the description since it seems amazing.By me this game just doesn't deserve a recommendation!I was expecting a fun game and instead i got a grindy, confusing mess. . .

												Do not let my play time on Steam fool you, I played this game for countless more hours than what's stated here. I just keep coming back to it, because it's really what you make it. You can hardcore grind all day long or play more casually like me these days, lounging about spamming the best emotes I've seen in a game, role playing, or PvPing. I also voted it for Steam's ""Game Within A Game"" award because there's just so many side quests, mini games, and achievements. I do wish Steam would fix it's achievement registry though because I have way more than 2!This is not to say the game is perfect. I've seen some major bugs over time but they do reward fair compensation and try their best to fix things in a quick manner. I'd say that's normal for most any MMO though, wouldn't you?So try it. One of my favorite games to date.			"

												I loved Final Fantasy Tactics A2 and the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series and always wished for a multiplayer version of those games. This game does a pretty good job of putting the combat experiences of those games in a multiplayer setting. Besides the combat, I also enjoyed the game's environmental mechanics because it kind of gives me a Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing kind of vibe where the world gives you these resources to do things with, and the players are responsible for tending to them or making something out of them. As for the grinding, I personally don't know if it is actually necessary or not, but in any case I managed to skip the first story quests altogether and head to my chosen nation (Bonta) and then proceeded to grind the highest level mobs and dungeons that I could manage, purely because I love overwhelming myself in these tactics games and barely pulling through. It also helps that the only punishment for death is no exp gain for a lost battle, reduced stats for about 3 minutes and a respawn back to the previous checkpoint area of your choosing. I've spent no money on the game so far, but I might in the future if I keep playing. Paying players get some nice bonuses, but I've been playing comfortably without them. There's also some nifty costumes and stuff too. I recommend the game because it's free and I enjoy it. If you get it, I'd definitely recommend doing the tutorial and trying out a few different classes. I went through a couple classes and then went with the Elitrope as my main because I personally loved the portal mechanic. My brother went with the archer because he loved the obscene range and then the huppermage because of the elemental/light attack dynamic. There's a lot of variety, so don't be afraid to try a few out. Also, your lower level alts will gain an experience multiplier to make grinding levels faster,			"

												I have been playing this game off and on (mostly on) since 2012. I more than likely have thousands of hours of gameplay which I think is more than enough to warrant me to review it. And yet... reviewing this is hard. The game itself conceptually and artistically is fantastic. It is such a visually pleasing game and the music is pretty great too (after a while I put the music on mute however). You can really feel the thousands of hours of hand drawn work that went into making Wakfu such an attractive game. But the two caveats here is that the game is buggy and the customer support is lackluster at best. But before you turn away and never touch this game - just give it a shot. The game itself is good enough and challenging enough that you might really take to it. If you loved those JRPGs with the word 'tactics' thrown onto the end (or front like 'tactics ogre') of their titles then you might really fall for this game. What is more is that it is an MMO and as anyone who has really dug deep into an mmo knows you start to form bonds with these people that you play with. It is really unlike any experience a video game can provide.			"

												Honestly, I went into this game not expecting too much since it's just another RPG. I'll be truthful, the character design is extremely pleasing and creative, gameplay is. . . alright I suppose. The issues I found, though not playing it long (for a reason), is that there's very little ambience. It gives the game an eerie feeling. . ? I mean sure there's bright colours and I can turn on my own music but besides loading screens, don't expect too much sound unless you enter a fight and EVEN THEN there's no battle music to submerge you in it. Also, besides quests I didn't see much else to do. . . Better level up!! Since there's not much else to do!  The other issue I found was that I made a character and DID the tutorial and leveled to almost level 10 in one night (which isn't difficult trust me, there's plenty of enemies). I quit the game EXPECTING IT SAVED PROGRESS that I could come back to, but INSTEAD when I reopened the game it's as if my character or rogress EXISTED in the first place. I even used the same character names and everything! So, I had to redo the entire tutorial and everything. Yes because that's my favourite part of an MMO. . . If I even open the game again and my character was deleted once more I can gaurantee that I will be furious. There's no ""save"" option or is it just ever so hidden away that I can't locate it. . ?Anyways, to put it simply:Character design - HighGraphics - HighGameplay - Medium to lowOverall - an OK game, if you need to pass time.

I mean, I'm not a pro at it or anything. But the game is actually really really fun. You actually have to work at your goal. Which I really like. Though some of the players can be quite immature and you'll have a few of those nubes that will spam their emotes, and you'll find a few (and weird) bugs here and there in the game. And the admins could try and get rid of some of the lag. Other than that I don't see too much of a problem with the game. That being said I rate this game 8/10.

												* CaveatsFirst of all, the caveats.  If you can't handle these, don't bother:** Partial pay-to-winBonus XP and loot abound alongside otherwise-unatainable items for those who open their wallet.  I wouldn't call it a true pay-to-play since it's entirely possible to compete with people who pay, but it will take significantly more effort on your end.  The items may even make sense in some cases if they're cheap enough, but I would never recommend to anyone the booster pack or paying continuous fees for the new hero system  It's preposterous unless you have far too much money and nothing better to do with it.** SlowTactical, turn-based combat that gives everyone 30 seconds to make their move.  With up to twelve players per battle (6 players per team PvP), there can be something of a wait until your turn.  For me, this is an advantage since I can plan out my approach more carefully, or even do other things while playing (the game makes a distinct sound when it's your turn), but people who prefer action will find it a bit troublesome.** ConfusedWakfu sometimes wants to straddle the line between single player and MMO.  The scenes when following the main questline definitely try to feel like you're playing through a single player RPG, and those other players with you are all extras.  You, yes, you are the hero of prophecy, and it is your task alone to defeat Ogrest.  It's a neat approach, but the disconnect is sometimes a bit much.** TrollsDon't like being randomly killed by someome three times your level?  Might not be your game.  The only way to completely opt out of PvP is to stay in Astrub, where you'll never be able to level far.  Honestly, this doesn't happen often.  Once every couple months or so, it seems to happen to me.  The consequences of losing are pretty miniscule -- You reappear at your phoenix and there's a negative status effect attached to you for three minutes.  My suggestion is generally to ignore them because of this, but some people have strong emotional reactions to this, so they should be aware.** PerformanceMy laptop is hardly top of the line, but it plays a number of my games with no problem.  It doesn't even slow down much on Minecraft most of the time, and we know how badly that was coded.  Why, then, does this 2d game sometimes completely tank in framerate even when the graphics settings are at the minimum?  Why can it then run quite well sometimes with the graphics set to max?  There's a wide variation possible based on what's happening at the time, both visually (there was a problem with the steam/smoke effect a few months ago that brought both machines I used Intel cards on to their knees, while my significantly older Radeon didn't suffer at all) and in terms of action (beginning and ending battles, loading areas, players suddenly logging in, etc. can sometimes leave Wakfu unresponsive for seconds on my laptop), so if your machine is fairly weak, prepare for occasional input or display lag.** DocumentationMy goodness.  There are tutorial panels that come up occasionally to try to tech you what's going on.  Some of them are massively outdated, some aren't descriptive enough to be much help, some come up at bad times and block your view, or even mouse (Though most can be dismissed with a click, I encountered one that could not.), at awkward times.  Frequently, the best option is to ask someone.* The restNow, on to the good stuff:** Class selectionThere are a variety of classes that can represent a significant range in play styles.  The classes I love the most aren't neccessarily liked by my friends as I do not always like theirs, which I generally take to be a good thing on variety.  Even within classes, there are a surprising number of variants available based on the spells you choose to bring to battle and where you spent your points when leveling.  There are some respec opportunities available for free (as well as one for cash and one that requires you to collect a rather shocking amount of items), and it's relatively easy to level a character once you learn where to go and what to kill (so you can even discard a character and redo it all if you don't feel it's worth earning a respec).** Fun combat systemIt's not the best system I've ever seen (Makai Kingdom forever, man!), but the combat system is remarkably nice.  With the recent update, you are limited in the number of spells/abilities you can bring to battle.  This has significantly hampered one of my characters, who was a staunch generalist, but it has helped refine a few others.  The spells, active abilities, passive abilities, and attributes of your character are genuinely brought to life by a combat system that effectively allows you to translate your choices during character growth into sometimes novel and interesting results in combat.  It then goes further by offering additional challenges in combat that you can complete for bonus XP and items.  If you decide to go along with it, these can sometimes make a battle much more interesting.  Even enemies notably weaker than you can get complicated when you refuse to give up on any of the challenges, which can be a delightful way to keep things interesting when you need to gather items dropped by weak enemies.** GraphicsThe anime-style graphics are generally well done, with good customization for your character's appearance (Your equipment appears on your character, allowing for great flexibility in appearance if you're not too worried about having great equipment, or you can use costumes to hide it and choose freely.) and relatively fluid animation that feels quite right when put together.** StoryThe story itself is pretty generic, but it's realized in a remarkably nice universe with solid backstory and a wide varity of interesting characters.  Suffice it to say the world has a great feel to it.** CommunityYeah, I mentioned trolls earlier.  They definitely exist, and there's no real way to control or contain them implemented.  They're a small portion of the population, though.  Some of the conversations and interactions between players are hilarious or intriguing, there's a wide variety of emotes to unlock, and even text smilies are brought to life with the vizage  of your character doing the expression above your head.  There's plenty of people to talk with, and sometimes random people just feel like inviting you to join their group.  Being an introvert myself, I was rather cautious at first, but I've grown rather fond of people randomly inviting me to go stomp through a dungeon or two with them, or to do a bit of this or that quest line with them.  It's really rather fun.** TypesA bit of a note, the options available to players are a bit more vaired and detailed then Healer, Tank, DPS.  Obviously, there will be damage specialists sometimes, but they can specialize on distance or close combat if they can afford to sacrifice the other, there will also be those who specialize on moving allies or enemies to different spaces in the field to maximize the advantage for their side, characters who can use a great number of status effects on friend and foe alike, characters that place blockages on the field to keep enemies where you want them or who scatter automated turrets or summoned allies across the field to win with sheer numbers...  If you're expecting battle to always be straightforward, you're in for a surprise.* ConclusionWhile I hate some of the free-to-play nonsense, and I mourn the great potential the hero system had before it became the rent-a-slot deal it is, I have a great deal of respect for the effort and thought that has shaped this game into the remarkable thing it currently is.  I enjoy Wakfu a lot, and many of my fellow fans of tactical turn-based combat will likely come to the same conclusion should they give it a long enough try.  I wholeheartedly recommend Wakfu to those who enjoy a good turn-based tactical fight.			"

												Wakfu is one of the best games I've ever played!  It has an amazing system where players contribute to their Nations environmental status, whether it be keeping monsters at a constant spawning rate or keeping the plantlife flourishing and available for everyone to farm and gather.  It's really engaging and makes for great communities and teamwork involving everyone!			"

												This game is a fantastic amount of fun, even compared to many other tripple-A titles. It has a way of easing you into the gameplay and system that fealt like the right ammount of hand-holding and freedom to make mistakes. I do understand that Wakfu or it's parent game Dofus are not for everyone. It being on the turn based and tactical side of MMO's it does take the right fit for a gamer to enjoy. That being said however if you are new to turn based tactical RPG's and want to give them a try, this game will not let you down. It can work as an excellent introduction into the genre, and the community in this game has proven time and time again to be very welcoming to newcomers, and you will get every bit of assistance you could ask for.All things being equal, I would highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys this genre of game and my personal overall score of this game would be around 8.5/10The flaws are few and not wanting to repeat what my fellow reviewers have said I will make a refrence a particular reviewer for his/her hard work and broad grasp of the game. Having read through the majority of the reviews the one I do most agree with is Myrtæth's.Myrtæth gives a fairly informative and detailed review of the game. Look her review and should give you every thing else you would want to know.			"

												So, I've played Wakfu for  2500 hours since open beta almost 6 years ago and i recommend this game.I find this MMORPG very fun to play although it does has its downsides to. So here are some pros and cons:Pros:- Its realy fun to play if you are the strategic kinda type and like to take your time (Turn-based)- The Community in-game is realy friendly and almost always helpfull since pvp isnt a big or esential part of the game.- Theres lots of diffrent quests to do, Profesions to be leveled, Dungeons to run, people to hang out with, collectibles to be found and tons of other stuff.- Lots of different character classes to choose from for your own playstyle (right now its about 18 (both male and female))Cons:- Wakfu has its fair share of bugs, these are mostly minor but still iritating (also steam achievements seemed to progress slower or not at all when they should be (this is on 22-07-2016).- It has a lack of tutorials, hints do apear but theres nothing to solid, although there are lots of Guilds in Astrub (main beginners region) that are always looking for new members and are willing to help out.- All the things thrown at you can be pretty overwhelming at first, but you probably know a lot more around lvl 50 (can be achieved in less then 5 hours if power leveld so depends how u look at it)I WONT recommend this game for people that can't get along with others very well and are the leeroy jenkins kinda type.I DO recommend this game if you are looking for something for the long run with lots of stuff to do, friends to be made, and strategic fun the be had.

												Wakfu is a tactical MMORPG unlike any other MMO except for its prequel, Dofus.  It has play style similar to Final Fantasy Tactics where combat takes place in a grid. The character classes (15 of them) in Wakfu (and Dofus) have unique play styles and the classes themselves can be played many different ways.The spells have a variety of rules, and positioning makes a big factor in damage dealt/recieved.The art in this game is very charming.  It's very pleasing to just look at the content in the game.The music is very pleasing as well.  All from playful, cheery music to serious, blood-pumping music.There is a lot of humor in this game and a lot of funny parodies.  A lot of naughty references are in the game too, but are subtle enough that kids wouldn't (or shouldn't) understand.Of course, playing in a team with others is a lot of fun (and often necessary for tackling dungeons of your lvl).  Being in a guild & the in-game group finder tool helps with playing with others to enjoy the game better.Players can also make an impact on the environment.  Most mobs can be planted to have them spawn, and they can also be killed enough to have very little to no population in the area (sometimes ghost forms appear when that happens). Flowers, Trees, and crops can also be planted in the world and are shared with others, and they can also be completely harvested with none left for others.  Making certain plant/mob population too high or too low or just right can affect area bonuses and nation bonuses.  One nation (Riktus) benefits from other nations having their bonuses ruined.The environment, plus nation laws and wars set by a governor voted by its citizens (who then can appoint other people to different positions in government), makes for interesting experiences in the world.I've been playing this game for a long time (since open beta Jan 2012).  It's enjoyable and I recommend it.			"

Of course you're free to join one of those plenty guilds but they are mainly just inviting players for their ""guild-points"" they recieve for each fight you win ^^			"

												This is my experience of finding Wakfu.I really love a legendary game Final Fantasy, all of them. but the most I personally like, is the tactic. I played it on every game station it has. Started on PSX, then Lion War on PSP came out, I even installed emulator so i can play on my phone. Thats how much i Loved it. The Grid-Based battle. The Story written. The Plot. The Character classical grinding process. The Class complexity and lots of skills each of them have.  The Game was simply.. perfect.Until I reach a point where I want to explore another great game with same criteria. I try a lot of games, not very satisfying. Sometime the battle was not good, the story not interesting, too easy. it always lack of something, that tend to makes me stop playing. ""Maybe  FFT is the best game after all."" Thats exactly my thought at the time.Then, I found Wakfu.It was an RPG. MMO at its best. Grid-Based Battle, and Free roaming. Various Character you could choose to play with and the complexity of each character skills, is remarkable. It has profession system, side quest like. A Guild, Nation, Outlaw, and environmental system. Also, It has many secret too. I found several secret places that even havent used. I saves several and upload on my profile. It has so many element that hasnt been implemented, yet the game was this much interesting.Long story short, this game is worth your time.			"

												I really want to like this game.  I mean I REALLY want to like it.  There are a few things preventing me from giving my full life to this game.-Pros--Great design and look-Unique classes-Interesting skills (more on this later)-If you like tactical RPGs and MMOs then this is probably for you.-Cons--VERY complicated for a beginner to get into. (this seems to be a theme)-Not very beginner friendly, most things have to be explained by long-time players within the game.-Skills are horribly explained, skill buffs/beduffs are explained in pop-ups within pop-ups within pop-ups at times.-Very convoluted texts and quests.-Some things such as haven bags, setting a location, and professions aren't explained very well at all.-Unexplained reasoning for actions having to be taken by the player, such as HAVING to have a respec at lvl 10 or you cannot fight anything in the game, ever.  If this is a bug of some kind, it should be stated as such by the developer.  Otherwise, it's quite jarring to suddenly realize you can no longer battle anything in the game.Again, this game is great and has wonderful depth to the classes and skill sets, but the convoluted execution of it all does not create a well-thoughtout package for beginners.  The tutorial in the beginning leaves much to be desired and only prepares the player for the battles.  Everything else in the game has to be found out, missed, or learned through other longtime players in the game.I still recommend trying this game out and see if you are willing to spend the time necessary to learn all of what it has to offer.  I'm still learning as I go, gaining a little bit more knowledge as time goes on through other players.  It's a slow going process but it might pay off in the depth and fun to be had.			"

												It's a shame that you don't see much turn-based combat in MMOs anymore, especially when it's done so well, like in Wakfu. Really, there's a lot of great mechanics in the game that are super unique and fun to play around with, but the game is pretty empty sometimes and there's no real questline structure past the early areas. You're kind of just released into the world to grind, and while the combat is unique, it's really personal preference as to how fun it is. Overall, the most innovative MMO I've ever played, though innovative doesn't necessarily mean outstanding.			"

												If you like Final Fantasy Tactics (PSX) and Dungeons and Dragons. Then YES! this game is for you.I've been browsing and testing alot of free to play games on steam now for a year now and I've finally came across Wakfu. At first I thought ""O.K... now let see what this game has before i uninstall it and move on to the next game."" and holy sh!t guys. I've been hooked.Now this game isn't perfect, but no game is without it's flaws.Combat, when paired correctly with your LV, is tough. Very good challenge.There are no ""in-combat"" consumable items, so no potion chug'n. No NPC's you can sell your junk to, all currency is player based. Player to Player trading help build teams and connections.Almost every item is a crafting material, even your equipment. Meaning most of your items can be upgraded to better teirs of equipment. However you need the the crafting skill.You are not limited in crafting, so you can make everything in the game. Most game rules are controlled by the players, that sound a bit confusing but once you understand how the game works and it's politics. You can really do some crazy things. This world is digitally alive.If you're trying this game out for the first time. Play until LV.10 and decide if this is worth your time. And try multiple classes. Now I'll admit that this game is a grinder. There are times when I thought or said, ""F**K THIS SH!T, I'm sick of killing these damn chicken peacock things."" but still, it was so worth it when I collected all the items and made some sweet armor. Trust me the grind is worth it, and this game is worth your time. ""just with i had more time to play... (T_T) "

												I have over 100 hours sunk into this game so I feel that I can properly review this game, if you do not want to read the whole review then scroll to the bottom to see the pro's and con's, here we go.   Wakfu Is a turn based strategy anime MMO RPG (a mouth full I know) by Ankama. This game originated from France, something pretty rare to come from them, it also has a anime that is subbed and dubbed in English on Netflix. The gameplay is something new and unique to this style of game, it takes concentration and planing in battle, should you use up all the points to move in close and unleash a flurry of attack or stay back and chip away at you enemy is up to you and your class. This system makes PvP a real challenge, most classes can far well in PvP due to the way you can build your class, all classes have at least some ranged spells, even those up close types.   Oh boy the classes, one of the best things about this game next to the combat. There are 17 unique classes that all have there own style of play, some examples are the Cra, your run of the mill pew pew archers, they have accses to these things called beacons, which they can use 3 different elementle attacks on the beacon which will have different affects depending on the element (Air, Fire, Earth). Another good example is the Sram, this class is all about assassination, going invisable and closing the gap behind there prey, also they use giant scythes, whats not to love.   The community of this game is hit and miss, you will have some people that are nice and try to help you and some who spam you with guild invites because they just want more guild points. The big areas where people gather are hot spots for spam bots trying to get you to go buy accounts and that junk, just put those people on your ignore list, the starting area seems to have some pretty chill people but if you are new or do not like trash talkers DO NOT go to The Temple of Scriptures. The Temple mostly has high level people that challenge eachother to PvP at the base of the steps, after sitting there for an hour to listen in on people all they do is call eachother homophobic slurs and offensive names, unfortunately you will have to come here once a day for a quest and it is also the best place to do high level gear trading due to all the high level people hanging around there.   Are you one of those ""save the earth"" people? Well guess what, this game has its own eco-system that you, the player, have control over. Do you wanna make a jungle? Go right ahead. Wanna destroy another nations resorces and laugh as they can't craft anything? Well you can, you sadistic monster.    Ever wanted to be a baker, a chef, or even a talor, making cute dresses for your in game wifu? Welp get to grinding that job XP, or run for governer of a nation and have everyone look up to you as a god. Of corse if you don't want to rule a whole nation you can always run for Vice governer, or Head of the Guard, and even control the weather of the nation, if you are having a bad day, flood your lands with rain. PROS-  +Has unique gamplay   +Can run on most systems  +Has a plethora of classes   +Not pay to play at all   +Has its own in game eco-system   +Prices in store seem really far   +Has its own government   +Anime Wifus-------------------------------------------------CONS-  -Small player base  -Players can leave a sour tatse in your mouth  -Takes a lot of grinding   -Can be boring playing alone  -Have to redeem all DLC code through Ankam's website  -Graphics are nothing special  -Fixed cammera can make fighting very difficult  In the end, despite its flaws I really enjoy this game, and would highly recomend it to all my friends			"

												Wakfu is a tactical turn based rpg successor of the Ankama game named Dofus. The world is the same in both games, but the time and story have a huge leap, while you have almost all the same classes, the skills each one have is different in every one of them. But not different in sense that is only an upgrade, it's more about a different system without touching the gameplay itself, which is quite frankly almost the same. Like j-rpgs and korean rpgs, wakfu is a game where you gonna need to grind a lot in order to get strong, craft, obtain powerful gears. that could bother some players that wish to have more action. well in that case this game is not for you. Also it's a teamwork game, so party, groups, friends, guild is a must. Of course you can play solo, but you will need multiple accounts to fulfil your party.The wakfu art is very cartoony and charming, I really enjoy the draws since Dofus, the french guys really got nice artists. Heck they even did an animation with tons of episodes , it's interesting , cool and a great addition to the game story and vision on the world of the twelve.Unlike dofus in wakfu you don't have to be a subscriber in order to play, But obviously if u p2p you have advantages suck as + 30% exp and drop bonuses. Howeever the game isn't p2w so no worries about that, every player can have the same stuff that someone that paid have. Most of stuff are cosmetics or consumables.Altought is not all rainbows and sunshines, the game currently have a few bugs that has to be fixed. The devs are kind enought to give a compensation, but some stuff may still bother some players. Keep that in mind if you gonna play. See you in the world of the twelve !			"

												short version:think final fantasy tactics mixed with a bit of harvest moon (or....augh....farmville.....we dont have long wait times though) and a dash of borderlands comedy into a sandbox MMORPG.long version:1.its a turn based MMORPG (all capitals btw,because they REALLY focus on that),there is a good community,and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of classes to choose from,and they're pretty non tradisional,except some ofc.2.while not as hard as fire emblem,you might need to think of a plan sometimes,like if placing a trap on the floor to finish off an enemy while reseulting to friendly fire (did i mention friendly fire is on?yeah,have fun trolling),3.No friends or no one to join to help you fight?No problem,they have a sidekick system (although i prefer to call them minions)basicly they're like those characters in turn based RPGs that you can control,they start at level 1 when you get them,so dont be surprised if they have less health,although some have skills unique to them,which can be advantage,you mostly need to get to the cash shop for them,which i hate doing,it is pretty nice of them to give you a free minion (cant help calling them that) after a quest and a trial one every now and then4.there is a ecosystem....system built into the game,you can replant and harvest some crops/trees and animals(?),if the ecosystem reaches a certain threshold,you get a bonus.5.professions,there are alot of professions you can chose,mind you professions are different from classes,classes are MOSTLY combat base,while profession is can become a side income or help you in combat by either making food for buffs,close range weapons,AoE weapons (yes there are AoE weapons) or armor,or just a plain hobby,and these professions arent limited to crafting weapons,food or armor,they can also become a handyman or lumberjack or hell,a fisherman,most professions can help each other,so having other poeple in different professions help.and all those stuff you can get into in a matter of hours,hell i havent joined a guild or faction/nationpros and conspros:1.free to play2.an ACTUAL turn based MMORPG thats good3.ecosystem4.professions5.nation (joining certain nations will make you their enemies,which is a nice lore effect)6.active community7.secrets within the game,like a portal giving you a cape somewhere in the beginner area (hint:its at the lower right corner of the map,also when you get it,read the description)cons:1.with everyone F2P...there are always microtransactions....although its not as bad as others,its still there,they do give you a free sidekick and a mount via quests and 5 character slots....im looking at you realm of the mad god2.its a birds eye view game,and when you start at the beginner town,its pretty hard to get a grasp of whats what and whos who,like if this chocobo thing does anything or this statue have any fuctional purpose,or maybe if this board will lead me to the market3.speaking of grasping,they dont really teach you what is what and where,hell i had a friend tell me the minimap pops out via shift+m,and best thing is they dont tell you how to use the market or what it looks like4.since you have a ecosystem to run,you need to watch what you kill and what you harvest,make sure to replant EVERYTHING you kill just to be safe5.you REALLY need to read stuff,like badly,if you dont,you might not learn what to do or get the humor of it,its not as bad as dark souls lore being hidden in item descriptions though6.when you finish the tutorial,you're probably gonna exited to chose your class,the thing what i hate about choosing classes IN GAME (you can probably wiki them for better description) is they're vague,you might THINK that feca's shield is a tank but nope,its a (ranged) buffer and trapperoverall it takes a little learning and adjusting to the game,and if you can do that,you'll start having fun,plus it is a free to play game with optional cash shopmy review:8/10give it a gotakes a few hours of adjusting to the game thoalso read item descriptions,you wont regret it			"

												I really thought this game was really fun since ive also watched the Cartoon/Anime in Toonami(TM) and the graphics were great! I was playing tutorial i reached level two then it says on my quest list that i need to distribute my skill points but i cant/dont even know how or where to do it! The tutorial is so unclear! It's like its just bugged! I cant even press anything like Shift+T ! And it doesnt freaking work! And i woul recommend this game to others if it would work properly! And its always delayed! And idk how other people can paly it properly! But in mine it doesnt so fak that! I kinda hate it tho being excited about one game taking a lot of time to download but then suddenly its just a piece of crap? XD but the customer service isnt even responding! OK im done with this game but i am still going to ifnd out a freaking solution~!			"

												Wakfu is a turn based mmorpg with a cute anime-like style. The combat system is similar to final fantasy tactics and players are able to shape the the environment. But there are not a lot of quests that will tell you what to do and lead you the way, it's more of a sandbox game where you decide what to do and where to go.If you prefer quests from Lv. 1 to XXX this game will not appeal to you.Main Quests:When you create your character you will get your first quest chain until like Lv. 12-15.I think the next is around Lv. 35 to get your first mount.The next one is at Lv. 50Then there is another one around 90~100...As you can see, there is alot of spare time between those main quests. So, if you don't like to explore the world yourself, you will be stuck after each quest chain ends.Classes and SpellsThere are 16 classes to choose from, each once has its unique fighting style. These are no archetype classes you'd normally expect. Except like 3 classes which are similar to Warrior, Archer and Assassin. But you probably won't know which one is the warrior, if you see them, they are more like a mix of a Barbarian, a Warrior and an idiot (The game calls them stupid, not me I swear). There are also Faries, Bamboo-Milkoholics, Machosists, Robots, Human-Plants, Gambling Cats, old greedy Farts, Terrorists and a few more...But there is no higher class change at a higher level or something like that. You will be stronger when you level up your Class abilities and elemental spells.There are 4 Elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Air. All Spells in the game are categorized in one of them.Each class has access to 3 Elements, 5 spells for each Element.Each class also has 10 Class specific supportive abilities. 5 of them are active spells, the other 5 are passives.What are the elements for? Everything has Elemental Damage and Resistance. If you have a lot of Fire Damage, your fire spells will deal more damage, if the target you attack has a lot of fire resistance, you will deal less damage with your fire spells.Elemental damages can go over 100% to infinite. Elemental resistance has a maximum of 100%(which would block 100% damage of that element), but you cannot reach that. I have about 60% resistance at Lv. 105. So you can at least reach that :)For your first 20% resist in each element you will need 100 points in resist, which are 5 points for each % resist. After that it will slightly increase the amount needed for each % resist.LevelingThe best way to level up your character is probably by doing dungeon runs. You get a wisdom bonus in there, which increases exp gained. 20 Wisdom = 20% more exp after the fight. To enter a dungeon, you will need the corresponding key, which are usually not too hard to get. If you know what monsters are inside the dungeon, kill the same monsters outside of the dungeon, they will drop it sooner or later. You can also craft keys by using the items those monsters drop. Usually its 7x Item X.There are also daily quests in each zone of the world, which tells you bring 10 items of the monsters that are lurking around. If you collect 20, you don't need to hunt them tomorrow, just accept and finish the quest immediately. Those quests give you a decent amount of exp.I think in all zones except the first one in each nation are also timed events with a small variety of quests. There are either monsters appearing, or other random stuff you have to interact with before the time runs out. Those are highlighted in green if you see them while the event is ongoing. There is a new event every 10-15 minutes I think and the exp is also decent if it's around your level.There is a lot more to talk about this game but if I tried to explain every detail I know, I would need 2+ hours to write this review. I will try to end this with a short Pro and Con.PROS+ High Variety of Classes (16 Classes)+ 10+1 Crafting Professions (the extra profession can't be leveled. you can create in game money called Kama with it, if you have the materials)+ 6 Gathering Professions+ Battles get more challenging at later levels (monsters gain passives, you can't always ignore to win battles)+ You have your own home, which is a bag and is accesible from almost everywhere (You can put furnite in it, plant stuff and there is an item storage)+ A lot of costumes for customization. Also everything you wear, besides the belt, can be seen on your character, haven't seen that in many 2D games.+ If you don't have friends, you can have 2 Sidekicks fighting by your side.+ Shape the world, Kill monsters, replant them, cut trees and flowers and plant them where you want em, but be careful, in the open world everyone has access to this.CONS- Bugs, Glitches. The longer you play, the more you will find. Some are just minor bugs that don't matter much, others are killing you in battle. The worst battle bug I know is that you can't do anything for 1 round. I have that once in maybe 2 weeks. The friend I play with has it every 25-30 battles. I guess, it depends on your computer.- lack of guidelines- Most crafting professions don't feel satisfying to level (only a few things you can craft are better than hunting equip)- Some gathering professions are really slow and boring to level (Ex.: Trapper, most stuff you collect from monsters to level up will be thrown away to save item slots)I play and like this game because the combat is fun and challenging to me. In an even battle, every wrong step you take, might cost you or your party members life. The special effects are also pretty well done. If some bugs and glitches scare you away, you won't be playing for long. Give it a try if you like most of the things I have mentioned about Wakfu. If the bugs you find don't affect your gameplay experience too much, you will enjoy it.			"

												dont play this game, dont purchase anything made by this company. watch the ""anime"" if you want, but dont bother playing any of ankamas games, paticuarily this or dofus.game is trash, support is dead, community is mostly dead. from someone with thousands of off steam hours its doubtful the servers/community will ever recover. all of this a far cry from how populated and fun their games used to be years ago. however through horrible supports, un-needed updates and garbage balancing as well as constant anti-consumer decisions, ankama successfully bled out their own games. this movement to steam was likely their last chance to fix thingsbut they failed.

												Loved Dofus, played it since start of 2005 until about end of 2012 when i got tired of the new version and some decisions that made it bad atleast to me. This one was sopose to be new, better, the future, it turned out to be♥♥♥♥♥♥ From bad inventory space management that got solved later, to player economi that was bad from the first day. The 4 nation war was also not much since most people picked 1-2 nations rest were empty. The game wasnt any good compared to Dofus, that is its preducessor. When you make a new game, you try to make it better from the previous one, not make it worse. Whats most anoying to me other than bad inv space management is the damn Trapper and the need to have to level it and replant mobs so some **** can come and kill them all not caring about the negative points. They should just close the servers and move on, they screwed up dofus and they destroyed wakfu from the start. This company used to stand for something, be something, now they are just money hungry asses that try to push crap into the market.			"

												I was wondering a lot should I recommend this game or not. Well Wakfu has some bad sides, but the good ones are much more! Great atmoshere, innovative gameplay, world ruled by the players and ofc since they go to f2p - this is MUST try, or better MUST play game! Since i mentioned the bad sides of Wakfu - it's support! Yeah, great game and devs and support guys tries their best to ruin it. Each update are worse, they did the most insane thing - made great Prison Island and after few months - they remove it ?! WTF ?! Who does that ? You must fix and made better the content u made, Ankama, not to remove it! Other bad thing is - they advertise something good on the cash market - u bought that precious item, and after month or two they change it and U left with worthless piece of trash. The support: well common joke with Wakfu people is ""what support?"" :) So this is it, good game with few negatives ... but it's pretty addictive, so u can handle the bad sides :P Have fun!			"

												Sure, the hours I've put in for Wakfu on Steam so far have been measly, but I've been playing Ankama's games ever since Dofus came out back in 2005. Any avid Wakfu player should know that Dofus is the game that started it all.But I digress. Wakfu is definitely worth your time if you love RPGs. If you don't, well, now's the time to start loving them. Beautiful, artistic, modern graphics combined with addicting gameplay, old school turn-based action, and funny NPCs make Wakfu a blast from the past as well as a next-gen RPG. So go ahead, give it a try, and if you don't like it then you can go back to CS:GO and/or TF2 and leave the rest of us alone.			"

												Although I have been play the game for 2 weeks, but got deeply attracted by its outstanding contents.The “Wakfu” here is not the fantastic French Cartoon, but a MMOSLG game. The game offers many distinctive classes/characters which have 3 different elementals each. People in the game, will never repeat killing stuffs, but also plant something, including mobs. The diverse crafting system will satisfy the most needs of your gears, furniture, keys (for entering dungeons) etc. Different pets/sidekicks offer different passive buffs to enhance your char/team.   Although you can solo most dungeons with your sidekicks, you will still need a community to share the thought about the game. I had joined a friendly guild in Asia server which is called Sacred Feathers. They offer me a really professional suggestion which saved a lot of time/money for me.  I think most ppl in that guild are Chinese but they really friendly, the guys called Mathers and Izayoisakura really helped me a lot, one is providing useful suggestions, another offers power levelling. Its only 2 weeks and I’ve almost hit lvl 60. Awesome!  "

												Great fun game that feels a bit like an anime. Tactical and clever, this game will make you think as you roam the lands. Easy to pick up and simple combat, as it is a tactics based game, this is a great free-to-play game that you can get pulled into. The races double as the class, but this is minor compared to how much thought went into making it all look great. Popular refences to major movies and cartoons can be found, as well as a well thought out crafting/harvesting system that few has ever tried. All and all this is one to get, if only to have something different yet fun.			"

												I recommend this game to anyone who is a casual gamer as the game has many perks to it.You can level up by fighting monster to become the strongest out there! Some players out there maybe dont like fighting monsters and leveling up thats fine in this game as you can do things like farming,mining,woodcutting,weapon making,making armour and many other things for those not really into combat.I really enjoyed this game as its combat system is fairly easy to get the hang of and the guilds you can join have some nice people who will help you along the way!If you haven tried this i suggest you do as it is a fun game to play.

												If you're a fan of Final Fantasy Tactics, and like playing MMORPG games, then this game is for you. Unlike your typical mmorpg game in were half of the time you just need to click on an enemy and watch your character smack it to death, this game actually requires you to use your brain. Its a turn based mmorpg style game in were every (well...not everytime i would say) combat actually requires you to have a strategy as you can't just randomly do stuff and expect it to go your way. It also has a very nice cartoonish/anime-ish type of art style which will remind you (atleast for me though) of the old 2D games that you used to play back in the glory days before 3D games started ruling over the game industry. Did I mention its also F2P? :D Sure, the game has some few bad points, but if you're a fan of turn-based type games and like playing mmorpg games as well, then this, my friend, is the game for you.

												Wakfu is a really fun game, its just a lot of the servers are really underpopulated which makes the game start to get boring very late coming from someone who has PLENTY of hours in the game i would recommend it to anybody sure sometimes the community is awful make somebody mad and ur on a kill on sight everywhere you go by everyone (woops) I have reatched max level which has probably changed to 170 the pvp in my opinion is horrible due to the fact that you can be as low as a lvl 40 with ur PVP TURNED OFF and get attacked in your home nation by someone whos like lvl 150 and just mad at said nation if you were to pick a server DO NOT PICK NOX i know almost everybody in nox due to its massivly underpopulation..what you dont belive me check my wakfu government achievements but the overall concept of the game is fun its very original in turns of game style turnbased mmorpg with not a single agressive monster but yes the grinding gets a bit tedious at higher levels after 120 its just obnoxious depending on your class because some people dont party with certain classes. I recommend this game to anybody who wants to play something new but remeber this always know your place.			"

												A very beautiful and unique take on MMOs. The strategic turn based combat is very well done, the monsters, skills and spells look good and its a world I keep going back to. Like any MMO, it will take you some time to level, but the game gives you a companion that makes levelling a lot quicker than it otherwise would be. Im more than happy with the pace of levelling and you get a level every couple minutes if you are in level appropriate areas.The only thing that frustrates me is that the game has recently been updated to be a lot better and more friendly to players, but the player wikis have not been updated to reflect this. Mob levels have changed, some locations have been moved about, and I have found myself directed to places that no longer have the item i require once or twice. But the exploration aspect is a very big plus.Overall, an amazing game. Like it so far (180+ hours as I write this) and will udpate if my feelings change			"

												TL;DR- Great Tactics/MMO game. You should give this amazing, under-rated game a shot. Wakfu is an amazing game that doesn't get enough credit. It has been (mostly) improved by the most resent major update. (9/9/2014) The art and animations in this game are beautiful, the music isn't bad, and the new revamped level up system makes the game much more accessible, and actually give you a feeling of progression over the old stat system. If you like Tactic games and MMOs I don't see how you would not enjoy this game. There are two free and effortless character respecs. The first is given at level 30, when you have all of the skills unlocked and plenty of time to try them all out, and another at 80, when you have a much better understanding of the game. Aside from the two respecs given you can do a quest to respec, or buy a respec from the cash shop, to save time.There are many classes to choose from, and they are all very different from each other. You have the more basic classes, such as the Iop, who is just a front line warroir. Then you have the much more complex classes like Xelor, whos spells have alternating effects every turn. On top of that each class can be played multiple ways. No matter what class you are looking for Wakfu will have a character for you. The new starter zone/quests are mostly enjoyable. The starter quests explain a bit more, and reward with more items that you weren't introduced to at all before, such as; Weapons/Armor, Haven Bag Decorations, Shop Stalls. Inventory Bags, and a Pet. HOWEVER. The quests themselves are ... not very fun. Its not that they are bad, or poorly done, but they do not fit into this game. A sliding block puzzle is great, but not in a turn based tactics game. The other quest that doesn't fit uses silly context to teach you the mechanics to a (boss?) fight that you have to do right after... It would have been much more enjoyable to just FIGHT something. There is a daily quest NPC on every map that is simply collect X from Y and bring them to me. Much less annoying. Although nothing original there, if you are fighting the monsters to level anyway, it is a welcome bonus to exp. I have not tried the new ""Mercenary"" quests, so I cant give a review on those. Dungeons are fun (I enjoy them at least) and there is no lack of them. The new token system means you wont run a dungeon 20 times and still not get the drop you were looking for. On top of this, any item from the token machines is account bound, so you can't flood the market with items you got from boss tokens. At the start of the game Dungeons and boss fights are simple and straightforward, the further you get into the game the more challenging and complex dungeons become. PVP has had more content added in the recent update, bringing PVP gear and rewards. Much more active PVP with the nation vs nation, and limited alliances between nations. If you do not have PVP turned on the only way someone can attack you is through the PK system, witch was already in the game. The level range to attack other players with PVP turned on is much too high right now, at 50 levels apart. I have high hopes that they will lower this range to 20, at the most. I believe for that to happen we would have to see a population increase. The Ecosystem ... system, is both fun, and frustrating. On any given map there are values of monsters and resources that should be on the map, within your nations you gain points by putting said resources within these ranges. While the ecosystem is in balance, you will also enjoy a buff on that map. The Riktus clan gains bonuses by destroying this balance, so this also fuels PVP. The frustrating aspect of this is that little to no players seem to care about the ecosystems, the problem with that is that monster populations are a part of these. I have gone to maps with monsters nearly extinct because no one is repopulating them. An easy process through gathering from said monsters, and simply using the gathered material on an empty cell on the map. I believe the reason behind this is no one really want to level the professions used to manage these things. As much as I would love to see a population increase I fear it will bring mass extinctions to the beginning areas of the game, so please, at least repopulate the monsters.			"

												Alright before anyone complains about my time, I played this during its closed beta period and I have the costume and title to prove that.Now:wakfu is pretty interesting for a mmo as it takes turn based strategy to the next level by making you have to think ahead to compete with others.For Example: I play a xelor, which is one of the least player friendly classes you can play. To use this class properly you have to understand how to use the dial ability that comes with the race/class. Proper use of it will lead to either your victory or imminent downfall.Now for those of you who are free to play gamers: Fair warning, I'm not sure if this game still uses its membership policy or not for minting kamas and using your factions land. So if it does, you are only really going to be able to affect the eco-system of the starter region, everywhere else you will need membership to modify. If it does not do that anymore than thank god and good riddens. Now go out there and train your skills..... And thats all I got for this review...			"

												I hate MMO's, mostly because of grind, and this game is grind city, I tell you. The Wakfu universe and the artstyle is utterly awesome and the only things that gives WAKFU an edge over other games in it's genre. The only reason I give this a positivie review is that, even though I think MMO's are not fun, I can see why people would like it, and that I love Ankama for giving me the Wakfu and Dofus TV series.God, Eva is so ♥♥♥♥ing hot.I have no shame.

												A fun MMO that has a different playstyle than any other MMOs I have played. Turn based, although it is quite grindy. Crafting is useful though be prepared to also grind for materials, and have professions require mats from different professions. There is government and PvP for those that like that.Interesting storyline and there are quests to be had. I've played since its beta and it has come a long way, mostly for the better I feel. Cash shop has mostly cosmetic purchases, and while free to play there are benefits for being a subscriber/premium member. A nice time sink for those MMO fans out there that want a different feel to the usual.			"

												  Wakfu is a game where you try to preserve the appropriate animal population by extracting the seed of monsters and planting them in the ground to grow new monsters. Unless there are too many of them, then you must purge the disgusting sheep and bird creatures that fornicate right out in the open and overpopulate.    Pretty good game.			"

												To be honest i was a bit sceptical with this game since it was by the same producer that made dofus. I mean i really liked dofus but the pay2play subcription was a real downside. But turns out wakfu is huge improvemen of dofus and best of all it is completely no subscription to be able to enjoy the whole game content.8/10I would recommend playing this game if you like turn based combat. Alone or if you have a friend to play with that would be much more fun from low lvl up to high lvl.Pro:+ Player driven economy+ 4 nations with players controlling them/governing them with rules chosen by the ""leader"" of the each nation.+ Can start war to control more lands for your nation or become allies to control more lands together+ All class skills are available once you have reached past lvl 10 and they have their one lvl depending on how much you use it in combat, no more lvl up for one skill every 10-20 lvls + Turn based strategy combat <- I LOVE STRATEGY <3Cons:- No Trade NPC to sell junk item to so you can get easy kamas(games currency).- Rather hard to find party at low lvl since you get your own sidekick and lvl up rather fast alone.Currently i'm around lvl 20 so don't have much experience of this game but i have played dofus and reached lvl 40 or so. The similarity are almost identical but with new changes.			"

												Picked it up in closed beta, got disappointed due to the P2P restrictions that Ankama (finally) lifted for a better microtransaction model. Nothing blatantly overpowered in the cash shop, and all content is finally open.Very solid game - a bit lacking in direction and story, but if you like your turn-based RPGs you will love Wakfu's combat. There is a large grind, so beware! I also like the dynamic nature of the game world and the fact there is no loot rolling (nodes still are public and contestable, though the game's ""ecosystem"" feature takes care of that most of the time).Well worth a try for anyone looking for a refreshing MMO or turn-based RPG experience.

												You've already played this game twice. The first time was when the game was still under Squarenix's publication (They later relinquished it due to Ankama's lack of management). You left it once the game left beta and it created one mistake after the next. The second was when everyone flocked to the SEA servers which were free to play, unlike the American one's monthly fee for a laggy java game. You quit a second time after you calculated it would take you months of clicking on rocks to get your mining level to where you want it to be.Now you want to try it again. Oh, maybe it will be better. Maybe it will be more fun. While you're betting on that, Ankama is betting on you falling into the same trap for the third time. Just go watch the anime if you want your French hips so badly.			"

												Like it's older brother Dofus, Wakfu is a lot of fun to play, with the advantage of perhaps being even better, and free. Turn based combat is well executed, and the universe of the game is compelling. However, while the idea of an in-game ecosystem to maintain is brilliant, the way it is actually implanted is rather disappointing, it never really feels like your actions have a true impact. Still, it's a solid turn-based RPG, and that's rare enough to be applauded!			"

												This game is great!I played this game in the early beta before it went p2p and quit a long time after that. I started playing again when it wend f2p and now I use steam to play it. The game is much like it's predecessor Dofus. A turn based tactical mmo. But unlike Dofus you can change the world around U in real-time. Kill a lot of monsters and they get extinct cut down a lot of trees and there gone. And you can of course plant trees to let them regrow and you can even plant monsters so they come back.There is a lot of crafting in this game and you can do them all! I advise you to at-least take up backing and farming because bread is the most used way of healing after a fight. You can wait to heal, and that's OK when you are low lvl. But after a while when you get to a point where you have a lot of HP it will take to long to just wait to heal. There is a recent revamp of the game that changed the lvling up system. I think it did this in a good way and allows for more unique builds. They also did a revamp on the in game sets. You used to get a bonus from having a X amount of set items. These bonuses are now on the items themselves and the dmg type a set have is now randomly generated. I understand why they did this. So you can have any item you want and not be forced to use a complete set just to get that +1AP. But I Prefer the old system. That update has broken the economy a bit to. Items sell for a lot less now and its a lot harder to earn a decent amount of in game currency (kamas). But I hope that this is just now and will recover in a while. I think its best to join a active guild because this game really has a nice community. And its best to play with others. Best thing about the turn based system is that you have time to chat in fights with your team and discuses tactics our just have a good chat.  All in all its a great game and recommend it to everyone to try. It has a nice player-base, looks great, easy to run on almost any machine and although you can go P2P and never feels you have to, F2P gives you just as much to do in the game.			"

												Turn based Strategy? Not accurate. Turn based TACTICS, more so. With 15 (Completely) UNIQUE classes, and a minimum of THREE different ways to build offensively per class. The graphics are childish and anime styled, but the humor is not. You will be met by crass jokes when you read most of the gear you find, and characters too! The game is designed for laid back party-based fun, but it is still possible play alone! On top of that, the entire game has 5 'factions' which are OPERATED BY PLAYERS. Also, the eco-system CAN go bankrupt, but thanks to a great community, it never does! For those of you with more than enough spare time, feel free to join!			"

												Very fun game and lots to do. One thing to check when ever buying steam DLC packs, double check all the items and benefits you gain, they packs do change from time to time and often what is posted on one section in a dlc pack isn't whats actually in it. Has caused problems in the past. Otherwise, a fun game with much to do.			"

Don't get me wrong, the story is pretty great, it's just a bit hard to find. Anyways, the combat system is great AND Fair. Ankama did a great job making the game and representing the ""unique"" styles of the show (which is also amazing). Overall great game, but a few bugs here and there.			"

												I was wondering a lot should I recommend this game or not. Well Wakfu has some bad sides, but the good ones are much more! Great atmoshere, innovative gameplay, world ruled by the players and ofc since they go to f2p - this is MUST try, or better MUST play game! Since i mentioned the bad sides of Wakfu - it's support! Yeah, great game and devs and support guys tries their best to ruin it. Each update are worse, they did the most insane thing - made great Prison Island and after few months - they remove it ?! WTF ?! Who does that ? You must fix and made better the content u made, Ankama, not to remove it! Other bad thing is - they advertise something good on the cash market - u bought that precious item, and after month or two they change it and U left with worthless piece of trash. The support: well common joke with Wakfu people is ""what support?"" :) So this is it, good game with few negatives ... but it's pretty addictive, so u can handle the bad sides :P Have fun!			"

												Sure, the hours I've put in for Wakfu on Steam so far have been measly, but I've been playing Ankama's games ever since Dofus came out back in 2005. Any avid Wakfu player should know that Dofus is the game that started it all.But I digress. Wakfu is definitely worth your time if you love RPGs. If you don't, well, now's the time to start loving them. Beautiful, artistic, modern graphics combined with addicting gameplay, old school turn-based action, and funny NPCs make Wakfu a blast from the past as well as a next-gen RPG. So go ahead, give it a try, and if you don't like it then you can go back to CS:GO and/or TF2 and leave the rest of us alone.			"

												Now that Steam has fixed its issues with Achievements, I'm enjoying seeing what I didn't realise I never knew about Wakfu. I started with Dofus, and gradually made my transition to Steam where I discovered more resources and a larger fanbase of my favourite games.Wakfu, like its predecessor, is a player-controlled environment where the ecology and economy of the world are entirely dependent on the users. While that seems simple enough, the game goes slightly further, allowing players to be elected as the governing rulers of an entire area of the map, dictating how money should be spent, and how the environment should thrive. The downfall to the above is that 100% of your item profits are from users. There are no NPCs to whom you can sell or trade items from your inventory.With a large collection of classes, Wakfu (and Dofus) has ensured the general availability of most preferred character archetypes, and has done extensive work keeping all the classes fairly well balanced. The tutorial is only generally comprehensive, so it's strongly suggested that trying a new class is done in the Incarnum world where everything is easy enough to not concern oneself with the dangers of durress. I personally prefer playing support roles, and have found that the highly acclaimed Eniripsa is fun, but the Eca and Xelor make healing very different, and definitely a lot more worthwhile in the aspect of overcoming challenges.Leveling is tedious, and the quests aren't very well thought out, so once you're finished with Astrub, prepare to grind. The maximum level takes a while to reach, especially since it's primarily done by grinding the entire way after LV20. Max level is 170 at the time of this writing, so there's a bit of perspective. The dungeons are awesome! when you can get friends to tag along, especially if you're following the difficult to locate storyline. I've read the manga and watched the anime, so seeing the dungeons and being part of the story is definitely a great deal of entertainment for me.If you're having a tough time getting through an area or quest, and haven't made friends on your server yet, no problem; Sidekicks are available in the market for Ogrin. If you're from Dofus, you know Ogrin can be purchased with Kama (in-game money), and thus is possible to acquire at no cost (for those who prefer not to pay). As a long-time subscriber, I highly recommend you give Steam's monthly options a try. I'm used to getting a pet or piece of gear with my Ogrine each month, but Steam goes a step further including more items that are only available through the now gaming giant.My final, most important factor to playing Wakfu is this: It's adorable! I love cute, and Ankama has done a great job at giving exactly that to me. Have fun, everyone, and feel free to join me on Nox or Remington. Just let me know you're coming.			"

												Only played for 7 hours, and didn't get far in the game. Just one character at lvl 14.I liked this game and still plan on playing it. It's pretty fun, and I don't even like anime MMOs to be honest. The choices and strategy is what caught my eye, and it's easy. So that's a bonus.Kind of annoying that you absolutely need to do the tutorial every single time you make a new character, because if you don't, you do not get skill points and the level you were in the tutorial map. If you decide to skip the tutorial, it puts you into the online world with no skill points to spend, and you're level 1, and all the ""low level"" creatures are level 5 or higher.So skipping the tutorial is an absolutely stupid idea, and a waste of time. Because it traps you in the house and will not let you leave. So you have to delete that character and do the tutorial. It shouldn't let you skip it if it just traps you inside of a house and never lets you decide if you want to go back and do the tutorial or actually leave the house. You're just stuck there until you decide to redo everything. Which is the most pointless option they give you. Long story short, DON'T SKIP THE TUTORIAL. It's an absolute waste of time and your character will be useless afterwards.Also the compass sometimes does not track my missions. It will for a short time, then it vanishes without explination. I'm talking about the above ground quests, not the quests underground. It get's really irritating having to keep pulling up the stupid quest thing and  click the compass ""Follow"" button every single time. I'm still trying to figure out how I sell my garbage items to get money. Where is the NPC that just buys all your crap items? Or do I have to drop everything on the ground. Some things aren't explained in the game, and you have to figure it out for yourself most of the time.			"

												To be honest i was a bit sceptical with this game since it was by the same producer that made dofus. I mean i really liked dofus but the pay2play subcription was a real downside. But turns out wakfu is huge improvemen of dofus and best of all it is completely no subscription to be able to enjoy the whole game content.8/10I would recommend playing this game if you like turn based combat. Alone or if you have a friend to play with that would be much more fun from low lvl up to high lvl.Pro:+ Player driven economy+ 4 nations with players controlling them/governing them with rules chosen by the ""leader"" of the each nation.+ Can start war to control more lands for your nation or become allies to control more lands together+ All class skills are available once you have reached past lvl 10 and they have their one lvl depending on how much you use it in combat, no more lvl up for one skill every 10-20 lvls + Turn based strategy combat <- I LOVE STRATEGY <3Cons:- No Trade NPC to sell junk item to so you can get easy kamas(games currency).- Rather hard to find party at low lvl since you get your own sidekick and lvl up rather fast alone.Currently i'm around lvl 20 so don't have much experience of this game but i have played dofus and reached lvl 40 or so. The similarity are almost identical but with new changes.			"

The only reason I give this a positivie review is that, even though I think MMO's are not fun, I can see why people would like it, and that I love Ankama for giving me the Wakfu and Dofus TV series.God, Eva is so ♥♥♥♥ing hot.I have no shame.

If you like strategy, turn based fighting, alot of variation in how to build your hero, skills, items,spell configuration and so on, well you will love this game.- Graphic 9/10   At some angles in fights, it feels like the view is blocked by a building, object in somekind of wrong way, other than that, VERY NICE.- Overall feeling 10/10- Music 10/10- Gameplay 10/10- Questing 9/10  = needs more quests, - Community 8/10 = reason why not more = there are some heros that just stand and spawn ""buy gold from store"" messages and GM`S not directly bannig those IP´s are unfair against everyone enjoying game.Now, why I don´t give even lower score = theres not alot of them and you can put them to your ignore list and that goes for their whole account and not just character.- SUpport 7/10 ,  Outside game = great INside game ? hmm, haven´t really noticed if there is any and WHY ARE THEY NOT REACTING TO SPAM HEROES?- All else in game = 10/10 and theres alot alot alot alot , to write about, so I rather play and waste time with writing of all that works.Just go into game, put like 20 hours and after that, seriasly  your eather stuck for life or it´s not for you. I mean life,   ones you plaid Wakfu or Dofus, you will always return to it even if you get bored sometimes. Also, don´t miss the WAKFU ANIME Serias  :D "

												The interface doesn't scale with higher resolutions, meaning it's way too tiny. Doesn't really matter though, cause it doesn't do much to inform you of anything. In other MMOs, the lack of information wouldn't be a problem. However, Wakfu includes quite a few puzzles and tasks that have nothing to do with the combat (and that every class must attempt). Most of the time reason saw me through the puzzles, while other times I found myself performing a task over and over, trying to figure out the exact order of things to accomplish. It was annoying and frustrating, considering the main draw for me is the combat.The combat is highly tactical, yet poorly explained. By the time you start to figure things out you will've already committed your character to a path you may not like. Several abilities are only usable on party members, but not all the abilities make it clear how they should be used. Worse still, the balance in several areas is extremely odd and non-conducive to experimentation unless you are in a group. This is not an MMO you can really play in single player, and that for me is a deal breaker. With so many good free to play games available, in addition to the good multiplayer games always going on sale, I can't recommend Wakfu unless you have lots of free time and like the style.			"

												Do you like to be unable to complete the tutorial? Do you like not being able to do any quests? Do you like not being able to interact with NPC's? Do you like a game that contains so many bugs that all you can do is rage? Then look no further! I am amazed that the players here state they love this game, it plays so well, and its so much fun. I wanted to like this game - but if the first 30 mins is me running around Incarnum with nothing happening, then killing myself, spawning in the starting zone with ZERO NPC's able to be interactable and no guidence on where to go or what to do - then naturally you are going to rage. Wakfu - fix your game.			"

												This game might be good. who knows. SOO broken. first quest says collect these seeds then plant them.  fine i think. I collect the seeds. you cannot plant them this area is too full. only way to plant them is to clear space by killing stuff. but wait. you cannot kill anything until after you plant them. so you have to wait for ages til i dont know what changes. next quest. collect 3 more seeds. im on 7 seeds atm but quest tracker wont count any of them.  dont waste your time on this garbage til they fix it.  duno why they release a game when the first 2 quests are completely unplayable.. great first impression.

												The game is fairly good, people bypass its incomplete state because of the genre (?) and the chance to meet new people (social game), regardless of which, there are a few problems, such as the tutorial phase, it can reach up to 30 minutes to figure out what to do if you're a new player, PKing happens fairly easy, saw higher levels killing lower levels regurarly, reason? None I think. The game is built in a beautiful way, definately, but major parts of it are broken, I'd suggest to play it first to convince yourselves. I wouldn't recommend this game for everyone, mainly I wouldn't recommend it for its current state, it can become annoying after a while. Peace!			"

												WAKFU is an interesting type of mmo, a grid based stratagy rpg. It's easily one of the top games of its genre and should be looked at. Just making a North America/ Canada server, from just the French server, the game its opening up.  Using the manga/anime tv series WAKFU, you embark on the story line journey of the World of 12 to climb and defeat Ogrest (an ogre) who pretty much messed up the world and is on this Mount Zinit. Now like most RPG games you choose a class. Here there are 15 (?) very diffrent style, culture, playing styles for the game. Foggernaut, Cra, Scram, Xelor, Huppermage, Elcaflip, Eniripsa, Sacrier, Elitrope, Rogue, Feca, Enutruf, Pandawa, Masqueraider, Sadida, Iop and Osamodas. Now the names are crazy, but everyone brings something new and diffrent to the table. Each class has specific elemental abilities witch is the base of the game. ELEMENTS. Bad guys have strength and weaknesses to the elements and so do you. Each area and boss and creatures all changes by the elements and what is happening in the game....So keep on ur toes. You and can change the elemental happenings by doing certain things in the ecosystem to help, or take advantage of, or find that the one boss will eat you cause fire does nothing to him at this moment. You can even change baddies to extinct or help them out along with your gathering items. Controlling the ecosystem and elements. Thats alot of power... Along with a class you take on a nation to help you politic, merchant, protect and help along against the Ogrest bad guy. Brakmar, Sufokia, Bonta and Amakna. Politics is very real with the economy and both are in according to your nation. Perks for your nation add to your crafting skills. Crafting in this game you can take them all. No choosing. Take on gathering skills to obtain items to craft, to up craftingskills . Its the usual RPG gameplay here, but its ALL available to you. There is mining, lumberjack, farming, tamming for cooking, armorsmith, close and distance weaponary, handyman, and just all sorts to do. Use these gathering skills and crafting to make your character better while you follow the story line through the World of 12. NOW, the aspect of the game is that it is grid, turn based, stratagy combat. No mobs or running to and frow baddies. You click, challange a group and go into tactical combat. You lose- you go back to a Pheonix save point. ( its not that bad)  Win and gain loot equipment and exp. ALL THE RPG GOODNESS. Equipment, level elemental spells and characteristics to be the best. The usual. Combat can be casual to slow to OMFG, I made a wrong move and the boss destroys you and your group. Remember it is turn based and planning and thinking is required...It's not a faceroll keyboard or click shoot till you hit the baddies.YES ! groups are made and incrouraged in this game like most MMO's. You also can have a sidekick to help you out. Sidekicks are leveld and geard by you and are earned through quests, missions, acheivments and such. Everyone starts off with the Astrub Knight. Hes a neat soldier, with a lance and melee, chopchops for you. Pets and mounts are also in game for fun and helping.  Custamize and collect pets, mounts and sidekicks to your liking or play style.So what class will you make? will you get to the top of Mount Zinit? and master your characters abilities for grid based stratagy combat!. It does have humor, the story line is pleasing with good music and voice acting. Its more fun then chess and checkers and its casual . The graphics and baddies can be a bit on the kid side, due to it being a kids ''cartoon''. The first dugeon bosses are a Cat, Larva, Chicken and Sheep. So yeah no ghoulies or anything to make your kids wimper. Also there is a problem that steam acheivments have not and seem not to be fixed yet for the game and the game of as now, is kinda low in number and population. BUMMER.			"

												Game not for everyone but if you like tactics and turd based combat than this is the place. Beautiful art style and music are just part of this MMO, no quests to hold your hand, just go out there explore and advance, make some friends and do dungeons together or if you prefer solo(like in single player) just add sidekick to fight by your side. Its a proper f2p, store made of cosmetics, exp boosters and sidekicks, nothing really limits you from playing.  Being VIP gives slight boost which is reasonable and you probably should get it if you enjoy the game and want things to go faster :)			"

												Wakfu is a turn based MMORPG with a crafting system, political system and ecological system. There are multiple classes to choose from, all unique, no archetypes are used, and combat is interesting, if not engaging. Party members can make or break certain dungeons and the learning curve is certainly high, but once you hit your stride, the game opens up tremendously. There are also several gathering and professions you can learn/master all of which can factor in your early game. All the content is well thought of until you hit level 120-120 and then it all becomes irrelevant. The game has no endgame goals, PVP is pointless, token and nonexistent. The ""government system"" doesn't actually impact your game in any way and ecological features do not factor in the endgame content. Wakfu is a semi-meaningful 70 hours followed by nothing. If you like spending time by yourself crafting, farming and turn based combat, I recommend either getting Xcom2, Stardew Valley or Rune Factory on DS. Now, let me get to the bad stuff. The cash shop does not work. READ: Does not work. It isn't 100% reliable, which is pretty pathetic as far as F2P games go. Payment options are extremely limited cash shop or otherwise and there doesn't seem to be any change in the system. If you're looking for a more robust MMO experience, hit up Terra online, Tree of Savior, or even Ragnarok. Let this game die in peace.			"

												It was a great mmo with partial skill based leveling, full player generated economic system (the only way money appear in a game is being crafted by players), simulated ecosystem (climate, monsters and resourced depend on players behavior) and friendly adventure atmosphere, little buggy and class imbalanced, but tottaly playable.So it was two years ago. Steam says it was released  18 sep, 2014, which is not quiete true. According to wikipedia it was released 29 feb, 2012. Now servers populations is low on all the shards, and almost every start location is empty. The thing is, this game is not supposed to play in an empty world. So Steam is kinda tricky saying it had just released.But it's free and enjoyable without donate on low levels, so you should check it.			"

												It was a great mmo with partial skill based leveling, full player generated economic system (the only way money appear in a game is being crafted by players), simulated ecosystem (climate, monsters and resourced depend on players behavior) and friendly adventure atmosphere, little buggy and class imbalanced, but tottaly playable.So it was two years ago. Steam says it was released  18 sep, 2014, which is not quiete true. According to wikipedia it was released 29 feb, 2012. Now servers populations is low on all the shards, and almost every start location is empty. The thing is, this game is not supposed to play in an empty world. So Steam is kinda tricky saying it had just released.But it's free and enjoyable without donate on low levels, so you should check it.			"

												If you like turn based games, you might like this one too. For me honestly it was an acquired taste, cause I felt that the combat was boring at the start, and the missions too. So at the start of the game, I was already discouraged from playing more, but then I decided to play a bit more, to actually get somewhere in the game, I put a little more effort in and then some more and more, and gradually I felt that the game was becoming pretty fun. I have a level 25-ish character now, there are tons of dungeons, some quests here and there, and a craft system that DOES NOT limit you to only 2 ♥♥♥♥ing proffessions(as many as you want to have, instead). I also really love the idea that the entire ecosystem is the entire playerbases responsibility. They do a pretty decent job keeping it all going. If they decide, ""I HATE THESE GOBBALS!!!"" They can decide to kill all of them and extinct the species. There are 4 nations and they all have their own set of laws, and they are either enemies or allies of each-other. The laws are pretty cool, cause  if the governor chooses to  declare an endanged species as ""ILLEGAL TO INTERACT WITH"", you can disobey them and become a criminal to your own nation lmao.There's alot to this game and it is fairly unique, give it a go, and put a little bit more effort in too, this is a slower paced game.7/10  Awesome community, unique game			"

It's one of those pick your battles instances I guess.Anyway! It's rather fun, the economy being entirely player based means theres no way to sell off your junk to an npc (last time I played anyway).			"

												Keep trying to fall in love with this game.Light TBS is so my style. Nothing too heavy unless youre really looking to kick♥♥♥♥♥br>Its a grid based affair with elemental attacks, positioning, leveling abilities and a diverse class syste that encourages messing around. There's mecahnisms to respec for free and starting a new journey is always fun as each class has its own fighting style on the grid.Mechanics lend themselves towards the application and development of your own skills, little quests and a vibrant crafting economy.The choice in armour and gear is broad enough, and being part of a Guild can put you into a living community.Unless you choose your class to be money printer, where what you do is literally cause inflation. YOUR WHOLE JOB IS TO PRINT MORE MONEY, WHICH INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A CLOSED SYSTEM. THE ECONOMY IS ♥♥♥♥ED UP. THE SYSTEM CRASHES IF NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE PRINTING MONEY AND CRASHES AGAIN IF TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE, AS THE ONLY WAY TO DELETE MONEY IS TO HAVE IT POURED INTO A GUILD BASE FOT ITS UPGRADES.Also everything is adorable. Super adorable. So yeah. A Turn BAsed MMO with a lot of choice and quite a few little adventures to be had as you refine your strategies and travel with new freinds to kick♥♥♥♥♥and collect loot.			"

												NOTE: Steam DLC for this game doesn't go towards cards/boosters at all.That being said, you'll get more bang for your buck if there's a sale on them if you're a core player.In game shop isn't availble in tutorial.+ point for making it super easy to log in with steam- point for the gamer sin of locking a hero behind a paywall. A very high paywall.- steam sales =/= in game store sales on top of which there are sales on stuff in store. If you run the same game, why can't you package the steam bundles INTO your in game store the same as having sales on steam? Advertising trading cards that buying FROM the steam store don't go towards smack of free publicity without the payoff. In fact, a simple search on google reveals you tinkered with the in game/out game currency price to cash in on the new market on steam. The older players, who now can link into steam and may be interested in the card feature, won't exactly like the sales and booster unlock being on two seperate paths. In fact, it's almost a slap in the face of anyone interested in your trading cards, as you're effectively saying: ""buy stuff on sale and unlock all this in game optional frill bonus content, or unlock the booster pack for the cards and just buy some exp boosters, which is almost begged for by rhe see through costume, 2,500 in game currency I might add, that just lets you stay the same way you looked without your silly bunny hat equipment...I'm happy you can pay to make some armor sets look like others just with the same stats as the other one, but I've never quite heard of a game that charges you to look naked, it's neat, I'll get it that, but for the price????????????!??????????????The paywalled character isn't game breaking; the in game shop is lacking in my opinion, except the boosts/subscription(exp boost/item drop/curency boost)/sidekicks, the costumes are kinda...limited. In spite of the franchise, the low costume count and their contents are just asian mmo style lazy, with the only one that really glows being a spikey samurai affair that we're all so familiar with, and hell, it only comes in one color mix of blue/teal/black. *I'm just getting into the series so this may be wrong *trying to avoid all this I simply bought a farmer costume, but my only options were pirate/drag queen as the rest is clearly geared towards ladies, muskateer, golden helmet = justice league/superhero (eh), dastardly black caped guy, mohawk S&M and that was about it. Whereas the female costumes had more variety and unless you count the super saiyan zodiac glow gear, generally better but not by much.All of which is really kinda spendy. I can only hope the money goes towards animation costs as well as server maintainence, because aside from sale prices on steam, I can't see someone except a die hard fan of doofus/wakfu or the cartoon wanting to spend these high prices, except for the exp boosts, to reward the creators and devs, and good for them, but it really feels more like a friendly mugging then a reward.28$ will get you 13,000 in game shop currency.3x30 exp days (90), which start the second you buy them, costs 8,100 in game shop currency.As far as sub prices go, especially an optional one, that's pretty good, but with every other item ranging 2000-3500 in game shop currency, to emotes, of all things, costing 900(effectively 2.5 dollars a pop) in game currency and there's about 15+ of them. Yeah, but at least unlike the sub it stays with you and that should make up for it, riiiiiiight? Ouch. Not for me, but for whoever is out there looking to unlock every little social thing in this game, it'll cost you. ...at least they animate nice, but maybe they should have been made into upgrades or version 2's of already available free emotes.Simply put: who is the target demographic you're trying to sell to? These prices seem wonky.The exp rate isn't an issue unless you can't stand a grind, especially knowing you can put money on it to speed it up. Depending on how you approach mmorpgs, this would be a deal breaker as for some, that would mean they're holding the xp hostage and the grind is even more arbitrary.That being said, have been meaning to catch up with this game and I'm glad I played it.

 I want to start out by saying, that if you can look past the initially grindyness of all MMORPG games, this game has a great community that you can return back to whenever. It's got great art, and wonderful music, cheezy PG-13 humor, and a great combat system. Possibly my favorite things about this game are the fact that the four nations of the game are entirely player-run. Economy, Ecology, etc. I play as a character that makes sure other players have enemies to fight and I try to keep a good ecological balance in the places I go. New players don't seem to realize that you can actually make an enemy type go extinct, so you have to be careful. This game gets an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 from me. Anyways, that's it for my little introductory, brief review.  Full review; - Wakfu has an anime art style. This is because it's based around an anime of the same name, which is a french anime that, while I've personally never watched it, I do know plenty of the characters from it and I do know that it is a really rather nice anime, at least, from what I've heard from my friends. It has a great soundtrack also reminescent of the anime, and the humor is right around the same. The character designs for the game are all very solid, and even though it looks more reminescent of, say, a flashgame, where you can notice like, how the limbs move, maybe stretch, you'll notice that here, but it's in a cartoony sense so you won't pay it much mind, Id think. - Wakfu has a very robust crafting and harvesting economy. All your resources, except for ores, are things you either have to hand-plant, or harvest from groves or gardens that are maintained by other players. Nations can impose limits to how many plants can be harvested or planted in a percentile range, and going over or below those percentiles will actually impose a penalty on you, being something as low as a 'citizen-level' penalty, to something as strict as a kill-on-sight bounty. The monster ecology for this game is exactly the same as the herb/tree/plant ecology, and everything is controlled by the players, even influencing the weather in the game for certain regions, making one region better for certain plants, and even time of years will influence the temperature! - Wakfu's combat system is probably just as robust as it's ecological and economical parts, and I'll echo the sentiment that this game's combat system is similar to Final Fantasty: Tactic's. I can't really say too much about the current state of the combat system, as it's apparently undergone a good deal of revisions, according to my friends, and skills and passives no longer work like they used to, and work in different ways, but the combat system is still very in depth, and you can view all of it's workings, majorly, in your own character screen, so it may be intimidating at first, but the more you play around with it the more you get used to it. I'm not a very serious combative player so I can't fully explain how the combat system works, but there are a lot of classes for you to try out and tinker with, so there's probably at least one playstyle for you to like!- On Wakfu's community.. I'm going to make one thing clear; Every game will have it's people who are there to ♥♥♥♥ with other players. This game is no different, and there's no exceptions. Players from hostile nations can invade your nation and try and instigate you to attack them, or deforest your region you're in. They can also try and bring your nation's enemy population down, but that's majorly it, people can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but a major group of people are either rather kind and helpful or they keep to themselves, which is understandable. This game shines in my opinion for how it's all player run, and you, yes, you could be nominated for helping whichever country you join, or even ruling it, if you make enough friends and prove yourself to be worth of such a responsibility. It's daunting at first, but you'll meet plenty of people who've played as leaders or as parts of nations. It's like, a half-sort of roleplaying thing, half nation management for your role. I've never been a member of a nation's staff, but I plan on working my way to that. (I'm currently reinstalling this game, and the game's done-- for now, this is my review, but I will add more later!)			"

												Keep trying to fall in love with this game.Light TBS is so my style. Nothing too heavy unless youre really looking to kick♥♥♥♥♥br>Its a grid based affair with elemental attacks, positioning, leveling abilities and a diverse class syste that encourages messing around. There's mecahnisms to respec for free and starting a new journey is always fun as each class has its own fighting style on the grid.Mechanics lend themselves towards the application and development of your own skills, little quests and a vibrant crafting economy.The choice in armour and gear is broad enough, and being part of a Guild can put you into a living community.Unless you choose your class to be money printer, where what you do is literally cause inflation. YOUR WHOLE JOB IS TO PRINT MORE MONEY, WHICH INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A CLOSED SYSTEM. THE ECONOMY IS ♥♥♥♥ED UP. THE SYSTEM CRASHES IF NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE PRINTING MONEY AND CRASHES AGAIN IF TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE, AS THE ONLY WAY TO DELETE MONEY IS TO HAVE IT POURED INTO A GUILD BASE FOT ITS UPGRADES.Also everything is adorable. Super adorable. So yeah. A Turn BAsed MMO with a lot of choice and quite a few little adventures to be had as you refine your strategies and travel with new freinds to kick♥♥♥♥♥and collect loot.			"

												Wakfu is a fun and adventurous game. It has turn based battle style fighting, a huge and expanding open world, interesting mob monsters (little birds called tofus- if you're vegitarian you won't want these Tofurkeys, Bow Meows, Treechnids, lots of weird stuff). Its a player run game, with 5 different governments that players can be elected into. Bonta, Amanka, Brackmar, and Sufokia cough cough Sufokia being the best, of course cough cough are the four land owning governments. The fifth is a group called the Riktus Clan who are sort of a pirate/rogue group who go around and wreck shop and steal land. You join one of the land owning countries at level 18 or so, and later get the option to join Riktus, if you're so inclined, aroud level 35.The best way to level up is to scour the many dungeons scattered across each country, and the neutral lands (ex Astrub, The Sadida Kingdom, and other such islands found on the map). Getting into the dungeon itself provides a challenge as you have to fight area monsters to get keys or ingredients to make keys to get in. Each player requires a key to get in. Groups are suggested for dungeons, though you can use a 'sidekick' which is basically a second character you control. Sidekicks require you to use a key as well, as they count as a second person linked to yourself. At the end of a dungeon you earn experience, items and tokens which allow you to buy other items from a machine outside said dungeon. Those items from the machine are linked to your player character. You can also run the dingeon multiple times to get all the items from a set without them being linked (most times).Then there are things that I consider 'sub classes' that help you make pretty much anything in the game. These jobs allow you to make armor, weapons, furniture for your havenbag/home, accessories, food, etc. They are on their own leveling system unrelated to your characters level. The CRAFTING professions are: A.O.E Weapons Master, Armorer, Baker, Chef, Close Combat Weapons Master, Handyman, Kama Minter, Leather Dealer, Long Distance Weapons Master, Jeweler, and Tailor at the time of this review. There are also GATHERING Professions, which help you get the ingredients for crafting. GATHERING Professions are: Lumberjack, Herbalist, Miner, Fisherman, Trapper, and Farmer. These professions also offer unique items to craft, though are best leveled up by actually gathering things.This game is very time consuming. But fun as all get out.In this game there are a lot of guilds. When I say a lot I mean, like, over 500. Many may be in disuse or inactive, but there are a lot of options out there. Look into the guilds and join one that makes you comfortable, you can always make one of your own if you want to. Guilds provide boosts you can't earn without being part of a guild. Stuff like increased HP or damage for a certain element, depending on the guild level and amount of points they've earned. Guilds have 3 daily quests that grant 15-20 points per quest per character that does them. You also earn small amounts of guild points just doing whatever if you're grouped up with members from your guild- like the little environmental quests (like kick 10 Gobball Balls or stomp some weeds type things), running through more than one dungeon (though the one daily quest for that grants 20 each time after grants a few points too). You can always leave a guild as well, f it no longer suits your playstyle, though you will lose all related bonuses.On the topic of dailies; there is a temple called the temple of almanax. It has 4 doors correlating to the seasons inside, and once a day you go to 'pray' to the merida of the day. It grants a token that allows you to buy cool stuff like costumes or a pet or haven bag upgrades, something like 10,000 exp, and a randomized bonus (something like +40 Wisdom or +30 HP and other things like that. the bonuses last one hour of gameplay).Theres so much in the game, it is really worth it to give it a few hours to try, it is free after all. Theres also a user-run wiki for Wakfu that covers a bunch of stuff and is always expanding (albeit slowly sometimes). Theres also Ankama's site that has more info on specifics as well.All in all, its worth a try at the very least. Its fun, its enjoyable, and its free (though you CAN choose to spend some real cash if you really want, but you don't have to)			"

												I really love this game, I also played the original one (not from Steam, the one from Ankama). The Steam-version lacks some sounds, what is a bit disappointing because they, too, made the fights and so on more interesting. What's bothering me is that I had an Ankama account before and linked it with my Steam account. Now it seems like I can't get any achievements on Steam for the things my character (that I already played before linking the Ankama account with the Steam account) does. Summed up, it's still a pretty awesome game but it lacks some stuff that the original from Ankama has. I'd really recommend it because it's fun to play and lets the players their freedom, the classes are interesting and if you know the series you're pretty much in heaven. Let's keep our hopes up that the lacks I mentioned before won't bother us for too long.			"

												Ahhh, this game...  This game is definately worth sinking some hours into, especially if you're into Tactical RPG's, MMO's, or even managing a Nation!I first found out about Wakfu by watching the series on Netflix.  I thought ""Oh boy, i wonder if there's a game for this!""  Turns out my ignorant self was unaware of the series being based off of a game!Finding out as much as I could, I was extremely pleased to find this game on Steam, and absolutely FREE, too!Anyways, back to the game itself, I've spent a good 130 hours on it now and I am STILL exploring the world that there is to see!  After a while you get tired of playing by yourself (if you're a social introvert like me) and you want to expand a little.  That's where making/joining a guild comes in handy.  You can find plenty of people to kill and gather resources with.The system incorporated into the game are kinda... well, up and down.  The currency system, as well as the ecosystem and government, is all player-run.  So you'll have to checkup daily for new prices on an item you want.  And the crafting system is a little over-the-top.  Why do I need almost 32 bits of wool to make clothes!?All in all, it's a good time-killer if you need an excuse from the world and want something a little different than MMO's like World of Warcraft.I give it a 8/10.

												This game is pure genius.  The battle style is similar to Fire Emblem, but you can actually play with other people in real time.  Only annoyance might be waiting for them to complete their turn.  The game is colorful, bright, and welcoming.  Plenty of ""classes"" to choose, all which have a male/female version of them (even Robots).  Level up and do dungeons with your friends to gain equipment, stats, skills, items, and keys to more dungeons.The game even features some other skills such as mining, farming, and crafting.  There seems to be always something to do.  The game even has competing nations, PVP, and guilds.The only gripe I have with the game is that it's primarily sandboxed; in the beginning you'll have plenty of quests to get you going, but at some point the quests do stop, which leaves it up to you how you want to play the game.  Do you want to grind to the highest level?  Do you want to help newer people grind to the highest level?  Do you want to take it easy and become a farmer for the rest of your life? The choice is yours.  However, when I got boosted to a higher level, I had no idea what to do because of the limited amount of quests.			"

The list goes on and on.This game has personality by the boat load.  It was originally released in 2012 after a Closed Beta phase.  It is the successor to DOFUS, Ankama's other successful tactical RPG.  The games are different though.  I've never played DOFUS, but I know they're different.  If you like games like FF Tactics, then give this one a try!			"

												Wakfu.  What to say about this game?  Tactical combat?  Check.  Cute, anime inspired graphics?  Check.  15 unique classes?  Check.  Awesome art style?  Check.  Dungeons?  Check.  The list goes on and on.This game has personality by the boat load.  It was originally released in 2012 after a Closed Beta phase.  It is the successor to DOFUS, Ankama's other successful tactical RPG.  The games are different though.  I've never played DOFUS, but I know they're different.  If you like games like FF Tactics, then give this one a try!			"

We got to a point where the story kinda dropped off and we had to figure out what the game truely was we got kind of annoyed at first but we played it more learned more about it from veteran players which btw the comunity is amazing, but now that we know more about it this has become one of our favorite games.

												A very fun game with colorful characters and a lot of unique classes. The missions are fun and varied, you can punch bunnies, pick flowers, eat pizz'larva, or do basically whatever you want. The beginnning stage is a little tough due to the saturation of wodents, but once you're past that, it's one of the best free games out there.

												The game itself is very dull and slow paced. Tactical RPGs should never be MMO's to begin with and the game has very little driving aspect to get the players to play the game. That being said it still has unique features and fun gameplay mechanics that is better suited for single player. You can play single player in the game by building a bunch of characters and then sidekick them to your main character (with the only fatal flaw being you have to spend over 25$ just to even do that for 90 days). I like where Ankama is going with this but they are doing it the wrong way. They should do what Squaresoft did when they made Final Fantasy Tactics for the Playstation 1. If they were to do that and sell the game for roughly 20$ on steam than they would be able to have a successful video game. If people like tactical RPGs, this game will be up your alley. Just a note though: Game is kind of buggy and not many players to play with.			"

												I played Dofus for years. I always said that Dofus is great game and you won't ever find game like Dofus. How wrong I was. Wakfu is like evolved Dofus. Sure it lacks some things we didn't even know we like in Dofus (e.g. you don't get all skills at once so you have more time to learn using them), but generally Wakfu is even better. Why is Wakfu so special? You have to use your brain while fighting. Of course you will have some skill pattern, few skills you will use again and again, however you have to know where to go, who should be killed first, etc. New monster means new type of battle. And another great thing Wakfu offers to its players is economy and ecosystem. There are no NPCs for buying/selling, everything is on players. Another thing, that depends on players is nature. You can gather plants, you can cut trees, but if you want them to grow again, you have to plant them. And monsters as well. Also everyone in certain area can get bonus, because special NPCs who take care of areas will tell you how much trees they want there, how much monsters, ... And if they are pleased, players get temporary bonus stats. I am not saying everyone will love the game, but I think everyone should at least try.			"

												Been playing this game all day and I only have a few gripes that are overwhelmingly outweighed by the positives.Cons: 1. Up until level 10 or so there are some really annoying quests but that's expected out of an MMO. There's one specifically which has you pushing flower pots into plants in some sort of puzzle that I find mind numbingly stupid. 2. The professions are an amazing part of the game but there is no mission or anything that really explains any of them. You have to track down the trainers themselves and read the little mini books the give you on each profession.3. The starter area is way overpopulated and makes grinding out some of the lower levels/gear grinding kind of annoying.That's the only real gripes I have, now, for the positives.Pros: 1. When they game says it has unique classes it really means it. I found myself making quite a few new characters just for the sake of trying out the classes. One that sticks out in my mind is the Escaflip which is a gambling class in a since. Certain skills in the class (namely the ""Earth"" path) are 100% based on pure luck. There are passives that make you luckier but I just find the class overall interesting.2. The amount of stuff to do fresh out of tutorial is amazing. Immediately what came to mind is runescape just on a smaller, better scaled version. Including the gathering, crafting, etc. which brings me to pro number 33. This one will vart from person to person depending on who you ask but I do not find the gathering to be tideous or boring, Wakfu is a beautifully designed game with vibrant colors and cute, anime like avatars. I found joy and going around collecting seeds from animals. Yes, I said seeds from animals. This sort of solves the issue with con number 3 because it takes roughly 5 seconds (no exaggeration) for an animal to spawn after you plant the seeds. 4. The community is very friendly and talkative. Now, me being a somewhat older player I found this to be annoying as well as helpful because, like I said, the game is very anime-esque. This means LOTS of 13 and 14 year olds. As long as you're the type of person who can easily ignore this it's no issue. If you go dungeoning that's where you'll find the informative, helpful, mature mmo players.I could go on and on about this game because I literally plaed it for about 8 hours straight. It's a fun game and I reccomend it to anyone who's looking for something new and different. solid 9/10			"

												I've played this game in the past, and recently decided to pick it up again. I have to say, I really enjoy this game. I like the art style as well as the mechanics. I'm normally not a fan of Turn Based Combat--I like to kick'em when they're down... or something like that, but Ankama has found a way to make it work. I spent a while looking for an MMORPG that would work on Linux, and this one happens to work on Linux, and Windows. They've apparently updated classess and some quest, and I expect there's more to come; however this game does require that you have patience. But overall a good experience.... ****/*****			"

												The game itself is quirky, beautiful, and addictive. The classes are completely unique, and each has four different elements it can focus in, which makes for a lot of easy tailoring to play style.Even though it's the most aethetically pleasing MMO out there, it's still infested with middle schoolers learning their first swear words. It's an interesting sight to have some grouchy kid stomp the plants you're growing for a recipe while cussing you out, saying your flowers are too close to theirs. If you were expecting this game to have a nicer commmunity, boy, are you naive.Luckily, you can pick and choose which chat channels you see through buttons on the right of the chat box. You can have groups and guilds and the like, but I have become a hermit and still find the game fascinating.			"

												If you are one of the blessed souls that played Final Fantasy Tactics in the old days you might like this, every race in the game has his unique playstyle and can be forwarded into 3 different elemental branches or combine them for unique playstyle, of course as it is a free 2 play game it has it's upside downs, the time you get to lvl up is huuuge and the people who pay have some advantages but still its a pretty good game specially if you have friends to play with, the races are pretty balanced and the enemy AI its pretty well done you will get challanges playing on PvE and the PvP its hell fun, definitively a game you should play if you like Strategy per turn games, it has it own economy AND ecology system, 4 factions and Wars between them :) you can even also choose the gobernor of that faction, overall wakfu its a 8/10 and if you are not sure about it try it! you might find that mmo that hooks you up for a while!

												I played Dofus for years. I always said that Dofus is great game and you won't ever find game like Dofus. How wrong I was. Wakfu is like evolved Dofus. Sure it lacks some things we didn't even know we like in Dofus (e.g. you don't get all skills at once so you have more time to learn using them), but generally Wakfu is even better. Why is Wakfu so special? You have to use your brain while fighting. Of course you will have some skill pattern, few skills you will use again and again, however you have to know where to go, who should be killed first, etc. New monster means new type of battle. And another great thing Wakfu offers to its players is economy and ecosystem. There are no NPCs for buying/selling, everything is on players. Another thing, that depends on players is nature. You can gather plants, you can cut trees, but if you want them to grow again, you have to plant them. And monsters as well. Also everyone in certain area can get bonus, because special NPCs who take care of areas will tell you how much trees they want there, how much monsters, ... And if they are pleased, players get temporary bonus stats. I am not saying everyone will love the game, but I think everyone should at least try.			"

												8/10 It's a great game for people who like challenges and don't mind being social in a video game and can tolerate easy grinding. General Census  I like it, it has this cute unique charm that you don't often see in free to play's. The gameplay has very much depth on comparable terms to when ragnarok was popular before transitioning to 3D. For somebody who has watched the show on both seasons, I can say this is very faithful to the wakfu IP, especially if you like old video game references and culture.It is a very artsy game for something than runs on java and is sprite based. Gameplay The game itself is very hardcore in terms of rpg's where you need to number crunches and research on having the ideal build for character’s. The gameplay is more forgiving in a sense compared to the old days where everything was un-killable without organized efforts. It is sandbox but it has some sense of direction, every so often you will get a quest giving you an idea of what you should be doing at this point. However the professions in the game and the drops give it a very strong grindy feeling, but it doesn't hurt so much because of how easy it is too grind. They give you several options and ways on how to level professions so you don't get bored or annoyed instantly. It's very easy instead of being this long gradual process, not to mention how fast you can level up. In each battle they give these conditions in the upper left which are rule sets, and if follow them no matter how confusing they can be you will get some insane bonuses. Me and a buddy have been playing this since Friday, and we reached the 30's bracket with just 6 hours of game time each day in-between this game and dark souls. And we came from games like WoW and Guild wars where everything was boring and repetitive. These rules are unique challenges and make everything more challenging because we are purposely putting handicaps on ourselves to get the best rewards. And the xp and drop rates are astonishing if you follow through, I used to beta test this game back in 2011 before they came to steam and I dropped it because of how much of a chore everything in the game was.They have these little Gatcha machines outside of dungeons and depending on your performance in them you get these tokens to use on the machines so if you trying to build a set, you just go to this little machine and use the tokens you earned to finish the set. Ups Ankama did some really good revamps and permeantly removed that paywall, everything is there for free to play and the gap between people who get boosters are very little because it just a time saver. There are some annoying options like not being able to deposit money or items in an account bank and have it spread across all characters, and having limited bag spaces;  But is solved if you just make bags or buy them off the market boards. This may be one of the first games I played where they made the environment an integral part of the game because when you cut down trees, harvest plants, or kill mobs. These things don't respawn. You have to do your part and befriend nature by collecting seeds, planting trees, and breeding monsters so you can the players around you have access. You get rewards and points by helping the environment and give your character a reputation on how helpful you are to the people around you.Everyone is rewarded for not being selfish and increasing this collaboration between people.The last part I’m going to cover is the politics system and how it affects people who join nations. The people in seats of power are given the reasonability of making sure everyone in their territories is looked after. They spend their cash and collect taxes to buy bonuses which apply to everyone in their nation and their lands by having increased drop rates, more natural resources available to use, and giving access to dungeons that are not normally open for everyone. They also organize the pvp structure for the lands and against other nations. They pass laws protecting the environment and reward those who plant and expand dwindling resources. And give people titles for those who go out of their way to give security to the people that serve their realm. Everyone has a part to play to guarding lands against thieves and invaders, to distributing crafting materials and giving to the less fortunate or under leveled.  Downs The game is confusing at times and does not always explain what you need to do, I had to use the wakfu encyclopedia from time to time to figure out where stuff is, what drops what, and how to get things. It is also very weird on how sensitive things are for spells, victory conditions, quest conditions, and crafting conditions. There was an instance where I had to capture and tame a wild giant turkey, and was given 3 books which actually do nothing for me in terms on capturing it. They gave me a book on how to eat these things when I am supposed to capture one and use it as a mount, so I do not know why they would tell me how to eat my mount. I have to talk to a guy inside the pen and had to make sense of his explanation. One of the problems I have with the game is that I don't want to sit and read a bunch of paragraphs, and by not doing so I am punished by not giving me something intuitive. I constantly need to read stuff otherwise I won't know what I’m doing and I don't play video games to read things, I don't mind cut scenes and people telling stories but it’s kind of hard to enjoy the game if I am constantly reading everything. I won't give them♥♥♥♥♥♥for not narrating anything but it would be a nice change of pace if they gave small tutorials with a over voice explanation so you’re not constantly consulting manuals or googling.

I love this game with its ecosystem and its fun lil tid bits, its characters classes and its turn base stratagy, is INCREADABLE and im the type of person who hates TBS mostly for the reasons of End war on the ds. But any who. Wakfu is amazing its reliving my childhood and im greatly pleased of this game			"

												If you like rpg's,mmo's or strategy games you will love this title. This game is soo good, while I haven't played too much Dofus, I am 18 hours into the game and I can say it might be as good as Dofus. + Hilarious dialogue and character names ( Also you can see animals make out )+ You are free to do whathever you like. Whenever you grind and feel like you are getting bored, there is a lot of things that will make the boredom go away, like doing dungeons,crafting,harvesting,exploring,pvp,guild wars and much more.+Quest's are always fresh and dont feel like your average MMO where you need to either collect this and this from an enemy or killing this and this number of enemies. Usually the only collecting thing would be harveting materials , and from killing monsters, its only optional because they will give you only a little bit more exp from eco quests or like i call them ""field quests""+Beautiful art design , and just exploring through the scenery feels relaxing.+Great skills that have multiple uses,and skill resets if you are not comfterable with your char.+You can choose from a wide selection of  unique characters. Even the archer is so unique.+You can put items on sale while offline and you can fast travel + Ton of archivementsNow for the bad things-Game might get grindy at times-Discarding items is a pain in the something to do-You can't sell at merchants , instead you have to sell your items to players, or discard them.-You need to put a lot of time into it if you want to get to the fun stuff-You cant move with keys, mouse only. And no camera movement besides zoom in and zoom out.-Glitches. You have them.-WHEN CAN WE WATCH THE ENGLISH ANIME ?-With friends, this is a bit easy. (But still ton more fun)Final reviewIf you put time into it, its a amazingly unique game. If you wanna get through it fast, its gonna get boring really fast.7.5/10 Recommend it to anybody who loves things like fire emblem or final fantasy tactics.			"

												honestly, this is pretty fun, it's a player driven ecosystem, meaning players who focus on different jobs, such as farmer, handyman, trapper etc. you also have a TON of classes to mess with, from the gambling ecaflips, to the situation changing masquaraiders, to the speedy portal summoners the eliotropes and a ton more, while you can have more then one job in the ecosystem, you will need help finding the items needed for some stuff, personally I recommend playing this game with a band of friends so you can all get a lot of stuff done and have a blast during the battles, which are freaking fun as hell, honestly, the only reason I would not recommend this game, is if your not a fan of grinding for stuff, or don't have a lot of time to spend, so for me, this game gets a solid, but not perfect, 8/10			"

												A fairly interesting MMORPG. For anyone who played the early stages of this game, or even the Beta like me - I can assure you that there has been some major progress since those times. Not something I would recommend to people who despise grinding, but for those of us who are sort of accustomed to the old Ragnarok way of things, this should be no problem. I've played past lvl.30 and I'm still having alot of fun with it.Looking for a MMORPG with a turn based tactics twist to it? This could be for you.			"

												Confusing at first but highly addictive later Wakfu stays a classic must play for all tacticalturn-based RPGS fans and it in my honest opinion is a true succesor to the genre of TTB RPGs. Just Imagine Disagea and FF Tactics with strong MMO and semi-sandbox elements where you (the player) is responsible for ecosystem/politics/economy/ecology and more. The only down side is the games extreme grindines from time to time and highly group/raid based gameplay, meaning that soloing content is a lot harder than do it with a group, cause there is no downside in having a larger group.Final personal score - 8.5/10			"

												The Show is wonderful and the game isn't all that bad but that being said it isn't all that good ether. It does little to hold your attention as I played it I found very little enjoyment in the combat system as I was thrown from boring quest to boring quest. What really hurts the game most though is how it trys introduce mingames viva the combat system one fine example is the Pizzalarva quest where the player is asked by a NPC to cook larva as this will train him somehow to fight Cult members. The idea was forced and the mingame itself was horrible as instead of just straight up fighting you had to not only keep the larva from reaching the end of the track but also had to tenderize and granish the larva the correct way. Sounds simple but in reality all the player finds themself doing is running back and forth from granish barrel to conveyor belt hoping that the next larva is the correct color and trying to keep other larva from escaping.

												Wakfu is a turned based MMORPG, that has interesting graphics, music, so on and so forth with things that've already been touched on. Lemme tell you about the part of it that really makes ME excited. Wakfu really tried to build a world that was entirely dependent on the people who play it. So, right off the bat? There are zero NPCs, aside from the occasional quest giver. That means if you're looking to sell your♥♥♥♥♥♥ you better start up a stand. There's also an Ecology system that effects monsters and gathering nodes (trees, plants, ore, etc.) wherein, if you kill too much, or take too much, it'll actually GO AWAY. It's up to the player to repopulate these areas by planting things, breeding animals and generally working with the ""Wakfu"" of any particular area. Some other notable parts are as follow: Player elected governors, citizen points that can effect how the world treats you (Wanna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, be an outlaw and go to jail? Hell yeah you do.), instant player housing (Haven bag) that... also works as your store, a place to decorate things, a place to put gathering nodes and so on. There's also huge maps, the ability to spec into every kind of profession, interesting character classes that have little to no over lap as far as utility... I mean, come on!I'll admit I'm pretty stoked about this game. However, it is definitely not a game for everyone. The combat can be pretty off putting, and it's generally not as fun of an experience if you go at it alone. But, if you're the type of person that really likes to see a game take some amazing steps for MMOs, you might wanna give this a shot.			"

												I normally don't enjoy playing MMOs and usually keep away from them (why? I have no idea), but Wakfu feels different. This game has an Isometric viewpoint with turn based tactical combat. Its PvP is balanced and its paymodel fair, which is something you dont see in F2P games often here on steam.			"

												Confusing at first but highly addictive later Wakfu stays a classic must play for all tacticalturn-based RPGS fans and it in my honest opinion is a true succesor to the genre of TTB RPGs. Just Imagine Disagea and FF Tactics with strong MMO and semi-sandbox elements where you (the player) is responsible for ecosystem/politics/economy/ecology and more. The only down side is the games extreme grindines from time to time and highly group/raid based gameplay, meaning that soloing content is a lot harder than do it with a group, cause there is no downside in having a larger group.Final personal score - 8.5/10			"

This game follow a bit the story of Dofus but 1000(?) year later , but overall it is extremly great. Note that this game know how to evolve and adapt to the player. Only thing to say is .. this is definitively worth the try !			"

												Despite the amount of interesting open-world area, Final Fantasy Turn-by-turn gameplay style, it seems that it is just now mainly for Windows instead of the Mac, due to JAVA-Based compatibility. Especially from users that are new to Steam for Mac on Yosemite and Higher.The only fix is this is just only using a VERY OLD and maybe unupdated service to Java for Mac. Sooner or later, Java will kill off Java 6 (the game currently utilizes this version of Java) for all the new versions, so where does this leave this game?I think it maybe safe to say that the developers may soon need to think about bringing a major update to have new Java version support (Java 7 or 8 and newer in the years to come).

												A few key things to know about this game.1.) You will do a LOT of grinding.2.) The end game dungeon currently requires you to pay to even ACCESS. (No sub means the highest level area is locked out for you.3.) If you pay money you get to field more heroes/sidekicks allowing subs to monopolize more turns per fight4.) PvP is dominated by people who have sunk hundreds, if not thousands of hours into the game, even with subscriptions. If you plan on doing any serious pvp, it won't be until your AT LEAST 1,000 hours into the game. Until then be prepared for a lot of repetition. If one of these points don't turn you off then you might want to check the game out. Mechanically it isn't bad and the community, for the most part are a cool bunch of people. That said, around 120-140 prepare to spend hundreds of hours running the same 1-2 dungeons fighting the same group of mobs over and over again. Unless you can join a guild to find people who will help pass the repetitive nature of the game it will eventually get to you.NOT FOR LONE WOLF PLAY - PERIOD			"

												PROS:Best ever game environment.  Beautiful art and style. Extensive crafting system. PVP option. Dungeons are unique and mob's are difficult to master-  they all have different abilities. Gameplay grind and difficulty creates a relatively mature player base. Can play for free if you can stand the grind punishment.CONS:Gear acquisition until you have a maxed out character is very punishing! If you're used to Warcraft dungeons, where you can get all the gear you need that matches your level running  dungeons, you're going to be frustrated. Dungeons AT YOUR LEVEL, are DIFFICULT for a group, YOUR LEVEL. So you're basically left with hoping you have some maxed level freinds to run you through, over and over. Which by that time, you've leveled past the gear you were after in the first place. The system really makes no sense.Getting groups at levels other than high levels is hard. Most players are maxed and have no incentive to help you with low level dungeons. They need to introduce player scaling and rewards so high level players are compelled to play low level dungeons.BIGGEST CON:  THE GRIND.It's the most punishing grind I've ever experienced- even if you purchase booster packs for 3x the XP. Now I only get to play an hour or two here and there and on weekends, but I've been playing about a year and my highest toon is 115 out of 165. People get around this by being ""power leveled"" by high level players- which is about as fun as teasing a cat with string... You're just there for idle chit chat while they blow mobs down- for hours....SUMMARY:One of my favorite games ever due to art, sounds, playstyle and difficulty. But it has serious flaws with helping and keeping new players interested (grind and grouping). Best summarized as an MMO Chess Game.			"

												Good:Combat is fun, especially with friendsThe world is very open allowing for exploration and training your skills well beyond your level (like mining and carpentry)All currency and item value is created and determined by the players, creating a unique market systemYou can wage war on other nations with more than just pvp, you can destroy their resources as wellBeing a bandit is actually helpful to other players, because they gain citizenship points for correcting your eco-terrorismBad:No one usually wages war. Most of the time everyone is friendsThere are no incentives to become a bandit other than for the hell of itGame suffers from imbalanced resources (using three logs to get one plank, and using 17 planks to make a box)experiencing minor, but consistent lag. Game seems to hickup ever couple minutes, or when pulling up the map/gathering resourcesSometimes creatures are labeled as “Busy” but aren’t doing anything, so you can’t get rid of them.Overall, a very good game and most issues I have with it can be solved if players start trying to kill eachother in-game.

But today I was looking at games in steam and I just see Wakfu.I think:""well I will download it and see if it's still P2P or not"".I nearly cried when I find it's f2p.In fact you can buy things for money but you musn't which is amazing,because this game was like 3 Years P2P...I have no words for this.GJ Amakna!!!Pros:+Graphics+Combat System+Many classes+Many proffesions+Guilds+Many sides of conflicts(brakmar-devils,bonta-angels,amakna-mercenaries,su♥♥♥ia-?)+F2P!!!!!+You can reset once per months all stats which is amazing because if you make mistake,or you can don't like your build you can change it one per month.+Purchased items not affect that much and you can win with people who buy items.So it's not P2W.+Open world.You can go everywhere!!!! When it was official you had restricted zone!!! This is awesome!!!Cons:-There is nothing like site with builds,which means you must experiment on your build or ask experienced player about it.-Fell little empty and unsocial because you see people and you walk around and when you go somewhere there is little chance you will see again same person.I back to this game when I started play it nearly 3 years ago and I will stay like 16 hours per day on it.infinity/10			"

												Wakfu, I kind of recommend the game, the free build allows you to make the character any way you want, beside may not have skills for that kind of gameplay.The world in the game is big, and there are quests and events that pop up randomly that gives you experience, you can also help the world be populated with monsters and flora, or even destroy it, depending on what you do, you can even gain a few good points to your nation.There is also the crafting system on the game, where you can create items and weapons that may be usefull for you, and the better, you can learn all kinds of crafting at the same time, so no cap of what you can specialize on.The only cons I found on the game are:Look's like attacking with the player equipped weapon is weaker than using skills on the enemy, even more because weapon attack can only be used once per turn, but skills, depending on them, can be used twice or more in a turn, causing higher dps.The faction war system is the most vile system I've ever saw in a game, beside it seems like not having much impact on the game world, it impossibilitates you of visiting other towns, because if you cross the frontier, you are screwed.You can easily get confused when doing quests, even more because some of them are not very clear of where is the objective, so you may end up having to look on the web where is the quest objective.Beside those cons, the game is fun, but not really my type of game, even more because playing alone may make you get tired of it very quickly.

Some of the best 3d-2d transitions I've seen in animation. Couldn't tell that it was 3d like the obviousness of the Berserk movies.			"

												This is one of the best MMORPGs I've ever played. The textures may not look so good if you play games for what they look like, but they've got theyr beauty. Also every single thing in this game is amazingly complex, like the ecosystem or the jobs. Damn, it even has political stuff in it if that's what you're into. Also the classes are sooooooooo varied, each with it's own huge range of unique spells that provides a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of combos and stuff. One more thing: the game is MASSIVE, it has tons of areas to explore and a lot of dungeons, items, jobs, quests, anything... The bad stuff? Well, if you play alone it kinda gets boring, but it's a good thing that Wakfu has this amazing comunity, everyone is so friendly and helpful and stuff, no trolls, nor scammers, so you'll make friends real fast and you'll have for sure someone to play with. In the end: great game, also free so it won't hurt to try.			"

You are able to do almost anything in this game as a F2P player. The classes are alot fo fun and I have leveled up so many times. There are so many ways to play that you can turn one character into a variety of archeotypes. *PROS*-Classes-Community-Style-PvP-F2P strong*Cons*-JavaAlot of people would say Anakma is a problem but, I do not think so. They generally release solid material. Yeah they are slow on somethings but, to be that is fine. They have gotten alot faster since they came to Steam. Give this game a chance. It will take over your life and caress you and take you to a magical place. 10/10 will keep banging daily.			"

												Wakfu is a great 2D mmorpg. Its one of a kind and none like it and you cant go wrong with trying it out.Its a deep game with a steep lvlcap over 160. Many classes to play and one of a kind that do not share skills or even textures.Wakfu has a massive land to roam and has many many crafting jobs. Hell you can even re populate the world with monsters.Do not go by what all the bad Steam reviews say... Most of them just got mad they updated the class they had and made it much harder to play. The support maybe bad or not but most mmos are worst. As for the bugs, all AAA games mmos or not on consoles and pc have more bugs then this so dont let the thumbs down run you off.			"

(Low Popularity Server)You can create a Shop or something like that, even while logged out.Housing(Its not a house its more a floor without walls.)Buyable Companions/Partymembers from the Premium Store(I got mine from the package that i purchased)No need for external Account, just use steam.The tactical battle system is like the one from shadowrunner.(Sorry if you found a better description of if you are unhappy with my comparision.)Enough said.

												one day i decided to start working on my mining skills because i wanted to craft something.you can probably tell by the fact that i didnt say what it was i wanted to craft that i have forgotten what it was.so anyways i started mining the most basic iron, and because i figured even non-miner guys can easily get their hands on it by mining it themselves or from people who sell it for cheap, so i just dumped them in the kama minting machine.slowly, i got to the more high-level ores, and salt.around that level i decided the ores were worth more than iron at least, and i couldnt put coal and salt into the minting machine(i dont think so anyway), so i sold them for about 20 kamas apeice.soon i noticed something: salt sold EXTREMELY well, i always logged in every morning to find all the salt i put up for sale sold out, so i started to prioritize mining salt as well as continueing to grind out mining levels for more advanced ores that could potentially have higher demand and sell for more.but nothing, and i mean NOTHING, not even refined salt, sold better than the base salt ore.then one day i noticed i was logging in every morning and spending upwards of 2 hours just going around the same few spots mining salt and minting kamas.11/10 would restart salt-mining empire when i regain the taste for MMOs			"

												Pretty cool game, it's a MMORPG with very different mechanics from the rest, sorta like final fantasy tactics which adds some very needed variety to the genre.Character classes take the word unique to a whole different level, you can think of any typical archetype of a character and you won't find any of them in here.As a combat focused game you're also expected to progress through combat so expect some grinding, thankfully grinding doesn't involve right clicking a mob once and falling asleep while you repeat this 500 times for each 1%.

												I haven't put much time into MMORPGs, but I do like tactical strategy games, so Wakfu looked promising. However, the game seems extremely convoluted and unwelcoming to new players. The user interface is cluttered and full of irrelevant information.I could accept that as the habits and trappings of MMOs, but the tutorial itself seems to be buggy. I'm supposed to be gathering a bunch of flower seeds, but the game is refusing to count them as I harvest. Then the ""Report a Problem"" link locked up the game.I can't comment on the quality of the game, because I can't play it. It seems like Wakfu needed to be baked a while longer before release.			"

												I'd like to start saying my hours played isnt very accurate. I played via Wakfu launcher for much more than i did here.This game is a remake of a popular game known as Final Fantasy Tactics. a Square grid based, turn based tactical game.There are some great features of the game but most are overshadowed with extreme lacklustre support and game management. Ranging from hacks and exploits never being dealt with causing the entire auction house(market) to flood kamas into the game nulifying the years spent aquiring them. Top end-endgame gear being duplicated and flooding the system making them about as expensive as a level 20 set.Even dealing with the PKing system which is an absolute joke if you run into a kiddie that has nothing better to do then camp decent leveling zones ( such as A.W) and kill you for no reason hours on end. (Which wasnt really a problem  after a while because i just Ddos'd him anytime i needed to enter the zone again so my friends and I could atleast play the game hassle free.) Then there is the subscription issue. As a player that has been with Wakfu and Dofus for many years now and owns all DLC and content. My subscription has finally ran out and I am no longer able to enter most end-game zones to further progress my character. So I provided Wakfu with money to assist with producing new content for them to release the content and then make me pay again to play on it... Seems a bit stupid from a consumers prospective. My friends and I have now actually quit Wakfu due to extreme neglect from Management and lack of content advancements over the years.While i DO recommend this game for a new users for a few hours to pass some time. I do not however advise you to ever pay them for their lack of service and progress and just quit once it gets a little boring after a hour or two.PS. There is a reason the ""Bug and Issues"" forum is bigger than the ""General Disucssions"" forum..			"

												Wakfu. The name alone makes people cringe like, you don't even want to go there.In the beginning there was Dofus, and I'd be lying if I said all was well.Dofus was the first of its kind, back when Steam actually made games and we were all little younglings playing 'Gunz: The duel'. Dofus was an interesting beast because unlike conventional play to win games at the time, Dofus was an over glorified demo of an MMO back when other MMO's thought they could actually stand up to the likes of Everquest and World of Warcraft.As time went on, many of us old guard who rememered the awful, oppressive treatment at the hands of Anakama had moved on and seemingly so had a large enough portion of the playerbase that a sequel was in order!A strange move indeed, making a sequel only a few years after your base product had launched. Wakfu of course is that sequel. Well it was announed years before it arrived and that signalled only the beginning of its issues. Not as late as Duke Nukem Forever but late enough to miss its own funeral because Wakfu is effectively dead.I say effectively because the servers seem to still be online, probabaly with the funding from the first game and piggy backing on those servers too no doubt.Dofus became a franchaise even having its own cartoon series over in France and its nice that we have a game filling this cutesy on the surface but brutally difficult when you play niche, but Wakfu is an MMO and with so few people around to play with, it just falls apart.But lets go back in time! What about when there WERE people to play with? Dofus was still a better game! Its like they took out all the things in Dofus that demanded teamwork and made Wakfu a 1 player game with online connectivity.Some people may like that idea but remember that this game was born from an MMO; it is akin to World of Warcraft having a World of Warcraft 2, still set in Azeroth only now its a one player twin stick shooter. It might be good on its own merits but we can't ignore the dramatic shift and we know the old crowd, the ones most likely to even want a sequal are going to feel very alienated.That is Wakfu. Welcome to Wakfu.Now all that aside is the game even good? Well the animations are fantastic, no really they are a joy to look at! The music...Well it exists. Yeah no one track really adds much which is a shame. The graphics are once again top notch like the animation and looking at the world around you isn't breath-taking like in Dark Souls or anything like that but they look great. Real dediction went into every art asset.Wakfus biggest failings are not even its own fault. Communities grow and wain as new products come out to tempt the crowds. Anakama are terrible at customer support but that is more of an 'outside of the game' issue. The music might lack pepper but that is very minor indeed. Really I don't recommend Wakfu but only for 1 reason and that reason is that its old! I don't mean old games suck, not in the least but what I mean is the community is effectively gone, its like Guildwars, which is a fantastic game, but going into Lions arch and having no one to play with, well it is the death kneel for an ""MMO"" and while people are playing Wakfu, the vast community has long since moved on and when I played I found barely anyone to interact with, even my screenshots were barren of life when I took them.What a shame.If you and enough of your friends can populate the game, you may have fun. If however you are looking to play this game in order to make new friends then move on, their is nothing to see here.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Years ago, this game was roughly 5% F2P. You could hardly do anything. It was fun but so incredibly limited. Now that it's ~95% F2P, you can do pretty much everything. So far, the only thing I've seen in-game that costs real money is an account-share vault that allows you to store items to be used by all characters on your account. A huge improvement from what I saw so long ago.The fighting style is very similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, one of my favorite games of all time. Play with friends or else you'll feel lost in this big, confusing world. You can solo but it's a lot easier with friends and the game seems to lean heavily on party play.I'd rate this game a 9/10 with a half point deduction because of repeatition (which is in pretty much every RPG) and another half point deduction because it's not as fun to solo. I highly recommend you play with friends.			"

I understand you got to make a living but people who can't invest in alternate characters without a booster makes them jump ship to another game.)*Fix your REPORT FEATURE         (I think they still haven't fixed the bug that makes your computer freeze the screen almost every 5 seconds of character movement.)Til then enjoy having the Nox server look like a ghost town.

												While the game has many good aspects, it turns into just farming very fast. The gathering system reminds of RuneScape skilling system but worse (is that even possible?). Farm for 2 hours to get a few levels in woodcutting and then have a ton of wood with nothing to really use it for. The crafting system is overally complex for the gear it provides and there is a lack of any game or story progression. Whats the purpose of playing? This is ultimately more of a Farming Simulator than the actual Farming Simulator game. While there is a multitude of unique classes, every character in the same class is ultimately the same. A large lack of skill customization. All it offers is slight stat customization which isn't very great either. It pretty much asks you if you want a minor boost in hp, defense or attack but makes it more complex than calculus with more stats than is necessary. From what I experienced in the dungeons, there are no intensely strategic boss fights and maybe there are some after you farm for hours upon hours in boredom, its really not worth it to find out. After level 18 the story drops off no where to be find, and there is seriously only like 10 quest givers from levels 18-60 that give out daily repeatable quests of go collect 10 of these junk items for me.It's not worth the time it takes to play it even if it is free.

												I feel dialogue continues the story? its rather strange to think that but hey => I am one those gamers who like to follow the cue cards.  However I bit not smitten how long it takes 2 gb what fudge if other family members aren't using the same network at same time it would be dandy to go get that data files? only time I could achieve that success is at 1 am. Game itself has very interest of possible characters, you have find out, to me seems major of mobs are bit corrupted or non corrupted, Could we attack not-corrupted? or that just mean? Seems you have finish lengthy tutorial in order to be free of directions in or be free play? I don't know when that is. More like game that keeps giving. You could keep playing forever and ever but updates make me question lot of things. I had uninstall because there was strange bug, flashed screen all over the place. I took photo crashing right in middle of 1st dungeon.  It then proceed as safety mechanism to log me out. Will I be playing in future maybe lets just keep in future when I feel game has no more bugs.			"

												I gave this game a fair chance--I truly did. It has its own unique charm and somewhat unique gameplay elements. There are many job classes--and I do mean many with tons of specializations you can consider by spending your precious skill points in one skill tree or another. You can even bash the tarnation out of other players via pvp at any time in the open world environment--even from the start of the game (once past the tutorial area).However, there are so many other mmorpgs out there that this one gets lost in the crowd and there are some incredibly frustrating elements to the game's structure. First off, it seems to be programmed exclusively in Flashplayer and uses a point-and-click interface to get the character to do anything. So you will be constantly using a mouse for everything. Leveling crafts, crafting gear, grinding, it gets to be so tedious with such a clunky interface after a while that I honestly just stopped with the other aspects of the game and tried focusing on leveling just to try and keep going.One of the main features of the game though is political and other players seem to constantly beg you for one thing or another--or even worse: they attack you because you belong to a different faction than them. Unfortunately, there's no way to simply stay factionless in the game either--it makes you choose one to progress past certain points and areas in the game.I honestly gave this game a go because I thought it would be something completely different--and it was: a nightmare. If you like a game with entirely too much going on then maybe this one might be for you. Otherwise you might want to skip this one. (And yes, I kept this review general on purpose without going into any spoilers--you're welcome XD)			"

												First ImpressionsWell i haven't played a MMORPG for a few years now. GW2 was the last, but also played in the day LOTRO, Metin2, Linage II, and a few others can't seem to remember. So after, i installed the game which didn't tell me exactly the file size of the actual game (not the starter), I started where all should start - Tutorial. And sure enough I was like WTF?!Tutorial if anything is anything but a tutorial - they obviously expect players to know how to play the game straight off the bat. What was bad is the mechanics... ie choosing a tile behind the character is sticky unless you zoom in. One has to guess what each button on the keyboard is for straight away - So understanding the hotkeys is all guess work. Even then, the setup for the hotkeys is .... defined for one way.Kind of reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics, with a Baulder Gate Overview where you cannot rotate the screen, but a Borderlands feel of graphic design. I don't know if this is suppose to be a mixed of some cartoon or Kungfu Panda but it doesn't grab me. But appears to be another Cash Grab FreemiumsUnless you want to slog it out farming for wheat for over a few hours and then move onto the next item just so you can build something else. And the fact that I have all the stuff that I can't even sell to a NPC or buy♥♥♥♥♥♥from a NPC is annoying. I couldn't even work out how to setup shop for when I logout, i read forums but still no step by step instruction on how to do it.Does this game have potential - sure, any game does. But, by the time I got to level 11 I was wishing I didn't even bother with this. Maybe someone might lend me hand/ear/nose in the right direction but really - I am not bothering. Forcast for deletion in 5 days time.			"

												I don't have any play time Via Steam because I've been playing it for months via Ankama. This is an extremely fun game, with quite a lot to do. from dungeons to professions, challenges, quests, and its getting bigger and better every day, While the customer support at times is lacking. the game is amazing. full of comedy, and also peverse sense of humor can be found in almost everything, from the monsters drops to the equipment, some of them are just outlandish, take a look at the Tofu Rump monster drop if you don't believe me, its a literaly A hole lol.The game has a political system, with an ever changing ecology for every zone, containing plants, crops, tree's ore and mosnters. all of which are depleted / maintained through players, and naturally occuring reproduction ( you can watch some Gobball / Tofu porn while you wait for spawns :D lols ) and a weather system, while not entirely visual, its presentm and affects growth rates of plants. all in all, I would very readily reccomend this game for anyone interested in an mmorpg with tactical grid based combat.

												I have an unhealthy obsession with the animated series. I really hate turn-based games.My love for the animated series has pushed me to try and get hooked on this game again and again and again. I just can't. It is NOT my jam. I have tried to play this game at least 5 different times now. Every time I install it, the beginning is different. This game is NOT bad. But if you can't stand turn-based combat (like me) then you will not be able to play this. I'm sorry, master. I guess I'll just stick to the cartoon.Definitely give this game a try if it looks interesting to you. It seems....unique...			"

												This game has a lot of potential. Too bad it doesn't make any use of it.The combat is fun. It's different than what most games do, it's pretty tactical. It lasts you for about 2 days, because it gets repetitive fast. Why? Well there are a lot of classes, they are pretty different from each other, you can really find one for you. Each class has 3 branches of abilities, depending on element you will be using.While you have up to 15 active abilities you will only use about 2-3(at most) from them, since there aren't many situational skills, there are just those that do more and less damage. You don't want to mix abilities between branches, because that means less damage(best gear gives element based +%damage). Skills in the same branch usually have the same range, so you're stuck with either long range or close combat once you choose. And that's not a bad thing right? Well, no, but once again, you're stuck with using 2 skills because the others deal less DPS.It doesn't help that you kill the same enemies over and over again, because the game is so empty that finding a group for a dungeon is nearly impossible, except for the most popular dungeons, and even then it's problematic.Most people meet in starter area,which is pretty populated. After you get to your nation, you're pretty much playing single player with someone passing you by every once in an hour.At least the crafting system looks nice, after choosing to become an area of effect weapon smith I was greeted with message that I won't be able to harvest materials, and will have to buy them from lumberjacks and miners. Wish I had some kind of warning before I chose my profession, but okay, I'm fine with that, the system looks great! This means that what I make will surely have buyers, because if you're a lumberjack you won't be able to make those weapons. If you're a baker you will buy my weapons and I will buy your bread. That's awesome! Finally someone did it right.Except I still could harvest. I could chop down the trees and gather iron ore from deposits. I could learn all the professions and create anything I needed myself.Instead of having good economy based on supply and demand, they screwed it up completely. You want to be a baker? Well you better be a farmer too, because otherwise you would have to pay for the flour. It's fun for about 2 days, after that you have tried all classes, finished the Astrub(starter zone) quests 10 times, and there's no point in moving to main land, since there's no people there.That's a shame.

												The tutorial is compltely broken. To progress a player needs to plant some seeds but they aren't able to because ""area is full"". The solution to this problem is to have some players that somehow found a square among about 9243847 different tiles where he/she can plant the seeds, gain the ability to fight mobs, and pretty much grind eternally so others can progress.Edit:The grind also barely does anything so you'll be stuck there for a while.

												This game has a pretty unique turn based, tactical gameplay which is actually kind of fun. What makes it tactical is the fact that you might block other players view, you have a limited amount of steps you can take per turn, and stuff like that.It also has an interesting ecological system in which you can take part. To take part in it you can plant new trees, spawn new enemies, plant crops and of course harvest all this stuff, etc.BUT if you are looking for something like a ""classic"" MMORPG with straight questlines you might want to try another game because this game is a pure grinder. Except for the starting zone there are like no quests. All you do is to go from one group of enemies to another. While doing so, do not expect to meet any other players.All in all, I'd say that this game has a great potential because the tactial fighting system is a lot of fun but there are hardly other players except for the starter city but still there are like a 100 servers. What ruins the game for me is the lack of quests.			"

												On one hand, Very fun game, lots of classes and spell trees, awesome turn based fighting.On the other hand, Support is terrible, had a ticket sent to them, more then 4 months ago, still with no reply. Think it is a good game, but not steam caliber as they can't keep it up on the support side with the mass of new players steam brings.			"

												Pretty decent game but I definitely wouldn't spend any money on it. The mechanics and whatnot are decent as well but it's designed for co-op play really. Solo players will have fun but some content is designed for co-op only, which is quite sad because it means you cant experience certain game content without friends or grouping up - and we all know what a pain grouping up is, which is why most MMO's fail (the dumb kids of course). It does entertain you, but if you are looking for a serious and fulfilling way to spend time gaming I strongly suggest something else.			"

												I tried, I really tried to get into this game. But here is my perspective:The game is quite nice but I do not reccomend this to brand new players. It really is not new player friendly, and the dungeons are very difficuly for new players. You need patience to play this game.It is turn based, and the combat system is unique but what made me (as a new player) leave this behind were:Dungeons that are puzzle based, really give you zero hints on how to beat it. You are forced to use google on this and you cannot leave a battle unless you quit the game. Other tactical based mmos allow an ""escape"" feature if the battle is too tough or you need to leave, this however does not.  This right here is a red flag for me.Another feature that didn't really keep my interest is the quest system. For new players, if you log off, you have to manually try to find your quest destination as most do not give you a compass (quest tracking tracing feature).So in summary:Pros____Unique battle systemTons of classesSmall Patch and DownloadCons____Not new player friendly.Map layout can be confusing for new players.Google how to beat puzzle dungeons (new players).No hints on puzzles from in-game.Can't leave in the middle of a battle without logging out. (no escape or flee chance option).Overall: Do tons of research and look up guides if you are new to Wakfu. If you are a veteran, then jump right in.New player perspective: 3/10			"

Hu? What's that? Oh, its seems Iop want his class gameplay backAbout 3/4 of classes are like this.I've played sooooo many hours on dofus, got exited with wakfu release, then all my hopes were crushed one by one after each update.Yes, you have many classes.Yes, its f2p (The only advantage by paying per month is bonus like x2 exp... so its not pay2win).Yes, its turn based game mmo (Quite rare).But no, the class balance is really broken with some of them.As a veteran of ankama games, i can't recommend it.As a player perspective, i will recommend it with a little shrug.PS: Don't be fooled by the 17.2 hours, i've played about ~70 hours when it was not on steam			"

												A charming game - initially.Cash shop is more cosmetic than gameplay - except for boosters to xp and drops.Combat is a plus , its highly tactical , full of MANY skills  with a broad array of tactics to use depending on the skills you choose to develop. Many different stats affect gameplay.There are no NPC's. Players will have to barter or trade for any ingame currency. This can be a blessing or a curse depending how it is implemented in a game and how a games economy is setup. In wakfu , this is a curse.Wakfu suffers from an extraordinarily handicapped economic system. There is a central auction house however most things cost 1-20 / ea , ingame currency. If those things are even listed. It is cavernously empty most of the time. Many items run 20,000 - 20,000,000. Prices vary wildly , not because of some economic principle , but because there is a large glut of equipment left over from those whom are ""Leeched"" through most of the games levels to level 105 by already established guilds. If your a new players who does not wish to interact with or play marco polo trying to discover who the major guilds are - Good luck.  The player base is sharply divided between old veteran players (commanding in some instances hundreds of millions of ingame currency) , whom are largely silent and meandering new players who dont seem to understand what todo or where togo and whom appear to be largely confused.Leveling is fun ....... the first 50 times you encounter mobs.  Once you realize exactly how much grinding is entailed you begin to understand the presence of xp pots in the ingame item mall - and why new players are encouraged simply to quit the game if they cant find an active guild which they can tag along with during higher end repetitive runs. Seriously , I was told this several times.  Respec'ing your character? Is considered an act of god in this game. An occassion so special that it requires no less than 1400 items spread across 8 different mob types which must be killed to gather at a pace of about 1-3 per encounter (Not kidding). Even THIS can only be done every 30 days.  Act of god? Or act of marketing? You decide.  Oh and if your a new player - you can expect these encounters to last anywhere from 5-10 mins , EACH.   For a game as complex as wakfu is with so many different tactics to try - to have such a choke hold on simply redistributing points you earned through gameplay is rediculous in the least in my opinion. It is clearly a money grabbing effort.  Almost no information is available for many of the classes , many posts date back to 2012 - some so far as 2011 - so one is never sure whether the information you are getting is upto date or not.  The game is updated semi-frequently however , going so far as to literally change the stats on sets of armor between updates***     Have fun with that!Despite all of this?  Im still playing it. Glutton for punishment? Likely.			"

												This game did and still has potential, however, a player driven economy and eco-system does not work well with low population servers. The only server with high population are the French servers. The level-200(cap) players are bored and the new players have no one to run dungeons with. The level and content gap between them is so hugh that most players end up quiting.The game is however free to play and definitely worth trying but not worth investing money in.			"

This is not a normal RPG. This is turned based. And when I was fighting I read what I was supose to do. They asked me to hide to avoid getting damaged by the chaos plants which is summoned by this strange mage. I managed to pass the first one. But then there was another.. The 2nd part there was less hiding spots. Also I stood behind a tree but it still damaged me. I was like -.- there is too many chaos plants. Then I died it says if i wanted to reappear but just now I died trying to fight the first one beacuse idk what to do and I clicked I wanted to reappear it sends me back to spawn. So I didn't want to fight the first guy again so I waited for 3 minutes. Nothing happened... So I though its done so I clicked reappear.... And so I had to fight the first guy again. I was like you know what. THIS GAME IS TOO HARD.420/666not illuminati enuff			"

												This game is terrible. Think of the worst aspects of The Old Republic F2P along side the grindiest bits of the original Ragnarok online and you have Wakfu.Unless you pay money you earn half as much exp and constantly lose items, that they blatently flaunt stealing from you in the exp window after combat labeled ""PREMIUM REWARDS"". Thats not all! Theres a P2W element in the mix too! There as sidekicks which are additional party members that you control. They give you one free one, but he has only 3 attacks and is always weaker than single mobs of the same level, meanwhile they sell a wide variety of sidekicks that have about 5 attacks along side passives and a higher stat climb and you can use multiple at the same time. Thats all along side what appears to be a level buying option in the store labeled ""Class change 1-200"". Thus ends the money section, onto the bad systems.The crafting system is a hilariously bad joke, requiring a ludicrious amount of materials for even low level recipes, to the point where you will out level anything you are trying to make before you can get the mats and the skill level to craft it. Also, pretty much all the crafts require you to use something you make using early mats even way back into the later levels, which means grinding low level herbs and picking cat hair ro make that leather you need off level 1 mobs at level 50.The dungeons aren't terrible, they have about 3 fights in them that rise slowly till the final boss, but the grouping mechanic doesn't work. I ♥♥♥♥ed with it for a full 15 minutes before giving up. From what I can tell people put up requests to do a dungeon or quest and people can ....

												This game is terrible. Think of the worst aspects of The Old Republic F2P along side the grindiest bits of the original Ragnarok online and you have Wakfu.Unless you pay money you earn half as much exp and constantly lose items, that they blatently flaunt stealing from you in the exp window after combat labeled ""PREMIUM REWARDS"". Thats not all! Theres a P2W element in the mix too! There as sidekicks which are additional party members that you control. They give you one free one, but he has only 3 attacks and is always weaker than single mobs of the same level, meanwhile they sell a wide variety of sidekicks that have about 5 attacks along side passives and a higher stat climb and you can use multiple at the same time. Thats all along side what appears to be a level buying option in the store labeled ""Class change 1-200"". Thus ends the money section, onto the bad systems.The crafting system is a hilariously bad joke, requiring a ludicrious amount of materials for even low level recipes, to the point where you will out level anything you are trying to make before you can get the mats and the skill level to craft it. Also, pretty much all the crafts require you to use something you make using early mats even way back into the later levels, which means grinding low level herbs and picking cat hair ro make that leather you need off level 1 mobs at level 50.The dungeons aren't terrible, they have about 3 fights in them that rise slowly till the final boss, but the grouping mechanic doesn't work. I ♥♥♥♥ed with it for a full 15 minutes before giving up. From what I can tell people put up requests to do a dungeon or quest and people can ....

												My review will simply be about things I wish people had told me before I clicked 'install' on this:1.) THERE ARE NO VENDERS TO SELL JUNK TO. Too much junk? Throw it on the ground. Click 'Ok' on popup. Did it have a little hammer icon on it? Whoops, looks like it was needed to craft some crap somehow. No big deal, was probably 1 of 90 of the item needed.2.) GOOD LORD THERE IS A LOT OF CRAFT GRINDING. Let's say you wanted to wanted to make a 'Ham Sandwich' so you got +2% damage for 15 minutes (in a turn-based game). In WoW, you'd butcher some mobs and buy some salt and then cook over a fire pit and *BAM* 'Ham Sandwich' ... but not Wakfu. Nope. Go grind mining until you mine raw salt, make 3 raw salt into ""Refined Salt' and then go out in the field and skin some mobs for meat. Hope you leveled skinning! Go farming for wheat. Make 3x wheat into flour. Draw some water. Bake the bread. Cook the Sandwich. Each of those skills, the Mining, Skinning, Farming, Baking, Cooking... are all separate skills with a METRIC TON of grind and there's a FAILURE CHANCE as you're crafting. ALL THAT FOR A SANDWICH BUFF THAT WILL BE OVER IN 1-2 COMBATS. Since there's no vendor to sell crap to once you're done, you either throw it on the AH (Governor sets a tax!) and it come down after 24 hours or you put that trash right on the ground because your bags are full.3.) SPACE FOR ALL THE MATERIALS. There's no low-end bag vendor. You get two quest bags early on, but you'll fill up soon and the ""You're too full"" popups always have a ""Are you sure?"" annoyance chaser. Nobody makes low-end bags on the Auction House, so you're left stumbling through a horrible crafting system. Often, you'll need stuff from Tailor, Tanner, AND Armor crafting lines to get an item made... and the next upgrade will need you to make 3x-10x more of those AND use dungeon boss drops. Don't forget the failure chance! Or you can spend $1USD on 9-slot bags or $3-$10 on bank slots.This game could easily be the MMO equivalent of a 'F-ville' game. You can walk anywhere without being attacked and just grind material collection. This could honestly be the best Mother & Son, Farming & Killing crossover game of all time... but that'd be such a rare niche thing to hit. If this was Steam Market-able, then you could play the game with all sorts of loot and then sell it or trade it on the market once you'd decided it was way to grinding and directionless... but you can't. Meanwhile, Ankama totally wants you to spend $10 on character pimping, $10 on functional stuff, and then $6 every 30 days on a 'booster pack' for XP boost and access to subscriber content.The last thing I can say is about the class I played. Sram. I HATED the character design of the Sram, but it did what I wanted. I hate, Hate, HATE the character design. It's a stupid sugar skull design tattoo'ed on a WoW troll, complete with troll witch-doctor hat. But you may think ""Well, weren't there cosmetic outfits or at least armor for characters?"" Well yes. But all the other characters have on short-shorts or just panties, so 99% of the outfits are designed to leave the legs bare. The stupid Sram is in a bone-print onesie, which bleeds through every outfit but one. And there's no reason given! None! There's no ""Oh, they have to wear this crap or their souls won't go to Sramville!"" ... it's just ""We didn't make pant-armor in the game so nothing ever covers that up?""			"

That's your fault for not closing the previous connection when disconnecting me.Let's try one more time, choose realm... black screen. Stuck.

												So, well, I might not be in the best position to rate this game, but when you have to spend ungodly amounts of time finding free spots to plant monsters because the game wasn't made to accomodate more than a few players, you are bound to lose the players who refuse to spend the first hour of their game time running around doing nothing but wait.I haven't played anything but the intro, so this is in no way something that should be regarded as a ""the game sucks"" post, but I'm just saying, a game which has no idea how to accomodate several players probably has more of these faults than would be acceptable.Perhaps in a year or so, when they realize how to make games for more than 1 player at the time it will be worth coming back.

												Seems to be alright. There aren't enough games in the same style as Final Fantasy tactics.However, this game seems to be one of those that is rather selective in where it plays.As several other people exclaimed, this game does not even start after clicking the shortcut on Desktop. On my end, my PC even froze up and stopped responding until I hard-reset'd it.I'd have loved to test it, but no game is worth it having my PC freeze up for an undetermined amount of time.			"

												The game was ok when it first came out I've sunk hundreds of hours into it but with each new patch comes new bugs and suprisingly enough the issues i had when i first started playing are still around today such as immense lag. The delay in my text appearing on screen is almost 5 minutes long you dont want to know what its like in a battle.I don't have these issues in any other games other then wakfu even their prior game Dofus which has been around for 10 years isnt laggy. How this got on Steam i will never know.They keep bringing out more new cool things with each update but never actually work on the current issues not to mention their customer service is absolutley shocking. Countless threads have been made in the forum regarding issues with the game and they have gone unheard or simply ignored for YEARS! There is an issue that every person has ingame where they will start to freeze up at around the 3 hour mark of playing if not sooner. But as ankama doesnt bother fixing this long time running issue the players see it as a normal thing and actually accept that they have to restart their client every hour or two just to keep playing.. What if your in a high level dungeon and all of a sudden start experiencing these freezes. I know for a fact my guildmates have become frustrated to the point where they quit as have I.I came back to check it out as I saw it was on Steam but I am very dissapointed.The game has picked up in popularity due to its Steam release but alas I still think its not worth the time invested, As like me you will get a high(ish) level character invest money in the game and then it slaps you in the face and becomes unplayable.Also purchase Ogrines at your own risk there are multiple reports of people not recieving their Paid for Currency and as Ankama take so long to reply you may be waiting over a week to hear back.. I literally yesterday recieved a response to a ticket I posted LAST YEAR!			"

												I have played this game since close beta, about 2 years ago maybe?, then open beta, and then pretty much for a year.As some reviews say, and they are right, the worst enemy of the game is Ankama itself. It changes core features of the game with patches, and patches are common; it changes classes, changes skills, items, most of the times it makes them all obsolete.I remember playing a sacrier back then when the game got ""full"", i spent months building him tank, a lot of months and time, the GRIND... What happened next? Ankama decided to nerf every skill of the Earth Sacrier... ok, so i can live with that... what happened next? There was ONLY ONE BOSS that COULD USE an Earth Sacrier that was build IN ONLY ONE WAY... so i was obsolete/useless. Pretty much 8 months wasted.I dont even want to start with the loot.The Game Art its beautiful, lovely, i really like it. The gameplay, is good, sometimes the fights are intense. Some fights can change with just a blink, you may thought you already won the fight, but then something happens, like a critical, and it changes everything. It can improve drastically, it can learn from really good RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics, but overall its ok.Classes balances where ok back then, but as i said, Ankama HATES this game and its players.I encourage you to try the game because it has A LOT of potential, and hope someday Ankama dies, Square Enix dies, and a good developer gets its hand on it. Sorry i dont want to offend anyone from those companys.			"

												I played this game when it was on the open beta.The game was fun, addicting and crowded.Now its left with hacks, bots, scammers and a few dedicated players who somewhat manage to go through the game remake which in my opinion, was the coup de grace on this game.The game has already very few skills and combos, like 3 elements for each class, 4 skills for each element and a class passive related skills, in a total of 16 skills, from lvl 1 to 200, the same over and over again.But now, its like 8 skills, including the passives.Plus, since its release, there was no new classes added, barely a new contect now and then, must of the stuff are cash content, and prepare your mind to the grindfest. GL with that, i ain't playing this crap again. "

												This game is virtually unplayable.  I admit I only tried it for about an hour but it was so bad that was all I could take.  The U.I. seems like it was designed by someone who has suffered a traumatic head injury.  The pace was glacial and even with climate change this is not fast.  I suppose that some people will probably like it but then again some people like 'Two Girls One Cup' as well.  Try it but I think the only result will be another scathing review on Steam.			"

												WAKFU is an amazing game about wandering around a fantasy landscape and murdering countless cats, chickens, and sheep until you realize what skills are. There are 15 unique class/race/mishmashes in WAKFU, but the only one worth using is the Blue Loli class, for they are the only ones who can harness the raw power of sheep. WAKFU features a beautiful selection of gorgeous armors, like sheep armor, and spiky sheep armor. Overall, I would recommend WAKFU to anyone who is a fan of sheep.10/10 it's like Skyrim with Guns - IGN9.5/10 Masterul Story - Metacritic8/8 m8 I r8 this b8 a perfect 8 no h8 - That guy in my English Class			"

												The anime for this game is great and explains a lot about the lore and class' but the game is far more difficult than what it lets on to be.First off the game is loaded with bugs and not the kind that can help the player early game.Secondly the begining quests are a tad bit far apart in levels as when i got to level 5 they sent me on a level 10 quest.Honestly this game could use a lot of work but how it is now i cannot reccomend it to anyone unless they enjoy mindless level grinding after each quest.On a more personal note that i do not let spoil my reviews; i hate games that let you customize your stats each and every level rather than the game just giving you whats balanced as to me that says the developer got lazy with the game			"

For my review for this game...-fun-amazing characters selection-exploration-grind-costumes-mounts-spells and attacksHowever my biggest issue is THE LAGGNESS OF THIS GAME! Please, my internet connection is fine and I had to put my graphics low, low as possible. Still lags. Died in almost every important battles because of it. Please add in the lower graphics, maybe add in more servers to keep the lag at ease. Thank you. "

												The game is fun but there were some annoying bugs. There was a mission to harvest seed from plants, I think I had to harvest 20 to get 3 seeds. Any other harvesting quest at that point had a 100% drop rate even outside the tutorial. I also got stuck in the end of a combat when the enemies fled after the event was over. Bugs apart: you SHOULD be able to rotate camera and use xbox controller. But that is not possible and will not be implemented from what I read on the forums.			"

												Do not bother with this piece of trash. I know this comes off as incredibly negative review but I was trying to curb my frustration with this game for the simple reason that I REALLY wanted to like this game. The genre is SO rare to find a good version of it that isn't plagued by utter stupidity.The BIGGEST and most SACRELIGIOUS issue with this game is the TIMER. Don't EVER make a tactics game with a timer. There's NEVER a reason to do this and it just rushes things.Now ... this wouldn't have been such a massive issue if it wasn't for the fact that everything is SO hard to understand. The translations aren't HORRIBLE, but the descriptions are rather ... vague and subpar. They make figuring out how abilities work and effect function more trial and error than actual reading and understanding. Which is made harder by a short turn timer.Then you have an opening tutorial that does nothing to grease new players into the game. This will be a grindy game, from beginning to end. And in all the weirdest ways. Grinds in the typical ways of course too, but weird ways like forcing yourself to learn a new game that fights against you because the genre is so promising and the like.It's very painful to see such a pretty game turn me away because of simple, outright, horrible execution. I sometimes wonder after playing a game like this .... Do these people even play their own game?			"

This is by far the worst game as it takes to long to understand how to play the game. Also everyone on the game is soo small!!			"

												Only other MMORPG I quit within ten minutes besides Vindictus. Wakfu looks nice, it sounds nice (Except for the ""voices""), but this game is just real boring and the combat is dull. Then again I've been spoiled by Dungeon Fighter Online, and that game delivers the action packed fast paced fighting I thirst for, while Wakfu is like playing a weird mix of Ragnarok Online and Final Fantasy Tactics, but nowhere near as appealing as either.

												Wakfu is a turn-based MMORPG, with a great variety of characters and builds, and a heavy dose of grinding.I found the first hour enjoyable, but the tutorial leaves a lot to the imagination, and there is a steep learning curve when entering the actual game.My main problem with the game is the combat system. In combat, there is a timer for every action, and when you're a new player, obviously you want to read what all your spells do and what your enemies are weak against, read passive buffs/de-buffs, etc. But the timer is way too short to do any of that, and seeing as you have enough action points to complete multiple attacks/spells in a go, it is a rush to complete your turn.Secondly, the combat area is split into tiles/squares, each one accounting for 1 movement/range. Now, when casting a spell or attacking an enemy, you have to ensure that you have clear line of sight to the target, and that they are within range - which means, inside of the minimum and maximum range.When you move your character, as there are often so many obstacles on the map, it is really hard to tell whether you will be able to attack the enemy with a spell, from the tile you are moving to. This means, if you are playing a spellcaster (and all characters have spells), you may sometimes waste a whole turn just trying to stand in a position where the enemy is in range.There is also no basic 'attack'. You can't just hit someone. Your basic attack is determined by the weapon you are holding, and the weapon will have a predetermined attack range and attack area. For example, in the tutorial you receive an axe, this weapon attacks three squares around your character in a big sweeping motion, and if you have an ally nearby, the ally will take damage from the swing.Basically, the combat is too complicated to have a timer, the tile system seems quite broken, and the information needed to make the learning curve less steep, is not very accessible. The tutorial itself was of no help when coming to the actual game.			"

												I love the game to bits, however it is impossible for new players or low level players to have fun. This is due to the large amount of KOS players there are camping bonta port ( the main route for getting between regions and actually experiencing the rest of the game) Additinally there is major flaws with the combat system which results in sidekicks vanishing but still taking turns, characters not being seen cos they are at the edge of the map (the camera can never be moved in combat, you can only scroll in and out)yes you can 'turn off pvp' but that doe not prevent people from KOS when you reach a new region because you automatically become an outlaw. just because you had the audacity to choose a different region to live in........there are many more issues with this game like classes being far too over powered( a lvl 65 getting their butt kicked by a lvl 60 that has 1000 more hp and more attack??????)Sort your game out before you release it please! (oh and maybe instead of fine tuning class abilities to ever % you should actually try to fiix the main mechanics of your game. aswell as your servers, being dissconnected for no reason is a pain.......)

Quests are varied and in depth, there's a voting system on who's in charge, different areas, dungeons and so on. You can even team up with other players for better item drops and more xp. When animals and plants are killed/harvested, you need to replant them, teaching the player how to look after and keep the ecosystem in check.

												One of the biggest WTFs I came accross, these graphics brought me so many nightmares. This game has a pretty unique turn based, tactical gameplay. But that's all unique and good stuff in it. It's just boring cause making over and over the same stuff can't be exciting. Oh and it's giving me low performance, a 2D game with no graphics at all. I used to laugh but then I just deleted it. Maybe I just don't like MMOs anymore but that one really made me to get back to fps games.			"

												Alright, I haven't invested too much time into Wakfu thus far and I can't say I want to eithier. I picked this game 'cause it  seemed like it might've been fun. It seemed like it would be different from most mmo's, or at least that was my impression, and I was right. Sorta. To start with, there are a reasonable number of classes to pick from. Although the brief descripions left me a little unsure as to what classes were actually effective in a fight. Although I've seen a bit of plot kicking around, I wasn't entirely sure what it was nor could I be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to find out. The battles were kinda fun for the first two or three before the tedium set in. That was mainly because while there were a bunch of skills they only level up when you use them. Which meant that you'd only wind up using a couple that were strong enough to actually do anything. Even then I found that enemies I fought that were something I could techincally beat, especially in matches of 1v3 or more, I'd still have my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me. So either I'm terrible at tactics in a general sense, which I can't entirely deny, or I'm just finding all of the battles meant to be fought with other people. So to put all that in one sentence, Wakfu could actually be fun later on but I'm not willing to invest the time that seems necessary to get there.			"

												This game looks perfect, what I really wanted to play.

Hopefully, the developers either 1. Fix the ""Bug"" (?) or 2. Update the game.			"

I really love this game but there must fix some things for players, to be more fun to play, ore u play solo game, and u will stop playing it cuz there isnt anythink what u can done. only farm minions ore do crafting, becouse u cant ride dungeons.

												Despite the reviews, I decided to try this game. Looks allright, music is fine, but I didn't much care for the gameplay.There are several attacks you can do, and hovering over them with the mouse shows what they do. But that's not a short line of text telling me how much damage they do, no, it's a 12 page monstrosity full of abbreviations I don't recognize with tons of numbers that mean really nothing to me. Also the numbers aren't correct, an attack that is supposed to do 6 damage just does 3, and other mistakes like that.Some items in the terrain 'guard' you, because they form a barrier between you and an enemy, which means that you can't attack because there's something in the way, but also the other way around, the tutorial tells you you're safe there yourself as well.Except that's not true. It's true that my attack can't reach the enemy, but the enemy still beats my *** up.I think the attack 'system' is way too complicated. They've tried to come up with something unique, well, it is, but not in a good way.			"

												This game is absolutely awful. It is, without doubt, one of the worst things to ever hit the internet. I won't even go in to how ABSURDLY unintuitive it is, or how awful the entire sound scheme is. I'll just focus on this one, glaring, point that makes this game completely not worth it.There is a tutorial mission, that will two-shot you. I understand what I am supposed to do. It's teaching you about Line of Sight, and how to avoid damage. Here's the thing though, the punishment is somewhere in the area of 15 damage, when you've got about 60 HP at this point. This is horrendous. You make a few mistakes, and you're dead. And I'll be honest, that isn't even THAT awful, but the line of sight for the attacks isn't SHOW to you! You have to run a gauntlet to an enemy, and you have FOUR chances to mess up. It's trial and error at the most ABSURD level. Your reward for finally getting to the end of the gauntlet? You get to do it again, in an even LESS defined map. It's stupid. It's awful.If the tutorial was this horribly put together, then the game as a whole can't possibly be much better.Oh and the kicker, at this point, you're not even allowed to be in a party to get help from somebody. In an MMO, they don't allow you to be in a party.An MMO...where you can't party. Can I stress that enough?Save your time, avoid this awful excuse for a game.			"

												FEELIN WEEBY? If so this is your kind of chinese cartoon. While the game provides a vast variety of krill dice, I don't believe it really fulfills that feeling in our heart of positive stuff. Sure it has grass, bass, and a decent lass, but in the end do you really feel like having a dance with the ice mice? It really doesn't suffice as a vice. Feeling the euros pouring out of your pouch yet? Sure the movie has some free blocks but the experience will never be truly had unless you put your dinky in the cd-drive. This game is a game and should be treated as such but a review is not a review unless it is one. So go and make the choice do you want to feel it? Do you want to experience the decree that is peace? No. There is non. Make a choice and decipher the vent do what you want but stay away from my fedora bud.			"

												Although this game has been littered with poorly written positive reviews that tell you NOTHING about this game I'm going to give you an honest review of what it's like to download this game, jump in, find your feet and then play *actual* content.First of all, the tutorial is *okay*. It definitely doesn't need to be adjusted content wise. However, this game is over filling with broken English so DO NOT EXPECT the tutorial to help you in any deep sense; you learn this game by guessing and learning from your mistakes. It is NOT an 'intuitive' game and I've met many players higher level then me who didn't know basic stradegies that I learnt early on. Many as in several. As in 7 other players who considered themselves amazing.Secondly, finding your feet is an awful experience. If you're a stranger to turn-based gameplay GIVE UP NOW. You're tossed into this enormous world filled with options but absolutely no sense of purpose or direction. To begin with, it can be SO immense that quiting IMMEDIATELY was a considered option. ""Why should I even bother with all this CRAP?"". You learn  your own way and you creative your own incentive, which works excellently later in the game but early game it's a miserable experience. After you find your feet and get the rythm of the game it BEGINS to become amusing enough to be considered a video game. So prepare for a pretty bitter beginning phase.Lastly, the in game content itself... So I've tried not to make the same mistake I've made on other MMOs. I've avoided the ""grind my character to max and then quit"" attitude and instead have be working on leveling up all my professions with my main level to make the game much more interesting. In fact, there has been some real ""shining moment"" inside Wakfu that no other game has come close to fulfilling. I mean there was a point where I was mining, skinning, farming and fighting all in my own little area and it was AWESOME FUN... to begin with. Now every bit of storage I have is totally and utterly filled with essential crafting resources all of which have an enormous amount of units (400+ thistle, 500 wood, etc) so dropping IS NOT AN OPTION. I tried to combat this technical issue by crafting bags but the developers seem to have not considered that new players may want to try crafting as well; only assuming that you're clearly a high leveled player with tonnes of bag space because you poked enough fat mobs to have a full set of maxed capacity bags. I needed to gather 6 Royal Feathers from a very easy and low level dungeon. I ran that dungeon over 250 times over 2 days at my maximum speed. After all of that ... 5 feathers. Oh and a quest that will take 10 off of me. So really now I need 16. I am NOT willing to be put through such a f**k around for low level content, get real you idiots. Try PLAYING YOUR GAME instead of theorizing crap that works. ""Ohh 16 feathers isn't much in theory""... WRONG. Wrong. Wrong. It's TOO much and has wasted over 16 hours of my life. For the dungeons themselves, they're *okay*. You fight the same mobs you come against in the world and then eventually a boss with much more HP and stats then normal. There is very little feedback to add to such a generic system. It works fine? That's all I can say. But! If you're with a friend and your friend lags out or DC's then expect a 40 second skirmish to last longer then 15 minutes (which is bloody insane to sit through) because the game will CONSTANTLY ""wait"" for the player for minute intervals even if the dungeon and game itself has acknowledge the player not only leaving but being offline.Overall, you're basically fighting the game the entire way through JUST to enjoy small parts of it.Long story short: play something else because you'll quit most likely faster then I did.

												SOOO Boring, generic and slow. I couldn't stay awake long enough to even get past the dozens of tutorials that it takes miles to even walk betwee. Basically the game is kill bunnies and plant seeds. I might have a good time if there was some action once in a while, but if you love to read paragraphs of ""backstory"" text about generic events by generic characters with even more generic names, then this is the game for you.

												This game is dead. Don't waste your money on it, it's not worth it. I played the beta and now I saw it was on Steam so I installed it. Sadly, nobody's playing it anymore, Nox (my server) was empty, and so was the market. I think french servers are still active, but I can't choose it because I don't live in France, what is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I would love to give it a good review because this game has full of potential, the graphics, the music, etc, but right now, Wakfu is dead.			"

												Ingredients2 large eggsSalt and pepper2 to 3 tablespoons shredded cheese (optional)1/4 to 1/2 cup filling, pre-cooked if necessary (optional)2 teaspoons unsalted butterMinced parsley, to garnish (optional)EquipmentMixing bowlWhisk8-inch nonstick skilletSpatulaDinner plateInstructions1. Whisk the eggs: Crack both eggs into a mixing bowl. Whisk the eggs until completely combined, and season with salt and pepper. If you\'re adding cheese or other fillings, make sure they are prepped and nearby.2. Warm the skillet and melt the butter: Place an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Tilt the skillet as the butter melts to evenly coat the bottom. When the butter stops sizzling, the pan is heated and ready.3. Pour the eggs into the skillet: Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Immediately tilt the pan so the eggs coat the entire bottom. The eggs should sizzle on contact; if not, continue cooking, but remember to heat the pan a little longer next time.4. Drag and push the eggs to form waves: Use a spatula to gently drag and push the cooked eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan, making space for the uncooked eggs and forming waves in the omelette. Tilt the skillet so that the uncooked eggs flow into the open spaces.5. Cook the omelette for 1 to 2 minutes: The omelette will finish cooking in 1 to 2 minutes. When done, the bottom will be set and the edges will look crisp. The top of the omelette should still look fairly wet and uncooked, but there will no longer be any loose, easily flowing liquid egg — the omelette will continue cooking off the heat, so finish when you think the top still seems a bit underdone.6. Top with cheese and fillings: If using, sprinkle the cheese and fillings down the center of the omelette.7. Fold the omelette: Fold the bottom third of the omelette over the center, and then fold the top third down. Alternatively, fold the omelette in half.8. Slide the omelette onto a plate: Gently slide the omelette onto a plate and garnish with parsley. Eat right away while still hot.			"

												I saw this game on steam and was like ""Hey, the reviews don't sound too bad"". And then I started it...First let me tell you, I'm not a fan of strategy RPGs, where you have to position your character and such. Maybe this clouds my judgement, maybe not.I opened the game, and had the choice to do just the tutorial after a few MB downloading (which is a pretty nice feature!). I then proceeded to wait for the game to finish loading. Since it took more than a minute, I just restarted it. And it loaded instantly. Then I had to give my acoount a name. Well, seems like ""God"" is forbidden in your account name. The game doesn't tell you however. It just tells you ""This name is forbidden"". Nothing more, nothing less. After a few tries I finally found out, that ""God"" isn't allowed, so I took something else. The game asks me if I want to play the tutorial. I did, and I regret it. In the tutorial you are asked to gather and plant seeds. Gathering is easy, but the planting... Imagine a field full of flowers and quite a few spots with just grass on them. You can only plant seeds on grass obviously. The game thinks so too... or not. ""The area is full"", ""Ecosystem: bla bla, try killing some monsters"" are the messages I get. Well, ok. Let's kill a monster. The game doesn't give you an option to do so though.  Tired of this, I deleted my character, so I could pick the name again. And finally could play it, after ignoring all the bugs (also ignoring the fact, that no sound played, another bug).The classes seem to be fine and fun. I have only tried one class, however. So I guess I can't really tell much about it. The GUI seems pretty nice. Big screen, almost nothing on it. I guess that's pretty good, I missed the minimap though (Dunno if you can activate it somehow). Finding out, how the ""Quest Compass"" works, I finished a few quests and leveled up. The game yet again tells me something ""Don't forget to spend your points!"", or something like that. However, this is only something you can do on level 5 and later on, because then you unlock something, where you can actually spend points on leveling up.After finally reaching level 5, I decided to stop playing. I still don't know how I level skills or how I even get them. The game doesn't tell me either.Maybe if the game fixes some of the bugs, I will give it another go. But as of now, I can't recommend it due to the bugs and the innovative GUI.			"

												I couldn't even make it past the tutorial because it bugged out on me. (Gather seeds. Nothing happens when you gather enough.) I have no patience for a game that's been out for years and still fails on what's supposed to be the very first impression for a new player.As for you biased feedbackophobic fanboys who can't stand any kind of criticism whatsoever so you just immediately thumb literally all negative reviews down, please note that they're asking if you think the review is HELPFUL, not whether or not you agree with it. Not like there's anything to disagree with here because you can't really argue that the tutorial isn't bugged. Telling people that the tutorial is bugged is very helpful. Just going, ""This game is good/bad"" is not.			"

												I downloaded this today and really enjoyed it.  Very unique to see a turn based MMO and I absolutely loved the combat.  Lots of different types of enemies and interesting set of skills to use.  Im not far into the game but I found the story to be interesting, the gameplay very enjoyable and there were quite a few people playing online and of the few that I talked to they all said they love the game.  Also worth noting that I had no issues at all with performance as has been put forward by other people.  My laptop is average at best as well and no issues at all.  Not saying others are lying but just my experience was fine.  The game did take a good 10 minutes to start though on 1st launch due to updates. The game world is absolutely huge.  Loads of different islands/counties, gorgeous artwork, engaging combat system and so much replayability with 13 different classes.Now for what I wasnt so keen on.  The timer on the combat system.  I actually think its a great idea, expecially for PVP so people dont take forever but I think when you are learning the game it should be disabled.  You only get 30 seconds to make your moves and when you dont know the game or what different buffs and debuffs are in play I found myself paniking at times which doesnt suit the relaxing nature of the game.  Like I say great idea but I think it should only apply for level 10.  I then started to get confused by the crafting.  To the point that I turned it off.  So many professions and things to craft that I found it daunting.  Im not going to give up though.  The game has interested me enough to do some reading up on the subject on the forums.I think this game has potential to take over my life if I allow it. If turn based games in a fantasy MMO setting interests you then i strongly advise you to give this a go.			"

												A really great game that very few people have heard about. It has a unique style of combat in the MMO-verse: turn-based. The good thing is, it's pretty quick considering the turn-based nature of it. The community seems pretty good, maybe a bit on the younger side of things (majority under 25 is my guess), but that's not been a negative for me (almost 30). For those who are inclined to get deep into the game, there is a political system for each of the four nations, as well as an in-depth weather system that ties into the ecosystem for each nation.The graphics are totally awesome; it has a top-down view, similar to that of Ultima Online or Dark Ages (Nexon).It's definitely worth a go if you're looking for something free and detailed.

												game is quite fun. you can hang around in astrub and yell out slurs all you want as long as you don't bypass the filter,enemies you find are always unique and weird to see,treechnid dungeon is amazing because it is based on hentai,people are usually friendly and finding the right guild is never out of the question,and most importantly noone knows your level. so you can have a lvl 3 talk♥♥♥♥♥♥to a lvl 100 and get the lvl 100 to back down. it is the most funny and amazing thing to see though it is quite rare to see and they may call your bluff.cons-game is a bit laggy and buggythe grind is realprofessions are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to lvl upthere are certain bugs that annoy the hell out of you. so far i only have seen the bugs in astrub.eliotrops need a total rework on all their spells. (havent seen the new update for 23rd of july yet)overall, talk♥♥♥♥♥♥all you want no one knows your level and have fun hanging out with people. the grind is real but the people you play with make it all the more fun.

												Actually, when I downloaded the game I though I wouldn't like it, as I don't quite like the turn-based strategical combat, but I was incredibly surprised how fun the game turned out to be. I still didn't play much, as I just started, but I have to say that the game is HUGE in every possible way and offers lots of possiblilities. The community is the nicest I've ever met and the graphics are beautiful, too.Now, it's even better if you like the animated series :DCompletely recommended for everyone to try, even he he usually doesn't like this type of games.

												I'm honestly torn how to rate this game. Love the community, hate the developers. Beautiful art too!My opinions are based off of roughly May, 2015. Some of this may have changed. Most probably hasn't.--History, Positives about the game--I played the title since beta v0.2 and loved the class system, was intrigued by the ""no NPCs"" rule (except territory masters), LOVED that original crafting system, and LOVED the open (grid based) world where you could plant resources anywhere you wanted or cut everything down! >:D However, everything was in French. I learned a lot of French.Then they remade it (beta v0.3) with English support. I kept playing but the crafting system was replaced with a typical gather-craft grind. Still great open-world sandbox game. They added more classes so combat was more interesting, guilds developed. The community was super great, with a handful of ... inciting personalities.Time is getting muddled in my brain, but somewhere in there we reached full 12 (then 13, then 14...) classes, Wakfu ""left beta"", it was released on Steam, EA signed on to manage the North American server, quests developed, guilds developed even further, and much more area, mechanics, and equipment were added into the game. Good things.--Drawbacks--However, I have never been part of a game where the developers were more sluggish in responding to the people.Patches come once a month at best. Sometimes three months pass without a change. Then BOOM everything is changed, a few barely noticable hotfixes in the days that follow, then, silence.They have a terrible tendency to balance a class around PvP OR PvE. Never both. (Also, huge favortism with developers and certain classes they work on. Trying to outdo one another?)Classes have gone unbalanced for AGES and developers would rather wait years to remake the class entirely rather than tune some numbers. Sometimes these class changes completely gut the core identity of a class.Example time!Eniripsas (healers, my preferred main) went TWO YEARS with both a mechanic that made healing more effective (by flat bonus per spell) and less effective (by scaled percentage) in long fights. Two mechanics that fought each other.They didn't tune numbers. They didn't get rid of the passive that was the issue. They took the power of the class (extending fights) and made it impossible to do so because a good healer couldn't die in 1v1 pvp fights.A completely wrong reaction to a legitimate problem. SELF heals could have been nerfed at any time.Xelors were (are?) the time-mage class. They focus on removing your enemies ability to use as many skills on their turn. However, certain PvE bosses came out and Xelors could keep them from doing any damage.So, first they made a stacking resist occur every time Xelors were successful. ON ALL MONSTERS AND PLAYERS. (Whats the point of being punished for doing your classes job?) They later made those same PvE bosses immune to AP loss and increased both the max AP and spell cost and thus rendered the point moot, yet kept the scaling resist on everything else.But I digress...A rock-paper-scissors PvP system where there are 3-4 reigning classes at any one time, each with 0-2 classes it just cannot fight and win.A confusing swap from solo play being the focus, to full group of six players being the only way to get good experience, back to allowing solo players to fake the group dynamic with bought upgrades.--Summary--All in all I had some good times playing Wakfu with a huge guild (shoutout to Kamaradery!). The wonder of it wore off and I realized the mismanagement of the game.So, this game will entertain you and can bring you a lot of fun. Until you experience most of the content and start waiting for the developers. Then, only sadness.I truly wish the best for Wakfu in the future because it has some amazing pieces that I want to see in other games. However, I dont think I can play it any more. The people that made it great have moved on and so should I.			"

												Started playing this in early beta, liked the concept and gameplay style but it was limited after the beta ended due to a subscription cost and other non-free to play elements. There are still micro-trasactions and other misc. real money items but none that are necessary for complete gameplay (as far as I have found). Quite a bit of grinding but it also gives a sense of progression. Combat is intricate and in depth, and with all of the classes and specializations/skill custimization allow for any approach to combat. One of my favorite MMO's now that it has been moved to steam and made free-to-play.			"

												Great game.... It offers players a REAL Free to play, as in not a pay to win, kind of game. The player can create any class with both genders, but one, that has its own role. The down side is that thier is only A healer race/class in the game, but heavy amounts of DPS on a few, since they sacrifice Defense for Power. Grinding takes time, dont have to do professions, but doing them adds to the moral outcome of your gear, which is farmed from either nature, or creatures. Heack even mining.... Players are friendly, but like in WoW, do not go to the sights that say you could buy Kama, its a way to get banned from not only the game, but Steam... And the classes and races all have different abilities, making them more, unique from others, Some shoot arrows, some charge in, some get drunk (Pandawa race), some do lottery, one is abunch of greedy elders... Many easter eggs, and awesome graphics, BEWARE PVP UNSTABLE!!!!!!!! 10000/10			"

												Dofus was the brainchild of Ankama, a unique and very imaginative strategy based MMO, y'know with the final fantasy tactics kind of gameplay. It featured a pretty huge world with unique enemies on nearly every zone and map, with many freaking dungeons to enter as a team of unique races, each with their own set of abilities that all contribute to your chances of clearing these dungeons.Wakfu is supposed to be the sequel MMO to the world of Dofus, the world is flooded because of Ogrest, an ogre who swallowed a dofus, which in dofus, was the most rare and expensive thing in the world of twelve.You can play 14 classes, same as in Dofus, each race has been graphically updated or changed a little.What wakfu did right is that it tried to create a world that was entirely run by its players, environments and even the 4 divided nations are still entirely run by players, with its own governors, vice governors, treasurer, eco protector, guards, soldiers, activity chiefs you name it. From the tree's to the monsters its all provided by the player themselves.which is also exactly why its greatest and most unique feature is also its worst.Imagine the average lazy♥♥♥♥♥MMO player destroying an entire ecosystem you as a player worked really hard to preserve within an hour? it actually costs money from the treasury (who you pay your taxes to) to patch up, annoying right?imagine an item on the market you want with incredibly high taxes to go with it.better vote for a different governor next time, what's that? You didn't know you could? Well you can!Every week or month (can't remember) there's elections for a new governor, even you can become one. With enough votes you'll win and you can put your own friends in charge of handling various government jobs in your nation.you can even declare WAR on the other nations and allow your nation's people to attack visitors from the other nations on sight.with this system though it's easily abused by guilds and stuff funneling their votes into a guild master or whatever, which is too bad. Combat is a little more fast paced which I find sad really. Bosses can be very fun to fight in a grup though.The classes themselves feel a little like dumbed down versions of their Dofus ancestors, you'll only be using maybe 6 or so abilities through your entire playthrough.It's still worth checking out as its free to play, and I still do recommend you play it. It's artstyle is incredibly nice.			"

												Ah wakfu, what can I say about this game that can't be limited to pros and cons? Not a lot, so we'll just do pros and consPros Unique gameplay Interesting lore Simple pet system Relatively friendly community Well made guild system Professions Wide variety to pick from class wise Playing more than one account is encouragedCons Boosters are needed to compete later levels Extremely grindy After the free resets the game gives you it is a huge pain to do a quest for resets P2w for days. The Steam client for this game isn't as good as the one you can get off the game site Holiday events are usually crap.  Bugs tend to not get fixed for months at a time  Neglectful devs are neglectfulBoth pro & conI had to include this because there are things in this game that really could be amazing if used correctly or actual work be put into them. Political system - corrupt as all hades, suggesting removing it until they put work on it Ecosystem - players tend to be the biggest problem with this, nobody wants to replant...ect... Forced pvp - You have to pvp to protect your nation for the most part but even if you aren't in a pvp mode anyone and their best friend can bum rush and kill you for no other reason then being a donkey. Class reworks - classes were nerfed so hard into the ground they have to rework all of them but hey atleast you get shiny new spells Cosemtics - Cosemtics are actually pretty cool and let you make your character look great. This is only the case if you don't spend real money, otherwise be prepared to pay $20 for a piece of crap you can't trade.Wakfu brings an interesting twist on turn based combat and MMORPGs. Try it, if you don't like it just delete it and never speak of the horrors mechanics again.TL;DR Don't download with steam if you want more than one account5/10 without booster 8/10 with "

												--Edit--As of the update to 1.43 myself as well as several other people I've talked to in-game have not been able to purchase the in-game currency for their shop (Ogrines). I attempted to report the issue to Ankama support but they were rude and dismissive, sending me to Steam support saying my account was being restricted per the ""Trading and Market Restrictions"" (found at https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1047-EDFM-2932 ).I forwarded them a screenshot of my purchase history and explained how this policy did not affect me based on my purchase history. They responded with this:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Please accept our sincerest apologies.However, we have already endorsed this case to a higher level of customer support. Unfortunately, they have made their decision and have stated it as final. Therefore, we are unable to reverse it or force a different outcome. We understand that decision is not according to your expectations.As per our previous message, we are unfortunately not able to provide you more assistance on this issue.For a breakdown of the new purchase restrictions enforced by Steam, they are as follows:+Steam accounts are not allowed any purchase unless they had a successful purchase older than 30 days but not older than 1 year.+The successful purchase (meaning the transaction was not cancelled or refunded) of wallet funds, games, DLCs and software meet this requirement.+Retail CD key activations and gift purchases do not meet this requirement and will not lift the purchase restrictions on a Steam account.Please opt to contact the Steam Customer Support for further assistance. Apologies for the inconvenience.Kind regards,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I will update this review whenever I get the problem solved, but as for now I am at my wits end. I cannot recommend the game until they show better commitment to solving (at least) paying customer's issues in a timely manner.--Edit End--I love this game. It's artwork is amazing, It has an almost entirely player driven world from the ecosystem to nations ruled by PCs. Wars are fought as much through ecoterrorism as face to face combat. There are a multitude of guilds which fill in gameplay between storyline quests (if the national dramas aren't enough!) The system can be a bit buggy as stated in previous reviews but no-where near the point where the game loses playability. It is turn-based but there is also a turn timer which keeps things moving fairly well. The classes don't quite use traditional roles (tank, dps, healer, ect.) per say. In many cases you CAN build your character to strictly fill one of these roles and you'll find tons of guides on the Ankama forums to help you do so. That being said, MOST classes you can build to fill one or two roles successfully or a well rounded solo character that has just as good playability and balance in a group filling a role.The game is great, it gets monthly updates, it blends with an anime that even further immerses you into the World of Twelve. And it's highly addictive. 10/10 all around. Give it a shot and you'll be hooked!			"

But if I were to be absolutely critical, this is my review:Wakfu is a strategy MMO with a battle system remniscent of games such as Final Fantasy Tactics. It features several unique classes, a world with a rich story and lore comparable to Warcraft's, and a fun, playful art style you could probably only find from a French game.Its parent company, Ankama, has recently put in a lot of work to developing the earlier game (levels 1-100, basically) but overall... you basically need to be social in order to have fun with this game. Without friends, without a guild, the grinding can get pretty boring pretty quick. Further, the community is small and the PVP a little under developed - a recipe for disaster. Overall, I would still recommend this game, but with a huge grain of salt. If you can get past the grinding, the ""highschool"" mentality of the social scene, and the dupers, its pretty fun!  FOR THE GLORY OF BRAKMAR!6.5/10, I guess.			"

												First of all most games that you can play these days are easy mode meaning it doesn't take much to get to the end game.  Most F2P games ask you to spend everything you have to get ahead, including the shirt on your back. This game isn't either. It takes a lot of effort to level up and everyone is equal (not P2W). Ya sure there are perks to this game when you buy booster packs but it's not a lot in the way that it would put you at a higher class than others so you can be OP. It's well balanced with good graphics and music. It even has some humor in it to make you laugh. So if you want a game to take your mind off things (spend hours out of reality and beat things up to exact your fustration), need a good laugh, see graphics that are pleasing to the eye, and maybe even feel like dancing to good tunes then this game is for YOU! It's a well balanced turn based game so some may not like it but for those who like or even love turn based games then give this a try. What will it hurt?? :-)			"

												Started playing this in early beta, liked the concept and gameplay style but it was limited after the beta ended due to a subscription cost and other non-free to play elements. There are still micro-trasactions and other misc. real money items but none that are necessary for complete gameplay (as far as I have found). Quite a bit of grinding but it also gives a sense of progression. Combat is intricate and in depth, and with all of the classes and specializations/skill custimization allow for any approach to combat. One of my favorite MMO's now that it has been moved to steam and made free-to-play.			"

												Well, first things first, I absolutely loved this game, it haves a beatiful artstyle you won't get in any other game, it's a hiden gem of the MMORPG. But, in the server I played called ""Elbor"" There was a Rollback of 4 MONTHS, this is an uterly nightmare for players in that server, most of the updates are full of bugs and overall the developers don't care much about the community. I'm not saying Wakfu is a bad game, it's amazing, but it has been rooting more and more over the years, it would be nice that a good company took the role of the game and make it shine again...			"

												A really great game that very few people have heard about. It has a unique style of combat in the MMO-verse: turn-based. The good thing is, it's pretty quick considering the turn-based nature of it. The community seems pretty good, maybe a bit on the younger side of things (majority under 25 is my guess), but that's not been a negative for me (almost 30). For those who are inclined to get deep into the game, there is a political system for each of the four nations, as well as an in-depth weather system that ties into the ecosystem for each nation.The graphics are totally awesome; it has a top-down view, similar to that of Ultima Online or Dark Ages (Nexon).It's definitely worth a go if you're looking for something free and detailed.

												-the time played is of course false, Id say I've spent about 150 hours in game? -********** INTRODUCTION - A BIT OF HISTORY ***********Now I was a player of Wakfu back in the day (in 2012, like everyone here) and frankly the game was good. now sure, I had to pay a monthly fee (that was not nearly as much as what WoW would ask you to pay, but still, I had to pay it), but the game itself was great. The problem was that unfortunately, the servers were devoid of players, because most wakfu players would have been Dofus players and I think that the beta of Wakfu did really badly with tons of bugs etc. So I eventually dropped the game, like GW2, if you want, and went for something else. You cannot guess how surprised I was to see this game coming on steamplay xD.Well, I for one think that this is the best thing Ankama (french gaming company who did Dofus and Wakfu) could have done. Byt doing this not only will their number of players multiply by 100 (it was that low) but the game will be revived. As I understand it, now, there is no need for monthly payment (which I find is great) and you can just enjoy a great game for free.***********     THE REVIEW AT THE STATE THE GAME WAS IN 4 MONTHS AGO    ***********                       ( not much has changed except for an extra playable character )Now I keep saying great game, but what makes this game so great? many, many things.I think the first word to describe this game would be innovative, it is struggling to do something no MMO has ever done.+ Everyone has their own player house FROM THE BEGINNING and it can be upgraded and decorated through quests, achievements and dungeon battles.+ It has a very extensive job system. (it really is, trust me, you don't?  prepare to cut wood, fish, kill monsters, create monsters, plant trees, plant herbs/pick herbs, cereals (not the same skill tree), mine, craft potions, food and drink, weapons and armor, and bags and even house decorations. Each job comes with a skill tree which when ugraded allows you to pick and plant more resources/ make better gear.+ A very advanced ecosystem if all you do is cut a certain type of tree and no one else around you is planting some, prepare to be sued by the government for being anti ecologist. I also strongly advise not to cut down endangered species as that WILL lower your citizenship rating and you will eventually become an outlaw. Your chances of succesfully planting a plant will be mitigated by the weather, some plants like it sunny, others not so much.+ And to follow up on that point, an extremely well thought out political system. There is a government for each faction (there are four) on each server, in which there is a governor, and maybe 6-7 ministers (defence, ecology, economy, war... ). The governor's job is mainly two things, to go to war and to decide whih laws are in place or not. There are maybe 30 laws that can be turned off or on and that affect the daily life of the citizenry. The political system is extremely important because the government itself will organise events, and issue the tax levels on the different areas of the game. The government can spend the money gained this way in different ways: to control the weather in some areas, to edict new laws, to organise more events...+ War can be declared between factions, following that will be a grand scale battle between the said factions to conquer islands that aren't their home ones, knowing that a conquered island comes with benefits for the controlling faction.+ A Great strategic battle system which encourages you to be more tactical and not button spam like most MMO these days. there are 15  (originally there were twelve, then there were 14, and after I stopped playing they added in another one so 15) classes, each with a different skillset and abilities.+ A great variety of monsters who are also affected by the ecosystem. You can collect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from species and then use it to spawn new monsters into the world.Well, thats all I can think of for the good points, now to the negative points-  Back in the day, each class was nerfed or augmented every day, which made for a very hazy game experience, I do not know if they still do that however I doubt that they have yet found the perfect balance between the 14 characters (now 15) as there are always some who will outperform the rest.-  In game shop. Not much to say here, i'm just putting it here because that's basically a negative aspect of any game and yes there are some things you can get from the shop that make you more powerful, so it's NOT just cosmetic, but its really not indispensable.- Still some occasionnal bugs, but nothing major.- There is a main story, but it is completely seperated from the rest of the game for some unknown reason. I would have preferred a story implemented in the rest of the game.-/+ The lack of actual quests can be a bit annoying at first but I guess the presence of dynamic events (like in guild wars 2) makes it a bit better.Yeah so I guess that's it, I hope you read it all and that it was helpful. Of course don't try this if you hate turn based strategy, but if you don't, even if you're not sure after reading my review, just try it, it's free ;)******************** WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW ********************Unfortunately Ankama doesnt give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it's French player base (when we are the ones who have been supporting the game for 2 years) and does not let french accounts (like mine) play the game from Steam at all when Steam is the place to play it because of the newly found international playerbase. I think this is a stupid and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move and I am forced to thumbs down this game because of this. The game itself is still loved, but I cant thumbs up a game I can't play.***********************UPDATE AS OF 20/02 ************************Ankama FINALLY stopped their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! It took them 2 years! but now the game is finally free to play for all!! (changing my review form negative to positive as a result)  :D			"

												Do you like cute art styles and are capable of over looking more then 200 hours of grinding while listening to various remixs of music no one has ever heard of while doing the same robotic task with possible glitchs and stupid mini games that actually have an effect as to have a reason for you to keep an eye on the screen at all times?. Great!. Then read on and prepare for a completly random review.The gameplay is turn based grid based game with all the stragrindy of having higher numbers then what ever misshappen remixed abomination from kinder children on acid with some slang swears and lewd sexual content only those within the teenage and dirty mind will understand type of creatures.Armed with all the spells you could want ""about 15 total for each class 20 for huppermage"" that allows diverse switching of tactics with a wide arsenal of elemental attacks ""3 of whice you will actually use"".With a job system that takes for f**king ever to amount to anything and minor cases of Ptsd Ocd and emotinal stress of watching your waifu endure endless in what ever mundane task you can think of from planting trees cutting wheat to mineing fixed placed self regenerting material blocks for ores ""most of whice you will delete cause you just want to make money and its useless"".With the classes being seperated into ones whice you play if you have friends and others if you don't become a one man army or a severaly crippled low level scrub that barely manages to get by in the worst and worlds most broken econamy since post obama.With all the weapon selection whice amp your abilitys you can increase even further... your abilitys! ""no one actually uses weapons we just use them for stat boosts like armour, only use a weapon if you feel like wasteing time and showing off your sweet sweet swag"".With the ability to grind Grind! GRIND!! you too can become a low level player still stuck around level 50 out of ""200 i think"" cause you have no f**king idea how to level up properly and there is no average guides worth reading after you have actually started the game and planned it all in advance.Beat up hapless monsters and make your way haphazardly through the world of... uh... grid based tile sets whice become a real pain to navigate as you will only be useing the mouse to move!, thats right DOTA fans, left click to move right for actions! ""though in Dota its actually the other way around but really who cares?"".Join up with a dwindling community as we try to uphold the game with all the minor and worthless value it has and is waiting for!, play for a few days, take break for a few months, repeat again and again as the replay value ""nothing"" becomes so boring you actually have more fun not playing the  game!.But for those who are persistant, brave, and or have no lives, come play with us, where we will completly ignore you as were to busy trying to work around the absolutely horrible player priceing commonly found in Mmo's but with less players and rarer gear worth even more!.It has some good sides but iv forgetten half of them and can't be bothered with minor details, really its a typical Mmo all things considered its small it runs well and it does have an enjoyment factor though you will find it much greater if you have some friends decide to roll play or not and actually work together, apart from that you will find yourself feeling lonely like many other Mmo's where even in the busiest market places no one actually bothers to openly sell stuff ""except outside a giant church in neutral territory cause you will want to collect your token each day you log in"".This in its own way could be counted as a beutiful flawed master piece, and if they fixed some $hit it would be even better and attract more players thus enchancing the game, but its made in french... france. Sacré blu its one of those two!. So good luck trying to suggest anything to the devs.Waifu. I mean Wakfu! - 6.5/10			"

												Wakfu is not a game; its a lifestyle.  where your actions effect the whole of a mmo world. there is many things you can do, from crafting or performing a profession such as armorer, or farming. or defeating dungeons useing a tactical rpg format. after 2 overhauls of the way skills work and how stats are effected, the game is more balanced.  in addition to skills making more sence, and easy to upgrade them from lvling. i like the feature of the haven bag/world. haveing your own extra storage that you can carry along with you; customize with bedroom sets, garden gems(for growing stuff), and crafting tables-so you can do professions or craft on the go/collect and save plants for later use. what i dont like is that the official site gives more buyable options-even though donation rewards overall dont overpower your progression over others in any big or lasting way. i would like the option to change my name or get any of the other things steam wakfu shop doesnt have that official site shop does.       but after going over merit and flaw balance, then compared to other games of style type or what is available during this era of gaming, i give it a 8/10.  and definately recommend other to pick it up and play it.

												I've played Dofus years ago and enjoyed every minute of it. I can say the same about Wakfu. There's a lot of freedom, fun and enjoyable content in this game. Turn based combat forces you to think alot about your moves and lets you plan your movement in the future turns. The world is huge and well done. Another feature that should be noticed is that there's no NPC shops. There's an auction house, where people create economy and dictate prices. I also enjoy profession and crafting system. I find leveling up my crafting/harvesting skills very enjoyable. All in all, I could talk a lot about this game, but you should try it for yourselves. After all, it's free to play.			"

												Took a minute to get use to game play style.   So far it keeps me interested moving through each goal (i guess  you could call them quests).  I'm not particularly interested in the story line, but game play is fun and reminds me of a FF7 meets EverQuest.  Background sounds are overly repetitive and can get annoying.  Low game play time so far, I'll update the review after leveling up a few more times.   So far i like it, fun play and nice toon graphics, nice turn based combat outweighs any cons so far. If you enjoy MMO and clicker games, this is a fairly casual easy to play MMO clicker.. and its free at the moment!   4 out of 5 stars...  -1 only for repetitive background sounds can ruin some immersion.

												This is a free to play french MMORPG. There happens to be a very good tv show animation of it as well.Requirements are very low as its really 2d with an isometric (3d like) view, i think it runs on java.The battles are done by turn, in a square grid. It is fun and challenging as well.It has some original character classes and lore, and some of the usual. You could watch the animation first to see if it picks your interest.You get to choose from 4 factions to join, but it doesnt really affect you much unless you plan to do pvp. You can eventually go anywhere anyway. Like most MMORPGs be ready to put lots of time and effort into it. There is battling, and grinding, and crafting, and resource gathering, etc.If you are stuck with a low end computer, have internet, time, and want to enjoy mmorpgs, this could be your game!			"

												this game!!i am a final fantasy lover! i played all of them! (just to clear my point of view here)this game, it has lots of classes, with lots of differences!it has a class which lets you capture monsters to fight for you!!! (total win for me)you can just grind on monsters if you arent much into quests, you can level really well on those!so far, every single monster you fight, gives you its own equipment set o.o xD (sounds a bit like monster hunter? RIGHT!)kill a sheep! get a sheep equipment set, kill a pink bird, get a pink feather like set!i really love that ideayou can craft a LOT, you can run around, plant trees and flowers, sure other players will just take those trees or flowers away from the ground, but you can just replant them again if you got enough seedstry to make it YOUR world with YOUR pretty or ugly flowers! maybe the others wont be high enough gardener level to destroy your beautiful landscape idea XDwell okay, its mainly just ingredients for craftingif im not in the mood to fight monsters etc, ill just run around, take seeds from flowers and plant them all over the world to get my gardener level higher :Dbtw, you can even get .... ugh... monster seeds (i know, it does sound weird saying it that way)you can plant those seeds into the ground to grow your own monsters!but i think it only works in areas where those monsters actually are, you cant grow lv 20 monsters in the lv1 area (sad xD)IF you are a solo player and HATE teaming up with others like i do, you can just be weird, pay a bit of money in the cashop and be allowed to use 2 others of YOUR characters for your team, that way you have a 3 player team which you alone control, yes, you heard right, you can make up a team by yourself ;) perfect for anti-social people like me xD(it doesnt stay forever tho, its like 2 euro per week, cheaper if you buy it for longer, but i guess you know how that works)CON!1. the monster you capture, does NOT level up with you, it stays at the level where you capture it, which means, you wont be able to keep your favorite pet till high level because it will be really really weak then.... (really sad...)2. you cant keep your favorite look in the game because the set items get weak, there is no way to preserve the look of an item (as most other mmo's do) so you end up looking really ugly in the end because of 'high-stat-item-ugly-look' stuff "

												This game is actually full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I'm updating this sentence and not giving an EFF beyond that. There are a few issues though. Mostly not being able to turn the combat screen for a better vantage point. But if I had to say there was anything wrong with this game in all seriousness, it would only be the players themselves. Lots of jackasses on Nox. But that's common in these kinds of games. Though, if you're not excited about playing you should really watch the Wakfu anime first.			"

												Wakfu is built off the lore and mechanics of an old game called Dofus that used to run off flash. Then Amakna built Wakfu as a more modern version, with a slightly different side of the World of Twelve's story, as well as different take on character development. Overall this game has tremendous depth and complexity, even if its 2D interface can be a little off-putting.The game features many different character classes or races with basic attributes, which can be reinforced through leveling in countless different ways to suit whatever playstyle you may desire. In addition to combat there are also a rather extensive set of professions, that are accessible upon discovery and appropriately grindy towards end-game. The game's economy runs off a server-wide marketplace accessible from several different places around the World of Twelve.As a free to play game there is a wide array of microtransactions availbale ranging from cosmetics and accessories, to booster packs and ""sidekicks"". The game does a good job of keeping these things out of the combat system, so that a paying and free user can get into a fight and not notice any sort of difference in terms of their abilities.Overall the game is a lot of fun to play, and there are many ways to pair up with a companion or two, adding the additional spice to your fights. I do recommend the use of booster packs and other XP bonuses towards mid levels as character development seems to slow down drastically around level 60-70.Overall this is a pretty unique game, I recommend it if you want a change of scenery!

												first off, you can ignore the time, i've played this game before it came to steam for quite a while.Right to the point. Is Wakfu a good game? well, personally i'd place it near the top of my favorite mmo list somewhere below mabinogi (before the player pop dropped)The only reason im not active now is because of how much the player pop dropped on the north american server ""Nox"".But if Nox were to merge with the international server like amara will be doing soon, i'd definitely come back. If you enjoy turn based gameplay you should give wakfu a try. yep as simple as that, just make sure to join a more populated server than Nox.			"

												I was shocked at how much I liked this game because I'm not really into cartoony anime cutesy looking games, but the gameplay is great. There's issues with it like any game, and the community is small so you get really up close and personal with the idiots, but the game itself is good. They've made a lot of improvements over the years so if you're a returning player, it's like 200x better than it has ever been before. Only issue is its community size.Low level players will have a hard time getting through content without paying to run multiple characters per account. There aren't many lowbies around to run dungeons with you. You probably need to find a good guild ASAP, but most might find constant questions and nagging annoying. Prepare to subscribe and get the Heroes system, it will make the game feel a lot more like Fire Emblem (which I personally enjoy)			"

												Ok, for real?I spent a good year or so playing this game, developing a guild, making some great new friends. But if I were to be absolutely critical, this is my review:Wakfu is a strategy MMO with a battle system remniscent of games such as Final Fantasy Tactics. It features several unique classes, a world with a rich story and lore comparable to Warcraft's, and a fun, playful art style you could probably only find from a French game.Its parent company, Ankama, has recently put in a lot of work to developing the earlier game (levels 1-100, basically) but overall... you basically need to be social in order to have fun with this game. Without friends, without a guild, the grinding can get pretty boring pretty quick. Further, the community is small and the PVP a little under developed - a recipe for disaster. Overall, I would still recommend this game, but with a huge grain of salt. If you can get past the grinding, the ""highschool"" mentality of the social scene, and the dupers, its pretty fun!  FOR THE GLORY OF BRAKMAR!6.5/10, I guess.			"

												I'm honestly torn how to rate this game. Love the community, hate the developers. Beautiful art too!My opinions are based off of roughly May, 2015. Some of this may have changed. Most probably hasn't.--History, Positives about the game--I played the title since beta v0.2 and loved the class system, was intrigued by the ""no NPCs"" rule (except territory masters), LOVED that original crafting system, and LOVED the open (grid based) world where you could plant resources anywhere you wanted or cut everything down! >:D However, everything was in French. I learned a lot of French.Then they remade it (beta v0.3) with English support. I kept playing but the crafting system was replaced with a typical gather-craft grind. Still great open-world sandbox game. They added more classes so combat was more interesting, guilds developed. The community was super great, with a handful of ... inciting personalities.Time is getting muddled in my brain, but somewhere in there we reached full 12 (then 13, then 14...) classes, Wakfu ""left beta"", it was released on Steam, EA signed on to manage the North American server, quests developed, guilds developed even further, and much more area, mechanics, and equipment were added into the game. Good things.--Drawbacks--However, I have never been part of a game where the developers were more sluggish in responding to the people.Patches come once a month at best. Sometimes three months pass without a change. Then BOOM everything is changed, a few barely noticable hotfixes in the days that follow, then, silence.They have a terrible tendency to balance a class around PvP OR PvE. Never both. (Also, huge favortism with developers and certain classes they work on. Trying to outdo one another?)Classes have gone unbalanced for AGES and developers would rather wait years to remake the class entirely rather than tune some numbers. Sometimes these class changes completely gut the core identity of a class.Example time!Eniripsas (healers, my preferred main) went TWO YEARS with both a mechanic that made healing more effective (by flat bonus per spell) and less effective (by scaled percentage) in long fights. Two mechanics that fought each other.They didn't tune numbers. They didn't get rid of the passive that was the issue. They took the power of the class (extending fights) and made it impossible to do so because a good healer couldn't die in 1v1 pvp fights.A completely wrong reaction to a legitimate problem. SELF heals could have been nerfed at any time.Xelors were (are?) the time-mage class. They focus on removing your enemies ability to use as many skills on their turn. However, certain PvE bosses came out and Xelors could keep them from doing any damage.So, first they made a stacking resist occur every time Xelors were successful. ON ALL MONSTERS AND PLAYERS. (Whats the point of being punished for doing your classes job?) They later made those same PvE bosses immune to AP loss and increased both the max AP and spell cost and thus rendered the point moot, yet kept the scaling resist on everything else.But I digress...A rock-paper-scissors PvP system where there are 3-4 reigning classes at any one time, each with 0-2 classes it just cannot fight and win.A confusing swap from solo play being the focus, to full group of six players being the only way to get good experience, back to allowing solo players to fake the group dynamic with bought upgrades.--Summary--All in all I had some good times playing Wakfu with a huge guild (shoutout to Kamaradery!). The wonder of it wore off and I realized the mismanagement of the game.So, this game will entertain you and can bring you a lot of fun. Until you experience most of the content and start waiting for the developers. Then, only sadness.I truly wish the best for Wakfu in the future because it has some amazing pieces that I want to see in other games. However, I dont think I can play it any more. The people that made it great have moved on and so should I.			"

												Game very promising with uniques features and gameplay, you will really enjoy the experience when you face the world at a crowded server or at peak hours.Their huge bugs and the bad management by the company kinda shade how good is this game, still recommendable tho.			"

												Cartoony, Turn-based, Free to play, but not Pay to win. Used to have a subscription system that limits free players from getting access to the goodies and content of the game, but it's all okay now. Artwork is splendid, and there is a Animated TV Series of the same name about it on Netflix. WAKFU, the game itself is very contrasting compared to other MMORPGs, mostly because of the climate, economy, and more importantly, the charater classes. It isn't just the cliche style of Warrior, Mage, and Rogue, it's more like A plentiful variety of specializations to choose from the start. For example, the Ecaflip is a class that's based on gambling, taking risks for bonuses and penalties during combat. The Sadida, is a class based on using nature to their advantage, healing allies and removing their opponents ability to traverse the terrain. On the other hand, there are a few roles that fit in the Warrior theme like the Iop. Also with the recent skill and spell revamps, the abilities of all the classes have mostly changed, including their status effects, debuffs and buffs on the skills and spells. WAKFU focuses more on a Strategic gameplay, now limiting the amount of skills you can use in combat and, putting a more emphasis on what skills you should use and exp-grind on. There's also a Economy based purely on player-trading, resource-gathering, and grinding, and a Climate system that determines effectiveness of farming of certain plants.TL:DR : Try the game, is gud stuf.

												Probably not for everyone because the tutorial can be vague and it is grind based system, not quest based. Also it is turn based mmorpg with art style of Bastion. Just imagin a game where Bastion and Fianl Fantasy: Tatics had a baby.  If u are not  thefan of grinding its probably not for u. However for some reason this games gridning pulls me in and the just made it fun with cute and adorable characters and lots of classes and profession to chose from. im talking about 15 different classes with 3 different path to choes from for each classes. 17 professions to master. Quest wise probably not much to offer but the dungeons and the amount of exploreration u can do in the world of wakfu is very satisfying			"

												Fun for a few hours until you hit the pay/grind wall upon choosing your kingdom. There's a complete lack of quests, story, and guidance after that. This is something that the developers have been aware of for months and have yet to address, which is the second biggest problem with this game. Bugs and issues that have existed for months go unaddressed and support requests almost always go unanswered. There is a staff for this game, as events and updates seem to come fairly often, but they definitely don't have their priorities straight.			"

												Well, I am not as much a reviewer as some people might be but from just overall experience so far I have no complaints really. The only thing i could personally complain about is just my own old as crap computer causing the bloat issue with Java. Otherwise, the log-in process can be inconvenient because of the idle kick and Error: Account already in use. Other than that I enjoy the tactics style gameplay and the varied job classes. I may not be the type who likes to grind too long for a level-up, but that is ok. the game tries to keep itself interesting for awhile and is usually truly more enjoyable with a party of friends rather than solo play. Overall i see this game more as a play with friends kind of game than a play alone type.			"

												I'll keep this review short, I have played this game for 2 years and probably have over 500+ hours in ( Yes I had no life)Pros:-Very deep game. (You can be a lumberjack, a farmer, a baker, an armorer, a leather dealer, a trapper, a governor, a guard, a miner... you get the deal)-Nice artwork, VERY colorful and relaxing. (If you love anime you'll love the art and concept of the monsters and characters)-NOT a serious game, filled with jokes and humor (To some this may be a con, but to me this was a pro)-4 Nations, and a political system. They also added a new ""nation"" called Riktus which are basically outlaws who do not obey laws.-plenty of classes, with each their own playstyle .Cons:-This game went free, and now you can gain an extra +20%/+30% Drop rate/exp rate (depending on the subscription you choose)  and some other little things but these DO NOT affect the game that much.- THE ONLY REAL CON HERE... is TIMEBefore you play this game, realize that this will take a chunk of your time away, to do the simplest things in this game can take an hour or two.. looking for a specific tree you want to chop down could take you from a minute to 15 minutes.And leveling also takes really long time, unless you have friends OR have multiple clients running (3 characters controlled by one person, gives me a headache)-very hard to find people for a certain dungeon, this game ENCOURAGES multiboxing (opening two clients on a single PC) which I hated very much.    That's all I have, just remember that this is a huge time waster and the only reason I quit this game is because I wanted to focus on my life a little bit more, but by all means it's a great game. Have fun!			"

												I'm not devoted enough to this game to know the ins-and-outs in order to give a surefire recommendation, but boy does this game have, at the very least, potential, and even decent delivery.For one thing, there's a truckload of playable character classes with their own abilities, all of which not just have their own compelling gameplay identities, but three different proposed styles within them that allow you to 'build' one the way you want. And all of those abilities take, like, no time at all unlock. Streamlines the process in a way I don't mind, as from then on really all it's building up to is making those abilities more powerful, and even that's made as easy as possible without taking the grinding out of it. Various effects and damages scale with bonus damage provided by items, and every now and then if you're no happy with the level of your abilities, or the way you've allocated your stats, you can just re-do it (albeit only once a month for whatever wierd reason).And then I guess second is the turn-based grid-based pseudo-strategy approach to combat. Fresh breath of air, and it works well, though this is one of those wierd MMOs where you have to do not-combat things, but they still use the combat system for whatever reason and it looks incredibly out of place and is unnecessarily complicated. Only those things though, actual battles are just fine.The english localization is kind of a bang-up job, as all these types of games tend to be. And certain systems being as complicated as they are means this doesn't help learning the game very much. It took me about halfway in to my current playtime to realize what Lock and Dodge even did, so either I can blame that on the game or tell you to do what I didn't and go do some research.There's also buddings of a Runescape-lite kind of thing going on where you have different crafting and harvesting skills and using them levels them up. This is not a bad thing, I like Runescape, and it's nice to make it feel like you don't need to invest in combat to see most of what the game has to offer, but going the whole hog and having freaking full-on ecosystem management puts player-to-player trust at arms. Everyone can plant the seeds of the things they just cut down to resupply for anyone else who wants to cut them, but there's nothing going on to say you must.EDIT: Playing it again after putting it down I did remember one other problem with it. Most of the game's dungeons say they're supposed to be done at certain levels, but you can only do them that way if you have a party of friends with you. It makes no concessions for solo players, and it's not exactly the best environment for finding people to help you out.			"

												In the massively multiplayer online game WAKFU, players have to use the skills and smarts to survive, battle and build in a virgin universe. Characters fight fierce fauna and flora using magic, martial arts or new technologies. They also have to build cities in a virgin universe while preserving nature from destruction. Thanks to a universal and intuitive language, players will interact to create alliances or to take part in fights that will have a direct influence upon the universe.The story of Wakfu takes place a long time after that of DOFUS. An ogre named Ogrest gathered all the six Dofus and gained boundless powers. The ogre offered his beloved the dragon eggs. But she turned down the present though worthy of the gods themselves, and Ogrest started shedding tears of rage and pique. The tears of the ogre made the ocean level increase so much that parts of the World are now submerged to the inhabitants' great displeasure. Now gods and heroes of the World are starting a new adventure before reaching Ogrest and confront him in an ultimate fight!			"

												It tries its best to make its way out of the shadow of Dofus (Ankama's First TBSMMO) but fails. The classes are better and the combat feels deeper but the grind is even worse. Most of my time playing It felt like almost every feature they tried to improved from Dofus was more of a step back. The F2p model is a joke its one of those Booster subscription deals and some of the stuff in the cash shop does not really make sense. While the nations were a interesting idea there is balance problem and over time it has made Ankama set most of each nations maps to be almost the same so as not to smooth the leveling curve. Gods help you though if you need to get to another nation that your at war with, The political system is heavily abuse-able. I'm not sure if its a problem in this version but it was a huge problem in the beta. Multi boxing is still alive and well so that mmo part is not really there though other players that are willing to help are a dime a dozen.In the end it would have just been better if they merged the Stats, Spells and Combat system into Dofus and called it day. Maybe the haven bag too, that idea wasn't too bad.			"

I've played it since the early betas. The world is growing, the sory is spreading, this game is so alive! And yeat stress relieving, warm, nice to play :).			"

												I've tried playing WAKFU for 15 minutes or so, and here's what I have to say about the game. Most negatives are about purchasing and support. Not gameplay.Pros-*Good battle style*Graphics are nice*Up to 8 possible different characters*Variety for character appearancesCons-*Lags slightly*First-time setup installing is extremely laggy*I can't find any way to group up other than with nearby people.*Only 5 character spots are free*your first character must be a certain class*Advertisement-esque ""If you had premium you could have gotten _"" popups after battles*No friends feature?All in all, I say this game is p good for a F2P. It has its bugs and downfalls, but as long as you don't buy anything this is a fun MMORPG. Except it's not exactly a MASSIVE MO.			"

												They have updated a lot of the things I hated about this game for the better you can skip the puzzles now.Old Post:Half the game dosn't matter what level you are, too many puzzles without ryme or reasion should give you the option to skip the puzzle crap and get to the fighting.Probbaly the only reasion it has a ""Mostly Positive"" is because most people can't get the first quest done and give up b4 they even play it.FFT MMO is BS FFT didn't have crappy puzzles.

												I want to like Wakfu I really do, but it has to many glaring flaws for me to recomend it.Lets start with the pros.+ great art+ Interesting classes+ fun combat system+ Interesting lore (including the anime)Now... to the cons- no quests: Wakfu lacks quests and expects you to just be happy raiding dungeons on your own without anyone telling you to. This is doesnt work as you will soon fin yourself tried to doing nothing but running into the same dungeons over and over. Which might have been ok if...- dungeons suck: sad but true. The dungeons are ok on your first play through, but without a party there is no real strategy to beating them, either your strong enough or your not. And even when your playing with friends to make the experience more engaging, once you beat a dungeon your basicaly done. Sure you might grind it for drops but ther fun has since gone. The dungeons never change so once you have beat it once, unless you AFK, you will always beat it from that point out.  This could have worked if there were a ton of dungeons, but there are not there are maybe 5 per area and you wll stay in each area for about 10 or so levels which can take mutliple dungeon runs to acomplish. And yet even this might have been ok, if getting epic loot was fun, but...-the loot sucks: the loot variety is small, like really small, and without random stats attached to any of it there is no reason to get it. You will raid a dungeon once, get the loot then never return, or better yet just buy it off somone for cheap because since everyone has the exact same loot its all worthless! Which could be ok if leveling your character was fun, but...-progression sucks: Its basic gaming design to make sure the player isnt doing the same thing at level 100 as they were at level 1. That will not happen here, sure you will find leveling up to about 25 or so, engaging, but from then on out your character will not change at all. You will be using the same combos over and over and over again with no real motivation to change it up, the only thing that will change is how much damage they do. But luckily there is somethign other than fighting, there is crafting so that....- crafting also sucks: The game doesnt enforce you to have one job, you can do any, because of this your job is worthless. Everyone just makes anything they need themselves and ebcause of this everything on the market is either dirt cheep or super expensive. The idea of running a armor making store sounds fun, untill you realize no one will ever buy from you when they can just make it themselves and earn exp while doing it. This has an easy fix (force people to have only a single job) Which the games text says is how the system works! But it doesn't and they havent fixed it, so it fails.So in short Wakfu is a game where your character doesnt grow past level 25, in which you grind repetative dungeons for borring loot. To the tune of no story and no meaningfull jobs or minigame to complete. Sounds fun no?			"

This game is basically sandbox from the getgo, no fetch this or that. Its definitely unique from other mmo's i highly suggest you guys try it.			"

												There could be improvements to its interface and other features such as NPC shops to give all the players a little more diversity than just grinding on quest to gain items. (Granted there are professions to make some items--it's better if you have NPCs setting up shops.The skills could be a little more balanced and less complicated.Among others, these are just minor problems with the game because as long as you're a fan of RPGs, WAKFU is the game for you.

												In the past, Wakfu was a terrible F2P MMO. All the business model cared for was money money money. Players weren't able to get in-game currency and you weren't able to leave the newbie area unless you were a subscriber to the game.Now everything has changed. F2P players can go to the zones that subscribers were able to go to, and monsters drop in-game currency (in the past, the only way you were able to get money as a subscriber was by minting it.)The only downside to this is that the in-game currency minting machines are almost obsolete now unless they revamp that system somehow to make money-minting more profitable than grinding. But in the past items were much more cheaper than they were due to the fact that money HAD to be minted to order to get money. Now everything is a lot more expensive.Overall if you like games that play like FF Tactics or FF Tactics Advance for fighting, as well as games that have job professions, and a Havest Moon like open world where you are able to plant things that grow (even monsters,) try this game out.

												Had to Edit this review due to massive changes in the game since it was written. Prior to this, it was 57 of 67 Helpful, and I recommended it.However, due to these changes, I can no longer recommend this trainwreck of a game.It seemed like they made such good decisions with the initial steam release. Class fixes/overhauls to make them useful and fun again, removal of most of the ""pay to even play let alone win"" mechanics.But then they redid a number of classes, again. Including my beloved Zookeeper Osa. What once was the only class I genuinely enjoyed, with a stable full of pets I could summon 3 or 4 pets at once with, has been transformed into a shadow of it's former self with only a single pet allowed, some stupid new buff/energy system, and all my previous skills (and thus my gear) being rendered mostly useless.This is on top of the LOOOOOOOOONG-awaited ""Hero"" system turning out to be complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everyone was expecting this new system that let you use Alt chars on the same account as Sidekicks/Party Members, since previously, everyone had multiple accounts anyways with alts in their party - so we figured, ""Cool, they're going to implement a system to make this official and easier on both us and the servers.""WRONG. The Hero system is a monthly subscription, which costs more per-char you want to add, and highly overpriced. People were waiting for this to come out and be the game-saver, what made the community skyrocket, instead, people quit in droves, major cities that once had dozens or hundreds of shop bags out are now empty, and the pop has dropped outside of the French servers.They also took the main neutral gathering point, the Temple in Astrub, and literally deleted the entire area where everyone had their shop bags and socialized and had duels at, so there's no room to do anything social there anymore. The developers. actively. removed. socialization. On purpose.What was once a good, fun little game has been destroyed by terrible decisions. RIP Wakfu.			"

												Be careful. Once you join the world of Wakfu you will find yourself very addicted and you will only be talking to your in-game friends. For those who have lives....BEWARE!But, seriously this game is good! c:EDIT: They changed the entire battle system which is what made this game fun. The system is now just an annoying hassle and the support team for this game barely try to assist you if anything happens. The game is buggy and constantly changing for better and worse. I regret spending so much time on this game only for them to ruin it for me.The ECOSYSTEM in this game. What do I mean? Wakfu is unique in the sense that the players control the ecosystem of the world which also applies to the shops. If someone chops down all the trees they will be gone from an area forever until someone plants them back. This causes a lot of annoying problems especially because a lot of people just go to an area to ""ecoterrorize"" it because they are from the enemy nation. Having to plant things back takes a very long time and it is very boring. Things HAVE become close to impossible to find in this game. One of those things are beans...yes, beans. In the NA server Nox you can't find them anywhere and it is only a matter of time before more in-game resources become extinct and you won't be able to craft important items.That player influence also pollutes the in-game MARKET. In Wakfu there are no npcs that sell you items, everything is sold by other players. You can imagine how this influences the prices of things you need in the game especially if you are new.From levels 120-145 (I believe) there is nothing to do but grind. Grind the same 3 or so dungeons over and over until you make it to 145. I've spent hours grinding and by the time I quit the game my character was level 134. It just didn't feel worth it to me. Beyond level grinding is the relic grinding. You need to do the same 2-3 hour dungeon to MAYBE get a relic about every 5 runs just to get a good item. It's ridiculous especially in my personal experience where the game glitched and all my relics disappeared (I had like 30) and when I sent in a support ticket they just gave me a rare costume and an emote as conpensation...but all my time grinding was for nothing.CONCLUSION:This game feels really good in the beginning but late-game it just seriously becomes a head ache especially when you notice all your in-game friends have quit. All the new updates just make the game feel even worse because Ankama only adds things and never fixes what already exists in the game. You're honestly better off watching the series on Netflix but even that is decent at best.			"

												Wakfu is a really addicting RPG that has dungeons to conquer, areas to explore and items to collect. I would strongly recommend playing Wakfu with a group of friends.			"

												This game has ended up being quite a great find, and has provided many hours of very enjoyable entertainment at no cost!  I will admit, my initial response to the cute/kiddish facade made me a bit weary, but eventually found it to be fairly charming.  Playing through the tutorial made me realized the game mechanics had a lot to offer, and is a very refreshing breath of fresh air in the MMORPG world.  After a couple weeks of testing this game out, I can see myself playing quite a lot more and eventually investing some money into.  I recommend giving WAKFU a try and judge for yourself.  As a heads up, the mechanics are different from your traditional RPG, so there is a bit of a learning curve.			"

												Wakfu has a look and style I find enjoyable. One drawback on this it sometimes hinders gameplay (especially on the battlefield!!!) as you cannot turn the camera. The action resolves around turn based battles on various grids with variation in size, pattern, elevations and some in accessible locations. These battles are fun, Tactics and knowledge of your character, ofcourse when grouping up - the team play, brings you a lot to amuse yourself with. There seems to be a intricate crating system in place. The flaw is that there is too little information in the game itself on many gameplay facets beside the tutorial wich learns you to navigate your character and his abilities. No explanation or not enough explanation can be found on topics like the environment, crafting, guilds, havens, special tokens, especially nations!!! what they do how the function in respect to others, and the UI is not optimal. Spoken to a lot of players who already spent some time in the game being ignorant about tabs on windows in the game giving them access to a lot more character options, just to name a simple example. It has a lot of potential for a great game and hours of gametime.			"

												Wakfu is one of my all-time favourite games.As far as MMO elements go, It's fun to play cooperatively, but it's perfectly possible to go it alone, with sufficient grinding, of course.For the RPG aspects, Wakfu offers a great (and I do mean great) variety of classes and customisation options within each class, so that everybody can tailor their respective incarnations to their playstyles, and have no two be quite exactly the same.The turn-based, boardgame-like combat is a fast, fun, and all-around enjoyable experience that never gets old, thanks to the wide variety of playstyles, monsters, and environmental properties.And not to forget the art and music: The music is a combination of relaxed environmental tracks and epic orchestral battle themes (Inspirational to say the very least); and the art-style, as inspired by the artist Xa-Xa-Xa on Deviantart is as absolutely, stunningly lovely as ever, with vibrant and imaginative worlds and creatures within those worlds, and the character models are just the right balance of adorable and badass.Wakfu is a wonderful game that I would recommend to just about anybody. And it's free, too!!!			"

												5/10The graphics are good, not great but good.  The gameplay is average for a 4x strategy game, not great but not terrible.  The crafting could be fun, but it's a long slow grind to get anywhere with the crafting.  The quests are fun, but it's very misleading how they are ever present for the first 15 levels and suddenly vanish when you pick a nation.If you have space on your hard drive and nothing better to do with your time it might be worth trying out, but expect to be disappointed when you leave the starting area.

												WAKFU is a highly complex, immersive 'world' with its own laws, politics, international-relations, ecology, and economy.   Learning how all of those forces interact is the great challenge of WAKFU, this is not a simple 'shooter', but a community with a range of player personalities ranging from open, helpful and friendly ... to darkest, evil villains.     Players choose for themselves what role they will play, and quickly learn their actions have consequences, especially when ones actions are contrary to the wishes of the local 'clan members'.   There are many paths to success in WAKFU, players may choose from a wide range of character classes, and professions.WAKFU has its problems too, particularly the publisher: Ankama, seems to have a great many problems with real world payment processing for many players attempting to purchase items from their 'shop' for use in the game.   Fixing these issues does not seem to be a priority for Ankama whose customer support seems quite lacking.If one is willing to accept the lack of support from the publisher, the game itself is still worth a look, as to a large degree, WAKFU's world is what, we, the players, make it.

												I would recommend this game as I like to play this game a lot ... so far in my list of games this my favourite.But.... its quite a complex game where you can do so many things. I still haven't figured everything out. I feel I still have a long way to go... but that is good because then the game won't end quickly. I like the fact that it is open world and multiplayer but I don't have people to play with. It would be very helpful because I need to fight and level up and grow further in this game. If anyone needs someone to play with just let me know. I am part of a clan but only did something together once. I am glad there are guides for this game but I haven't used it as yet because I don't know where to start as this game is very big and you don't do things in a chronological pattern.I also think my game is a bit buggy because I can't take screenshots even thought it says I can press F12. I hope steam fix this soon as I would like to take some screenshots of my favourite game.			"

Most of the time I find myself constantly spamming an attack and never using ym others as they'd make the fight go longer. I feel no sense of planning and well thought out strategies when playing this. This has nothing to do with it being turn based as I've played tons of turn based games that have never felt like a bore fest.			"

												I would recommend this to anyone who has a strategic mind and loves to plan their move, each turn the player has time to plan their move (Around 30 seconds I believe) within those thirty seconds you can plan your attack your move, and attempt to coordinate your attacks with a team mate, playing this with my friend was very interesting. We had to coordinate our attacks so he wouldn't hit me, as he was playing a character with AOE attacks.  I recommend this game simply because it's an interesting take on MMORPGs instead of being a stand and attack like so many others, (Which I will not name) this relies on a grid system of which you can maximize your advantage through strategic planning. Overall, I give it a 9.5/10 for its interesting gameplay.			"

												First of all most games that you can play these days are easy mode meaning it doesn't take much to get to the end game.  Most F2P games ask you to spend everything you have to get ahead, including the shirt on your back. This game isn't either. It takes a lot of effort to level up and everyone is equal (not P2W). Ya sure there are perks to this game when you buy booster packs but it's not a lot in the way that it would put you at a higher class than others so you can be OP. It's well balanced with good graphics and music. It even has some humor in it to make you laugh. So if you want a game to take your mind off things (spend hours out of reality and beat things up to exact your fustration), need a good laugh, see graphics that are pleasing to the eye, and maybe even feel like dancing to good tunes then this game is for YOU! It's a well balanced turn based game so some may not like it but for those who like or even love turn based games then give this a try. What will it hurt?? :-)			"

												Wakfu was fun for a good while, especially with friends. It gets a bit repetitive and fetch quests are by far its worst feature. All in all its pretty good for a couple weeks, maybe a couple months at best. The gameplay itself is pretty good, being turn based and all. The open world is fine and fairly diverse in enemies. Dungeons are heaps of fun, again especially with friends.			"

												There could be improvements to its interface and other features such as NPC shops to give all the players a little more diversity than just grinding on quest to gain items. (Granted there are professions to make some items--it's better if you have NPCs setting up shops.The skills could be a little more balanced and less complicated.Among others, these are just minor problems with the game because as long as you're a fan of RPGs, WAKFU is the game for you.

												Okay so ive played this game probably more then most people on here. That being said my hours on this are incorrect ive played this game since it used to be subscription based and ill just say it has not changed by much. For starters if you dont like games that are usully solo then dont play this game. There are very limited numbers for low level characters and very few high level characters taht will even give you a second look. Its not as grind heavy as its brother Dofus but its still there and can be very irritating. The game also practically forces you do either pay so you can drop kama of mobs or mine to you can make your own kama. Positive side tho their are 15 differnt class to choose from 16 starting tomorrow and having played them all i got to say theyre all unique and most are very fun Sac being best for quick fights and Xelor probably my favorite DPS.

It relies on its players as its community. The entire game is almost completely player driven. Economy, PvP and PvE is directly influenced by the players in their respective factions.			"

												A very cute mix of a few other MMO's out there without the constant irritating world chat. Open world game play. So far at level 20 combat, mobs do not attack you, you have to select fight to battle. Battles are turn based. Not my favorite form of combat, however, with the addition of a 'companion' soloing is a breeze. Plenty of crafting skills to keep even the most obsessive player busy for hours. Not so involved that you feel you need to allocate huge blocks of time to get anywhere. I've set aside all other games in favor of Wakfu. Thanks to two of my sons for getting me addicted to a really good game. *grins*			"

												I'm not devoted enough to this game to know the ins-and-outs in order to give a surefire recommendation, but boy does this game have, at the very least, potential, and even decent delivery.For one thing, there's a truckload of playable character classes with their own abilities, all of which not just have their own compelling gameplay identities, but three different proposed styles within them that allow you to 'build' one the way you want. And all of those abilities take, like, no time at all unlock. Streamlines the process in a way I don't mind, as from then on really all it's building up to is making those abilities more powerful, and even that's made as easy as possible without taking the grinding out of it. Various effects and damages scale with bonus damage provided by items, and every now and then if you're no happy with the level of your abilities, or the way you've allocated your stats, you can just re-do it (albeit only once a month for whatever wierd reason).And then I guess second is the turn-based grid-based pseudo-strategy approach to combat. Fresh breath of air, and it works well, though this is one of those wierd MMOs where you have to do not-combat things, but they still use the combat system for whatever reason and it looks incredibly out of place and is unnecessarily complicated. Only those things though, actual battles are just fine.The english localization is kind of a bang-up job, as all these types of games tend to be. And certain systems being as complicated as they are means this doesn't help learning the game very much. It took me about halfway in to my current playtime to realize what Lock and Dodge even did, so either I can blame that on the game or tell you to do what I didn't and go do some research.There's also buddings of a Runescape-lite kind of thing going on where you have different crafting and harvesting skills and using them levels them up. This is not a bad thing, I like Runescape, and it's nice to make it feel like you don't need to invest in combat to see most of what the game has to offer, but going the whole hog and having freaking full-on ecosystem management puts player-to-player trust at arms. Everyone can plant the seeds of the things they just cut down to resupply for anyone else who wants to cut them, but there's nothing going on to say you must.EDIT: Playing it again after putting it down I did remember one other problem with it. Most of the game's dungeons say they're supposed to be done at certain levels, but you can only do them that way if you have a party of friends with you. It makes no concessions for solo players, and it's not exactly the best environment for finding people to help you out.			"

												In the massively multiplayer online game WAKFU, players have to use the skills and smarts to survive, battle and build in a virgin universe. Characters fight fierce fauna and flora using magic, martial arts or new technologies. They also have to build cities in a virgin universe while preserving nature from destruction. Thanks to a universal and intuitive language, players will interact to create alliances or to take part in fights that will have a direct influence upon the universe.The story of Wakfu takes place a long time after that of DOFUS. An ogre named Ogrest gathered all the six Dofus and gained boundless powers. The ogre offered his beloved the dragon eggs. But she turned down the present though worthy of the gods themselves, and Ogrest started shedding tears of rage and pique. The tears of the ogre made the ocean level increase so much that parts of the World are now submerged to the inhabitants' great displeasure. Now gods and heroes of the World are starting a new adventure before reaching Ogrest and confront him in an ultimate fight!			"

												--Edit--As of the update to 1.43 myself as well as several other people I've talked to in-game have not been able to purchase the in-game currency for their shop (Ogrines). I attempted to report the issue to Ankama support but they were rude and dismissive, sending me to Steam support saying my account was being restricted per the ""Trading and Market Restrictions"" (found at https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1047-EDFM-2932 ).I forwarded them a screenshot of my purchase history and explained how this policy did not affect me based on my purchase history. They responded with this:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Please accept our sincerest apologies.However, we have already endorsed this case to a higher level of customer support. Unfortunately, they have made their decision and have stated it as final. Therefore, we are unable to reverse it or force a different outcome. We understand that decision is not according to your expectations.As per our previous message, we are unfortunately not able to provide you more assistance on this issue.For a breakdown of the new purchase restrictions enforced by Steam, they are as follows:+Steam accounts are not allowed any purchase unless they had a successful purchase older than 30 days but not older than 1 year.+The successful purchase (meaning the transaction was not cancelled or refunded) of wallet funds, games, DLCs and software meet this requirement.+Retail CD key activations and gift purchases do not meet this requirement and will not lift the purchase restrictions on a Steam account.Please opt to contact the Steam Customer Support for further assistance. Apologies for the inconvenience.Kind regards,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I will update this review whenever I get the problem solved, but as for now I am at my wits end. I cannot recommend the game until they show better commitment to solving (at least) paying customer's issues in a timely manner.--Edit End--I love this game. It's artwork is amazing, It has an almost entirely player driven world from the ecosystem to nations ruled by PCs. Wars are fought as much through ecoterrorism as face to face combat. There are a multitude of guilds which fill in gameplay between storyline quests (if the national dramas aren't enough!) The system can be a bit buggy as stated in previous reviews but no-where near the point where the game loses playability. It is turn-based but there is also a turn timer which keeps things moving fairly well. The classes don't quite use traditional roles (tank, dps, healer, ect.) per say. In many cases you CAN build your character to strictly fill one of these roles and you'll find tons of guides on the Ankama forums to help you do so. That being said, MOST classes you can build to fill one or two roles successfully or a well rounded solo character that has just as good playability and balance in a group filling a role.The game is great, it gets monthly updates, it blends with an anime that even further immerses you into the World of Twelve. And it's highly addictive. 10/10 all around. Give it a shot and you'll be hooked!			"

												I downloaded this today and really enjoyed it.  Very unique to see a turn based MMO and I absolutely loved the combat.  Lots of different types of enemies and interesting set of skills to use.  Im not far into the game but I found the story to be interesting, the gameplay very enjoyable and there were quite a few people playing online and of the few that I talked to they all said they love the game.  Also worth noting that I had no issues at all with performance as has been put forward by other people.  My laptop is average at best as well and no issues at all.  Not saying others are lying but just my experience was fine.  The game did take a good 10 minutes to start though on 1st launch due to updates. The game world is absolutely huge.  Loads of different islands/counties, gorgeous artwork, engaging combat system and so much replayability with 13 different classes.Now for what I wasnt so keen on.  The timer on the combat system.  I actually think its a great idea, expecially for PVP so people dont take forever but I think when you are learning the game it should be disabled.  You only get 30 seconds to make your moves and when you dont know the game or what different buffs and debuffs are in play I found myself paniking at times which doesnt suit the relaxing nature of the game.  Like I say great idea but I think it should only apply for level 10.  I then started to get confused by the crafting.  To the point that I turned it off.  So many professions and things to craft that I found it daunting.  Im not going to give up though.  The game has interested me enough to do some reading up on the subject on the forums.I think this game has potential to take over my life if I allow it. If turn based games in a fantasy MMO setting interests you then i strongly advise you to give this a go.			"

												If you're a jaded MMO player then seriously check this game out. It's just completely different from what you've probably played before which I found refreshing. Pros: Its off the wall humour: from the armorsets you can acquire to the descriptions of items, you'll find yourself reading everything as the game really doesn't take itself too seriously. It's also incredibly cute in places, but you really don't have to enjoy anime to appreciate it.Complex character building and tactical gameplay - It does take awhile to get use to and requires a fair amount of reading wiki/forum posts to understand how best to level your character, but once you've got your head around the main points, it's just so much fun developing the skillsets you want to play with. Environments - The game enables the players to control resources (including mob spawning) through environmental management. It's a fun twist on the normal mmo conventions and enables you to take aside an area of land and start your own small holding should you wish or spawn mobs if you're just out to hunt. Its a good way to get resources, which you can use or sell to tradeskillers, but it's also just a fun way to spend time.			"

												The gameplay at its core is solid.  It's definitely an MMORPG.  There's lots of options in terms of attire, fighting style, spells, weaponry, enchantments, and other things.  Playing free has yet to reveal any immediate disadvantages against paying players beyond the obvious slightly slower leveling.  The developers update well and update often, as far as I can see.However.I've only just started this game and let me say before I'm any more experienced:  This game is confusing as hell.  You aren't told much of what you're getting into, what to do, or how to do it beyond combat and interacting with things/people.The overcrowding of the screen and most hub locations doesn't help either.  The chat window is often obtrusive, the hint windows are only circumstantially helpful and are not worth the entire corner of the screen they take up, and the quest system is either buggy or has yet to reveal its mysteries to me.  Often in combat you will look at the statuses you're inflicted with and ask yourself: ""what is that?  What is it doing?  Why do I have it?""  When it comes time to join a nation, you are given almost no informaton about any of them beyond their total wealth, who they're allied with/enemies with, and the amount of the playerbase they hold.And that's what makes it absolutely beautiful.  This is the most granular, inaccessible, 80%-complete-at-all-times game I have ever played, and I personally believe that's what makes it an MMO.  Play this game.  Do it.  It will be confusing but it's the best kind of confused I've ever been.  You learn as you go, and the confusion wears off, and feeling it wear off is the best kind of feeling I've gotten out of games.			"

												I have sunk a lot of time in this game, well for my standards. I do play it daily. I guess you think that it says what I think about the game. Not really :D The game has its problems, that mainly being bugs. But all in all, playing until lvl 100 I recommend, it's somehow far more fun in that lvl range, after you cross over that barrier and start heading to the mystical land of lvl 200... let me just tell you, that if you don't have a group to play with daily, you won't reach it (unless you make like extra accounts to help out run high lvl dungs... not a fun option, but an option nonetheless) It's just grindy and not many other options to choose from if you are on your own, then again, this is a multiplayer game :D So, this being a free to play game, just give it a try.

												If you like the graphics, style, and charm of this game, but hate the grinding and the farmville-esque way of making mobs spawn, then you should play this company's original game, Dofus. It's been out far longer, it's a more mature, enjoyable game, with all the charm and wit of Wakfu. It seems like when Dofus was made, it had passion and love put into it, like the developers actually enjoyed making it, and enjoyed seeing people play it, while Wakfu is more about just letting people waste time and grind. It's not a -bad- game, but it just doesn't have the heart that Dofus has. If you want to try it, then here's a link to the site. Hope to see you there~! http://www.dofus.com/en "

												Okay so ive played this game probably more then most people on here. That being said my hours on this are incorrect ive played this game since it used to be subscription based and ill just say it has not changed by much. For starters if you dont like games that are usully solo then dont play this game. There are very limited numbers for low level characters and very few high level characters taht will even give you a second look. Its not as grind heavy as its brother Dofus but its still there and can be very irritating. The game also practically forces you do either pay so you can drop kama of mobs or mine to you can make your own kama. Positive side tho their are 15 differnt class to choose from 16 starting tomorrow and having played them all i got to say theyre all unique and most are very fun Sac being best for quick fights and Xelor probably my favorite DPS.

												Wakfu was fun for a good while, especially with friends. It gets a bit repetitive and fetch quests are by far its worst feature. All in all its pretty good for a couple weeks, maybe a couple months at best. The gameplay itself is pretty good, being turn based and all. The open world is fine and fairly diverse in enemies. Dungeons are heaps of fun, again especially with friends.			"

												Awesome and addictive game! Play mostly with your friends or, otherwise, there are many people who asks for teamplay. It may have few lags sometime and lose time when in a fight, but you can catch up if you're fast enough. Also, it is a very sexually conoted game, like for example you'll see many Gobbals and Tofus humping on each other. A nice variety of classes with different abilities, so many options on your growth is given. The most fair thing is that you can have friendly fights against others, no death if you lose or anything, just a nice friendly fight, easy to determine if you are putting good fights in later PvP. I played it's prequel, Dofus, and I find Wakfu way easier and efficient on some stuffs.			"

												I'm honestly torn how to rate this game. Love the community, hate the developers. Beautiful art too!My opinions are based off of roughly May, 2015. Some of this may have changed. Most probably hasn't.--History, Positives about the game--I played the title since beta v0.2 and loved the class system, was intrigued by the ""no NPCs"" rule (except territory masters), LOVED that original crafting system, and LOVED the open (grid based) world where you could plant resources anywhere you wanted or cut everything down! >:D However, everything was in French. I learned a lot of French.Then they remade it (beta v0.3) with English support. I kept playing but the crafting system was replaced with a typical gather-craft grind. Still great open-world sandbox game. They added more classes so combat was more interesting, guilds developed. The community was super great, with a handful of ... inciting personalities.Time is getting muddled in my brain, but somewhere in there we reached full 12 (then 13, then 14...) classes, Wakfu ""left beta"", it was released on Steam, EA signed on to manage the North American server, quests developed, guilds developed even further, and much more area, mechanics, and equipment were added into the game. Good things.--Drawbacks--However, I have never been part of a game where the developers were more sluggish in responding to the people.Patches come once a month at best. Sometimes three months pass without a change. Then BOOM everything is changed, a few barely noticable hotfixes in the days that follow, then, silence.They have a terrible tendency to balance a class around PvP OR PvE. Never both. (Also, huge favortism with developers and certain classes they work on. Trying to outdo one another?)Classes have gone unbalanced for AGES and developers would rather wait years to remake the class entirely rather than tune some numbers. Sometimes these class changes completely gut the core identity of a class.Example time!Eniripsas (healers, my preferred main) went TWO YEARS with both a mechanic that made healing more effective (by flat bonus per spell) and less effective (by scaled percentage) in long fights. Two mechanics that fought each other.They didn't tune numbers. They didn't get rid of the passive that was the issue. They took the power of the class (extending fights) and made it impossible to do so because a good healer couldn't die in 1v1 pvp fights.A completely wrong reaction to a legitimate problem. SELF heals could have been nerfed at any time.Xelors were (are?) the time-mage class. They focus on removing your enemies ability to use as many skills on their turn. However, certain PvE bosses came out and Xelors could keep them from doing any damage.So, first they made a stacking resist occur every time Xelors were successful. ON ALL MONSTERS AND PLAYERS. (Whats the point of being punished for doing your classes job?) They later made those same PvE bosses immune to AP loss and increased both the max AP and spell cost and thus rendered the point moot, yet kept the scaling resist on everything else.But I digress...A rock-paper-scissors PvP system where there are 3-4 reigning classes at any one time, each with 0-2 classes it just cannot fight and win.A confusing swap from solo play being the focus, to full group of six players being the only way to get good experience, back to allowing solo players to fake the group dynamic with bought upgrades.--Summary--All in all I had some good times playing Wakfu with a huge guild (shoutout to Kamaradery!). The wonder of it wore off and I realized the mismanagement of the game.So, this game will entertain you and can bring you a lot of fun. Until you experience most of the content and start waiting for the developers. Then, only sadness.I truly wish the best for Wakfu in the future because it has some amazing pieces that I want to see in other games. However, I dont think I can play it any more. The people that made it great have moved on and so should I.			"

												I've played Dofus years ago and enjoyed every minute of it. I can say the same about Wakfu. There's a lot of freedom, fun and enjoyable content in this game. Turn based combat forces you to think alot about your moves and lets you plan your movement in the future turns. The world is huge and well done. Another feature that should be noticed is that there's no NPC shops. There's an auction house, where people create economy and dictate prices. I also enjoy profession and crafting system. I find leveling up my crafting/harvesting skills very enjoyable. All in all, I could talk a lot about this game, but you should try it for yourselves. After all, it's free to play.			"

												This is a good game.Where to start. First of all,wakfu is a multi media idea. There are shows,comics,and the game. Of course,this is gonna be about the game.The creators appear to have worked their best to keep the game from a p2w platform,as all the thingd you can buy in the shop are either cosmetic or has severe downsides to it,such as the garden haven gem. Gardening in the world gives you experience toward Farming or Lumberjack,depending on if you're tending to trees or crops,but planting things in your haven bag grants no xp to the skills. All of the armor in the shop is also cosmetic,and everything has to be earned,whether you like it or not. The closest thing to a p2w is subscriber status,which grants you bonus items after a fight and more XP after a fight,along with a potion that makes crafting easier. In short,wakfu is a game where you CAN buy things with real money,but they are only minor things that make things more convenient while also introducing a downside to those conveniences. A good amount of store items can also be earned,such as a garden haven gem being able to be gotten by praying at the Almanax Altar for 60 days in a row,or completing certain dungeins.			"

												Wakfu is not a game; its a lifestyle.  where your actions effect the whole of a mmo world. there is many things you can do, from crafting or performing a profession such as armorer, or farming. or defeating dungeons useing a tactical rpg format. after 2 overhauls of the way skills work and how stats are effected, the game is more balanced.  in addition to skills making more sence, and easy to upgrade them from lvling. i like the feature of the haven bag/world. haveing your own extra storage that you can carry along with you; customize with bedroom sets, garden gems(for growing stuff), and crafting tables-so you can do professions or craft on the go/collect and save plants for later use. what i dont like is that the official site gives more buyable options-even though donation rewards overall dont overpower your progression over others in any big or lasting way. i would like the option to change my name or get any of the other things steam wakfu shop doesnt have that official site shop does.       but after going over merit and flaw balance, then compared to other games of style type or what is available during this era of gaming, i give it a 8/10.  and definately recommend other to pick it up and play it.

												-the time played is of course false, Id say I've spent about 150 hours in game? -********** INTRODUCTION - A BIT OF HISTORY ***********Now I was a player of Wakfu back in the day (in 2012, like everyone here) and frankly the game was good. now sure, I had to pay a monthly fee (that was not nearly as much as what WoW would ask you to pay, but still, I had to pay it), but the game itself was great. The problem was that unfortunately, the servers were devoid of players, because most wakfu players would have been Dofus players and I think that the beta of Wakfu did really badly with tons of bugs etc. So I eventually dropped the game, like GW2, if you want, and went for something else. You cannot guess how surprised I was to see this game coming on steamplay xD.Well, I for one think that this is the best thing Ankama (french gaming company who did Dofus and Wakfu) could have done. Byt doing this not only will their number of players multiply by 100 (it was that low) but the game will be revived. As I understand it, now, there is no need for monthly payment (which I find is great) and you can just enjoy a great game for free.***********     THE REVIEW AT THE STATE THE GAME WAS IN 4 MONTHS AGO    ***********                       ( not much has changed except for an extra playable character )Now I keep saying great game, but what makes this game so great? many, many things.I think the first word to describe this game would be innovative, it is struggling to do something no MMO has ever done.+ Everyone has their own player house FROM THE BEGINNING and it can be upgraded and decorated through quests, achievements and dungeon battles.+ It has a very extensive job system. (it really is, trust me, you don't?  prepare to cut wood, fish, kill monsters, create monsters, plant trees, plant herbs/pick herbs, cereals (not the same skill tree), mine, craft potions, food and drink, weapons and armor, and bags and even house decorations. Each job comes with a skill tree which when ugraded allows you to pick and plant more resources/ make better gear.+ A very advanced ecosystem if all you do is cut a certain type of tree and no one else around you is planting some, prepare to be sued by the government for being anti ecologist. I also strongly advise not to cut down endangered species as that WILL lower your citizenship rating and you will eventually become an outlaw. Your chances of succesfully planting a plant will be mitigated by the weather, some plants like it sunny, others not so much.+ And to follow up on that point, an extremely well thought out political system. There is a government for each faction (there are four) on each server, in which there is a governor, and maybe 6-7 ministers (defence, ecology, economy, war... ). The governor's job is mainly two things, to go to war and to decide whih laws are in place or not. There are maybe 30 laws that can be turned off or on and that affect the daily life of the citizenry. The political system is extremely important because the government itself will organise events, and issue the tax levels on the different areas of the game. The government can spend the money gained this way in different ways: to control the weather in some areas, to edict new laws, to organise more events...+ War can be declared between factions, following that will be a grand scale battle between the said factions to conquer islands that aren't their home ones, knowing that a conquered island comes with benefits for the controlling faction.+ A Great strategic battle system which encourages you to be more tactical and not button spam like most MMO these days. there are 15  (originally there were twelve, then there were 14, and after I stopped playing they added in another one so 15) classes, each with a different skillset and abilities.+ A great variety of monsters who are also affected by the ecosystem. You can collect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from species and then use it to spawn new monsters into the world.Well, thats all I can think of for the good points, now to the negative points-  Back in the day, each class was nerfed or augmented every day, which made for a very hazy game experience, I do not know if they still do that however I doubt that they have yet found the perfect balance between the 14 characters (now 15) as there are always some who will outperform the rest.-  In game shop. Not much to say here, i'm just putting it here because that's basically a negative aspect of any game and yes there are some things you can get from the shop that make you more powerful, so it's NOT just cosmetic, but its really not indispensable.- Still some occasionnal bugs, but nothing major.- There is a main story, but it is completely seperated from the rest of the game for some unknown reason. I would have preferred a story implemented in the rest of the game.-/+ The lack of actual quests can be a bit annoying at first but I guess the presence of dynamic events (like in guild wars 2) makes it a bit better.Yeah so I guess that's it, I hope you read it all and that it was helpful. Of course don't try this if you hate turn based strategy, but if you don't, even if you're not sure after reading my review, just try it, it's free ;)******************** WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW ********************Unfortunately Ankama doesnt give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it's French player base (when we are the ones who have been supporting the game for 2 years) and does not let french accounts (like mine) play the game from Steam at all when Steam is the place to play it because of the newly found international playerbase. I think this is a stupid and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move and I am forced to thumbs down this game because of this. The game itself is still loved, but I cant thumbs up a game I can't play.***********************UPDATE AS OF 20/02 ************************Ankama FINALLY stopped their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! It took them 2 years! but now the game is finally free to play for all!! (changing my review form negative to positive as a result)  :D			"

												Do you like Fire Emblem? Final Fantasy Tactics? Luminous Arc or any other SRPG's? Then this is the MMO for you!Unlike other SRPG's Wakfu task you with not controling a batallion of pretty simple characters, but instead a singular complex character. Your hero will have muliple attacks and buffs they will have to manage to achive peek performance.However the game will allow you to use Side kicks. These guys act as secondary party members and while not as complex ( Usually ) they still have at least three different attacks. The starter Side Kick has 3 attacks, a heavy, a light and an attack that will let it fly across the map at higher levels. It might be your starter but he'll be a strong companion till even late into the game.You can have 2 side kicks, which will allow you to easily play up till around level 100, which is half way to the level cap.All in all this is a REALLY fun game, I recomend you take a look yourself. Oh and watch the anime too it's very good.			"

												The best free tactical MMORPG with the best 2D MMORPG artstyle.Highly customizable characters, pretty much every piece of gear has an in-game model.It gets really mechanic-heavy as you progress through the levels, having 5 spells of 3 different elements, and a bunch of passive and active special skill as well as some class-restricted special skills, both of which can be leveled up as you desire giving you a lot of different gameplay options for each class; this becomes even more in-depth considering the game has 15 different classes.A lot of pets, mounts, companions and emotes to obtain (and buy, sadly) and a very big world with a lot of dungeons to explore.The only con for this game is the fact that there are amost no side-quests other than the mercenary works that aren't very rewarding and the drop hunting quests which are very repetitive and don't have much substance to them (this changes once you start the big quests for the main areas, but is still a big problem that wouldn't be too hard to adress), which makes the -neccesary- grinding pretty boring.

												What the hell am I doing with my life?This game isn't bad, per say. It's just . . . not original.Before the fans bleed out of the ceiling tiles and throw snowballs at my face, let me explain:The ""revolutionary"" turn-based combat system was created LONG ago in Final Fantasy Tactics for GameBoy Advance.The ""Open-World"" MMORPG was done in EVERY MMORPG since UO.The only thing that is remotely unique are the characters and story lines - and those are sterotypical of the anime/manga books printed since the early 1980's.Is this the best COLLECTION of items thrown together for people to play at once? Perhaps.But it desperately needs more people playing. And by ""people"" I mean ""real players,"" not kids home from elementary school killing time before dinner and common-core homework.Give it a shot, it's free; there's nothing to lose except a few brain cells and an hour or two of game time for a fun little mashed game. Play it, learn the cheesy block/turn/action style combat system, and see how things progress. Just be warned, WAFKU demands a micromanagement of damn near everything....			"

												Took a minute to get use to game play style.   So far it keeps me interested moving through each goal (i guess  you could call them quests).  I'm not particularly interested in the story line, but game play is fun and reminds me of a FF7 meets EverQuest.  Background sounds are overly repetitive and can get annoying.  Low game play time so far, I'll update the review after leveling up a few more times.   So far i like it, fun play and nice toon graphics, nice turn based combat outweighs any cons so far. If you enjoy MMO and clicker games, this is a fairly casual easy to play MMO clicker.. and its free at the moment!   4 out of 5 stars...  -1 only for repetitive background sounds can ruin some immersion.

												An adventure game, indeed. There are so many places to explore, even hidden places which you have to have eagle eyes to find out, or just... look for them on wiki.Classes and professions are still, and always, unique features in Wakfu itself. A class can have several ways of buillding based on 3 elemental skills. Character can become a chef, a fisher, a baker, a farmer and even a tailor. All resources are from nature such as plants, monsters. And every player must preserve them and keep the nature balance by planting the seed of natural things.The story is quite good. The latest updates show more about the new script that is very interesting.As a player that have re-installed Wakfu so many times since it was not released on steam, I will have it 9.8/10.			"

												A game that is not pay to win Like path of exile, dota 2, League of Legends, and so forth you don't need to spend penny for equipments, just mostly for cosmetics and politics.Good game for people who likes Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Black Matrix, Summon Night, and other games similar to it.Class imbalance is one of the problems, but it isn't that hard as most MMOs.Game became pay to win now and I quit playing, sucks as it used to be sucha good game.

												Had to Edit this review due to massive changes in the game since it was written. Prior to this, it was 57 of 67 Helpful, and I recommended it.However, due to these changes, I can no longer recommend this trainwreck of a game.It seemed like they made such good decisions with the initial steam release. Class fixes/overhauls to make them useful and fun again, removal of most of the ""pay to even play let alone win"" mechanics.But then they redid a number of classes, again. Including my beloved Zookeeper Osa. What once was the only class I genuinely enjoyed, with a stable full of pets I could summon 3 or 4 pets at once with, has been transformed into a shadow of it's former self with only a single pet allowed, some stupid new buff/energy system, and all my previous skills (and thus my gear) being rendered mostly useless.This is on top of the LOOOOOOOOONG-awaited ""Hero"" system turning out to be complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everyone was expecting this new system that let you use Alt chars on the same account as Sidekicks/Party Members, since previously, everyone had multiple accounts anyways with alts in their party - so we figured, ""Cool, they're going to implement a system to make this official and easier on both us and the servers.""WRONG. The Hero system is a monthly subscription, which costs more per-char you want to add, and highly overpriced. People were waiting for this to come out and be the game-saver, what made the community skyrocket, instead, people quit in droves, major cities that once had dozens or hundreds of shop bags out are now empty, and the pop has dropped outside of the French servers.They also took the main neutral gathering point, the Temple in Astrub, and literally deleted the entire area where everyone had their shop bags and socialized and had duels at, so there's no room to do anything social there anymore. The developers. actively. removed. socialization. On purpose.What was once a good, fun little game has been destroyed by terrible decisions. RIP Wakfu.			"

												Do you like cute art styles and are capable of over looking more then 200 hours of grinding while listening to various remixs of music no one has ever heard of while doing the same robotic task with possible glitchs and stupid mini games that actually have an effect as to have a reason for you to keep an eye on the screen at all times?. Great!. Then read on and prepare for a completly random review.The gameplay is turn based grid based game with all the stragrindy of having higher numbers then what ever misshappen remixed abomination from kinder children on acid with some slang swears and lewd sexual content only those within the teenage and dirty mind will understand type of creatures.Armed with all the spells you could want ""about 15 total for each class 20 for huppermage"" that allows diverse switching of tactics with a wide arsenal of elemental attacks ""3 of whice you will actually use"".With a job system that takes for f**king ever to amount to anything and minor cases of Ptsd Ocd and emotinal stress of watching your waifu endure endless in what ever mundane task you can think of from planting trees cutting wheat to mineing fixed placed self regenerting material blocks for ores ""most of whice you will delete cause you just want to make money and its useless"".With the classes being seperated into ones whice you play if you have friends and others if you don't become a one man army or a severaly crippled low level scrub that barely manages to get by in the worst and worlds most broken econamy since post obama.With all the weapon selection whice amp your abilitys you can increase even further... your abilitys! ""no one actually uses weapons we just use them for stat boosts like armour, only use a weapon if you feel like wasteing time and showing off your sweet sweet swag"".With the ability to grind Grind! GRIND!! you too can become a low level player still stuck around level 50 out of ""200 i think"" cause you have no f**king idea how to level up properly and there is no average guides worth reading after you have actually started the game and planned it all in advance.Beat up hapless monsters and make your way haphazardly through the world of... uh... grid based tile sets whice become a real pain to navigate as you will only be useing the mouse to move!, thats right DOTA fans, left click to move right for actions! ""though in Dota its actually the other way around but really who cares?"".Join up with a dwindling community as we try to uphold the game with all the minor and worthless value it has and is waiting for!, play for a few days, take break for a few months, repeat again and again as the replay value ""nothing"" becomes so boring you actually have more fun not playing the  game!.But for those who are persistant, brave, and or have no lives, come play with us, where we will completly ignore you as were to busy trying to work around the absolutely horrible player priceing commonly found in Mmo's but with less players and rarer gear worth even more!.It has some good sides but iv forgetten half of them and can't be bothered with minor details, really its a typical Mmo all things considered its small it runs well and it does have an enjoyment factor though you will find it much greater if you have some friends decide to roll play or not and actually work together, apart from that you will find yourself feeling lonely like many other Mmo's where even in the busiest market places no one actually bothers to openly sell stuff ""except outside a giant church in neutral territory cause you will want to collect your token each day you log in"".This in its own way could be counted as a beutiful flawed master piece, and if they fixed some $hit it would be even better and attract more players thus enchancing the game, but its made in french... france. Sacré blu its one of those two!. So good luck trying to suggest anything to the devs.Waifu. I mean Wakfu! - 6.5/10			"

												Addictive , Connection issues ,bugs.At first ,this mmo is well disguised until you realize later it's P2W.Majority toxic players community with few exceptions.Private area with subscription.Private class access with subscription.The company are reputed to have a poor support both for those who report bugs,suggestions feedback or problems with purchases.Always turning a convenient blind eye with failures update and duplicate itens rather than admit to correct the problem and ban.I already was took advantage of a flaw in an update, which committed crimes in nations,but no one can attack me(aggro), making intentionally to see how far it would go. Result: a lot of pampered players cursing me, complaining me instead to require the company Ankama that fix their updates faults.It took a while until developers fixing, even with the bug reported, it shows how the player base are crying kids, while Ankama not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥and takes advantage of immaturity to make profit no matter what way the game take.Conclusion: Wakfu is a good strategy turn-based and beloved mmorpg game which was destroyed by your company Ankama  and the player base community.It is very difficult to see a mmorpg that you like, going to deteriorate gradually. See people with whom played for so long discouraged and giving up the game.Then you start to think about everything and compensates continue or not.A part of you will say it was a lost time wasted.... But another part of you will say that it worth it to have known and play along with amazing friends, experienced together adventures in the game. If someone has something like that in other mmorpgs will really know what I'm talking about....			"

Either way this game is probably one of the best games ive ever played and will gladly restart just so I may enjoy the experiance of being part of such an amazing world that the company ankama has given us honest rate 4.5/5 *'s			"

												-the time played is of course false, Id say I've spent about 150 hours in game? -********** INTRODUCTION - A BIT OF HISTORY ***********Now I was a player of Wakfu back in the day (in 2012, like everyone here) and frankly the game was good. now sure, I had to pay a monthly fee (that was not nearly as much as what WoW would ask you to pay, but still, I had to pay it), but the game itself was great. The problem was that unfortunately, the servers were devoid of players, because most wakfu players would have been Dofus players and I think that the beta of Wakfu did really badly with tons of bugs etc. So I eventually dropped the game, like GW2, if you want, and went for something else. You cannot guess how surprised I was to see this game coming on steamplay xD.Well, I for one think that this is the best thing Ankama (french gaming company who did Dofus and Wakfu) could have done. Byt doing this not only will their number of players multiply by 100 (it was that low) but the game will be revived. As I understand it, now, there is no need for monthly payment (which I find is great) and you can just enjoy a great game for free.***********     THE REVIEW AT THE STATE THE GAME WAS IN 4 MONTHS AGO    ***********                       ( not much has changed except for an extra playable character )Now I keep saying great game, but what makes this game so great? many, many things.I think the first word to describe this game would be innovative, it is struggling to do something no MMO has ever done.+ Everyone has their own player house FROM THE BEGINNING and it can be upgraded and decorated through quests, achievements and dungeon battles.+ It has a very extensive job system. (it really is, trust me, you don't?  prepare to cut wood, fish, kill monsters, create monsters, plant trees, plant herbs/pick herbs, cereals (not the same skill tree), mine, craft potions, food and drink, weapons and armor, and bags and even house decorations. Each job comes with a skill tree which when ugraded allows you to pick and plant more resources/ make better gear.+ A very advanced ecosystem if all you do is cut a certain type of tree and no one else around you is planting some, prepare to be sued by the government for being anti ecologist. I also strongly advise not to cut down endangered species as that WILL lower your citizenship rating and you will eventually become an outlaw. Your chances of succesfully planting a plant will be mitigated by the weather, some plants like it sunny, others not so much.+ And to follow up on that point, an extremely well thought out political system. There is a government for each faction (there are four) on each server, in which there is a governor, and maybe 6-7 ministers (defence, ecology, economy, war... ). The governor's job is mainly two things, to go to war and to decide whih laws are in place or not. There are maybe 30 laws that can be turned off or on and that affect the daily life of the citizenry. The political system is extremely important because the government itself will organise events, and issue the tax levels on the different areas of the game. The government can spend the money gained this way in different ways: to control the weather in some areas, to edict new laws, to organise more events...+ War can be declared between factions, following that will be a grand scale battle between the said factions to conquer islands that aren't their home ones, knowing that a conquered island comes with benefits for the controlling faction.+ A Great strategic battle system which encourages you to be more tactical and not button spam like most MMO these days. there are 15  (originally there were twelve, then there were 14, and after I stopped playing they added in another one so 15) classes, each with a different skillset and abilities.+ A great variety of monsters who are also affected by the ecosystem. You can collect♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from species and then use it to spawn new monsters into the world.Well, thats all I can think of for the good points, now to the negative points-  Back in the day, each class was nerfed or augmented every day, which made for a very hazy game experience, I do not know if they still do that however I doubt that they have yet found the perfect balance between the 14 characters (now 15) as there are always some who will outperform the rest.-  In game shop. Not much to say here, i'm just putting it here because that's basically a negative aspect of any game and yes there are some things you can get from the shop that make you more powerful, so it's NOT just cosmetic, but its really not indispensable.- Still some occasionnal bugs, but nothing major.- There is a main story, but it is completely seperated from the rest of the game for some unknown reason. I would have preferred a story implemented in the rest of the game.-/+ The lack of actual quests can be a bit annoying at first but I guess the presence of dynamic events (like in guild wars 2) makes it a bit better.Yeah so I guess that's it, I hope you read it all and that it was helpful. Of course don't try this if you hate turn based strategy, but if you don't, even if you're not sure after reading my review, just try it, it's free ;)******************** WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW ********************Unfortunately Ankama doesnt give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it's French player base (when we are the ones who have been supporting the game for 2 years) and does not let french accounts (like mine) play the game from Steam at all when Steam is the place to play it because of the newly found international playerbase. I think this is a stupid and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move and I am forced to thumbs down this game because of this. The game itself is still loved, but I cant thumbs up a game I can't play.***********************UPDATE AS OF 20/02 ************************Ankama FINALLY stopped their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! It took them 2 years! but now the game is finally free to play for all!! (changing my review form negative to positive as a result)  :D			"

												I am playing Dofus (The best game of Ankama *for me* and the game that tells the beggining of the story of twelve gods and things like that. İ recommend that game too but it's p2p) since 2009. Things have changed since then. But i remember how i was excited for a new releasing game named ""Wakfu"". I was watching the videos of Wakfu all day and nights. At first when i downloaded it, i didn't like it. Because it wasn't like Dofus. It had lots of different things. But i started to understand things in the game. İt had a new skills system (and i liked it most). Whatever, i recommend this game because i have a reasonless love for ankama games and i think these games are the best MMORPG ever. You can do anything you want, choose a profession, join a guild, fight against monsters (most of them are not like monsters) or players, improve your character the way you want and reach the 200. level. (And if you be able to do that don't think game is finished. The game's real fun is starting at 200. level)			"

												An adventure game, indeed. There are so many places to explore, even hidden places which you have to have eagle eyes to find out, or just... look for them on wiki.Classes and professions are still, and always, unique features in Wakfu itself. A class can have several ways of buillding based on 3 elemental skills. Character can become a chef, a fisher, a baker, a farmer and even a tailor. All resources are from nature such as plants, monsters. And every player must preserve them and keep the nature balance by planting the seed of natural things.The story is quite good. The latest updates show more about the new script that is very interesting.As a player that have re-installed Wakfu so many times since it was not released on steam, I will have it 9.8/10.			"

												So, this game has kind of gone to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ now. They force you to pay to use sidekicks, and/or heroes. I could may understand the hero thing, but not paying for sidekicks.I like to play this game alone, and this changes the game to be find people to play with, or pay to play.♥♥♥♥ these greedy developers cutting out core features to resell them as additions. What a joke. GG Wakfu, glad I wasted money on you.---Former Review below----This game is very complex and so rewarding when you become good at it. Pulling off a combo of spells, and ending your turn in just the perfect position on the battle map to escape any counter attack feels awesome. There are very many ways you can play each class, and they are VERY, VERY unique.The one thing I would hold against this game is that it is a bit grindy, and last time I played there just weren't enough people, that and all the haven worlds are taken up already so playing in these worlds just feels you got late to a party and there is no cake left. (in a way)Eiether way, this game is awesome, and if you have friends who like RPG's this game will be an awesome time, and will deliver. I highly recommend it.1 last thing, why isn't there a proper minimap? @.@			"

												Wakfu is not a game; its a lifestyle.  where your actions effect the whole of a mmo world. there is many things you can do, from crafting or performing a profession such as armorer, or farming. or defeating dungeons useing a tactical rpg format. after 2 overhauls of the way skills work and how stats are effected, the game is more balanced.  in addition to skills making more sence, and easy to upgrade them from lvling. i like the feature of the haven bag/world. haveing your own extra storage that you can carry along with you; customize with bedroom sets, garden gems(for growing stuff), and crafting tables-so you can do professions or craft on the go/collect and save plants for later use. what i dont like is that the official site gives more buyable options-even though donation rewards overall dont overpower your progression over others in any big or lasting way. i would like the option to change my name or get any of the other things steam wakfu shop doesnt have that official site shop does.       but after going over merit and flaw balance, then compared to other games of style type or what is available during this era of gaming, i give it a 8/10.  and definately recommend other to pick it up and play it.

												This is a good game.Where to start. First of all,wakfu is a multi media idea. There are shows,comics,and the game. Of course,this is gonna be about the game.The creators appear to have worked their best to keep the game from a p2w platform,as all the thingd you can buy in the shop are either cosmetic or has severe downsides to it,such as the garden haven gem. Gardening in the world gives you experience toward Farming or Lumberjack,depending on if you're tending to trees or crops,but planting things in your haven bag grants no xp to the skills. All of the armor in the shop is also cosmetic,and everything has to be earned,whether you like it or not. The closest thing to a p2w is subscriber status,which grants you bonus items after a fight and more XP after a fight,along with a potion that makes crafting easier. In short,wakfu is a game where you CAN buy things with real money,but they are only minor things that make things more convenient while also introducing a downside to those conveniences. A good amount of store items can also be earned,such as a garden haven gem being able to be gotten by praying at the Almanax Altar for 60 days in a row,or completing certain dungeins.			"

												I've played Dofus years ago and enjoyed every minute of it. I can say the same about Wakfu. There's a lot of freedom, fun and enjoyable content in this game. Turn based combat forces you to think alot about your moves and lets you plan your movement in the future turns. The world is huge and well done. Another feature that should be noticed is that there's no NPC shops. There's an auction house, where people create economy and dictate prices. I also enjoy profession and crafting system. I find leveling up my crafting/harvesting skills very enjoyable. All in all, I could talk a lot about this game, but you should try it for yourselves. After all, it's free to play.			"

												Wakfu with as much expereince as someone like has had with game i belive i can give my honest opinion on this game.First off if your one of those tryhards that like to go solo and randomly own people in pvp and say IM A DIAMOND ONE SMURF GET REKT NUBS fuq off. This game is main focused around tactical combat no real skillshot no fighting game mechanics like street fighter just take turn plan ahead.Of course this game has something to make yourself UNIQUE FABULOS or that one weirdo that runs around in a pink suit asking wemon if they seen his pet snuggles(aka me). This game is why i even have freinds ( the little i have) Mainly cause this game is pretty damn dull if you play on your own But if you can get into a party it can be stupid fun especally when you can combine atacks with freinds to make some stupid combos or synergyOf course this game has flaws you can activate pvp and have some random guy 50 levels above you come and one shot you. Or worst of all be forever alone which is one of the worst things you can have in this game but thats where nations come in you can do stuff like plant trees fish cook killyourself make cabbages go clean your house get out the house and many things.Or you can go into you magical sack of maginess where you can hide all your secret weed plants and invite people to come see whats in your bag and give them a special suprise like having a million trees planted in there.Or activate pvp and bash their heads in at complete random either wayi give this game a You need freinds/10 go try it its fun for everyone.

												This game undoubtedly used to be better, before specific updates and a mass of players leaving. Sometimes it just feel like a singleplayer game until another players happens to pass by you; it feels like a ghost town. Nonetheless, it's still an extremely fun game, and I definitely recommend it to people who like any strategic, tactical games, like Fire Emblem for example.			"

												Had to Edit this review due to massive changes in the game since it was written. Prior to this, it was 57 of 67 Helpful, and I recommended it.However, due to these changes, I can no longer recommend this trainwreck of a game.It seemed like they made such good decisions with the initial steam release. Class fixes/overhauls to make them useful and fun again, removal of most of the ""pay to even play let alone win"" mechanics.But then they redid a number of classes, again. Including my beloved Zookeeper Osa. What once was the only class I genuinely enjoyed, with a stable full of pets I could summon 3 or 4 pets at once with, has been transformed into a shadow of it's former self with only a single pet allowed, some stupid new buff/energy system, and all my previous skills (and thus my gear) being rendered mostly useless.This is on top of the LOOOOOOOOONG-awaited ""Hero"" system turning out to be complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everyone was expecting this new system that let you use Alt chars on the same account as Sidekicks/Party Members, since previously, everyone had multiple accounts anyways with alts in their party - so we figured, ""Cool, they're going to implement a system to make this official and easier on both us and the servers.""WRONG. The Hero system is a monthly subscription, which costs more per-char you want to add, and highly overpriced. People were waiting for this to come out and be the game-saver, what made the community skyrocket, instead, people quit in droves, major cities that once had dozens or hundreds of shop bags out are now empty, and the pop has dropped outside of the French servers.They also took the main neutral gathering point, the Temple in Astrub, and literally deleted the entire area where everyone had their shop bags and socialized and had duels at, so there's no room to do anything social there anymore. The developers. actively. removed. socialization. On purpose.What was once a good, fun little game has been destroyed by terrible decisions. RIP Wakfu.			"

												I have sunk a lot of time in this game, well for my standards. I do play it daily. I guess you think that it says what I think about the game. Not really :D The game has its problems, that mainly being bugs. But all in all, playing until lvl 100 I recommend, it's somehow far more fun in that lvl range, after you cross over that barrier and start heading to the mystical land of lvl 200... let me just tell you, that if you don't have a group to play with daily, you won't reach it (unless you make like extra accounts to help out run high lvl dungs... not a fun option, but an option nonetheless) It's just grindy and not many other options to choose from if you are on your own, then again, this is a multiplayer game :D So, this being a free to play game, just give it a try.

												Actually, when I downloaded the game I though I wouldn't like it, as I don't quite like the turn-based strategical combat, but I was incredibly surprised how fun the game turned out to be. I still didn't play much, as I just started, but I have to say that the game is HUGE in every possible way and offers lots of possiblilities. The community is the nicest I've ever met and the graphics are beautiful, too.Now, it's even better if you like the animated series :DCompletely recommended for everyone to try, even he he usually doesn't like this type of games.

												First of all most games that you can play these days are easy mode meaning it doesn't take much to get to the end game.  Most F2P games ask you to spend everything you have to get ahead, including the shirt on your back. This game isn't either. It takes a lot of effort to level up and everyone is equal (not P2W). Ya sure there are perks to this game when you buy booster packs but it's not a lot in the way that it would put you at a higher class than others so you can be OP. It's well balanced with good graphics and music. It even has some humor in it to make you laugh. So if you want a game to take your mind off things (spend hours out of reality and beat things up to exact your fustration), need a good laugh, see graphics that are pleasing to the eye, and maybe even feel like dancing to good tunes then this game is for YOU! It's a well balanced turn based game so some may not like it but for those who like or even love turn based games then give this a try. What will it hurt?? :-)			"

												--Edit--As of the update to 1.43 myself as well as several other people I've talked to in-game have not been able to purchase the in-game currency for their shop (Ogrines). I attempted to report the issue to Ankama support but they were rude and dismissive, sending me to Steam support saying my account was being restricted per the ""Trading and Market Restrictions"" (found at https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1047-EDFM-2932 ).I forwarded them a screenshot of my purchase history and explained how this policy did not affect me based on my purchase history. They responded with this:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Please accept our sincerest apologies.However, we have already endorsed this case to a higher level of customer support. Unfortunately, they have made their decision and have stated it as final. Therefore, we are unable to reverse it or force a different outcome. We understand that decision is not according to your expectations.As per our previous message, we are unfortunately not able to provide you more assistance on this issue.For a breakdown of the new purchase restrictions enforced by Steam, they are as follows:+Steam accounts are not allowed any purchase unless they had a successful purchase older than 30 days but not older than 1 year.+The successful purchase (meaning the transaction was not cancelled or refunded) of wallet funds, games, DLCs and software meet this requirement.+Retail CD key activations and gift purchases do not meet this requirement and will not lift the purchase restrictions on a Steam account.Please opt to contact the Steam Customer Support for further assistance. Apologies for the inconvenience.Kind regards,------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I will update this review whenever I get the problem solved, but as for now I am at my wits end. I cannot recommend the game until they show better commitment to solving (at least) paying customer's issues in a timely manner.--Edit End--I love this game. It's artwork is amazing, It has an almost entirely player driven world from the ecosystem to nations ruled by PCs. Wars are fought as much through ecoterrorism as face to face combat. There are a multitude of guilds which fill in gameplay between storyline quests (if the national dramas aren't enough!) The system can be a bit buggy as stated in previous reviews but no-where near the point where the game loses playability. It is turn-based but there is also a turn timer which keeps things moving fairly well. The classes don't quite use traditional roles (tank, dps, healer, ect.) per say. In many cases you CAN build your character to strictly fill one of these roles and you'll find tons of guides on the Ankama forums to help you do so. That being said, MOST classes you can build to fill one or two roles successfully or a well rounded solo character that has just as good playability and balance in a group filling a role.The game is great, it gets monthly updates, it blends with an anime that even further immerses you into the World of Twelve. And it's highly addictive. 10/10 all around. Give it a shot and you'll be hooked!			"

												I would recommend this game as I like to play this game a lot ... so far in my list of games this my favourite.But.... its quite a complex game where you can do so many things. I still haven't figured everything out. I feel I still have a long way to go... but that is good because then the game won't end quickly. I like the fact that it is open world and multiplayer but I don't have people to play with. It would be very helpful because I need to fight and level up and grow further in this game. If anyone needs someone to play with just let me know. I am part of a clan but only did something together once. I am glad there are guides for this game but I haven't used it as yet because I don't know where to start as this game is very big and you don't do things in a chronological pattern.I also think my game is a bit buggy because I can't take screenshots even thought it says I can press F12. I hope steam fix this soon as I would like to take some screenshots of my favourite game.			"

												Personally I just find this game iffy. There's just something about the way the spells and attacking are done in this game that bugs me. Most of the time I find myself constantly spamming an attack and never using ym others as they'd make the fight go longer. I feel no sense of planning and well thought out strategies when playing this. This has nothing to do with it being turn based as I've played tons of turn based games that have never felt like a bore fest.			"

												Took a minute to get use to game play style.   So far it keeps me interested moving through each goal (i guess  you could call them quests).  I'm not particularly interested in the story line, but game play is fun and reminds me of a FF7 meets EverQuest.  Background sounds are overly repetitive and can get annoying.  Low game play time so far, I'll update the review after leveling up a few more times.   So far i like it, fun play and nice toon graphics, nice turn based combat outweighs any cons so far. If you enjoy MMO and clicker games, this is a fairly casual easy to play MMO clicker.. and its free at the moment!   4 out of 5 stars...  -1 only for repetitive background sounds can ruin some immersion.

												this game!!i am a final fantasy lover! i played all of them! (just to clear my point of view here)this game, it has lots of classes, with lots of differences!it has a class which lets you capture monsters to fight for you!!! (total win for me)you can just grind on monsters if you arent much into quests, you can level really well on those!so far, every single monster you fight, gives you its own equipment set o.o xD (sounds a bit like monster hunter? RIGHT!)kill a sheep! get a sheep equipment set, kill a pink bird, get a pink feather like set!i really love that ideayou can craft a LOT, you can run around, plant trees and flowers, sure other players will just take those trees or flowers away from the ground, but you can just replant them again if you got enough seedstry to make it YOUR world with YOUR pretty or ugly flowers! maybe the others wont be high enough gardener level to destroy your beautiful landscape idea XDwell okay, its mainly just ingredients for craftingif im not in the mood to fight monsters etc, ill just run around, take seeds from flowers and plant them all over the world to get my gardener level higher :Dbtw, you can even get .... ugh... monster seeds (i know, it does sound weird saying it that way)you can plant those seeds into the ground to grow your own monsters!but i think it only works in areas where those monsters actually are, you cant grow lv 20 monsters in the lv1 area (sad xD)IF you are a solo player and HATE teaming up with others like i do, you can just be weird, pay a bit of money in the cashop and be allowed to use 2 others of YOUR characters for your team, that way you have a 3 player team which you alone control, yes, you heard right, you can make up a team by yourself ;) perfect for anti-social people like me xD(it doesnt stay forever tho, its like 2 euro per week, cheaper if you buy it for longer, but i guess you know how that works)CON!1. the monster you capture, does NOT level up with you, it stays at the level where you capture it, which means, you wont be able to keep your favorite pet till high level because it will be really really weak then.... (really sad...)2. you cant keep your favorite look in the game because the set items get weak, there is no way to preserve the look of an item (as most other mmo's do) so you end up looking really ugly in the end because of 'high-stat-item-ugly-look' stuff "

												Addictive , Connection issues ,bugs.At first ,this mmo is well disguised until you realize later it's P2W.Majority toxic players community with few exceptions.Private area with subscription.Private class access with subscription.The company are reputed to have a poor support both for those who report bugs,suggestions feedback or problems with purchases.Always turning a convenient blind eye with failures update and duplicate itens rather than admit to correct the problem and ban.I already was took advantage of a flaw in an update, which committed crimes in nations,but no one can attack me(aggro), making intentionally to see how far it would go. Result: a lot of pampered players cursing me, complaining me instead to require the company Ankama that fix their updates faults.It took a while until developers fixing, even with the bug reported, it shows how the player base are crying kids, while Ankama not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥and takes advantage of immaturity to make profit no matter what way the game take.Conclusion: Wakfu is a good strategy turn-based and beloved mmorpg game which was destroyed by your company Ankama  and the player base community.It is very difficult to see a mmorpg that you like, going to deteriorate gradually. See people with whom played for so long discouraged and giving up the game.Then you start to think about everything and compensates continue or not.A part of you will say it was a lost time wasted.... But another part of you will say that it worth it to have known and play along with amazing friends, experienced together adventures in the game. If someone has something like that in other mmorpgs will really know what I'm talking about....			"

												Do you like cute art styles and are capable of over looking more then 200 hours of grinding while listening to various remixs of music no one has ever heard of while doing the same robotic task with possible glitchs and stupid mini games that actually have an effect as to have a reason for you to keep an eye on the screen at all times?. Great!. Then read on and prepare for a completly random review.The gameplay is turn based grid based game with all the stragrindy of having higher numbers then what ever misshappen remixed abomination from kinder children on acid with some slang swears and lewd sexual content only those within the teenage and dirty mind will understand type of creatures.Armed with all the spells you could want ""about 15 total for each class 20 for huppermage"" that allows diverse switching of tactics with a wide arsenal of elemental attacks ""3 of whice you will actually use"".With a job system that takes for f**king ever to amount to anything and minor cases of Ptsd Ocd and emotinal stress of watching your waifu endure endless in what ever mundane task you can think of from planting trees cutting wheat to mineing fixed placed self regenerting material blocks for ores ""most of whice you will delete cause you just want to make money and its useless"".With the classes being seperated into ones whice you play if you have friends and others if you don't become a one man army or a severaly crippled low level scrub that barely manages to get by in the worst and worlds most broken econamy since post obama.With all the weapon selection whice amp your abilitys you can increase even further... your abilitys! ""no one actually uses weapons we just use them for stat boosts like armour, only use a weapon if you feel like wasteing time and showing off your sweet sweet swag"".With the ability to grind Grind! GRIND!! you too can become a low level player still stuck around level 50 out of ""200 i think"" cause you have no f**king idea how to level up properly and there is no average guides worth reading after you have actually started the game and planned it all in advance.Beat up hapless monsters and make your way haphazardly through the world of... uh... grid based tile sets whice become a real pain to navigate as you will only be useing the mouse to move!, thats right DOTA fans, left click to move right for actions! ""though in Dota its actually the other way around but really who cares?"".Join up with a dwindling community as we try to uphold the game with all the minor and worthless value it has and is waiting for!, play for a few days, take break for a few months, repeat again and again as the replay value ""nothing"" becomes so boring you actually have more fun not playing the  game!.But for those who are persistant, brave, and or have no lives, come play with us, where we will completly ignore you as were to busy trying to work around the absolutely horrible player priceing commonly found in Mmo's but with less players and rarer gear worth even more!.It has some good sides but iv forgetten half of them and can't be bothered with minor details, really its a typical Mmo all things considered its small it runs well and it does have an enjoyment factor though you will find it much greater if you have some friends decide to roll play or not and actually work together, apart from that you will find yourself feeling lonely like many other Mmo's where even in the busiest market places no one actually bothers to openly sell stuff ""except outside a giant church in neutral territory cause you will want to collect your token each day you log in"".This in its own way could be counted as a beutiful flawed master piece, and if they fixed some $hit it would be even better and attract more players thus enchancing the game, but its made in french... france. Sacré blu its one of those two!. So good luck trying to suggest anything to the devs.Waifu. I mean Wakfu! - 6.5/10			"

												This game is actually full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I'm updating this sentence and not giving an EFF beyond that. There are a few issues though. Mostly not being able to turn the combat screen for a better vantage point. But if I had to say there was anything wrong with this game in all seriousness, it would only be the players themselves. Lots of jackasses on Nox. But that's common in these kinds of games. Though, if you're not excited about playing you should really watch the Wakfu anime first.			"

As well (hopefully) more attention from the developers.Wakfu has a dedicated and helpful community.Don't join if you dont like most of the written above.			"

												I do and always have supported Wakfu and Ankama productions, however there is several bad things about this company so make sure if you play this game to over look the company and just enjoy the game itself, however the bad things are1. over priced subscription fees (almost 15mth for 30 days membership)2. heros are not worth it in the end because of the cost, but a great addition and a lovely idea, just not worth the money3. customer support, is good, but takes forever to get ahold of them and even longer for a response, but in my experience    they are helpful though I have heard otherwise from others.but the subscription pricing is my biggest problem, id pay 10 a month for both heros and 30days but not 10 for 30 days and another almost 10 for heros			"

												This game has it's ups and downs; there are currently no Steam Achievements for it {Despite the list saying there are}; because the launcher the game uses to keep itself updated does not interweave well with the game. That said, the game is quite fun. It's similar to how the old Final Fantasy Tactics was played due to it's gridline map per battle {the grids size and obstacles change per fight} and it is an increasingly difficult grind to the next dungeon. But it pays off, because now there is an adjustable level system in place to play with friends. You can lower your level temporarily and just help your friends level or go back to your normal level and powercreep them. Players also heavily influence the enviroment which mean that certain things can change; being completely different from when you log off. To top it off, the entire game is FREE! The cash shop and membership for additional bonuses are the only things you can pay for. Don't forget to watch Wakfu the anime on Netflix. You'll see many characters from in-game there!			"

												Warning: This review has nothing to do with the history of the game's development or the decisions of the community/developers. It's an as-is opinion brought about by playing it for 20 something hours. The game in of itself is... interesting. Unique even. The art style is arresting, the combat intriguing, and there is a class/class build for just about every play style. However, there are several unique aspects to the game that will probably put off traditional gamers.First off, the economy within the game is entirely Player driven - you literally have to go out and make the money yourself from ores or from selling goods to people who went out did this themselves. Sometimes monster or a quest might drop some, but nothing routine enough to make the effort worthwhile. There are no NPC shops to buy or sell goods from, there is just an auction house like structure and tons of player run haven shops dotting the streets in the form of bags. Professions seem critical because of this, but judging how much something is worth is up to the player. Expect to slap your forehead for underselling things from time to time. Because of the lack of selling, space in the inventory and in the player storage is at an insane premium - you're going to be juggling gear sets a bit in the beginning to try to squeeze out the AP for battles. This promotes simply destroying stacks of items outright or, if you have space, grinding them into rune dust.This economy leads into the second put off - this game, without a doubt, is a grinding player's wet dream. Battling and grinding are the two primary activities the player partakes in, so it's a darn good thing the player can pick and choose their battles in the overworld. That's right, monsters will lounge about, look cute, or in the case of the male and female sheep monsters, bounce around doing questionable things. That is, until you or another player right clicks on them and initiates the battle. This can be good or bad depending on how you want to look at it, but this does, for the most part, facilitate free exploration. Dungeons, on the other hand, force you to fight through the room's contents before you can proceed. Dungeons are highly deceptive in the fact players can mostly breeze through everything right up until the boss monsters.Speaking of battles, the battle system is simplistically complex. At it's core, it's simply moving your character (and NPC friends if you have any) around the grid battlegorund and using skills on things. The complex part is knowing how to strategically place your character to best use the skills available to your class. The lovely part is you can participate in these battles with friends. In fact, you're really best off bringing friends to this game to begin with. What will become fun/frustrating is the 30 seconds you have to perform your round in combat. This will require some practice if your class requires some setup in your initial turn, but for the most part, 30 seconds does offer a challenge and keeps things flowing.The last put off is research is definitely required. The why lies in the history of the game - some classes were buffed or debuffed according to developer whim. As I was duly inform by a friend who played for a while, in early game this matters little, but if you persist into late game, it can become a source of frustration and irritation.Yes, there are professions in the game and executing them can be a source of irritation and fun - especially when you've joined a Nation (faction) to continue on into the upper levels of the game. I'll leave the fun of this for people to discover because if you've managed to stomach the gross amount of grinding required to equip yourself well in the beginning AND get to level 30+, you're probably going to stay for a good ways in.Would I recommend this game? I certainly recommend giving it a try. The experience of playing it is unique. I won't lie - the battle system, once you're used to it, is fun - assuming you've selected a class you can enjoy (don't worry, you can make up to five characters and delete them at will). However, I do not believe it is a game for the casual player as it requires a lot of time and effort to figure out how to play your class well and grind up the levels and equipment. Equally, it's easy to miss out on a lot of content just by not knowing about it. And there is a huge potential to burn out of 'same thing, different day' like every game has issues with.Ah, and a bit of parting advise: remember to click on the dragoturkey transportation carts when you find them to unlock their usage. Otherwise you'll have to do a lot of running around.			"

												Good game, but Brakma in my server is controlled by shady people, and balancing the ecosystem is hardly a priority in most nations. Other than that, it's great. Just be sure to play with friends or else you will be lonely. :P "

												Decent free-to-play tactical turn-based MMO. Be prepared for a grind, and beware the ecosystem management mechanics, but it's definitely a fun and different game. I definitely recommend at least giving it a try.			"

												This game is totally awesome for hardcore players like myself who is looking for a little bit of grind and strategy but since it's still on region lock I can't play with my guild mates that are on the other servers. so for now I will not recommend this game that is on steam it's better for us to play on the original client that is on wakfu.com because you have the freedom to choose a server to play on. on the plus side this games interface that's on steam is weirdly fast and responsive unlike on the official client.EDIT: after 2 long years now the game is amazing :3 hope you guys have fun in game.

												Warning: This review has nothing to do with the history of the game's development or the decisions of the community/developers. It's an as-is opinion brought about by playing it for 20 something hours. The game in of itself is... interesting. Unique even. The art style is arresting, the combat intriguing, and there is a class/class build for just about every play style. However, there are several unique aspects to the game that will probably put off traditional gamers.First off, the economy within the game is entirely Player driven - you literally have to go out and make the money yourself from ores or from selling goods to people who went out did this themselves. Sometimes monster or a quest might drop some, but nothing routine enough to make the effort worthwhile. There are no NPC shops to buy or sell goods from, there is just an auction house like structure and tons of player run haven shops dotting the streets in the form of bags. Professions seem critical because of this, but judging how much something is worth is up to the player. Expect to slap your forehead for underselling things from time to time. Because of the lack of selling, space in the inventory and in the player storage is at an insane premium - you're going to be juggling gear sets a bit in the beginning to try to squeeze out the AP for battles. This promotes simply destroying stacks of items outright or, if you have space, grinding them into rune dust.This economy leads into the second put off - this game, without a doubt, is a grinding player's wet dream. Battling and grinding are the two primary activities the player partakes in, so it's a darn good thing the player can pick and choose their battles in the overworld. That's right, monsters will lounge about, look cute, or in the case of the male and female sheep monsters, bounce around doing questionable things. That is, until you or another player right clicks on them and initiates the battle. This can be good or bad depending on how you want to look at it, but this does, for the most part, facilitate free exploration. Dungeons, on the other hand, force you to fight through the room's contents before you can proceed. Dungeons are highly deceptive in the fact players can mostly breeze through everything right up until the boss monsters.Speaking of battles, the battle system is simplistically complex. At it's core, it's simply moving your character (and NPC friends if you have any) around the grid battlegorund and using skills on things. The complex part is knowing how to strategically place your character to best use the skills available to your class. The lovely part is you can participate in these battles with friends. In fact, you're really best off bringing friends to this game to begin with. What will become fun/frustrating is the 30 seconds you have to perform your round in combat. This will require some practice if your class requires some setup in your initial turn, but for the most part, 30 seconds does offer a challenge and keeps things flowing.The last put off is research is definitely required. The why lies in the history of the game - some classes were buffed or debuffed according to developer whim. As I was duly inform by a friend who played for a while, in early game this matters little, but if you persist into late game, it can become a source of frustration and irritation.Yes, there are professions in the game and executing them can be a source of irritation and fun - especially when you've joined a Nation (faction) to continue on into the upper levels of the game. I'll leave the fun of this for people to discover because if you've managed to stomach the gross amount of grinding required to equip yourself well in the beginning AND get to level 30+, you're probably going to stay for a good ways in.Would I recommend this game?

												+rep great time killer finally almost completely f2p. If you don't wanna play it competitively you don't even need a subscription to reach max lvl. And it only would cost 40$ per year if you want a subscription. Gud game, great community, you don't get bored that easily if you have a good guild.			"
