												Rome: Total War is the most highly acclaimed game in the Total War series. Upon it's launch, it was apparent that the Total War series had something different to offer to fans of Turn Based Grand Strategy games. In time, it would become known as one of, if not, the best Total War games ever made. You might ask yourself why out of all the newer Total War games is Rome the best? Well, there's several simple reasons.Pros:- Simple design, as it is one of the first TW games- Large, sprawling cities to battle in, but not too detailed so as to distract the player.- The single best Soundtrack you will find in any TW game.- Large map, but not on a ludacris scale such as Rome II.- Great choice of factions- Campaign and battle map look beautiful- This game can be played smoothly at its highest settings on any modern computer- Massive replay valueCons:- [post suggestions in the comment area]Overall:Rome is a nice and simple, beautifully crafted game. It is what CA was praised for in the Total War series. Rome II is way more technical with a great deal more to learn Honestly, the inlons about this game. Just as I have, almost all major and indie critics have given this game a 9/10, 95%, 4.5/5, etc. This was also given ""14th Greatest Game of All Time"" apparently and I do think it deserves it.10/10			"

												RTW has an epic feel.As of today, this game is nearly eleven years old.  So, the battle graphics are not as crisp as newer titles, the historicity of some units is sketchy (or just made up), and it seems that multiplayer is not smooth in Steam.  Fortunately, none of these mean a thing to me.  The heart of the game is in the grand strategy and the personal narrative.With over a hundred regions in which to play, the strategic game is where RTW shines. You need to plan where you will expand and where you will defend... and then be ready to adapt when the AI does not do what you expect. You may be the pawn of the Senate and serve at their beck and call.  You might try to expand against the weak.  You can follow the trade routes to gain riches through conquest.  You will find yourself occupying regions merely to stymie your enemies (and your allies). Or you might work your way towards all seven Wonders to reap their benefits.The twenty factions all fall into one of the major religio/cultural groupings. Some conquered peoples will not like your religion, but a few might. Some conquered peoples will happily accept you as overlord because you share the same cultural values... and the Spanish clans just don't like anyone. Some factions have great infantry, some have cavalry, and some do many things well.  Yet, you can usually find mercenaries (disgruntled locals, rival tribes, or thugs) who might fill the holes in your army.Yes, most negative reviews harp on about the lag in multiplayer and the poor graphics in battles.  If you need gratuitous violence or managing pixels in a free for all, then watch Mad Max: Fury Road or play League of Legends. If you want to make decisions that will impact your dominion fifty turns down the road, then this game can give it to you.  What kind of temples will you build in each region... or should you let the people keep their native religion?  Will a town become a recruiting station or a cash cow?  When you conquer a region, you'll have to decide to either just incorporate it into your lands as is, relocating half the people by enslaving them, or just slaughtering most of the inhabitants and stealing their goods.... and you'll find yourself using each throughout the campaign, because one size does not fit all.And guess what?  I don't fight the battles.  If I did, I'd never finish a campaign.  I hit the auto calculation button every time.  Why?  Well... there are a number of positions which you will fulfill in a game.  Benevolent multi-generational spirit guiding your family, governor of a province, Commander in Chief, general of an army, and captain of a unit. Playing all of these breaks the narrative for me... I play the macro game, i.e. the big picture.  I plot and scheme, I build cities, and recruit armies.  Then I send them out into the field.  How they do is up to them.  If they win... great! I must be a genius.  If they lose... nuts. Back to the drawing board.Two friends of mine, let's call them Doc and Bro, played RTW like this... Doc played the campaign map, i.e. he decided what units were built and where the battles were fought, but Bro fought all the battles.  Doc was the CinC and Bro was the General.  They played two campaigns in three years, but they remember both as epic stories of their teamwork.In addition to the war... campaign strategy, building armies, transportation of armies, theatres of conflict, fog of war, etc... you'll have to deal with natural disasters, (In one game, a young woman of my family married a promising young fellow, but he died a year later in an earthquake.), piracy, rebellions, brigands, bribery attempts upon your armies, old age, death in battle, adoptions, plagues (stupid unwashed barbarians), and assassination. (In one game, the youngest son of my German leader was sent to subdue Gaul and Hispania. This gave him a command of 10.  I marched him and his elite German veterans across the Alps to conquer Rome... but the Romans assassinated him.  With my hordes leaderless, the Romans proceeded to sieze Gaul and invade Germania.) All of these additional factors help create a unique narrative for each game.Oh, and when you play as a Roman faction, you'll need to keep an eye upon the Senate... how they view you, how the plebs (the masses) view you, Senatorial missions, and the official Senatorial stance with every other faction. For instance, you may have a great trade agreement with the Egyptians and a low standing with the Senate, but the Sentate demands that you attack Egypt... attacking Egypt will hurt your income considerably, but offending the Senate may cause them to label you as a rebel... what will you do?Certain events always happen... Aetna erupts and the plague breaks out in Macedonia, but certain other events happen only when certain triggers occur (the Marian reforms), while others, such as floods, are random.  But the big event for Roman players is the Civil War.  At some point the plebs will want you to deal with the Senate and/or at some point the Senate will either have enough of you or become paranoid of your growing power that they'll demand the head of your family to commit suicide.  If you agree, they'll do it every turn until your family ceases to exist.  If you're not ready for war, then you can comply with the Senate for a few years (and prune your family tree of bad apples in the process), but at some point you'll have to stand up to the Senate... at which point you go to war with all other Romans.  Talk about raising your anxiety.... sheesh!All of your characters really flesh out the narrative... the story of your family.  Spies, diplomats, assassins, admirals, generals, and governors all have character traits that make them who they are.  Some will be drunkards, perverts, and ne'er do wells, while some will be loyal, moral, and cunning.  They'll also tend to generate a following of hangers on, freeloaders, men of honor, mistresses, etc...  For instance, a son might come of age in your family with a command of 3... a natural born general... but on his way to the frontier to defeat the Dacians, his inner circle grows to include a Drunken Uncle and an Actor and they decrease his command ability by 3... Ouch!  He's now a zero...In the first two Total War games, Shogun and Medieval, you had family members, but not nearly as many as Rome.  So to help you manage them (and for the sheer fun of telling a story), RTW includes a family tree.The game's not perfect.  The legendary/semi-mythological units can be frustrating and the Egyptians were certainly not using chariots in the second century BC. Naval combat results can make you scratch your head.  Negative income numbers on the campaign map are definitely misleading. There is always the point at which you know you've won even though you may only be forty to seventy percent of the way to the finish... but that's true of a lot of games.There may be other games out there that have made improvements to the grand strategy game, but I've always found this one to be fun to return to.

												I am the House of Julii.I am to the North of Italy. I am part of the Glorious Roman Republic, sharing with three other factions; the blue Scorpios (I think) who have decided to take a couple of islands and then the big parts of Africa. The green Brutii, who decided that looking ridiculous would best show the Greeks what's what. And I, wearing fantastically imperial red, who was tasked with sorting out the dirty Gauls.I quickly began a conquest that would put the Black Templars to shame, sending out army after army, conquering town after town. They tried to resist, but my men were worth two of theirs, and my men outnumbered their three to one. As we came, we took most of them slaves, built up my core towns, built as many temples to convince more people to shag as possible, and continued on our merry murdering way.Occasionally, the Guals or Brittony or Germans would manage to scrape together an entire army of 2000 people. These were the battles I, and my family, were born for. We smashed together, blood and sword and sinew, as my Velites threw their spears overhead, and cavalry quickly hit them from behind. Few enemies died facing us in the north, many ran and most died with sword wounds in their backs rather than face us.We tried peace once, and we paid the price with roman lives. When they begged for our mercy, they found only our gladius. We heard the lamentations of their women as they were taken back to mighty Arretium, our capital city. And how it had grown; on the back of slaves and the glory of our men, we raised great arenas and temples to show our glory! We raised great barracks to train our men! We grew the greatest of men to enforce our will! And the north of Europe was stained red with blood; the map of Europe was stained red with our flags.We found that land ran out quickly; Europa gave way before our bloodlust did, and we turned to look back. We were disgusted with what we saw. Corruption. Weakness. Our supposed equals made peace with the savages, our supposed superiors hide behind the walls of Rome. They whispered of treachery, but we knew weakness and corruption when we saw it. The spineless Scorpios had no trouble gaining the favour of the Senate; spending more time on their knees in glorious Rome than sword in hand over Carthage. The Brutii failed to live up to their brutish name; content with a paltry pile of sand, growing fat and lazy as we had grown lean and numerous in both flesh and glory.We recalled our armies to home, to the swell of the crowds. They chanted our name, and spat at the mentions of the Senate. All had been united under our banner; did not the Celts and Gauls and Germans and Thrycians alike not bend the knee to the glorious Romans, all beneath the bloody red banner of the Julii? Mars had made his favour clear; he doesn't favour cowards, and Jupiter didn't let the weak rule. We built temples in His Name, and spread his name further than even the diplomats know. All that was left was to follow the glory given to us, under the gaze of the gods and cheers of the people, we marched the final path.All roads lead to Rome.			"

												Rome: Total War is a strategy game from Creative Assembly and published by SEGA. Rome: Total War is set during the timeline of the Roman Republic to its transition into the Roman Empire.Rome: Total War gameplay can be overwhelming for newcomers but its not hard to master the gameplay. First you can only play as Rome, choose one of three Roman royal family. You start on the campaign map with some settlement where you can expand it, train troops, train a diplomat and build your empire. You can engage in diplomacy with other faction such as the Greeks, Egypt or Gaul, make alliances or declare war. When it comes to battle, you can choose to auto resolve the battle if you outnumber the enemy or engage the fight in the battlefield where you will command your troops. This is the best part where you command hundreds or thousands of Roman Legion and Auxiliaries support to fight the Greek Hoplites or the barbarian army and watch them kill each other. Each army can be commanded by a general which will improve the army morale and increase the auto resolve chance of winning. Each general has some skill bonuses that can improve army or improve settlement when they become the governor. As General takes part in battle, their skill bonuses will improve.Rome: Total War is quite addicting to play. When you're done playing with Rome, other faction can be unlocked and then you can play as them. Then you can instead fighting Rome and defeat the greatest empire ever exist in history. The graphics may be old, and some technical issues may occur on newer system, but the game is more than playable. I recommend this.Rating 8/10			"

												Well.....reviewing this game is hard. For it's time, it was without a doubt one of, if not the greatest, strategy games of all time. However, comparing it to newer Total Wars,(except for ROME II, that is something else entirely) it lacks in several things, notably historical accuracy, diplomacy, and managing your government. For one, in historical accuracy, there are multiple nations(like Gaul, Spain, Greece, etc.) that are unified nations even though in real life they were a divided people, with seperate clans, city states, etc. but for some reason CA mashed a lot of city states and tribes together to form unified nations, which is complete bogus. Also, in historical accuracy, Egypt is not Hellenistic at ALL. They still have traditional Egyptian Paganism as their religion, and their units are traditional Egypitan ones, even though Egypt was now practically a Middle Eastern copy of Greece thanks to Alexander the Great. In diplomacy, there are very few options(some examples are trade rights, allaince,  map info, etc.) and, therefore, made diplomacy lose it's immersion. Finnaly, there is governemnt. For Roman factions, the Republic government is fairly adequately displayed, but in general, there really is no ""government system"" like in Empire Total War, although there is a family tree where you can set the faction heir, adding a bit of spice to government. If we put those those things aside, you will find a true classic of a strategy game-and I'm pretty sure most people here would agree with me. In a time where graphics made people look like horrible mutants, AI was as smart as your neighborhood stray dog, and strategy games lacked a lot of actual strategy, this game was revolutionary. The graphics, although considered inferior to today's games, probably looked really great to a lot of players back in 2004.  The jump from the previous Total War, Medieval, to Rome's graphics was absoultely stunning. The AI (which, to be honest, is not very much smarter than the neighborhood stray)  is competent despite occasional errors. Diplomacy, while lacking in true immersion, added a new level of strategy to games, as a system with more than just basic alliance/trade/war was pretty much only used in previous Total Wars and a few other grand strategy games, and even then it was really basic. And government, while being very basic, also adds to the strategy of the game, as you scramble to find a sutiable heir for your glorious (or, more often than not, not-so-glorious) empire. Speaking of empires, there are 20 factions, with about half of them playable, half not playable. Technically, there is a 21st faction, the Rebels. The rebels not only represent actual rebels, which I am perfectley ok with, but they also represent ""minor factions"" that CA left out of the game, which is kinda sloppy to me. However, all-in-all, the campaign is sound, if perhaps a tad disappointing to modern gamers. Now..on to battles. It is not possible to manage a nation without going to war, and this game certainly does not oppose that fact. You will end up in countless battles, usually with random weaklings who think they are better than you, but you will often find yourself matched against a worthy foe. If it is a land battle, you can do one of three things-Fight the battle out on a battle map, have the computer auto resolve the battle, or retreat. For naval battles, you only have the auto resolve option. For the battle map, you and everyone involved-whheter or not they are on your side-will command various units that can be trained in cities if you have the proper buildings. You command these soldiers to victory-or defeat-against the enemy. I personally belive CA did a great job on the battle mechanic of the game.If you like Total War games, strategy games in general, video games in general, or if you like life, then buy this game. Even if you don't like life, still buy it. This is a true classic of a strategy game, and you would be a fool to pass on it if you are a fan of the genre.Overall, 9/10.Also, this game definitely deserves the ""Test of Time"" award. An absolute classic of the strategy genre.			"

												I played this game an unhealthy number of hours before so I had to pick up an original copy just to write this review.One of the best strategy games and my favourite in the series. An absolute classic!This game is a mix between turn based strategy (on the world map) and real-time strategy (on the battle map)8/10 Macro mechanics - you can manage your cities, conquer, develop and train your armies10/10 Micro mechanics - the feelings of managing thousands of units on the battlefields adds both realism and grandeur to battles. Tactical decisions are what wins fights. Positioning and good decisions that are not necesarily split decisions make the clashes immensly fun. DON'T YOU DARE use auto-resolve. You'll miss out on a lot.7/10 Graphics, because it's dated. Newer versions of the Total War series like Medieval 2, Shogun and the new Rome coming out have better graphics if that's what you're looking at, altough you shouldn't pay attention to the graphics.Learning curve isn't steep at all. Modding scene has some goodies in store afaik. Never tried multiplayer but it has to be tons of fun.It's an AMAZING game. It's like a middle ground between games like Civilization and Age of Empires and everyone should at least try it.			"

												They say rome wasn't built in one day, but that certainly depends on how much you play this game, and with a game like this, you can easily get stuck in front of your computer for hours. I've heard some good and some bad things about the sequel to this game, Rome II, so i figured i might try and review this one instead.I realize there's alot of TBS games kinda similar to this out there, but by some miracle i found my way through all those rip-offs and half bad ones, and found my way to this. Anyways, let's get to itNow even though this game might not have the best graphics, it's a good quality game, the game runs very smooth on even the worst of computers, I experienced a surprisingly few number of glitches and flaws. Also this game variates a lot more than you’d think, the terrain and weather and basically all the nature, and even soldiers surrounding the battlefield has an effect on the battle itself, and it manages to create a somewhat realistic atmosphere.You start of by choosing between a rich number of factions to play as, and each faction has their own abilities, starting points, diplomatic and offensive advantages, and of course they all are different difficulties. Now when you start you can also choose different campaign lengths and modes, but the ultimate goal, is to conquer the world. Even after you’ve reached your goal, and have gotten the “You Beat The Game!” message, there’s a lot to do.Now the game doesn’t have many tracks to get you humming along, in fact it has a couple of tracks running in the background, and some music to set the mood for a fight, but that’s in the rough it, and that’s one of the things letting this game a bit down in my opinion.To sum up, this game has a great costumization ability, and is good for a replay, or even two (to all the rome fanatics xD) not the best graphics or music but all in all, I give this an 7/10			"

												The Total War series has an element of elegance to it. Exploring the ways of historical battle as finely and closely as it does is rare, and only some years after its first installment (Shogun) did the videogame industry begin to shoot similar titles. After the legendary Medieval, not many people believed that, apart from a change of setting to a different historical moment, a considerable amount of different content would come up. Then Rome shouted: you're wrong. This game brings pretty much every element of real-time strategy and tactics to the table: city development, troop development and upgrade (besides restoration of battered troops), a ranking system for experienced details that smells pleasantly like Total War spirit, and a turn-based diplomatic conflict and tension only rivaled by the Civilization series, in my opinion.Rome does have its flaws, mainly related to in-battle bugs and primary AI, but its general brilliance is undeniable. Total War lovers meet RTS lovers in this game, as we witness the rise of Rome from the eyes of three powerful political strata of the Roman Empire (houses Brutii, Julii, and Scipii), besides several pagan tribes from central and eastern Europe - some of which you can control after the main campaign has been finished -, as well as northern Africa. A complete set of compelling diplomatic progress is also displayed in Rome (you can constantly set up family alliances, strengthening the power of military stations in cities you control through the maturing of new generals and governors), as well as completude of technological upgrades, and plurality of maps for different battle strategy tastes, from snowy forests of Northern Germany to Spanish plains to Eastern European rocky hills. Rome: Total War puts you right into the heat of pre-medieval belli, the moments of Roman rise and fall, the pressure from the outside and from the inside. Intrigues, military management, civil complexities, and territorial tension.			"

												Been playing this game for 5 years. My first ever Total War game. Activated it on Steam recently. Words cannot describe my attachment to this classic. I have hundreds of hours on it, perhaps even thousands, although I only recently activated it on Steam after the closure of Gamespy made it possible. My all-time favourite for sure.Its successor pales in comparison.			"

												Rome: Total War. One of my all-time favorite games. Taking place in the late Roman Republic, you assume control of one of three Roman families vying for power. Depending on which family you select, the Senate will usually direct you against one of three adversaries - the Greeks, the Gauls, or the Carthaginians. The beautiful thing about Total War, however, is you can simply ignore the Senators and go on a campaign of your own... Egyptians? Invade them! Is the Senate demanding you join in on the war against the Macedon, but you'd rather become allies? Go for it! Just make sure you keep a home guard, because Civil War is a constant threat!It has been almost ten years since Rome's release. It hasn't aged terribly bad - the AI is somewhat atrocious, the graphics are dated, but the game is still genuinely satisfying. At the price Rome goes for during Steam's seasonal sales, there's really no excuse NOT to give this game a try. If nothing else, it is a taste of nostalgia before these types of games became more like movies and less like free-for-all sandboxes!			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Rome Total WarDeveloper:  The Creative AssemblyPublisher:  SEGAGenre:  RTS/TBS hybridGeneral ImpressionRome Total War is one of my favorite video games. I've been playing it since it was launched, in 2004 and even after so many years, it's still very entertaining and challenging. Thanks to the Total War series, I became interested in history and geography, two subjects which shaped my formal years of education. The game's engine is easy to tweak and modify, having a plethora of mods online. The best one remains Europa Barbarorum, a mod which stretches RTW' engine to its very limits. Even if to some players, Rome Total War's graphics might seem outdated, it remains an echelon by which all 3D RTS/TBS hybrids, measure themselves. None are its equal.Strong Points+ Very high modding potential.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- All the units look like clones of each other.- No Achievements.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												How to properly experience Rome Total War. Step one: Start a new game playing as the Romans, doesn't matter the family.Step two: Decide how fast you want to get going by using cheats or not, usually depends onthe mood I'm in.Step three: Create an unstoppable army, or two, or 20, depends how fast you want the world to tremble at your feet.Step four: Send forth your armies into the lands of the barbarians, take their cities and sack them, burn them down, kill them all.Step five: Once the barbarians have been eradicated completely from the map, head for Greece, the home of the intelects.Step six: Send your armies to enslave the Greek peoples, beat them off their high horses and kill them slowly and painfully.Step seven: Once Greece has been pacified sucsessfuly, wait till you have a plauge in one of your cities, you will soon see why.Step eight: once you do have a plauge in one of your cities, get unimprtant agents like diplomats there, keep them for a bit, them send them to the south, in places like Memphis, Alexandria, or Carthage, large cities.Step nine: watch as thousands die from your own little biological terrorist attack, take it in.Step ten: Send your armies to finish off Carthage, Egypt and Numidia, enslave their peoples too, and make sure to kil the pharoh.Congrats, Romam regit omnia, Imperitor.

												In my opinion, this is still the best Total War game to date.Rome's got good combat, decent unit roosters for different cultures, good siege mechanics & decent city ""building/development"". You can also build forts & watch towers on the strategic map.Rome was made before the switch to the new engine, which means that each individual unit actually fight on an individual level, trying to hit enemies & block incoming attacks, instead of the crazy 1v1 kill-animation system. This have a major effect on how battles turn out & how they're conducted. If you got more units of similar skill & situation, they tend to do a fair bit better, instead of it just being a battle of attrition. Projectiles are fairly strong, but as far as I can tell, don't home-in on targets & ready, large shields greatly negate their effectiveness.I should mention that the music is the best in this title by a land-slide, it's always fitting & it's always get's you in the right mood for the situation.The one thing you may miss in this if you're used to the later titles is the naval combat, it's automated in Rome. Also, the graphics are very dated. Camera controls are janky & visual feedback is poor compared to later titles.Compared to the other Total War titles, there's only 3 other games that even come close to being as good as this one: Shogun 2, Medieval 2 & Empire(after milions of patches). I haven't played enough Warhammer to tell how it hold's up yet, but it looks promising.OBS!You may get random crashes to desktop if you buy it through steam, unless you go to the main folder, select everything, put it in a new folder within the main folder & then check integrity of the game & let it re-download everything. The game should then not crash, probably, it worked for me (I use Windows 7).			"

												Let's start with a confession. When Rome Total War was released I didn't buy it, didn't play it. Turn based sounded boring, I wanted real-time because that was cool. So when did I first play it? After Rome 2 was announced, I wanted to play with the ancient world but release was still months away. Then the release was utter garbage. Thus I turned to Rome Total War.So lets start with the TL;DR part.Good: The feel of combat. It's not fast, a bit to slow but formations collide. Good: Size, this game is huge. Large amount of provinces as well as factions. Improvement over Shogun 2, stuck in Japan.Good: Atmosphere, Senate missions as Rome, three seperate factions. Lots of different other factions too.Good: Mods, mods, mods. There some excellent mods out there for this game.Bad: Graphics, the graphics sure aged. Then again it's an old 3D game, they rarely age well.Bad: AI, AI isn't the smartest. The game is easily gamed, then again newer Total War's still are.Bad: Egypt. Egypt was greek at the time, not pharaohs, well not styled like the rulers of old. Just graphics but I'll mention it anyway.Bad: Resolution, no real widescreen support and no 1080p at all. Highest I can get is 1600x1400.So should I still get it? Well it's different for sure. I got into it after I played Medieval 2, Empire, Shogun 2 and Fall of the Samurai. I could make the journey back and was pleasantly suprised. On the other hand my main gaming PC wasn't very available at the time and I played mostly on a laptop. So older games was something I was stuck with either way.Give it a shot if you like ancient history, a slower strategy game and long battles. If you like historical accuraccy give Europa Barborium a spin. From a pure gameplay perspective it has an overwhelming amount of units, recruitment, moving and battles take ages but it's sure authentic.This is a great game, it has aged but not to much. It's deep but not to deep and I'm sort of sad the path Total War games have been taken lately. Still we can go back to this and I recommend you do that.			"

												Rome: Total War is a fine example of game that has aged well, even after almost 10 years of the launch, it's a solid game .Particularly, the Total War series is my favorite when it comes to strategy games, the mixture of TBS with RTS is genial and well applied, allied to the historical factor that their games presents and you have a good source of fun with them.Rome: TW was a title much acclaimed when it launched, for the reasons described above and for its innovation, It's an addictive game that manages to insert you in the campaign and leave you completely focused on the goal of conquer and recreate the legacy of the Roman Empire. The gameplay may seem complicated at first, But you can absorb as much of the campaign map and battles works by playing the tutorial. Throughout the game you can also enable the tips of AI that will enhance learning. The enemy AI is good, although sometimes it may seem very easy on the lower difficulties. The main focus of the game are the battles,  so the diplomatic  and political party is not as well addressed, nevertheless I did not miss this factor.The graphics are outdated but still perfectly playable, the sound quality is magnificent, as well as Hellenistic soundtrack, the speeches of generals before battle is a small detail but shows how much the developers have applied to the game, they are exciting! The Total War series has a solid fan base, it is possible to find many mods that improve, enhance and add replay value to the game. The expansion Barbarian Invasion is a good choice to play under another historical perpective.The downside is that are technical problems that an old game shows, especially in newer OS. I lost a save that was corrupted in a campaign well advanced, it was very sad. Once you learn to play well, the AI also seems to be limited in combat and especially in the campaign, making it easy to match. But certainly this game deserves attention of those who enjoy history and a good strategy game.8/10			"

												Note: I have played this game for embrassingly numerous hours outside Steam, certainly many thousands.The Total War series revolutionized a strategy genre that was stagnating. After years of the same things over and over again, strategy games with only campaigns and no war, sitting and waiting for this mechanic or that to play itself out, games that made the GUI a bit messier and called it depth, features that just made the same stuff a bit more Heath Robinson and called it progress and innovation, battles where you watched columns of numbers, or 7-8 little RTS guys bip and bop for 30 seconds until the game told you who won... Total War brought in a tactical scope with depth to it, actual battlefields where real time decision-making and some sensible tactical considerations played roles, and where the clash was a grand spectacle. In one fell swoop, this series revitalized the genre, indeed carved out its own genre - strategy games where real time wargaming is actually a thing.Then, some time into the series, this game - this beautiful, beautiful game came along. Not content with what they'd achieved already, they made a game so good it broke the mould. Not content with creating their own groundbreaking genre, they then pushed further.It might have aged now, and it isn't such a surprising, groundbreaking thing now as it was back then, and it has its warts and annoyances (like all of the games in the series) but I still have to say that for me, this is possibly the best computer game ever made. Certainly one of the best.Also, it is a great family game, as long as the subject matter is ok for your tribe, we have had many years of fun out of these games. It is not bloody and gratuitous at all, although obviously war is violent in itself.There is nothing else that does computer wargaming like the Total War series, and this is the glorious pinnacle of it. 100/10			"

												WARNING FOR WINDOWS 10 USERS AND POSSIBLE OTHERS: The game got a post-Gamespy update that will cause the game to do all kinds of crazy display stuff and crash. What you need to do is turn off anti-aliasing by default by going into the game's installation folder, preferences folder, then preferences file and make sure AA_QUALITY says AA_QUALITY:AA_ OFF. This should let you launch the game. If you wish to turn on AA from there, you can do so in NVIDIA Control Panel or any other equivalent program, as turning it back on in the menus will cause it to crash again.IF YOU GET REALLY BAD FRAMERATES AND LAGGY INPUT NO MATTER YOUR SPECS: Right-click the game in your library, click properties, then click Set Launch Options. In the text box, type the three characters ""-ne"" without the quotes and press okay. This should fix that problem for most people out there.With that done, I'd like to say that although this game is a bit primitive compared to modern TW games, it still can be a very fun game.  Pros:-The Campaign map is very no frills compared to modern TW games. You can build any building in any city, public disorder is easy to maintain, and it just lacks feature bloat of later games. The game is all about the battles, something I'd wish would come back after games like Attila.- The battles can look and play better than modern TW games in some ways. Losing units will actually be beaten back and enveloped by superior forces, soldiers will respond to orders at different times, and the engagements can have some real clash and weight to them. -There's actually strategy to the strategy map. I wasn't a huge fan of M2/Empire/Napoleon/Attila's maps because they tended to have lots of wide open plains, while Rome 1+2 and Shogun 2 had lots of limiting terrain features where you could create chokepoints and use terrain like mountains and rivers to your advantage.Cons:-Battles can be over a little too quickly. I kind of get whiplash at how fast I go from marching, to melee, to routing an enemy army.-The flipside to things like independent unit movement is that response can be sluggish, sometimes often so bad that I can't tell if the game knows if I ordered them to do anything.-Pathfinding can be garbage sometimes, especially in cities.-You can still get cascade moments where your empire is powerful enough that you're just auto-resolving your way across large swaths of the map at some points.Overall, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the game despite not playing it since roughly around its launch. Once you get over some usability issues, there's a game here that's aged better than it has any right to.			"

												I had Rome Total War long before Steam, but was so disenchanted with Rome 2, I picked it up on sale. At the time of it's release, it was revolutionary. Now, many years later, it is still a worthy addition to any library of turn-based and real time strategy. This Total War Rome has a great real time battle engine. You can easily control any and all units and fight every battle on your terms. Crashing into an infanty until from behind with calvary remains fun to watch over a decade later. I won the short campaign on hard for both map and battles...but it wasn't difficult for a verteran of Total War games. The music is perfect, from the calm background of the world map to the adrenaline pumping battle music. The introductory movie/music still makes me smile, capturing some of the feeling of Total Awe I felt at the time of its release. 8/10 Glad I visited old Rome again.			"

												Rome 1 really is the game that got me into the total war series. It's a fantastic gateway game for anyone wanting to get into the series, and has provided me with thousands of hours of entertainment (not all through steam). The game gels very well within itself, campaign and battle moulding together seemlessly. Very few bugs to be found, and minor when they are, also includes everal funny easter eggs. Largely historically, and has a thriving online community. All in all, I very strongly recommend.			"

												Still the best Total War game of all times even it is carries 9 years of dust. However the mods and vanilla game is much more immersive, the battle system is better than in all TW games past it.Also the multiplayer offers much more options than other TW games, and runs  very good despite some known but solveable NAT issues.EDIT:I've played the game extensively since 2004, before I got it on Steam, this is why I have only 80 hours of playtime.You should also try out to play with mods like Roma Surr ectum 2.I rate the game with a 8/10 vanilla.1 point less for the NAT issues in multiplayer and the fact the multiplayer part is now even dead.Originally it should not work anymore because the Gamespy service shutdown, but it still works somehow, the strong MP community is desperated though.1 point less for the battle AI, it will attack at any circumstances and is not very smart in battles.edit:NAT issues have been solved because the game has been shifted by CA from the dead Gamespy platform to Steam.

												This game is by far, my favorite game. Hands down, no competition. It is old, but I've yet to see any other strategy game come close to this. The graphics are decent, considering its age. The gameplay is complex enough to not be bored and just steamroll through everything, yet simple enough to actually know how to use every feature this game has to offer. The game is basically you controlling a faction during the time of the Roman Republic, and trying to become the best nation. Diplomacy is simple and allies will betray you constantly, unless you would just completely dominate them (and even then, they still might attack you!) The AI is pretty simple to defeat, their entire strategy seems to be just throwing all of their units at you and seeing who wins. The challenges come when you get into the Roman Civil War. This is an in-game event where the 4 roman factions fight each other for control of Rome. Up until this point, you've just been steamrolling through barbarians with your heavy legionnaires. Once the Civil War starts, you're fighting 3 other roman factions (2 of which have just as much land as you if not more, each) and they have the same troops as you. If you're not playing a roman faction then this will never happen, but it's called ROME total war for a reason. If you're into strategy games, buy this game. Even if you're not, you should at least give it a try. The controls might be difficult to use at first, but the tutorial is very helpful. You will probably lose your first few campaigns, but once you get the hang of the game it will be so much fun.			"

												Rome: Total WarThe game that launch the Total War series towards heights that it could've never dreamed of. This game is a turn-based strategy game where you take command the various factions during the Roman Era as you command, build, govern and attack Rome's enemies.The battle system unlike the system you will see in the modern day versions of the game is really simplistic. Sort of like an almost modern update of Imperial Glory. Now of course, the usual complaint would be ""OMG the game is too hard"" or ""OMG the online players are wrecking me"" Luckily the game has an in-depth tutorial plus you have all the time in the world as this game offers various combat both historical and custom made as you polish your skills in battle. And also being a leader of Rome.The advisor system is really helpful as they give advice towards the player. DO NOT turn it off if your new. Keep that option for advisor input set to ""High"". Plus the User Interface for manging your territory and what not is simplistic as well.Now bewarn, save often. Some of the daily tasks that the senate assigns you don't really give you concrete directions. For some of them it's a simple click of the ""zoom in towards target location"" while others it's ""Find this city"" and your just like ""Um okay...WHERE?!"" some of these tasks are important as it may further your position in the Roman government.If you still want a simplistic Total War game this is for you.

												This is a perfect classic of the Total War series. In short, you have the following:1) a huge map.2) massive armies.3) unlimited options when it comes to planning out your campaign.There is so much more I could mention that makes this game great, but I'd hate to write an entire novel about it. Just know that it sets a nice atmosphere and it's a great strategy game.However, keep note of a few annoying things:-Path finding for units can be very lousy sometimes, and there are some glitches routing as well. If a unit is defending the walls in a siege battle and they panic and route, they don't actually route for real. They just stand around idle all the time until someone kills them all off. -The AI, no matter how much of an effort you make, can be incredibly stupid at times. This is a trait common in all of the Total War games, but it shouldn't be too awful except for siege battles.Otherwise, this game is definitely a classic of the TW series. The pros greatly outweigh the cons.			"

												This is the number one game in my library. For over a year, it was the only game other than Spore and the contents of the Orange Box. Five years later, I still go back to it every now and then. I've had many a 14-hour marathon day playing Rome Total War, quite often back to back. I'm pretty sure I got a chance to play as every civilization before I switched computers and lost my progress. I've even gone through the Barbarian Invasion campaign a few times. Honestly, if I'd never bought Civ V, I'd have well over 1,000 hours racked up by now.This is strategy at its purest. Not only do you have the strategy of ""How do I move around my armies and generals and funds to best maintain and expand my empire?"" you also have the battles themselves. Many games do only one or the other, and those games can go hang. I'm not going to go into detail about the games mechanics and why they're good or bad; instead, I'm going to regale you with but a few of the ridiculous stories that have come out of my 800+ hours.*My British faction leader, supported by two other armies, slaughters a quarter of the entire Brutii force over ten years, littering Poland with heroic victories. He eventually meets his end, known as ""the Legendary,"" defending a town against a Roman force three times his size. Succesfully.*An elite squad of Berserkers sacrifice themselves on the walls of Rome itself, eliminating two entire legionary cohorts and flanking the wall's other defenders.*Four hoplite units hold Sparta against a full-size Roman army, earning a 100:1 k:d ratio.*My prize Egyptian army meets a humiliating defeat at the hands of Ponitc troops, navigates around the army, and marches straight into a Pontic city.*A Roman town is betrayed by Spain's finest, throws them off every year for three years until reinforcements can come in and ravage Spain's western coast.*A Carthaginian gambit to take Rome early fails miserably; a generation later, we're back with five armies that now include line-ravaging Armored Elephants.*Betraying Rome by landing an army next to her city - as well as every other non-Brutii city on the peninsula, and bloackading every Roman port east of Palma.*Falling in love with my faction heir, as he's my only general who can fight at night. He later on earns three bonus command stars at night, and sacks Constantine by the light of the moon.It's a glorious game, one with an infinite supply of stories. Go make your own.			"

I was really tempted to refund the game when I found this out, but I decided to keep playing. The game actually became really fun. I've watched prince of macedon play this game for a long time, so it was fun to finally get to experience it myself. Also, after a few hours, I got quite used to the lag. I don't really mind it anymore, and the game is very enjoyable. Definiately worth the price and it was a great experience.			"

												Rome: Total War is the Third game in the Total War series, released in 2004. Being 11-years old, as well as having several newer titles in the Total War series, Rome: Total War considerably shows it's age; However, with that being said it is still a fun, interesting game in the overall series. The game takes place prior to the middle ages, After the fall of the Roman Republic, during the Early Roman Empire. As is typical with the Total War series, You start off with a small number of player factions to choose, in this case 3, and unlock additional factions as playable once you conquer them.Also as is typical of a Total War game, gameplay is divided between the real-time battles when in combat, and the turn-based actions of exploration, nation-building, and diplomacy. Rome: Total War has been consistently rated as one of the highest games throughout the Total War Series, based on IGN, Metacritic, and GameRankings, and has a large following, as well as many player-made mods. Despite it's age, Rome: Total War is a strategy game any fan of the Total War series should have.			"

												A pretty decent game which turns out to be great with Europa Barbarorum modification. While the vanilla game is okay, it gets pretty boring after a while, because it's just very easy even on the highest difficulty and you just cakewalk everything. Moreover, multiplayer is terrible, because the game is unbalanced and community is terrible. Everybody just gets archers and camps in one place until other players get bored and try to attack but they are then in a losing position. AI is dumb, it plays terribly on campaign map, attacking with only a few units an entire army, leaving cities defenseless and in battle mode they just rush at you blindly, except horse archers who only harass you and run away and you have to chase them across entire map, which is extremely frustrating as it takes a long time.However, even with its shortcomings, it's a good game, and it can be much better with modifications, especially with a great Europa Barbarorum mod that makes the game way more interesting. Is it worth getting today? Or should you just play other Total War game?It is definitely worth getting for Europa Barbarorum, just like Medieval II is worth getting just for Broken Crescent mod. Otherwise... not so much, as the vanilla campaign is much better in ie. Shogun Total War, and the AI tends to be much less frustratingly annoying and dumb there too.			"

												Rome: Total War was the third Total War game from Creative Assembly, and it was the best one at the time. As it was expected, it was a game of epic-scale real-time battles and impressive attention to historical realism and detail. Shogun was a promising start for the series, while Medieval built on that promise to create an even more engrossing strategy game. Rome took the next step, and it was as much a revolutionary step as it was an evolutionary one, thanks to the at the time new 3D graphics engine that made the series' tactical battles (featuring thousands of soldiers) better than ever. The results were nothing short of spectacular, helping make Rome: Total War the very definition of an epic strategy game and a beloved classic of the gaming industry.

Rome: Total War is pretty cool, I guess. Back in the year 2000, a time when every music group went out of their way to look goofy, a little development studio named Creative Assembly decided to release a strategy game called ""Shogun: Total War."" The game mixed grand strategy and real time elements to create what was essentially a perfect formula of kingdom management and army control. The game was pretty successful, and two years later they released ""Medieval: Total War"" in 2002.  The game stepped away from the era of Feudal Japan and instead focused on Medieval Europe, hence the name. This game was also a success, and finally, two years later, Creative Assembly released what I personally believe to be their Magnum Opus. Rome: Total War was released in 2004, and that rhymes.Set during a period when killing someone was a lot more difficult because you had to get in pleasant conversation distance of one another. Rome: Total War's campaign begins during the early days of the Roman Republic. Or ""early"", I guess. You play as a various number of factions, some being unlockable as you conquer them in game, each one has a unique quality to it that comes into play during the battles. Now, I'm going to admit, I spent way too much time playing this game, and I'm probably just going to gush on it. ""But Dirk you World Champion Hugger."" You start. ""Steam says you only have 15 hours of total play time.""Well first, shut up, and second: Rome was one of the first PC games I actually bought myself after a long and backbreaking career in pig wrestling. I'm pretty sure I have almost, if not more than 1000 hours all together in this game. Though in those 1000 hours I haven't even played the Alexander expansion, but I heard that's good too. Campaign mode is broken into two segments, the campaign map where you control your entire empire, and the battle map where you command an army in combat. In the campaign map you build cities, train armies, make diplomatic agreements with other factions, and call Carthage stinky idiots for not releasing their hold on Sicily this instant. When diplomacy does break down, then it's time to get a little violent. Invading enemy territory involves you moving your armies around the campaign map like board game pieces, and having them attack enemy cities or armies. When the battle begins you zoom in to get a command eye view of the battle where you command each unit like a normal strategy game.Something that Rome and a few other games had that newer games do not is a captain system where, if you don't have a general in an army, it would instead be commanded by a captain within the army. If the Captain can prove himelf in a climatic battle or over the course of a war, then there's a chance that that captain can be promoted to General and actually become a named character.Generals themselves are fairly unique as well, each of them is named and can be improved or sabotaged independently. With every victory, the general can become a better commander and earn some traits, these traits can be positive or negative. For instant, a general may grow disgusted by war and have no taste for bloodshed, giving his army a morale penality. Or maybe he'll become better at army management and be able to move further each turn. Or maybe he'll just go crazy and talk about how his army will win because they have cooler hats. This and added into a pre-battle speech system where your general's speech can change depending on traits, gives the game a very neat little roleplaying element that helps give a narrative to your campaign. When your lords pass away they leave a history that will stick until the end of your campaign.Commanding your armies in battle is a very easy affair. You can control on unit, or multiple units at once, prepare their formation before the battle, and listen your the general's speech before it all goes down. For 2004, this part of the game was groundbreaking, since it was uncommon to see so many 3D rendered units on screen at once. It still holds up, especially if you put the unit scale to max. But should you play Rome: Total War?Yeah, probably, at least if you're a Total War fan who somehow hasn't played the classics. It's considered one of the best games ever made by people who aren't as great as me, and I would consider it at least in my top 10, if not my top 5. There are some problems, enemy campaign AI get sometimes wig out, having things happen like nations ask for an alliance one turn and then declare war the very next, but there are mods that help fix this to an extent. The modding scene is pretty great as well, with Europa Barbarorum and Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ coming to mind. I would give R:TW my golden seal of approval and say you should pick it up some way. It usually gets really cheap during sales as well. Rome: Total War gets 5 overly dramatic speeches out of 5. Bananas are curved because they grow towards the sun.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curationOh man, this review wasn't all that funny, was it?			"

												Rome: Total War was my first Total War game. Due to this game I fell in love with the rest of Total War series. Even though the game may be outdated, the gameplay is still great. Rome: Total War is a top class strategy game. One can control various nation during the rise (or fall, depends on which faction you play) of the Roman empire. I personally enjoyed the combination of city managing and real time battles. I have spent countless hours (don't be misled be my current hours, I have played Rome: Total War long before I bought it on Steam) on Rome: Total War. Who wouldn't want to be like Caesar?If you like strategy games, this is the game for you. The graphics may be outdated, but the gameplay is still solid.In conclusion, I rate this game a 89,89/100.Yes, I can be that specific.With kind regards,Your new Roman oppressor			"

												This game is honestly a modern classic. The progression is amazing, no matter what faction you play as. The battles are spectacular, and epic in scale. The campaign itself never fails to deliver. All of the tiniest decisions matter in the grand scheme, and one wrong move can destroy a campaign.

												They may try, but they will never beat Rome: Total War.Of course, the game is ageing, and with each new Total War iteration struggling to refine the gameplay it was always going to age somewhat badly. The soldiers which at the time seemed technological marvels now look blocky and cartoony, the campaign map looks less vibrant and more modular, the little portraits, banners and such all look unimpressive and much of the interface seems vaguely unresponsibe, low resolution and unattractive.But they will never beat this game.What was Rome Total War? Think of cars coming into a world of carts, think of chocolate coming into a world of porridge. People had dreamed of seeing the vast armies portrayed as 2D sprites in the original Shogun: Total War in glorious full 3D, and this game delivered in every way imaginable. The roman cities were sparkling, shining in the sun, the landscapes were the scale of the real world and the armies were, indeed, massive. The formations looked just as good as you always hoped they would, and things like charges had the very, excellent, feeling that we had all imagined.Not only that, but the game was deep and huge, with hours upon hours of varied gameplay promised, with any faction we wiped out in one playthrough being available to control in the next campaign - something that Empire: Total War really should have allowed. The (strangely Australian) tutorial woman left nothing to chance, and we never felt out of control, rushed, or under any pressure that was not a direct result of our own actions (all faults that would plague later titles in the series, in my eyes)The characters were great - real world names popping up here and there, generals increasing in effectivness. Money flowed relatively easily if you were but a little thoughtful about it, and developing more advanced troops was intuitive and straightforward.In short, this game got everything right. It has just the right mix of gameplay imposition and gamer imposition, input from both sources comign together to create a sandbox empire building experience that could suck you in and satisfied you for tens, hundreds of hours.Amazing game.

												Where to begin....I first purchased Rome over a decade ago... so the 500+ hours stated on here is vastly inaccurate. Which is a good indication as to what I think of the game. This review is to the point:The simple yet satisfying game mechanics are what keeps you coming back. The options of other factions, and the different unit available within each, means you will have hours of fun mastering the pros and cons depending on who you go. Armoured Elephant units or the Pharaohs Bowmen units are my personal favs.If you are a fan of recently released Total War games, give this a try and find out where it all really began for the franchise.

												Rome: total war is a great RTS game that allows you to conquer everything from europe to midle east.There are a lot of factions to chose from and there are also many ways to play the game. Even if the game is way too old and the graphics are kinda bad the gameplay is very smooth except from the path finding sometimes. The game is really fun and trust me, you won't regret buying it. In my opinion the best time to buy this one is when it is on sale that its pretty cheap. ~WARNING~ The game might not run in some new computers because its kinda outdated and it was meant to be played with the technology back in the day.

												Hello, Lets get straight to the point, Rome: Total War is a RTS game, Althought when you look at it you say, ""I think this is what my grandpa played."" you are Wrong! RTW is one of the best strategy games out there, don't let its age and graphics trick you that this is a bad game. If you are new to Total War games this is a game to get you started. RTW take reletively low disk space (2-3 GB) and is amazing at almost every aspact it has. True you might say how is this different from Total War Rome II. This game is easy and you get a good idea on what TW games are based on. This is one of the oldest RTW's but I would call it one of the best. From units to strategies, this game is amazing at simulating a battle, physics are amazing and anything you do changes the world around you. So if you want to play as a roman and expand the wast territories of the SPQR, Become the supreme ruler of the Roman Empire or destroy the romans and erase them from history. This is a game for you.Overall I would say I give this game 8/10 for being absolutely amazing. I really want to give it 9/10 but since it is old and Rome II or TW Attila is more modern, lets stick to 8/10Hope this review was helpful, enjoy the game and take care!			"

												A classic. One of the best pc games of all time.If you've ever dreamed of being an ancient general like Caesar or Hannibal, or conquering the ancient world as the romans did, this is the game for you !The game's main campaign is set during the rule of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire with the player assuming control of one of three leading Roman families. Other factions are playable once they have been unlocked. Gameplay consists of real-time tactical battles framed within a turn-based strategic campaign.  On the large strategic scale, players spend each turn managing diplomacy, developing infrastructure, moving armies, and managing the population's growth and public order. On the smaller scale, real-time battles against enemy armies take place with the player commanding forces that can contain thousands of individual soldiers.The game is also featured in tv series about ancient battles - Decisive Battles and Time CommandersSome other roman themed games : Caesar 3, Qvadriga, Grand Ages: Rome,  Europa Universalis: Rome..

												As the user-defined tags suggest this is a historical strategy game.  The overworld campaign is a turn-based grand strategy- sort of a simplified Civilization.  The battles are mostly real time, with a toggle for 2x or 3x, so I guess it could be argued there is a 4x element to the battle.The campaign takes a long time to finish, but it is good training if you want to play multiplayer.  There are some troops that don't seem to be very good relative to their costs-  I'm thinking the Arcanii (why only 16????????!!!!!!!!!!), but for the most part the game seems pretty balanced.The biggest downside for me was the fact that this game crashes every 4th or 5th battle, and I hear I am not the only person who has this problem.  The public order system can also be wonky- I lost a settlement to a gladiator revolt, then recaptured it and two turns later there was another gladiator revolt with the exact same amount of gladiators. Overall, I would strongly reccomend this game if you like the idea of massive battles, tactical thinking, or time consuming strategic considerations.  I know I loved it. "

												This is one of my favorite games, and, despite what my steam playtime may suggest, I have spent hundreds of hours playing the CD version. I cannot recommend the game highly enough.  The vanilla gameplay is excellent, and there is a wide range of mods that adds tremendously to that - Rome: Total Realism, Europa Barbarorum and others. So why the thumbs down? Because the steam version of this game is essentially unplayable on modern computers. My brand new desktop, which plays Total War: Warhammer on high settings at 60 fps, cannot manage large battles in this 13-year-old game at higher than ~30-35 fps. I've tried just about every fix for this that can be found online, from copying DX9 dlls to running in XP SP2 compatibility mode to running the game in borderless windowed mode at my full screen resolution. I've even turned all the settings down to low, and the problem still persists. The upshot is that this game is simply drastically unoptimized for modern hardware and operating systems. I'm at the point where I'm considering installing windows XP on a separate partition just to see if that will do any good, but I'm not holding out much hope. I understand that not everyone has this problem, but I've experienced it thus far on three modern computers, running windows 7 and windows 10. Anyone considering purchasing this should be aware of this problem.			"

												This vintage masterpiece was where I first learnt to appreciate to the beauty of thousands of dead soldiers lying across a field and where I learnt that urban management is letting a city revolt and then massacring the excess population.But be warned!

												The game is good, I remember playing this a decade ago. But I'm here to issue a warning: the game runs very inefficiently on newer systems. It was designed and optimized for one core, so if you have a middling laptop, you may want to steer clear. I've even heard of very beefy desktops struggling with it, possibly compatibility issues. You may actually find the newer games run better than this.			"

												So I bought this game on the steam summer sale. I have no regrets so far.I'm mainly more of a FPS type of person but playing this in some aspects is way better. First 10-15 matches online (you would be suprised at how many people still go online) I got clobbered but I started learning the keybinds and ways to space units out to make them for effective. Haven't touched much of the single player but when I did I played for about 1-2 hours. (Was really good).As I said before, a lot of people still play the online aspect which is always fun.Overall great game! "

												Rome Total War was in many ways the best that the Total War series had to offer, it was the game that took a giant leap forward and set the standard that it's own developers have yet to break. Despite game breaking bugs and broken promises about modding support Rome Total War still manages to give you a grand experience as you grow your empire towards total domination.   For those who have never played a Total War game it has two distinct elements to it, the first is the campaign map, this is an overview map where you build your cities, train units, send diplomats and assassins to your enemies and friends and move your armies around in a turn based grand strategy style and while it has nowhere near the dept of a true grand strategy game it does the job well enough that you forgive it, especially once you start to touch upon the second, and the most important, major aspect of a Total War game, the battles.   When two armies meet on the campaign map you are taken out of the turn based strategy and thrown right smack in the middle of a real time strategy battle with hundreds or perhaps even thousands of soldiers ready to fight and die. You move your soldiers around in squads of archers, swordsmen, cavalry, etc. Each faction has a semi-unique list of units they can employ, from the various types of Roman Legionaries to the Carthaginian War Elephants to the hilariously historically inaccurate flaming pigs. Each unit has it's own skills and abilities and while there is some level of rock -> paper -> scissors involved, the majority comes down to tactics, sure Spearmen beats cavalry, unless the cavalry happens to be charging them from behind.The game is pretty too, with a good amount of detail considering the scope of the battles, the soundtrack fits almost perfectly with the mood of the game and sounds of battle are utterly satisfying. Even the load screen are great, each one featuring a different quote from a period persona although a lot of mistakes were made by whoever typed in those quotes.It is not all roses however, Rome has a number of problems too the first and foremost of which being the same one that continues to plague Total War games to this day. The AI is completely and utterly inept. Whether it is trying to assemble an army by sending individual units walking through your territory one by one, letting you eliminate them piecemeal or displaying it's rather uncanny ability to form a perfect battle line and then break it in half just before engagement letting you flank the enemy at will you can't help but feel that this is somehow below the standards of the rest of the game and in fact modders have proven that making the AI not suicide every battle is indeed possible.In addition to that rather large issue there is a number of smaller ones, the campaign map is incredibly shallow and while the movement style is a big leap up from Medieval it still feels very arcadey. The squalor bug, or feature, as the developers would call it, whereby all cities automatically revolt if they grow to a certain population size. The lack of full scale modding, although Rome features a bunch of great mods there are certain things you are simply not allowed to do, such as adding more factions to the game. And despite the developers saying it's possible and banning people from their forums who says otherwise, it really isn't possible.Also the game throws any sense of historical accuracy out the window, from the equipment to the map to the very factions very few things in the game represent the time period accurately, this is something that will bother some people while others will ignore it. For me it only becomes annoying when people take their knowledge from Rome and try to apply it elsewhere.All in all, Rome Total War is a great game, it set the standard for all Total War Games to come and despite a number of annoying bugs and problems it still remains a great game to this day.

												Have played Rome: total war every now and then since 2004. Just finished my latest 20-hour campaign in the game, so this is without doubt playable even as in 2016 there are more modern total war games available. Didn't experience a single crash while playing (windows 7).Rome has some some issues: archers are undoubtedly underpowered, whole army can rout within seconds after the fight begins, senate's missions are sometimes nosense, AI can't handle siege battles, AI campaign logic is from USSR, etc.When Rome was released in 2004 it was a solid 10/10, something that haven't seen before. You can greatly improve the main game with wide variety of mods. When played today you can see the flaws, but still want to play just one more turn.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												Rome Total War is inarguably the best in the Total War series, with Medieval 2 coming in a close second. This game is a must have for all RTS and Grand Strategy fans! This game is perfect for a newcomer to the total war series, it's simple and easy to get into but tremendous fun to play.  Don't be discouraged thinking that old games are stupidly hard, with cluttered UI and bad graphics, it's not the case here!The city management and diplomacy is interesting. The UI is polished and easily understandable.  There's a great unit variety and especially the Roman legions are really interesting. There's nothing like mowing down hordes of barbaric tribes with your Legions. Sure the graphics are outdated but it still looks decent, at least you can crank them up to the max even on an old laptop. Total War Rome looked WAY better in it's age (2004) than how Rome II looks compared to today's standards. There are a huge number of mods, and complete overhauls out there to further enhance the gameplay and graphics. When you buy the game you also get the Barbarian Invasion DLC included which places the whole game to a completely different aspect. There's also another expansion called Total War Rome Alexander but it's perhaps the most forgettable one in the franchise.This game is in my personal top 10 of all time, worth every penny if you like strategy games go buy it and I guarantee you won't regret it! I played hundreds of hours of it (I owned a physical copy).			"

												Totally addictive.  A great game. If you are looking for something to fill up quite a bit of time for quite a small amount of money this is it.   It took me forty hours or so to get through one campaign, that is win one game.  After finishing a campaign successfully you can pick any of the nations on the map to use.As for the gameplay yourself you start off with some citystates.  You must develop your cities in order to increase monitary capital, defenses, religion, law and order, sanitation etc. all the while keeping the citizens at a content state.  They can and will revolt and kick you out if they get to dissatified.  You also must recruit a variety of soldiers to defend your cities and conquer other cities and generals.  You build siege weapons, ladders, siege towers, battering rams, or later when you get them elephants to scale or break down walls to take other fortresses and eventually rule the world!As you can tell there is a bit of a learning curve with  this game.  Save often at first.  With a little bit of patience you can learn to do all I have mentioned and more.  This sort of game is not for everyone, however, it is hard to know if you are really going to like it unless you give it a sincere try.  The game is a bit dated and can be hard to load at times.  Once loaded I have noticed no bugs.  It is a good game if you have a computer that is not 100% up to date as it will work on older computers that might not have the specs for the newer Total War Games.  So far I have played Total War Rome, Shogun 2, and Medieval.  They are all enjoyable in  their own ways.  So for those asking which game is the best I would recommend getting the one for the area of history you are most interested in as long as it will work on your computer.  If you like it you will most likely enjoy the others as well.			"

												Looking for the best RTS game money can buy? then look no further. Rome: Total War is by far one of the greatest games in Total War history with the best balanced gameplay in any Total War game.You run an empire of choice, first you must unlock other factions as this game is focused on Rome so you are only able to choose from them at first. Beat the main game and you unlock a smattering of factions. Then you can also hack the game files and unlock every other non-playable factions and of course play as them. Great fun.This game is many years old but the graphics stand the test of time, still pleasing to the eye as well as the first fully 3D Total War game.The game can range from been easy, to a total nightmare of course that also depends on the players skills. Something negative is really, the Rome factions on the higher diffculties are amazingly tough, but they are also overpowerd to play as. Overall amazing game easily a 9.8/10 :) - Dean			"

												Rome: Total War is the oldest Total War game available on Steam, and can be considered the basis of the rest of the games which followed (although I would totally rebuy Medieval: Total War if they ever added that). In previous games, the overlying board played like a giant Risk board, where you moved armied from province to province, instead of having the entire campaign map laid out and moving your armies to specific locations. This was a DRAMATIC shift for the series, and one which really helped to establish it at something unique from other strategy games.Like all Total War games that followed, you move your armies around the map to strategic locations in your turn, then the rest of the other players' turns elapse. At any point where two armies meet and fight, the option to autoresolve or fight on a tactical campaign map is provided, which is where the real-time portion of the game takes place.Rome is also the first game in the series where the armies were polygonal as opposed to sprites, which was a RIDICULOUS feat for graphics at the time. It's still relatively streamlined compared to modern Total War games, but it still stands up to this day. It's an excellent, excellent game, and well worth playing even now, a decade after its release. While I don't personally hold it up as the best example of the series, I know many people who do and I cannot fault their opinions - this is a damn fine game.			"

On a more serious note though, I really cannot find a reason for you not to buy this game, it's so wonderful. Remove the age of the game and the more primitive graphics (like I said though, it's an old game and for it's time it looks amazing) and there really are no downsides to this game in my opinion, but I am a massive fan of the Total War series so I may be biast, so just see for yourself!

												Close your eyes. Breath in the moist grass. The sweat of soldiers, armed to the neck with shields, swords, spears, and bows. Now, feel the ground beneath you shake, the war cries of the Gauls sending shivers down your body. The onagers and repeating ballista creaking along the grassy pasture. The synchronized march of the Roman army coming to meet the opposition. You open one eye, admiring the shiny--CLOSE YOUR EYES I SAID. Now, ahem, raise your arms into the sky, feeling the breeze and the tension of a battle wafting through your hands. Close your fist around that air and hover lightly into the air, looking down at the approaching armies. You're actually a quadrocopter, so you can float.Seriously, however, this game is amazingly fun. The campaign is captivating and the custom battles are entertaining. The possibilities are endless. There are so many factions and armies to make! Strategies to plan. Armies to deploy. Units to command. Towns to conquer. Upgrades to be made.I recommend this game to strategy game lovers!			"

												Rome: Total War is an incredible game. I remember buying it discounted at EB Games and thinking 'I can play this for a couple of hours'. Oh, how wrong I was. I played over 150 hours in less than a year (not really an acheivement, granted) and enjoyed every moment of it. Oh, how satisfying it is plundering through Gaul with highly trained Roman legions and crushing successor states under your hoplite phalanx. The game really put things into perspective for me. It showed me how the centuries-old Greek phalanx was finally swept aside by the Roman legions. Mind you, I was overpowered by them when I first tackled them as the Romans. My only proper disappointment is that Rome is overpowered (to be fair, it was at the time but not as much), Hellenistic pikes are underpowered and Egypt is anachronistic and overpowered.All aside, I've spent much time playing this and have loved it. Nothing is more fun than tearing chariots to shreds with Spartan spears.			"

												This is a great game. I think this game is same like word strategy. So if you say strategy its same like Rome total war. Exactly other Total war games asre too same like word strategy. :-) (sorry for my english im from czech republic so like you know i havent got a very good english)			"

												It looks like I haven't played this game much, but that's because I owned it on disc before it came on steam. Yes this game is old, but it is game is still one of the most amazing and in-depth games I've ever played and still my most favourite singleplayer strategy game of all time. This game is an absolute steal at the current price. Highly reccomended.			"

												AveThis game is superb for even the retail price, and easily has hundreds of hours of gameplay. Any person who has played this game would agree that it is amazing and a great way to enter the strategy genre. It is also  exhilarating to play for those who are already veterans in the genre, and one of the best RTS battle type combined with a turn based campaign map ever.No need for a rating, the game speaks for itself.

												Not only a classic of the genre, but also the best of the total war series imo. This game beats every other title out there in terms of a combined turn-based/rts historical game (especially with mods, which virtually increases the game length by hundreds--possibly thousands--of hours. Graphics: They're okay for its time (about a 6-7/10), but it may feel outdated for some newer gamers. Try some mods, and it'll feel more new. With that being said, about 7/10 with the mods in mind.Gameplay: Very smooth, responsive battle animations. If you can control your cavalry well, you can handle any opponent with proper flanking and timed troop engagement. The turn-based aspect may seem somewhat outdated, but there are mods that will bring the diplomacy among other parts of the game to unrivaled levels. 10/10I'm not going to comment on anything else, since I think this game is all gameplay with some visuals to create immersion. There is a grand and truly epic feel to the campaign, so anyone with some interest in history would enjoy it. "

												Rome: Total War is the third Total War game from England's Creative Assembly, and, to make a long story short, it's the best one yet. It was naturally expected to build on its illustrious predecessors, which featured epic-scale real-time battles and impressive attention to historical realism and detail. Shogun: Total War was a promising start for the series, while Medieval: Total War built on that promise to create an even more engrossing strategy game. With Rome: Total War, Creative Assembly takes the next step, and it's as much a revolutionary step as it is an evolutionary one, thanks to a beautiful new 3D graphics engine that makes the series' tactical battles--featuring thousands of soldiers--better than ever. The results are nothing short of spectacular, helping make Rome: Total War the very definition of an epic strategy game.Where do you want to go today? The ancient world beckons, if you're brave enough to take it on.As in the earlier Total War games, there are essentially two distinctly different types of gameplay in Rome. There's the overarching turn-based campaign in which you conquer cities and provinces, make improvements, and move armies around the map as you expand your empire, and then there are the real-time battles in which you use tactics and maneuvers to crush your enemy in combat. After the helpful and informative tutorial campaign, you can tackle the main imperial campaign. You play as one of three powerful Roman families--the Julii, the Bruti, or the Scipii--attempting to increase the size and glory of Rome and shore up your faction's power and influence. As all three factions are Roman, there's literally no difference between them in terms of units and building types, though they do have different responsibilities. The Julii must deal with the Gauls and Germania to the north in a difficult, landlocked campaign. The Bruti are required to deal with the remnants of the Greek city-states and expand the empire to the southeast. And the Scipii are tasked with subduing Carthage, Rome's great nemesis to the southwest.At least, that's the principle goal of each faction. But there's a fourth, unplayable Roman faction, one that can influence your course during the campaign: the Roman senate. The senate will order you on missions, from blockading a hostile port or conquering a city (and perhaps exterminating the populace, depending on the level of enmity between Rome and the faction in question) to forging a trade deal or an alliance with a foreign faction. It's up to you whether you actually obey the order, as sometimes the senate will try to stretch you thin on purpose. If you carry the orders out successfully, you stand to gain a monetary reward, a useful new military unit, or influence in the senate. Failing to carry out missions earns the displeasure of the senate and affects your standing with that body. By and large, though, the senate missions help to focus the otherwise huge scope of the campaign--instead of being faced with the monolithic task of trying to conquer Europe, you can instead look forward to accomplishing a long series of short-term goals.It's helpful to perform senate missions because they can affect an improved feature in Rome: Total War--families. Each of the three Roman factions is essentially one huge family, and your generals and governors are related to one another by birth, marriage, or adoption. These are the leaders of your faction, and they all have traits--strengths and weaknesses--that define their abilities. A strong general may have an excellent command rating, but his disdain for bureaucracy would make him a poor governor. Meanwhile, an otherwise strong governor may have a dislike of farming, which would affect the agricultural output in the province he's in. But if your family members are selected to hold important senate posts, they'll gain influence and abilities once out of office. This introduces a limited role-playing component in the game, as you actually care about trying to further the careers of your family members so they can serve you better.In addition to traits, family members--not to mention your spies, assassins, and diplomats--can all attract retinues. These are the hangers-on who surround important people, such as advisors, mentors, bodyguards, lackeys, sycophants, and more. Each of these can affect your characters' abilities. For example, a wrestler can improve a character's influence (by being able to literally twist arms), as well as provide added protection against an assassination attempt. You can actually collect and trade retinue members among your family, so you can transfer them to where they're needed the most.You'll draw your faction's leaders from the family tree. Make sure not to kill off your heirs in battle.Families are also critical because only family members can serve as generals. You can assemble armies without a general, but they'll be poorly led and will likely fare badly in battle. But with a general, the army's fortune can change. A general with a high command ability is a powerful force in battle, as a well-led smaller force can defeat a poorly led larger force most of the time. On the other hand, the fact that generals are drawn from the ruling family can be dangerous, because you need to make sure there are future generations of leaders and generals. A disastrous battle can wipe out whole branches of the family tree, cutting down promising young sons before they can sire heirs. This can have a crippling effect later on in the campaign, when you find yourself short of qualified generals and governors with a huge empire to manage. It makes for an excellent incentive to try and preserve your generals, rather than treat them as easily replaceable fodder.Thankfully, when you're short of governors, your cities will be taken over by the ""automanager,"" which is represented by an appointed official who runs the city in your name. You can give the automanager certain priorities, such as to follow a military or financial policy, and it will go about constructing the building and units required. (You can also turn on the automanage functionality in cities that do have governors, if you don't want to micromanage at all.) The computer is generally good at doing what you tell it to do, and this should appeal to players who don't want to spend a lot of time on the campaign map. But if you're a fan of grand strategy and want to control every detail, you'll want to make sure you have plenty of family members at your disposal.You can choose to autogenerate battle results or fight the battles personally. In most cases, it's easier and simpler to autogenerate the smaller fights.You can choose to autogenerate battle results or fight the battles personally. In most cases, it's easier and simpler to autogenerate the smaller fights.When you're not busy trying to crush your opponents, you can try to spy on, trade with, and subvert them. The diplomacy system has been completely overhauled since Medieval: Total War, and you now have a lot more options at your command. These include forming alliances, bullying your neighbors into becoming protectorates of Rome, and bargaining for trade rights. You can also dispatch spies and assassins to probe for weaknesses in enemy defenses, or to take out a key enemy general before a crucial battle. And in a nice twist, you can plant spies in your own cities, where they'll help keep unrest in check by acting as a secret police of sorts, rooting out the troublemakers. I definitly recommend this game to people who enjoy a good, long, legendary campain.			"

												It's hard to say exactly what's the best thing about this game. From its incredible soundtrack to its exciting battles, I cannot find any part of this game I do not like. I was pleasantly surprised to find that unlike many other ""strategy"" games I've played, this one actually felt like it required a strategy to win. I haven't fought with all factions yet so I haven't expierenced fights with many different kinds of units, but combat feels well-balanced (except with the Gauls and Britons, whose hordes of disorderly footsoldiers are easily crushed, making wars with them a bit too easy and not as exciting).Directing combat is easy, though units like Equites and the general's bodyguard are not fire and forget and require attention, which may make directing large armies a bit overwhelming, but that may just be me. The interface for controlling your units is simple enough to understand easily, and issuing commands is what you'd expect it to be.On to the world map: There's nothing extremely special about it, but managing towns sometimes requires a bit of its own strategizing. I have terrible governing skills, so a few towns at a time that I've conquered will be having riots, and not many of my towns will have governors in them to keep order. This can prove inconvenient in situations when there are multiple towns that need attention. But hey, maybe you can do better. Every part of this game is strategy through and through.I may not have gone over every explicit detail of the game in this review, but I give it a ten out of ten. It may be old, but for people who are tired of extremely repetitive strategy games, it's definitely something new.			"

												I was looking for new strategy games, and I didn't find any that would match the simple, straight forward, but always replay-worthy quality of Rome:TW.Of course, it is outdated now. Of course Rome II for instance has much nicer graphics. Of course, Rome:TW has its flaws.What the newer games all lack is the concentrated energy of this old style game. They give you bling bling, but then they limit your playing experience because the devs want to shape the way you play a game, instead of presenting the player with opportunities.I'll give you a - limited - example, just to show the main point, I could go into detail in many respects, but here's one that should show what I mean in principle. In Rome:TW, you could march an army without a general into hostile territory. Or you could scale walls with a single infantry unit - it's your choice (and your troops' funeral, perhaps). In Rome II, you are forced to recruit a general. You must replenish resources, even if you would like to get an advantage by sacrificing some units. You cannot win a game based on skill and creative tactics, but only by playing by the book. But the game will throw an achievement your way in exchange for freedom...I miss old style games like some old software, that did exactly what it was supposed to do and nothing else.Time to besiege Alexandria, brb			"

												The original game it's self is alright(but that's why people made mods that are awesome).  I rarely care 'bout graphics but if old graphics are a problem for you, you can find all sorts of mods and stuff for that.  I use Rome Total Realism VII mod and it not only improves the graphics a lot, but it changes the politics of the game(which ain't that good in the original game)  Get this game and look for cool stuff to add on to it.

												On older games, you will often experience performance that is less than optimal given how modern hardware should be able to shred older titles. However the Steam version of Rome Total War Gold somehow manages to lower performance even further by an exponential level, to the point where you will experience single-digit FPS numbers on large battles. For whatever reason, this effect seems to be amplified even further on the Alexander expansion.Apparently this has something to do with the switch from Gamespy to Steam servers. Anyhow, the only reason to buy this on steam is for the multiplayer, which is almost completely dead anyway. Performance is absolutely unacceptable.			"

												Rome Total War is an excellent game on it's own but with Barbarian Invasion added in the mix makes this a 20/10 game. My favourite part of Barbarian Invasion was being invaded by The Huns (Mongolians) and only having 374 men protecting my village from 1,586 Mongolians. I won the battle with 218 men spare and 1424 kills. Defintely buy this game!			"

												Rome: Total War has always been one of my favourite strategy games. Managing your provinces while waging war and besieging settlements  - or being beseiged yourself - is a thrill, and while the A.I. may preform some questionable decisions during the campaign map or in a battle, it still provides a fair or difficult challenge either way, depending.From the Romans to the Greeks, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. And all with the same goal: becoming the supreme ruler of Rome.Only problem is the pirate fleets. They never stop sinking your fleets, and they never stop appearing either. It'd be easier to march your army around the world then have them wiped because a rebel fleet kept attacking your own fleets until they couldn't withdraw further.			"

Rome: Total WarJust another overly subjective personal opinion FIRST DRAFTSadly I cannot offer anything that represents even a small fraction of an objective, highly professional review, thanks to the lack of my competence. What I got is only my subjective little opinion crafted by my experiences with this amazing game, which I see as a significant pillar and a spectacular peak, not only of the Total War series, but of the strategy genre as well.  I started to play with the Total War series with the first Shogun: Total War back in the early 2000's. I still have the physical copy of that great game in my drawer, next to Medieval: Total War with the Viking Invasion Expansion, and Medieval II: Total War + Kingdoms. As a kid who played a lot with turn-based strategy games like the first 2 Civilization, and Heroes of Might and Magic 2-3 (yes, I am an old fart), i was fascinated by the system and the era Shogun could offer. I was captured by the whole notion of empire building and expansion, and while I respected the whole battle-simulation aspect (which I played for hours back then), I realized that I was much more impressed by the campaign map, with its diplomacy, economy system, constructions, army building, etc. After Shogun I played a lot with Medieval Total War, which became my favorite thanks to its theme, and then for some particular reason, i did not try out Rome. I was not really interested in the ancient era, and jumped right to Medieval II. It was overwhelmingly superior to the two games I played before, and for a short period of time, I thought that Medieval II brought these improvements into the series. But I was wrong. It was Rome.I borrowed a physical copy of Rome: Total War in 2007 and realized how huge leap this game took from its predecessors in almost every aspect of the game. From the map which changed the whole one province = one army slot type to a more dynamic one with much more attention to positions and maneuverability, the engaging senate system with its authentic theme and quests, till the improved and much more detailed dynasty and family-tree building with an original ruler and general traits system, this game assembled a lot of great ideas, that not only gave it more soul and meat than the previous games, but it also made me identify with certain problem-solving and task performance situations much more effectively. I bought my own physical copy of Rome in the same year, but it did not live long. In 2009, after tons of gameplay hours, it gave up the good fight. After playing Rome, I went back to Medieval II, I bought Empire, and also Shogun 2, but I stopped trying out the latest entries of the series. I realized, that none of these games were able to eclipse the glory of Rome. Yes, they added new themes, some new mechanics, new graphics, changed some features, but the core mechanics are still those that was established in Rome Total War, and personally I only see them as bigger, brighter, louder echoes of the same old system, which still keeps its head up high. It may look ancient to some, but this well-crafted piece of gaming is not even close to become outdated.			"

												I wanted this game when it first came out, but didn't have the hardware nor funds to do so.Years later, I finally managed to acquire it, and I was not disappointed. To this day, this is still a decent game.The game is half civilization builder, half tactical battle simulator.You manage a faction, which includes cities and armies. Build up your cities for bonuses and to unlock better units. Guard your territory and expand it with your mighty armies.I love the tactical battles in this game. There's been some moments where I wasn't sure if I could win, and only through superior tactics and maneuvering could I maintain some sort of victory. Also, there's been battles I've played perfectly, where I've taken out armies two or three times my size.Don't get me wrong, the AI doesn't suck. If you try to just throw your troops at the enemy, you'll be in for a rude awakening. Also, be aware, this is not a short game (although there is alternate game modes if you're short on time and just need a quick fix). A campaign will take many hours to complete, spanning several days of gameplay.Who should buy this game? People who like civilization games, sure, but more importantly, those who love tactical battles where the battle is won more by brain power than sheer might. Also, those interested in long campaigns... Rome wasn't built in a day, and it won't be conquered in one either.Who shouldn't buy this game? RTS players who tend to just build up bases and overwhelm their opponents with sheer numbers. It is a possible way to play, but it wouldn't be an easy trip. Also, anyone who may just be a casual gamer should probably avoid this series.Anyway, I also recommend an article linked on the Rome:Total War news page, about the best and worst Total War games. It was a good read, and help me to decide which Total War to buy next (I'm going to download it as soon as my monthly internet bill rolls over).All in all, this may not be the *best* Total War game (idk, haven't played any others, yet), but it is very good in its own right, and its easy to see how it launched such a successful series of games. This one is definitely good, but I also recommend that you do a little research and see which Total War may be most to your liking before purchase, as they're all a little different (so I've read).

												When this goes on sale, there's just nil reason to not buy this game. The modding community is still active, presenting you with a plethora of game overhauls or additions on a smaller scale - whatever your preference - along with a healthy multiplayer mode and an endless supply of singleplayer conquest. If you're remotely interested in the strategy genre, you can't pass up what is one of the best PC games of all time.			"

												This game is probably one of the best games ever to me personally. It is one of those games that to this day, has aged well. There are signs of aging sure, but mostly due to issues with newer OS (Please fix Creative, thanks!). This game pits you as one of the three Ancient Roman families against the world, destined to conquer and divide and while only the three initial Roman families are avaliable at the start, if you completely conquer certain nations, you can unlock those too for the Grand Campaign.What makes this game great is the amount of randomness and innate customazable characters that give this game personality. Through the family tree you will gain members and depending on how you use (or not) them, they can become crazy warmongers or glorious leaders, a depth Creative Assembly never truly tried to recreate after Medieval Total War 2. You will care (or hate) these characters as their personalities shine during their grand speeches before your army clashes with the enemy.I recommend you this game, not for its combat and action, but for its personality and charm. Each grand campaign will likely be unique as different nations rise and fall and different characters are born into your family. If you haven't tried it and you love turn based/RTS strategies, don't miss this one out.			"

												Now superceded but a great game in it's own right - I immensely enjoyed playing the long  campaigns of all 3 familys in this game.    Each one plays a litttle differently to maintain your interest - and because of their location will have different strengths and weakness's.  Should you buy it? - Yes if you like action oriented strategy and tactics and or historical warfare.I like it enough to have bought it in boxes and from 2 different companies digitally as well. And it runs fine on most modern computer systems so you shouldn't need to break the bank on new hardware either.Of late (July 2015)  I have noticed a move back to this game from Rome II - with some saying they have dumbed the AI and gameplay down in the new one in favour of better graphics.  Ive put in 622 hours on it on steam.			"

So anyway this game has a lot of cool stuff in it, like the ability to move your troops around the map. Also, what I think is the most important, you could actually use boats xD.

This game pits you as one of the three Ancient Roman families against the world, destined to conquer and divide and while only the three initial Roman families are avaliable at the start, if you completely conquer certain nations, you can unlock those too for the Grand Campaign.What makes this game great is the amount of randomness and innate customazable characters that give this game personality. Through the family tree you will gain members and depending on how you use (or not) them, they can become crazy warmongers or glorious leaders, a depth Creative Assembly never truly tried to recreate after Medieval Total War 2. You will care (or hate) these characters as their personalities shine during their grand speeches before your army clashes with the enemy.I recommend you this game, not for its combat and action, but for its personality and charm. Each grand campaign will likely be unique as different nations rise and fall and different characters are born into your family. If you haven't tried it and you love turn based/RTS strategies, don't miss this one out.			"

												Now superceded but a great game in it's own right - I immensely enjoyed playing the long  campaigns of all 3 familys in this game.    Each one plays a litttle differently to maintain your interest - and because of their location will have different strengths and weakness's.  Should you buy it? - Yes if you like action oriented strategy and tactics and or historical warfare.I like it enough to have bought it in boxes and from 2 different companies digitally as well. And it runs fine on most modern computer systems so you shouldn't need to break the bank on new hardware either.Of late (July 2015)  I have noticed a move back to this game from Rome II - with some saying they have dumbed the AI and gameplay down in the new one in favour of better graphics.  Ive put in 622 hours on it on steam.			"

												I was the romano british, and most of europe was under my grasp. I had forged a strong alliance with the east and west roman empires, and most of the hordes had crumbled beneath my combined arms tactics. My graal knights ruled the world, and history was as it should be. Then the eastern roman empire decided I was making too much trade on londinum and landed there en masse, the same turn that the huns came out of hiding. The western roman empire, confused on what to do declared war on everything that breathed. Civilization crumbled again, and I will now have to spend another sixty hours piecing everything back together again.The game is a great strategy game, and the campaigns are fun (The modded ones are good fun as well) but for the love of god find a campaign AI upgrade.

												Hey guys back with another review. This time its for the newest and most improved sequel to Total War: Galactic Bowling. This game brings a whole new perspective to the war based trilogy we all know and love as, Total War: Elephant rekters. lel XD. So anyway this game has a lot of cool stuff in it, like the ability to move your troops around the map. Also, what I think is the most important, you could actually use boats xD. So yeah I give this game and awesomesauc out of awesomesauce. Get it? Its basically 11/12 because I left a number out! xD. So yeah have fun playing this RPG because I sure did cx. See ya next time!

												I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a strategy game.The spectacular graphics and extensive detail behind each character and race.Whether you choose to play as a Roman or a Gaul, each family member has their own traits and differences, so every new playthrough has it's own new experiences.The battles are utterly amazing, whether you're flanking your enemy with cavalry, using your archers to hold off twice your men, or bringing reinforcements that either you or an AI can control.Then there's the diplomatic side to it, you can put a spy in an enemy city in the hopes that when the time comes, they manage to open the gates for your men. Or, sending an assassin to kill an enemy captain, maybe send your diplomat to win over the enemy?However you choose to play the game, it's up to you. But it is definetely worth the price tag! 8/10 "

												Easily the best RTS game of its era, it might have aged a bit, but it is a cheap way of having some relatively realistic RTS fun.Some of the mechanics might be outdated, the graphics might not be the best and some units not realistic, but the unique to the Total War series battle and campaign system easily make up for it. Many historically famous and important factions to choose from, including 3 roman factions, the Germanic Confederation, Macedon etc.Good (although not very sensitive/complete) diplomacy options will give you the chance to regulate the fate of the (then known) world with other means than just endless battles. I rate this game with 7/10 only because since then btter games have been released, especially from the same series.			"

												Rome Total War is a war simulator that takes place during the Roman Empire. You can play on a variety of sides during various skirmishes and all out battles all over Italy.The game in general is entirely reliant on combat and tactics. Moreso then most strategy games, which tend to feature other factors like base building or RPG elements. With Total War, it's exactly what it says on the tin. War, as it was fought 2000 years ago. With thousands of troops and commanding 30 units in a single time rather then a handful.			"

												This is a game where you actually fight the battles, using tactics to win them rather than statistics. Where if your army is inferior you can still win. The battles can involve thousands of soldiers (if played on huge scale), with a maximum of 20 units of soldiers per army. The AI is rubbish, but ignore that. The campaign isn't the selling point of this game, it is the battles. There's online ones too. Whatever. Get this game, it's cheap. "

												There are probably hundreds of recommendations for Rome Total War, but I decided to write one as well. Rome Total War by far is one of the best strategy games to ever break into the market. Though the graphics are a little outdated, considering it first came out in 2004, the gameplay, unit selection, campaign, and my personal favorite, Multiplayer are outstanding. One of the best, if not the best game in the Total War series. I would recommend this to anyone who is a lover of Ancient Warfare, Ancient history, military history, and real time strategy games. Even if you dont' like any of those topics, play it anyway, because through this game one may sprout an interest in one of many subjects relating to this games history.			"

												If you haven't played a Total War, game before, and even if you have, olden but golden Rome: Total War is no let down.Based during the age when ancient empires were being built, RTW is both a RTS and TBS in one game.The Campaign mode(TBS) allows you to take control of a historical civilization and take its humble roots and create an empire. Improve and manage your economy, infastructure, military, taxes, and more. Quell uprisings and keep your people happy. Lash out upon the world: wage war and wield clever diplomacy to accomplish your goals. Take on the world all at once or one piece at a time: create your empire as you feel fit!When engaging enemy forces for battle in Campaign and when playing Multiplayer(RTS), utilize a variety of faction-unique units to dominate your opponents! There are many, many playstyles to fit your taste; no one strategy is going to be your all-time winner, though some playstyles may be more comfortable for you. These battles can range from petty skirmishes to all-out conflict. No one battle is ever the same.The graphics are decently good, the gameplay is superb, all in a single package. The only downsides lay in occasional multiplayer trolls and that the RTS combat can be a bit overwhelming/arcade-like since it can be very fast-paced at times. Get used to that, and you have yourself a wonderful game.10/10			"

												My favorite Total War game and the game that actually got me into the series.I love the roman period.I have literally spent 1000's of hours on this game, probably completed the campaign more than 50 times, not including the 2 dlc's, that was well before steam. And apart from the graphics/resolution, a game spoiling bug (epic seige bug) and the quite boring building structure, compared to later games, this game is still my prefered TW game even over rome 2!This is a great game to get if you are a TW fan and want to play on a low spec laptop.It is not about the graphics like more modern TW games, for me it is the far more simpler strategy and building management that would make me suggest for people to buy this game.The building structure was quite simple as was the diplomacy, army management etc.. essentially, when you know what you are doing, maintaining an attacking flow and constant faction progression is a much easier task than R2 for instance.Perfect for playing when you don't exactly want to invest a whole amount of mental energy to a campaign, but want to succeed, and enjoy a great TW game.

												Rome: Total War. So much can be said about this game. For this review I'll feel more comfortable explaining all of the Pro's and Con's I faced when playing this game. Remember, reviews are very subjective so my experience may not match yours. However, that shouldn't discourage you to purchase this title.Pro's: Right off the bat I'm going to talk about one of the key selling points to this game. The Battles!Battles in this game highly depend on your strategical and logical thinking. You command hundreds to thousands of soldiers on the battle field. Each having unique properties and abilities. Some troops are purely Missile (Troops that use Bows, Slings and Human Heads), while other troops can be a mix of this. A good example to look at are Skirmishers. These troops throw spears and damage units. When they're ammunition is depleted they go into combat with daggers and swords. However, they are inexperienced at hand to hand combat. These types of setbacks and advantages are what bring out the strategic aspect of Total War. So many possibilities as to how you can fight. It's definitely a well made and balanced system.The Campaign!Rome 1 has a phenominal campaign alongside its battles. The campaign map spans from Portugal to the Middle East and Russia. Northern Africa and the UK are also included. There are 21 factions however, only a couple are playable. The only way you can play as other factions is by easilly editing a certain script in Rome 1's files. I reccomend doing this as it gives you more options and various ways to make the campaign different. Each faction owns settlements in their unique areas. These can be profited off of to fund your army and other buildings to improve your empires happiness and what you can train in certain settlements. For example, the Carthaginians have access to War Elephants. These beasts can tear through any troop easilly. The only problem is you can't train them during early game as you need certain stables to do so.Cons: The AI!First of all, let me explain my position on the AI, It's not terrible at all, especially for a game made in 2004. However, it still needs to be adressed. In a game with a battle system that is dependant on strategy, well programmed AI is essential for such a mechanic. The AI in this game does fail to do so at times. Keep in mind though, the amount of times that such a problem occured is very miniscule. During sieges my Cavalry would sometimes decide to take the least logical route to get a to a certain point. Instead of going through an easy passage, they go to where all my infantry is and try to run through the hoardes of enemies. As long as you can correct them (Which can be done with one right click) this wont be a huge problem but, timing in Total War plays a big part in strategies. It may seem like I am nitpicking but, once you play this game you'll understand the importance of the AI.Final Verdict: Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yeah I do! This game is amazing and I will always love it to death. Especially considering how it was made in 2004. In fact, I would even say that this game out performs Rome 2 (That game is a huge mess that I don't care to explain right now).I give this game 10 Roman Soldiers outta ♥♥♥♥ing 10. Also keep in mind, this comes with an expansion pack.			"

Each army unit has ~100 men, and an army has a maxmum of 20 units. The game covers the period from 270 BC to 14 ACThere are 8 factions to play.Rome, divided in 3 familites: Julii, Brutii and Scipii. These factions are available to play at the beginning of the game.The other factions need to be unlocked playing a campaign.GaulsGermaniaBritonsSeleucid EmpireGreeksPartian EmpireCartage.			"

												As a huge advocate of the Total War franchise, id say this is hands down the best Total War game ever made. Even with CA's recent release of Rome 2, it still does not compare to the level of pure effort put into Rome 1. Rome 2 is horedously buggy, overpriced, naval combat is a plus, but only makes the game more tedious, just as it did in Napoleon and Empire, and simply uses new age graphics to lure players. No game should be judged by graphics, onl by gameplay mechanics, sound, community, and execution. Anyone who says ""DONT GUY THIS GAME OUTDATED GRAPHICZ SUX BUY SHOGUN OR ROME 2"" is inceccantly butthurt about losing 60 Dollars to the shitpile that is Rome 2.Buy this before you play ANY other Total War game.

												I know it says 7 minutes but I had the boxed version when I was younger and I have to say this is the STANDARD for Total War games, if not (older) strategy games. I am not saying this game is good for nostalgic reasons, I actually did enjoy this game because of how simple the map was yet how tactical the battles were, even with less units than the newer TW games. The game's map was smaller because the game is dated, and mainly for that reason I would get Rome 2 instead, because with a bigger map comes more diverse factions and units, more climate changes, and naval battles are not in this game, if I remember correctly (Though I hate them). Note: I love the city building in this game because of how many types of buildings there are, their simple and straightforward effects, and how it branches off to new things, and also I am pretty sure you can view your city in 3D, which is nice (Could be Medieval 2?)

												Fun game, easy mechanics, but graphics alright...(it is an ""old game"")Campaign:Starting from 272 BC from 3 Roman factions (Brutii, Juli, Scipii) You start expanding and managing Your own empire, obeying The Senates requests and missions- breaking out wars and building alliances(you can overthrow The senate ""S.P.Q.R."" when you grow stronger and turn on all Your roman allies or continue fighting with them). Defeated factions become available for a new imperial campgain, in other words- new buildings, units, strategies.The campaign map is huge: covers entire Europe(except for the Northen regions), North Africa and little of east Azia and has over 50 provinces. Rome: Total War also has historical battles where You get to decide the outcome of it(normally good commanders lead their troops to victory, these battles are to judge Your skill and leadership to win with minimum casualties)Multiplayer:Up to 8 commanders in the battlefield, players can choose between scored resolution and last man standing modes, form teams or just go ""every man for himself"" A.K.A Free For All(FFA). The host chooses the battlemap, sets rules, and it is go time!Even though R:TW is old, it's still remarkable, and offers an enjoyable gameplay. It is the fact the You get to control a full army: from hundreds up to thousands of soldiers at Your disposal! "

												Rome Total war is a rare breed. A realistic RTS game without the chaos of real life interfering with it. Historically, this game is fairly accurate, and the Roman fighting style lends itself to more user friendly battles. And here is where the game is such a drastic improvement on the previouse titles in the series.Organised ChaosWhether it is by phalanx or testeudo, the battles are a lot more organised than its predecessors. Battles are based on your ability to organise, coordinate and react to the adversity, more than the troops at your disposal. Gone are the morale sapping archers on the hill top and heavy cavalry charge from Medieval TW2 - Rome brings you a more balanced feel to the battle, even if it is elephants vs peasants.Macro, not micro managementWhat I like most about Rome (and where they seem to have strayed from the path in more recent releases) is that these are strategy simulations, not population management games. The management evironment is simple and straight forward, the interface is both familiar and intuititve while still giving you the ability to go into more detail if those damn peasants insist on revolting every turn.Rome is a great game to either pick up and play or delve into in for days on end. Rest assured there is a battle around every corner, usually where you least suspect it.			"

												One of the greatest games of all times- who doesn't want to conquer the world using Pigs you can set on fire? This game, is without a doubt, one of the greatest things total war invented, the variety of nations and paths you can take leaves you almost unable to stop. Try to conquer the known world, killing the gauls, the britons, the spaniards... etc, but we can't forget the parthians and their amazing pyjama warriors ;p Once you tire the singleplayer (normally after you have dominated the world at least a dozen times) you can try your hand at defeating other players on the multiplayer. I spent so many hours of my life dragging my friends with their laptops to my house to play all v all on this game... It was essentually who was the most devious or subtle one of us who won, always a challenge to be more cunning than the next. I found the best way to success was to use troops that blended into the map... so though they could be seen, they were'nt always acknowledged by my opponents... Though I may not have many hours in this game on steam, it was through the disk that I played a good thousand of hours on...			"

												There is very little to say about the amazingness of this game. So instead I will put a recipe for pancakes.\Makes: 4 to 6 servingsTime: 20 minutesIt’s amazing how quickly you can whip up this batter.  Store it, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.  Adjust the consistency of the batter with either more milk or more flour as you like. Recipe from How to Cook Everything.2 cups all-purpose flour2 teaspoons baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon sugar (optional)2 eggs11/2 to 2 cups milk2 optional tablespoons melted and cooled butter, plusunmelted butter for cooking, or use a neutral oil likegrapeseed or corn1. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat while you make the batter.2. Mix together the dry ingredients. Beat the eggs into 11/2 cups of the milk, then stir in the 2 tablespoons cooled melted butter if you’re using it. Gently stir this mixture into the dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten the flour; don’t worry about a few lumps. If the batter seems thick, add a little more milk.3. Use a little butter or oil each time you add batter, unless your skillet is truly nonstick. When the butter foam subsides or the oil shimmers, ladle batter onto the griddle or skillet, making any size pancakes you like.  Adjust the heat as necessary; usually, the first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches. The idea is to brown the bottom in 2 to 4 minutes, without burning it. Flip when bubbles appear in the center of the pancakes and the bottoms are cooked; they won’t hold together well until they’re ready.4. Cook until the second side is lightly browned, a couple more minutes, and serve or hold on an ovenproof plate in a 200°F oven for up to 15 minutes. "

												Rome: Total War is a great game. You know this game came out in 2004 and twelve years later this game managed to heavily impress me. From the small part of diplomatic relations to the absolute massive battle scenes, the game just immediately sucked me in. Now the Total War games had never really been a big thing to me up until this moment so I was just a bit dubious about how much this game would appeal to me, but I am a history buff and I was trying to find a way to spend the summer so I picked it up during the sale. What I found was an actually really good game that managed to combine the turn base parts with the real time strategy. The game as said is split into two types of strategy. The first part is map screen. From here you manage your settlements and your armies. You can upgrade your towns and recruit new units. From here you can also send out your diplomats to other factions in order to institute trade agreements and forge alliances for wars. The diplomats have actually quite a bit that they can discuss with the other factions. You can make demands such has making them hand over a territory or you can create a trade agreement that can help your income or just allow them military access to other parts of the world. Another thing that impressed me is that they can reject your offer and make counter offers. This really does feel like an actual negotiation rather than just a basic “I declare peace or war thing.” One thing I’m going to say though is that there is a severe problem with the lack of anything to really during peace time. In the end though the map screen is fantastic turn based strategy. Now as for the actual battle screens it is one the greatest parts of the game. The sieges and the battles are just so massive that it is impossible to be swept away by it. The fights aren’t too complicated. It doesn’t take long to figure the strengths and weaknesses and of each unit. Just know when to charge and how to flank the enemy and that’s rather easy to pick up. What makes it really work though is just the basic ability to pause the game and figure out your positions and where each unit should go. This takes a lot the panicking and stress out of other strategies that usually takes me out of most strategy games. The units are widely varied and it is rather cool to see the progress of your units to much more powerful troops.In the end what really sells the game is just the absolute scale it has. The game just feels massive and every advancement you do makes you feel more powerful. Some might say that the effects don’t look good and to those people I say they need to shut it. The game looked amazing back in the day and still looks line today. I don’t care if we can’t see every pimple on the soldiers they look fine. As for the multiplayer I don’t know what it’s like. I am not interested in it, but if you are then check it out. Rome: Total War is a game that everyone should check out if you are interested in history or if you think you might be interested in the game.  "

												Rome: Total War is by far one of the greatest games of all time. I have been playing it since 2012 and could say without a doubt that this is on my top 10. There is one very interesting thing about this game though. I have seen nothing make an army of over 2000 run faster than 152 Beserkers and 1 General. No kidding here. I main germany and build armies solely based off of 4-5 Beserkers and 1 Screeching Women for skirmishes. I have chased down 2 Armies (One was around 2800 and the other was 2500) and won because they fled the battlefield. I love this game.			"

I can't stress the hours I lost after finishing my homework and assignments.The game is nothing short but a masterpiece, forever cementing its place in my heart after I first set my eyes on the dvd cover in a Dubai store I bought it from.Get it for yourself, Get it for your kids.

I assume not. Yolo, I bring it anywaysDuring deployment we start at opposite ends of our sideWe accidentally start the battle early; we have not consolidated our forcesThe barbarians deploy about 2/3 of their forces opposite me with a blocking force against my teammateMy unsupported legionnaires are being overrun by the barbarian hordesMy teammate is bulldozing through the blocking force opposing him and rushing to my aidCan I survive long enough?I decide to commit my reserve - the praetorians - to sacrifice their lives for timePRAETORIANS, HOLD THE LINE AS LONG AS NECESSARY!The praetorians are having none of thisThey singlehandedly stabilize my lineBy the end of the battle over 900 of my 1500 men will be dead. Many others will have retreatedOnly 4 of 80 praetorians will dieThe literal last act of the battle was the infantry praetorians chasing down a mounted barbarian warlord and chopping him upI mouse over their status before the battle ends - they have been fighting about 2/3 of the battle, and charging up and down the field. Most of my other units are badly mauled, have low morale, and are exhausted“eager, warmed up, motivated by presence of general”ROMA VICTOR 10/10 would slaughter barbarians for the glory of rome again "

WoW -Rome: Total War- WoW Like a lot of people I think, I've already played this game before I played it on steam, maybe something like a 100 hours In a first part, the gameThis is a Total War....The strategic part in Rome is that without cavalry, you're ♥♥♥♥ed ;DThis is one of the main this to follow in the game : make your cavalry move and BUILD A WALL with  your infantryBecause the game is in the antiquity, you can find elephant, chariots and phalanx... very immersive thingsThe mercenary system is better in Rome than in Medieval II because the mercenaries cost REALLY less money and are really more useful. The Mods-I didn't test the barbarian invasions mod- I saw there were mod but I never played on ...(There are mods like LOTR) The communityRome: Total War dosn't have a big community, something like 1500 players permanently and people are not jumping on online battles.The campaigns is better -_- The end's word 3$ is the price of a candy pack but it's also the price if R:TW when there are sales: You'll eat your candy in 3 minutes or you'll play tens of hours on a CLASSIC  make your choice.... :D			"

												As the renaissance was based on roman and greek ideals, I shall now write you a play that describes the greatest moment of rome and the stain of greek historyI call it, ""Sparta's Folly""raise curtain, speaker comes on to stage centerSpeaker: Twas decades before the birth of christ, the house of brutii had besieged the greek town of Thermon, angered, the spartan king had personally went there to break it, however the roman general in charge of the siege was not going to give up and planned to get the town and win favor of the senate.curtain closes, speaker exits, a roman general appears on horse, he is off the house of brutii looking out at the battlefield, another general comes on stageGeneral 2: The greek army lead by Kleomenes of Sparta are on the nearby pennisula, what are your orders?General 1: we will besiege thermon again, once he comes into range we shall retreat and face off against his men on fairer groundGeneral 2: Fair sir?! there are almost 500 of them and only about 300 of us, we shall be fighting on less foul ground, but not fair!General 1: if this works it shall be foul for the greeksGeneral 2: very well sirromans exit the stage,kleomenes of sparta and a hoplite appear on stagehoplite: my liege, the romans have set out to take the city of thermon again, shall we engage?Kleomenes: Yes, and this time we shall give chase when they flee.hoplite: YES MY LIEGEhoplite exitsKleomenes: This should show those romans not to invade our territoryHe exits aswell, enter the first general and an equites, both seem to have been runningequites:General, the enemy has tooken the luregeneral 1: good then we shall show them our might, have your men ready, you'll be what decides this battleequites:Yes general!He exits, and general 2 entersGeneral 2: we have the high ground but that won't help much in this battle, how do you plan to win thisGeneral 1: you'll see when the time comes, you will also help in this battle, our spy has shown has the king has brought ranged units and peasants, you'll help keep them distracted while our hasati and velites take out their hoplites, then we'll take the kings headhasati: Generals, enemies are coming this way!General 1: Good, everyone in formation!speaker entersspeaker: The battle then began, while the king had been focused on the general and the main part of the army, the roman equites and the second generals guard quickily charged around the flanks, weakening the bulk of the greek army, outraged the king ordered his hoplites to hunt them down only for them to be lured away either far away from the battle or into the enemy lines where hasati and velite alike slauther them, finally the king had sent himself into the fray, only for his guard to be slain, injured he tried to flee, only to be chased down and slain by the same equites he was trying to hunt down. seeing their king dead on the ground the greek army was shattered, the romans did not end the battle and continued to hunt them down all the way thermon where they won with what men remained from that battle, this concludes our story of how the king of sparta foolishly threw himself into battle only for it to be his end.so get this game, I worked hard on this play "

												 Slightly out of date now especially with its successors release. However a great introduction to the series and this edition contains a huge amount of gameplay. The graphics are quite dated given the standard of the rest of the series nowadays but still enjoyable. While they spend the next year working out all the bugs on Rome: Total War 2 I would strongly recommend getting a taste for the game through this edition by which time Rome Total War 2 will be patched enough that it will be a superlative game. In the meantime you will easily lose yourself in this game and develop a real taste for the series in general.			"

												Possibly the best TW game on the market. It may just be me viewing it through nostalgia-tinted lenses, but this game definitelly surpassed the competition in my book.Pros:- Good unit variety, building variety, and so on.- Far more colorful and vibrant than later entries.- Good variety of civilizations.- Decent dificulty curve.- Replayable to almost infinity due to variety of strategems and civilizations.- Decent modding community and re-works through dedicated websites.Cons:- Realism slightly lacking.- Some balance issues in multiplayer (barbarians lack morale, phalanx beats any other unit one-on-one etc.).- Poor diplomacy.- Community has partially moved on to Medieval II and later, meaning less mods and reworks to add replayability that    otherwise.- Graphics slightly dated.In short, the game has much to reccomend it. The main complaint I find is that the game hasn't aged well compared to others, that the graphics are out of date etc. While some have a point, the old graphics have a certain charm and don't detract from the gameplay one bit. In fact, I take that as a point in their favor as it means that older systems can run the game without frying from the effort.Buy it. You won't regret it one bit.			"

												Total war, i expecxt you to do the right thing and add a game about WW1 or WW2 warfare. the two big ♥♥♥ wars in the human hisory. though the campaign may have to not rush through the years. it would add multiple types of warfare that strategist are killing niples for. actually 3 that i can think of. underwater, Tank, trench, Air, and even large scale naval bombardments.

												Rome Total War takes you on a journy to battlefields under the command of thousands of soldiers. Their are 20 factions. (21 if you count the rebels). Online is pretty good, only finding a game to join is a pain. In Campaign, you play as 3 roman factions and later you can play as other factions. Campaign is really hard but I keep playing anyways because of how fun it is. Their are a few things that I have to pick about this game but overall it's a must buy if your a Total War fan or not.Final verdict: 9/10			"

												I definetly loved this game. It was revolutionary at the time and is still considered one of the best total wars to date. It is mostly balanced and when it's not it's usually just the overpricing of certain units. The community is full of skilled players which is a pro and a con. Many players may struggle to get into the game because of that fact, but if you practice enough and look up some strategy guides then you can rek face. I felt that no army was super under-powered or super over-powered and that anyone could be good with any faction. Now I'm going to talk a bit more about the cons. One of my major cons is that some factions do not get that many units. In campaign this may be OK but in multiplayer it can make some factions harder to play as. Next con is, well it's old. I'm not complaining about graphics, I'm more complaining about limitations. Battles above five thousand are laggy and hard to play. Also the campaign is hard if you don't look up even one strategy guide. It's confusing and sometimes you feel like you don't know what to do. They give you some tips that aren't neccessarily helpful. I remember having to restart the game as the brutii often because it's that hard. You can end up having built up a large debt. And my final complaint is diplomacy. Oh god the diplomacy. The diplomacy is awful. I remember gaul asking me for trade rights, me accepting, and then they attack me. Also, I have a friend who was attacking the last city of dacia. Dacia had a ton of money and he had accept or we will attack, in exchange for ten thousand denarii. Dacia refused and got obliterated. Stingy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Also, Gaul in my most recent Brutii playthrough said ""give us 500 denarii or we will attack"" and I just gave it to them. Keep in mind that the julii is currently making them their ♥♥♥♥♥. Then I was like, ""Hey, want map information? Just give us 10,000 denarii."" Gaul counter offered with ""Give us 550 denarii every turn for two turns or we'll attack."" and I was like ""♥♥♥♥ you!"" and then Gaul went to go threaten the rest of rome. Bare in mind that they haven't attacked yet.My final score is 9/10 for the game. It struggles a bit, but for the time it was made it was amazing.			"

												This game...Despite its historical inaccuracies (more than likely set so to have a more balanced game), its a fun game. Its a game about taking the helm of the culture of your choice, then leading it to conquer all others (or a specific faction in some short campaigns). What more can I say about a ""Total War"" game?Despite its HUGE LACK of any decent diplomacy, classical Rome never saw fit to just let its rivals get away with anything. It's a game that wants you to take lands, demolish the barbaric religions, and build your own. What more can I say? Other than ""If you dont like it, mod it."" and ""I killed (absurd number of) peasants with (tiny number) of (elite troops)."" Seriously, if you don't like what is in the game, you can look up how to change it.Armoured Elephants ARE overpowered. Chariots and War Elephants aren't.Greek Cites shouldn't exist, Sparta should. Spain didn't exist, nor should it be unified, Why does Numidia hold Siwa? OBLIGITORY ""OUT OF TEN"" SCORE: 9/10. I need to find a mod that makes diplomacy better...			"

												I came, I saw, I conquered!Played it since my teen years, bought and played it again. Choose a Roman family, rise in status, fight barbarians, and seize power in Rome herself. Or you could be a barbarian heathen. Easily one of my favorite games in the series and one of the best RTS games of all time. The only problem perhaps is the autoresolve battle AI seems to leave a lot to be desired. However; if you wanted a turn based game I recommend The Republic of Rome Tabletop game (playable by your lonesome but better with friends you aren't afraid to lose) or your favorite Civilization. The Historical inaccuracy of certain aspects is also fairly blatant but it is forgiven due to the game being more about cinematic sword and sandal warfare than a rough simulation of historical events for that I recommend something by Paradox Interactive.The game's strenghts lie in it's great battle system and it's fascinating overworld of intrigue. If you want a hardcore tactics game it can be that but there is also an arcade mode for people who just want to watch the sword fights but do not wish to get heavily involved in tactical movement.This is a game I could recommend for anyone with even a passing interest in this period in history. The phoenicians are waiting to meet you on the field of battle.			"

												For the price of this game, it is a must buy. I have always loved strategy games, and I have ALWAYS loved total war games. Note though, the game is old, the newer versions of Total war such as Shogun 2 got a much better AI and if you have what I call ""Graphics sickness"" buy the newer versions.			"

												Developer: The Creative Assembly   Publisher: Activision   Release Date: 22.09.200Played On: (Various but most recently)Nvidia GTX 760AMD FX 6300 3.5Ghz8GB RAM(Upto several hundred hours to complete depending on faction, difficulty level and campaign length chosen).Where to start with Rome Total War? First released back in September 2004 the game recently reached it's tenth anniversary. I've played it on and off since release and the recent anniversary prompted me to go back and play through it again. It's a game that mostly stands up to the test of time for me and well worth playing today. I didn't play the Barbarian Invasion expansion included in the Steam edition as it's quite a distinct entity that should be reviewed in it's own right.Like all games in the Total War series there are two elements; the campaign map where you manage your empire, build cities, recruit units, move armies etc and the battle map, where you fight battles in real time. This gives the game some great depth and whilst you can auto-resolve battles this can be a bit hit and miss and you'll want to fight them yourself to get the best results. The Imperial Campaign is the main game mode where you can choose from a number of different factions and play through either a short or long campaign with prescribed victory conditions and different difficulty settings. There is a decent tutorial to ease you into things and plenty of advice is available throughout both with the optionn to turn it off for veterans.The Imperial Campaign is backed up by being able to fight custom battles where you choose the map, faction etc and Historical Battles which recreate a number of famous battles of the era such as Hannibal's invasion of Italy and the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest. You can also play online against other players but this wasn't something I did.The main campaign has a good deal of depth and each of the factions has different styles, units, cities and starting points which offer a wide variety of challenge. Playing as the Romans is the initial starting point and they are divided into three factions which compete against other and have some additional mechanics to account for including the Senate of Rome, the Marius Reforms and some other suprises which I won't spoil. Rome also generally has the strongest units and buildings which can make things somewhat straightforward for an experienced player. However a lot of the late game units of other factions more than match them and playing the campaign as Eygpt, Carthage, the Britons or others is very enjoyable.The mechanics of the campaign map are very broad and offer a wide variety of tactical options to pursue; bribery, assassination and spreading plagues amongst them. I played through on the very hard settings which I'd reccomend any veteran Total War player to do and the campaign offered a good challenge with interesting scenarios and incidents along the way. Whilst my progress was steady I wasn't able to steamroll the AI into the ground within a few turns. I did play as Eygpt who are one of the easier non Roman factions to play but still a challenge later in the game.The battle map is probably the slightly weaker side of the game and whilst some battles, particularly sieges, can be a bit difficult or frustrating, most are straightforward affairs if you have assembled a balanced army and have a relatively comprehensive grasp of the tactics to use. However the various factions armies all have different strengths or weaknesses and there isn't the rock, paper, scissors situation you see in some games. The Roman armies have the strongest armies as a general rule of thumb but other factions e.g. Eygpt, Germania have some very good units too and what works with one may not work at all with another.I've not mentioned performance or graphics at all as the game is ten years old and there generally shouldn't be any issues nor will it look fantastic.I'd also take a moment to mention the additional content available online from Europa Barborum and a couple of other sites. These add a huge amount to the game and are well worth a look if you want to take things further after playing the main game.Overall I'd definetely reccomend playing this if your a fan of the Total War series and I also feel its a good starting point for the series as whole. Those interested in the era itself will certainly find it enjoyable.			"

												This is one of my new favorite games of all time. While it isn't very up to date or pretty, its gameplay and simplicity make it great fun. If you're into the strategy genre of games, I highly recommend it, or if you want to get into the strategy genre as well, as it is a good game for beginners as well as long time strategists. Also, for an old game, its community is surprisingly active modding and multiplayer community.			"

												So i loved this game When i got it it felt so refreshing.I’m a huge fan of this setting the Roman Empire really did have some interesting wars and politics going on during its reign and you get to get in the thick of it all.Now im going to talk about the Total War games a little, if you haven’t played these games and like History and/or Strategy Games be it Real Time or Turn based (this game has the option to play both) then do you're self a favour and pick one of the absolute Gems up and disappear into the world of being a Leader/General.As for what one to get I would say this is 3rd on my list of Total War games If you own Shogun 2 and Medieval 2 then this is the one to get next.If you are looking at from I like this time period point of view I would point out Rome 2 is out....but if im honest this is a more solid game despite the Fact that Rome 2 is better Graphically and Mechanically this one is just so much better for many reasons ill mention two of them one being the Bugs and Glitches that infuriate even the most die hard TW fan.Secondly I would say that Rome 1 has a far superior Interface to Rome 2 its just a lot simpler and easier to use.I would give this game a 8/10.Edit - Doing this edit for my 2016 Awards badge			"

Although it probably can't compare to Rome II (Still have to purchase), its' gameplay is still very excieting to play after all these years.  If you want to go to the roots of the TW saga, this is a good place to start, that or go to the original Shogun and Medieval.			"

												Still the same pros&cons as the rest of the Total War series : halway between strategy game and cinema, entertaining but inadapted to challenging objectives. Note that this game has lots of user mods, with a community which is still lively. Therefore this is an interesting alternative to Rome II or any more recent Total War title if your computer sucks, if you're poor, or if you just don't like their new engine (I don't). The price to pay in term of features and gameplay richness is minimal.			"

												Rome: Total War is an excellent game. It allows you to take control of one of the three houses of rome (And other civs as well later) and pits you against others, you have to get your leaders into senates, conduct trade deals and manage provinces. You also have to manage the affairs of your family, whether or not your daughter will marry so and so, and if one of them dies of old age. It's a horrible feeling, that, especially when it's your leader who dies, and you are left lost, trying to find a Heir for when it happens again, moving your main body of the army under someone elses control. The battles are realistic, your men sometimes disobeying you, and having emotions of their own. If you are losing, they may run away, elephants and wolves will also freak them out. Sometimes one or two men will even disobey one of your orders, getting themselves killed, every loss you take is something you actually feel, as you must keep your army maintained and happy, keep your cities from rioting. It is not, however, impossible to play. I am doing it an injustice with how hard I am making it sound, it is truly an amazing game, and earns a good 9/10.			"

												The best Total War in my opinion and the only one I've finished so far. It is easy to see why this is considered the most influencial of all Total War games published. The battles are fantastic to play, the game is challenging to play, if you play certain factions, and fun to see a faction that was wiped out by the Roman imperilaists in our history, to suddenly lick Carthaginian sandal in your game. Another good feature in this game is how each faction has their own unique apperances and even how they fight and what units they can have, even if they are a bit copy and paste. If there are any flaws in this game, it is these; stupid stacked armies (several generals with up to 30 or more units), overpowered factions and historical inaccuracy.  The stupid stacked armies are a constant menace, especially  if you invade Rome, so be ready for that. Another one is overpowerded factions. The one in particullar is Egypt. If you play as the Seleucid Empire against them, good ♥♥♥♥ing luck! Historical inaccuracy is another flaw, but only minor compared to the latter two.Overall, the game is fantastic and a good place to start if you're new to Total War and want to see how the Total War franchise became more famous!

												Rome's Legacy wasn’t built in a day, and the game that bears its namesake was not free from this either. Unlike the empire, however, Rome the game's glory was ripped from it in a single moment---Rome 2's release. For nearly a decade, we the true lovers of Rome awaited its fable return, and begged the gods of the Creative assembly to return to us our legions! After the wonderful gift of Shogun 2 we thought certainly that this would be given to us, and that it would be glorious. Now that all the other classics had been given sequels the greatest of them all certainly was overdue for a revisit. Rome 2 was not a Total War, but a Total Joke... Unless you count the design choices conflicting with your desire to enjoy pillaging all of Antiquity-- But that was about as much a war as the British fighting the Zulu; the Zulu being your enjoyment.This prompted me to return to the original. Was it hard to put aside my Nostalgia to write this review? I would have to say nostalgia had no place in my experience with this game. For as many hours as I put in it all those years ago I can't say I had a plethora of memories to go on. Once I conquered Europe as the Saxons, and once I pitted Carthage against Egypt and both full stack armies were obliterated in an epic stalemate. These were my two favorite memories going into the game.I started up Rome and went for the Expansion ""Barbarian Invasion"" first. I picked the faction I always played as back in the day and took on the Vandal horde. We marched south into the Baltics and settled in present day Croatia area. Eventually the ERE decided I wasn't fit to exist and attempted a Reconquista. A fifty-year war ensued where we engaged the enemy professional armies with our militia. Suffering through the great losses of our people we pushed south taking Thessalonica and Achaea. The war finally came to a close after the third Siege of Constantinople took the city, and destroyed the ERE's last European Legion, and subjugated the most powerful city in the world during this point in history.The fledgling Vandal Kingdom of the Baltics established and independence now secure I reset the clock (And the game) to play the Vanilla. I decided to go a different route than I did when I was younger. Instead of picking Carthagians, or Scipii; I picked the Brutii. It took me a total of 6 minutes to realize what I just did. I was playing the Roman faction that was tasked to take the same exact lands as my Vandal kingdom had taken in the Expansion. I was essentially building the same ERE I would invade centuries later as the Vandals.  As I am still in the middle of my conquest of the Greek-Macedonian Alliance, I can’t really say that I curb-stomped them... In fact Athens remains defiant and un-siegeable from a practical standpoint. While the Greek armies of Athens  send every one of my Legions home completely rekt, the Macedonians force our defending armies to either remain garrisoned, or all-together abandon settlements to defend more critical points against the armies of the sons of Alexander at our gates.... Eh, at least the Senate likes me.So obviously I enjoy the game. I knew that before I even re-bought it on steam the other day. Despite being a decade old the game gets a ten for just the enjoyment. But I'm so confident in this game I am going to take it the extra mile and rate it like it was released a month ago, and compare it directly to Rome 2.Pros--Competent AISo the AI will not be winning any genius competitions, but put Rome’s AI up against Rome 2's AI and it will mop the floor with Rome II's pretty-boy face. Not only does this apply to the battles but the Campaign AI will actually give the player legitimate trouble.-SoundtrackGood, solid, mood setting music that changes based on the situation.  This music will get you PUMPED, and you'll remember these tracks for a lifetime. The track number is a little lacking in quantity, but quality is perfect. Medieval 2 might be the only one that can beat it.Units-The Roman factions all have the same units just painted different colors, but the Foreign factions are all unique to some extent. And don't think any faction is left out. Each one has their own death machines. Carthage has elephants, Egypt and Britain have Chariots, Greeks and Macedonians have Hoplites-- All of which will thoroughly ruin your day with brutal efficiency. The Barbarian Expansion scores a little lower on this to me, But the expansion still gets clearance on this issueReligion-(Barbarian Invasion only)This is a very simple religion system where the player can convert to a new religion at any point. Ironically the people will convert much, much faster than the player's own royal family. In short it's simple, but works.Engine- This Engine was designed for this type of game; Rome II's was designed for EMPIRE's Ranged based combat. Though the clashes can be anti-climactic at times; you'll never get the ridiculous mosh pit of Shogun 2 and Rome 2. Animations are also nothing to write home about, but they function, and don't jump around for kill animations.General Speeches-Yes. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GENERAL SPEECHES PEOPLE.Cons- Graphics- Graphics are dated, but it's a decade old; Since I said I was Rating this as if it was last month I can't not count this...... ummm.... come on that can't be it...Diplomacy- All total war games fail here, it functions but the AI can act a fool on a regular basis. the only TW game with decent diplomacy is probably Shogun 2.Seriously there’s not much to find wrong with this game. If you like Grand-Strategy and/or RTS this game is the one for you. Is it my favorite Total War game? Um, no I can't say it's my favorite, but it is the original champion. It didn't earn that honor form being a PoS. It was the first one I played back a decade ago, and it echoes a long forgotten day that CA had more pride, love, and passion for this title. Back then it was their baby, and it shows.for $9.99 Rome and the expansion is an investment any lover of strategy will not regret.If it was released last month:Modern Day Score- 7/10Overall and timeframes aside:Final Verdict- 8/10 When all is said and done Rome has aged moderatley well. While it does show it's age; the old man it more than capable of holding it's own and even going toe-to-toe with modern titles. It is the Jack of all trades, but a master of none. It is and forever will be one of my favorites.			"

												This game is amazing, that simply said. Yeah I understand, it's almost ten years old, but when did graphics ever matter? What it lacks in that department it makes up for in gameplay and sheer depth, and I don't know if you'll agree with me on this one, but is it just me that's thinking the Total War games are losing their charm with every new realese? I mean, you saw Empire, and sure, CA had the excuse of a new engine, but then they realesed that absolute mess that was Rome II (and I always thought the sequels were supposed to be better) I was appalled at what I was seeing, and henceforth opted never to purchase it.Rome I is (in my opinion)  the  greatest Total War game made, and one of the best strategy games I've ever played. The amount of detail that CA put into the game is incredible, and better still, installing DarthMod to your game ever more makes the playing experience one to remember. Sure, the A.I is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible, but that never bothered me (just made Rome easier to capture). I can remember once, I had a small force of perhaps five-hundred professional, highly trained and disciplined Legionaries with me, to defend against an army of over three-thousand mindless barbarians. It was these battles that made the game so enjoyable, the sheer tension in the middle of a pitched battle, when neither side show signs of winning, is it going to be yours? Or the enemy's? And aside from the few small skirmishes between armies, when you give your opponent time to assemble a massive force, and you ride out to meet that force with your own, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing bloodbath (serious, the amount of corpses left on the sand was immense). As I've mentioned before, the battles are intense, oh, and, did I mention that the battles were intense?With the expansions being ""Alexander"" and ""Barbarian Invasion"", these further build upon the gameplay. Offering you to play as the young Greek King as he forges his mighty path of blood and conquest against the Persians for control. Or giving you the chance to save the crumbling Roman Empire in a last attempt to drive out the hordes of invading Huns and Goths, and several other European barbarian tribes. I myself, never played much of the Alexander expansion, I've only sunk as little as a few hours into it. As for Barbarian Invasion however, that, that is a completely different story. I thoroughly enjoyed this expansion to the already great game. That said. Rome I is a great game, one I have played for hours on end, and was never bored with it.I give this game a 9.5/10			"

												Don't let my game time put you off, I assure you I have owned the disk version from very early on. I only bought the steam version to play online as I couldn't do it otherwise.This Game. By far, in my opinion, the best strategy game out there. TODAY. The economic system in campaign is simple enough so you can stay on top of it all but complicated enough so you face challenges to keep your armed forces financially. After play ROME 2 recently I have to say that I believe the economic system in this is better. Actually, this game does stand up to its successor (ROME 2). The AI for one don't spam one unit constantly, they provide challenges to you as well as actually being fun to play against. The battles are great and a regular computer will be able to handle it with ease. Each faction has a wide and fairly balanced selection of Units.This game is simply a masterclass. Way before its time, (if you excuse the graphics at times, althought they are not wholly poor). If you do not own this game, you are a fool. It is a must for all strategy game players.			"

												One of, if not the best strategy game ever created. Certainly the best in the total war series in my books.Rome excels with top notch gameplay and a smooth clear crisp battle engine. Certainly Rome Total War came out in 2005 so graphically comparing to modern titles it is inferior, however it runs and plays so much better as a game vs other total war games. Rome is like a no frills strategy game, no crap, no bulsht, an amazing game which loads of replay value- as it should be!I have probably spent more time playing Rome Total War than any other game. At it's current steam price around £1.60 it is a steal. Buy it, there are still plenty of folks online.			"

												Probably the best entry in the Total War series, Rome is where for many it all began. It would be difficult to overstate the hours of time that this game will eat up, as you conquer Europe as one of the three Roman factions or rewrite history by creating a sprawling and prosperous barbarian state from the Balkans to the Iberian peninsula. It's still a remarkably pretty game, and although the unit geometry is a bit angular when zoomed in it holds its own in creating an attractive world, with none of the over-sharpness that is plaguing the later games in the Total War series. There are frustrations though, especially with large unit sizes causing major pathfinding errors in siege battles.If you somehow haven't played it yet then it's a must-buy. Cross that Rubicon and you won't regret it.			"

												I personally think that Rome I is better than the Rome II. Why? Despite the graphic, systems and other aspects in Rome II seems superior to Rome I, the general feeling ---glory of Roman Empire--- cannot be felt in Rome II. In Rome I, I enjoy the process of building a mighty empire from a small piece of land. And the game looks much easier to control, unlike Rome II. The music surely plays a huge part in this game that it creates sort of historical mightiness. SO that's the reason I prefer Rome I after dozens of hour experiencing.			"

												I must begin by stating that Rome: Total War was the first and so far the only Total War game I have played.Total War is an exciting and very cerebral strategy game, that tasks you with not only rallying your troops and commanding them in battle but also governing your multiple cities along with it's inhabitants and the political relationships with other factions.The main campaign plays like a turn-based board game, where each player makes their choices and then skips, allowing others to make their moves. The objective is to take over the world.Managing your settlements is the slow paced portion of the game but still varied, as you need to satisfy your people while also recruting and positioning your military in order to accomplish your goals. You also need to be wary of what other factions feel towards you and your movements, as having allies might make a critical difference.When your troops meet other troops in the battlefield, whether it was you who attacked or your opponent is when there is the option to combat them manually. You take control of large armies, going up to to the hundreds or thousands depending or your settings. Controlling this massive number of soldiers is easy and intuitive and the variety of available units allow the combat system to provide you with multiple options. Each unit has its strenghs and purposes and the overall combination of troops you decide to take to battle make all the difference in the world.I can't recommend this game enough to any player who enjoys strategy or military games.

												Only recently bought it on steam, but i have had it since 2005, probably logging over 2000 hours.  It is, by far, the best game in the series (CA tires to do too much in the new games),  and quite possibly the best RTS ever made.  You will get lost into this game, and come out 100 hours deep without even feeling like you've scratched the surface.  I would pay 50 bucks to get this game rather than 40 for Rome 2.  You have just stumbled across the game you'll play for years to come.			"

												missing the good old days when customer staisfaction mattered not the dirty business practice of dlc, when moders had the opportunity to totally overhaull the map creating great mods like europa babrbaroum. Rome total war 2 would have been a way better game if it was based on this game with a slight improvment on the graphics. So sad Rome total war 2 could have been a the best game in history of pc games.			"

												This game hits right on the target for RTS games. It has a turn based campaign in which you create massive armies and manage settlements. Then when two armies collide (whether that be an seige or field battle) the real fun begins you can play battles with thousands of soldiers slugging it out. The different factions have huge differences in which you have to play. Romans have superb heavy infantry which can tackle most other infantry but lack cavalry. The Greeks have phalanx that buckle down enemy infantry so your cavalry can finish the job. And the barbarian have cool unique units like the druids and fanatics. This game is very polished and is better than all the other games in the series and i have played all but the first two (rome 2 is on my other account). Me and my friend love playing battles (even though he spams phants and  sacred band). I would recommend this game to anyone who plays RTS!			"

From the rolling hills of modern-day Germany, to the scortched deserts of North Africa and the Russian taudras, claim your dominance across vast landscapes against numerous enemies, with differant outcomes eachtime you play.

												One of, if not the best strategy game ever created. Certainly the best in the total war series in my books.Rome excels with top notch gameplay and a smooth clear crisp battle engine. Certainly Rome Total War came out in 2005 so graphically comparing to modern titles it is inferior, however it runs and plays so much better as a game vs other total war games. Rome is like a no frills strategy game, no crap, no bulsht, an amazing game which loads of replay value- as it should be!I have probably spent more time playing Rome Total War than any other game. At it's current steam price around £1.60 it is a steal. Buy it, there are still plenty of folks online.			"

												Rome has still its own personality among Total War series: its still nice to play it after the next ones of the series. Its main problem in my opinion is these powerful units with more than one ""life point"" like general units for example that make it unrealistic for this part and tough to counter. Another problem is the use of gamespy for multi battles, that sometimes show an error when you try to join a hosted game. Else the game in multi give to host more settings to manage than in next games since Empire, giving more the ability to have the battle the host wish without using rules among players, even if these rules are still used in some case, like clan war belt (cwb) rules.

												I personally think that Rome I is better than the Rome II. Why? Despite the graphic, systems and other aspects in Rome II seems superior to Rome I, the general feeling ---glory of Roman Empire--- cannot be felt in Rome II. In Rome I, I enjoy the process of building a mighty empire from a small piece of land. And the game looks much easier to control, unlike Rome II. The music surely plays a huge part in this game that it creates sort of historical mightiness. SO that's the reason I prefer Rome I after dozens of hour experiencing.			"

												Possibly my favourite game. I played the White Label version to death a few years ago. I was quite happy to see that they added Barbarian Invasion to this as well. Rome Total War combines a turn-based strategy world map with real time battle screen. The battles are the best part of the game so if you're more inclined to staring at maps and managing economics  I recommend looking at the Paradox games like Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron.This game is considered one of the better in the series and the graphics aren't too bad for an eleven year old game. My favourite part of this game is the custom battles. A phalanx of Spartans vs 1000 Roman peasants, who wins?If you're not sold on the dated graphics you can always download a mod or go for one of the newer games. However Creative Assembly managed to make every entry after Medieval 2 with a new engine. Since then the releases have been a bit hit or miss. Rome 2 had an incredibly poor launch thanks to a variety of bugs and removed features.So if you want a fun strategy game I wholeheartedly recommend this game.			"

												This was the first total war I played and I have played all of the total war games since then. I've played every total war game atleast 100+ hours on/off steam and Rome I have played almost a 800 hours or so. Nonetheless I can still enjoy playing it. It's almost 10 years old and I still think it is their best game. It is balanced and challenging and nothing compared to strategy games brougt out today.  The best thing about this game is it's strategy on both real time and turn based gameplay. This makes the game much more playable than real-time or turn-based only. It's focused around 300 BC. Around that time the romans were just about to enlarge their empire into the great roman empire which makes it fun to discover all the lost nations that they conquered. It's geography is the entire mediterian and all of germany, france, spain and the southern half of great britain.  I would definetly recommend this game if you're a fan of strategy games. It is old so don't expect much features or awesome graphics.			"

												Don't let my game time put you off, I assure you I have owned the disk version from very early on. I only bought the steam version to play online as I couldn't do it otherwise.This Game. By far, in my opinion, the best strategy game out there. TODAY. The economic system in campaign is simple enough so you can stay on top of it all but complicated enough so you face challenges to keep your armed forces financially. After play ROME 2 recently I have to say that I believe the economic system in this is better. Actually, this game does stand up to its successor (ROME 2). The AI for one don't spam one unit constantly, they provide challenges to you as well as actually being fun to play against. The battles are great and a regular computer will be able to handle it with ease. Each faction has a wide and fairly balanced selection of Units.This game is simply a masterclass. Way before its time, (if you excuse the graphics at times, althought they are not wholly poor). If you do not own this game, you are a fool. It is a must for all strategy game players.			"

												Rome's Legacy wasn’t built in a day, and the game that bears its namesake was not free from this either. Unlike the empire, however, Rome the game's glory was ripped from it in a single moment---Rome 2's release. For nearly a decade, we the true lovers of Rome awaited its fable return, and begged the gods of the Creative assembly to return to us our legions! After the wonderful gift of Shogun 2 we thought certainly that this would be given to us, and that it would be glorious. Now that all the other classics had been given sequels the greatest of them all certainly was overdue for a revisit. Rome 2 was not a Total War, but a Total Joke... Unless you count the design choices conflicting with your desire to enjoy pillaging all of Antiquity-- But that was about as much a war as the British fighting the Zulu; the Zulu being your enjoyment.This prompted me to return to the original. Was it hard to put aside my Nostalgia to write this review? I would have to say nostalgia had no place in my experience with this game. For as many hours as I put in it all those years ago I can't say I had a plethora of memories to go on. Once I conquered Europe as the Saxons, and once I pitted Carthage against Egypt and both full stack armies were obliterated in an epic stalemate. These were my two favorite memories going into the game.I started up Rome and went for the Expansion ""Barbarian Invasion"" first. I picked the faction I always played as back in the day and took on the Vandal horde. We marched south into the Baltics and settled in present day Croatia area. Eventually the ERE decided I wasn't fit to exist and attempted a Reconquista. A fifty-year war ensued where we engaged the enemy professional armies with our militia. Suffering through the great losses of our people we pushed south taking Thessalonica and Achaea. The war finally came to a close after the third Siege of Constantinople took the city, and destroyed the ERE's last European Legion, and subjugated the most powerful city in the world during this point in history.The fledgling Vandal Kingdom of the Baltics established and independence now secure I reset the clock (And the game) to play the Vanilla. I decided to go a different route than I did when I was younger. Instead of picking Carthagians, or Scipii; I picked the Brutii. It took me a total of 6 minutes to realize what I just did. I was playing the Roman faction that was tasked to take the same exact lands as my Vandal kingdom had taken in the Expansion. I was essentially building the same ERE I would invade centuries later as the Vandals.  As I am still in the middle of my conquest of the Greek-Macedonian Alliance, I can’t really say that I curb-stomped them... In fact Athens remains defiant and un-siegeable from a practical standpoint. While the Greek armies of Athens  send every one of my Legions home completely rekt, the Macedonians force our defending armies to either remain garrisoned, or all-together abandon settlements to defend more critical points against the armies of the sons of Alexander at our gates.... Eh, at least the Senate likes me.So obviously I enjoy the game. I knew that before I even re-bought it on steam the other day. Despite being a decade old the game gets a ten for just the enjoyment. But I'm so confident in this game I am going to take it the extra mile and rate it like it was released a month ago, and compare it directly to Rome 2.Pros--Competent AISo the AI will not be winning any genius competitions, but put Rome’s AI up against Rome 2's AI and it will mop the floor with Rome II's pretty-boy face. Not only does this apply to the battles but the Campaign AI will actually give the player legitimate trouble.-SoundtrackGood, solid, mood setting music that changes based on the situation.  This music will get you PUMPED, and you'll remember these tracks for a lifetime. The track number is a little lacking in quantity, but quality is perfect. Medieval 2 might be the only one that can beat it.Units-The Roman factions all have the same units just painted different colors, but the Foreign factions are all unique to some extent. And don't think any faction is left out. Each one has their own death machines. Carthage has elephants, Egypt and Britain have Chariots, Greeks and Macedonians have Hoplites-- All of which will thoroughly ruin your day with brutal efficiency. The Barbarian Expansion scores a little lower on this to me, But the expansion still gets clearance on this issueReligion-(Barbarian Invasion only)This is a very simple religion system where the player can convert to a new religion at any point. Ironically the people will convert much, much faster than the player's own royal family. In short it's simple, but works.Engine- This Engine was designed for this type of game; Rome II's was designed for EMPIRE's Ranged based combat. Though the clashes can be anti-climactic at times; you'll never get the ridiculous mosh pit of Shogun 2 and Rome 2. Animations are also nothing to write home about, but they function, and don't jump around for kill animations.General Speeches-Yes. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GENERAL SPEECHES PEOPLE.Cons- Graphics- Graphics are dated, but it's a decade old; Since I said I was Rating this as if it was last month I can't not count this...... ummm.... come on that can't be it...Diplomacy- All total war games fail here, it functions but the AI can act a fool on a regular basis. the only TW game with decent diplomacy is probably Shogun 2.Seriously there’s not much to find wrong with this game. If you like Grand-Strategy and/or RTS this game is the one for you. Is it my favorite Total War game? Um, no I can't say it's my favorite, but it is the original champion. It didn't earn that honor form being a PoS. It was the first one I played back a decade ago, and it echoes a long forgotten day that CA had more pride, love, and passion for this title. Back then it was their baby, and it shows.for $9.99 Rome and the expansion is an investment any lover of strategy will not regret.If it was released last month:Modern Day Score- 7/10Overall and timeframes aside:Final Verdict- 8/10 When all is said and done Rome has aged moderatley well. While it does show it's age; the old man it more than capable of holding it's own and even going toe-to-toe with modern titles. It is the Jack of all trades, but a master of none. It is and forever will be one of my favorites.			"

												Still the same pros&cons as the rest of the Total War series : halway between strategy game and cinema, entertaining but inadapted to challenging objectives. Note that this game has lots of user mods, with a community which is still lively. Therefore this is an interesting alternative to Rome II or any more recent Total War title if your computer sucks, if you're poor, or if you just don't like their new engine (I don't). The price to pay in term of features and gameplay richness is minimal.			"

												Rome: Total War is an excellent game. It allows you to take control of one of the three houses of rome (And other civs as well later) and pits you against others, you have to get your leaders into senates, conduct trade deals and manage provinces. You also have to manage the affairs of your family, whether or not your daughter will marry so and so, and if one of them dies of old age. It's a horrible feeling, that, especially when it's your leader who dies, and you are left lost, trying to find a Heir for when it happens again, moving your main body of the army under someone elses control. The battles are realistic, your men sometimes disobeying you, and having emotions of their own. If you are losing, they may run away, elephants and wolves will also freak them out. Sometimes one or two men will even disobey one of your orders, getting themselves killed, every loss you take is something you actually feel, as you must keep your army maintained and happy, keep your cities from rioting. It is not, however, impossible to play. I am doing it an injustice with how hard I am making it sound, it is truly an amazing game, and earns a good 9/10.			"

												Only recently bought it on steam, but i have had it since 2005, probably logging over 2000 hours.  It is, by far, the best game in the series (CA tires to do too much in the new games),  and quite possibly the best RTS ever made.  You will get lost into this game, and come out 100 hours deep without even feeling like you've scratched the surface.  I would pay 50 bucks to get this game rather than 40 for Rome 2.  You have just stumbled across the game you'll play for years to come.			"

												ROMANES EUNT DOMUS?!Rome: Total War is what you play when you want to tell the Romans to go home, or vice versa.It's the third game in the Total War series, and the first to introduce the gameplay template it still uses today. Gone are the 2D battlefield models and Risk-style campaign map from the first two games, replaced with 3D models and a strategic map you can use to finely position units and armies. Gameplay revolves around managing your territory in a turn-based strategy mode and moving armies around the map to fight opposing armies and capture or defend settlements in a real time tactics mode.This particular entry is widely regarded as a classic, and with great value to boot. It can certainly suffice for people who can't afford or run the later games in the series. Unfortunately the game is optimized to run on only one CPU core, so newer computers might run into some trouble anyway. As this is still only the third game in the series, there are some things in later titles that are lacking in this one such as resolutions above 1600x1400. Something to keep in mind, at least.The Gold Edition comes with the Barbarian Invasion expansion that takes place during the fall of the Roman Empire, adding new factions and some new features such as hordes & religion; well worth playing after the base game. There's also a second expansion-slash-DLC available separately that lets you play as Alexander the Great, and it's required for some of the more popular mods to run.The vanilla game is a good way to get the hang of things, but from the disorganized battle lines to the historical inaccuracy I wouldn't recommend playing for any extended period of time. To wit: the Greek city-states form one faction (just one) while Rome is divided into three gens that each get their own faction. Egypt, meanwhile, looks like it walked out of a timewarp from 1000 BC instead of the Ptolemaic empire it was at the time of Rome's ascent.There's a number of mods that overhaul the game to fix these issues and more, including (nominally) improved AI, which has always been a weakpoint of the TW series - with the exception of the first two games, which used Risk-style troop movement that's easier for AI to understand. Two of the most popular RTW mods include Rome Total Realism and Europa Barbarorum, the former being a general overhaul of the game and the latter being much more realism-focused to the point of near simulation.I'd recommend this as an entry point into Total War for people on a budget. It's probably better than Rome II at any rate; even with the many improvements that game's had since its disastrous launch it's still a game about ancient warfare that uses an engine Creative Assembly intended for Napoleonic warfare.

												Don't let my game time put you off, I assure you I have owned the disk version from very early on. I only bought the steam version to play online as I couldn't do it otherwise.This Game. By far, in my opinion, the best strategy game out there. TODAY. The economic system in campaign is simple enough so you can stay on top of it all but complicated enough so you face challenges to keep your armed forces financially. After play ROME 2 recently I have to say that I believe the economic system in this is better. Actually, this game does stand up to its successor (ROME 2). The AI for one don't spam one unit constantly, they provide challenges to you as well as actually being fun to play against. The battles are great and a regular computer will be able to handle it with ease. Each faction has a wide and fairly balanced selection of Units.This game is simply a masterclass. Way before its time, (if you excuse the graphics at times, althought they are not wholly poor). If you do not own this game, you are a fool. It is a must for all strategy game players.			"

												I personally think that Rome I is better than the Rome II. Why? Despite the graphic, systems and other aspects in Rome II seems superior to Rome I, the general feeling ---glory of Roman Empire--- cannot be felt in Rome II. In Rome I, I enjoy the process of building a mighty empire from a small piece of land. And the game looks much easier to control, unlike Rome II. The music surely plays a huge part in this game that it creates sort of historical mightiness. SO that's the reason I prefer Rome I after dozens of hour experiencing.			"

												Rome's Legacy wasn’t built in a day, and the game that bears its namesake was not free from this either. Unlike the empire, however, Rome the game's glory was ripped from it in a single moment---Rome 2's release. For nearly a decade, we the true lovers of Rome awaited its fable return, and begged the gods of the Creative assembly to return to us our legions! After the wonderful gift of Shogun 2 we thought certainly that this would be given to us, and that it would be glorious. Now that all the other classics had been given sequels the greatest of them all certainly was overdue for a revisit. Rome 2 was not a Total War, but a Total Joke... Unless you count the design choices conflicting with your desire to enjoy pillaging all of Antiquity-- But that was about as much a war as the British fighting the Zulu; the Zulu being your enjoyment.This prompted me to return to the original. Was it hard to put aside my Nostalgia to write this review? I would have to say nostalgia had no place in my experience with this game. For as many hours as I put in it all those years ago I can't say I had a plethora of memories to go on. Once I conquered Europe as the Saxons, and once I pitted Carthage against Egypt and both full stack armies were obliterated in an epic stalemate. These were my two favorite memories going into the game.I started up Rome and went for the Expansion ""Barbarian Invasion"" first. I picked the faction I always played as back in the day and took on the Vandal horde. We marched south into the Baltics and settled in present day Croatia area. Eventually the ERE decided I wasn't fit to exist and attempted a Reconquista. A fifty-year war ensued where we engaged the enemy professional armies with our militia. Suffering through the great losses of our people we pushed south taking Thessalonica and Achaea. The war finally came to a close after the third Siege of Constantinople took the city, and destroyed the ERE's last European Legion, and subjugated the most powerful city in the world during this point in history.The fledgling Vandal Kingdom of the Baltics established and independence now secure I reset the clock (And the game) to play the Vanilla. I decided to go a different route than I did when I was younger. Instead of picking Carthagians, or Scipii; I picked the Brutii. It took me a total of 6 minutes to realize what I just did. I was playing the Roman faction that was tasked to take the same exact lands as my Vandal kingdom had taken in the Expansion. I was essentially building the same ERE I would invade centuries later as the Vandals.  As I am still in the middle of my conquest of the Greek-Macedonian Alliance, I can’t really say that I curb-stomped them... In fact Athens remains defiant and un-siegeable from a practical standpoint. While the Greek armies of Athens  send every one of my Legions home completely rekt, the Macedonians force our defending armies to either remain garrisoned, or all-together abandon settlements to defend more critical points against the armies of the sons of Alexander at our gates.... Eh, at least the Senate likes me.So obviously I enjoy the game. I knew that before I even re-bought it on steam the other day. Despite being a decade old the game gets a ten for just the enjoyment. But I'm so confident in this game I am going to take it the extra mile and rate it like it was released a month ago, and compare it directly to Rome 2.Pros--Competent AISo the AI will not be winning any genius competitions, but put Rome’s AI up against Rome 2's AI and it will mop the floor with Rome II's pretty-boy face. Not only does this apply to the battles but the Campaign AI will actually give the player legitimate trouble.-SoundtrackGood, solid, mood setting music that changes based on the situation.  This music will get you PUMPED, and you'll remember these tracks for a lifetime. The track number is a little lacking in quantity, but quality is perfect. Medieval 2 might be the only one that can beat it.Units-The Roman factions all have the same units just painted different colors, but the Foreign factions are all unique to some extent. And don't think any faction is left out. Each one has their own death machines. Carthage has elephants, Egypt and Britain have Chariots, Greeks and Macedonians have Hoplites-- All of which will thoroughly ruin your day with brutal efficiency. The Barbarian Expansion scores a little lower on this to me, But the expansion still gets clearance on this issueReligion-(Barbarian Invasion only)This is a very simple religion system where the player can convert to a new religion at any point. Ironically the people will convert much, much faster than the player's own royal family. In short it's simple, but works.Engine- This Engine was designed for this type of game; Rome II's was designed for EMPIRE's Ranged based combat. Though the clashes can be anti-climactic at times; you'll never get the ridiculous mosh pit of Shogun 2 and Rome 2. Animations are also nothing to write home about, but they function, and don't jump around for kill animations.General Speeches-Yes. THIS IS HOW YOU DO GENERAL SPEECHES PEOPLE.Cons- Graphics- Graphics are dated, but it's a decade old; Since I said I was Rating this as if it was last month I can't not count this...... ummm.... come on that can't be it...Diplomacy- All total war games fail here, it functions but the AI can act a fool on a regular basis. the only TW game with decent diplomacy is probably Shogun 2.Seriously there’s not much to find wrong with this game. If you like Grand-Strategy and/or RTS this game is the one for you. Is it my favorite Total War game? Um, no I can't say it's my favorite, but it is the original champion. It didn't earn that honor form being a PoS. It was the first one I played back a decade ago, and it echoes a long forgotten day that CA had more pride, love, and passion for this title. Back then it was their baby, and it shows.for $9.99 Rome and the expansion is an investment any lover of strategy will not regret.If it was released last month:Modern Day Score- 7/10Overall and timeframes aside:Final Verdict- 8/10 When all is said and done Rome has aged moderatley well. While it does show it's age; the old man it more than capable of holding it's own and even going toe-to-toe with modern titles. It is the Jack of all trades, but a master of none. It is and forever will be one of my favorites.			"

												I spend a majority of my strategy gaming with two games: Rome: Total War and Civilization V (I have maybe 250+ hours offline in RTW). Why do I mention this? Because I have to say that while Civ V is a better game (though not by much), I have never found a game more masterfully put together than Rome: Total War. You might be the nicest person ever, but by the end of a campaign you might as well be ranked as the world's #1 sociopath, for you will be driven to crush every rebellion and consolidate the world under the mighty grip of your imperium. The aesthetic, feel, music, all for the glory of arguably the greatest empire ever created is emulated to absolute perfection.And that's 10 YEARS after the game has been released. The most epic, enthralling, massive strategy game you'll ever get your hands on.Only issues involve possible compatibility problems. Other than that, you're paying $10 for hundreds of hours of triumphant conquest. An absolute must buy.			"

												This game is on my Top 5 Games of All Time List.Let's start with the presentation. This Games graphics are out dated, but the attention to detail and polish are abundant. Nothing was more satisfying then watching my cavalry charge send individual men flying. The world map is kind of bland, but you have a pretty good idea of what the terrain is. All of the cities are (or were) real cities, and many you may already know of. This game is a very well researched game. There are many historical troop types and landmarks. I can't even imagine how much time was put in to making this game as historically accurate as possible.Overall, this is a well-presented game.Now let's look at gameplay. This games battle system is hands down the best I have seen in any RTS ever. The attention to detail is astounding. Certain troops counter others, this is in other games. However, different formations and tactics can turn the tables on your so-called counters. You can be a regular Cesar if you play your cards right. The AI is not the sharpest tool in the shed, especially when it comes to troop movement. I have missed a table-turning oppurtunity in many a battle due to a units slow response or incorrect followthrough of an order. It could be said that this makes the game more realistic, but that doesn't make it any less frustrating. The game can be played in single or multiplayer player mode. Single player has three functions: Campaign, Custom battles, and Historical battles. The Campaign can be played as one of the three Roman factions at first and later other factions. Not every faction can be played as-at least not in th vanilla-which is a shame as many unique factions were left out. The campaign takes place over a world map as you and the other factions take turns building and managing an empire. The campaign is extremely immersive. Players personalities are reflected in how they play the game. I can be impatient, but I also am a procrastinator. As a result, I would impatiently blitz one enemy, then stand around repelling the attacks of another. The goals of the game are dependent on what type of campaign tou chose. A short one has small goals while a long one has large. Overall the campaign is the best part of the game. The custom battle option is fun for experimenting with new tactics or just goofing around. It is not something you will spend a ton of time on though. The Historical battles are just that, battles from history. They put you in the shoes of real ancient commanders in battles that actually took place. They're fun, but not very replayable. The multiplayer is the second best function of the game. It allows you to play online in battles with other players. The type of battles vary, from sieges to free-for-alls. There are even some historical battles exclusive to multiplayer. Overall, the multiplayer is great for when you want a change of pace.Over all, this game has a good presentation, pays attention to detail, and is highly immersive, the best ten bucks you'll ever spend. 9.5/10 "
