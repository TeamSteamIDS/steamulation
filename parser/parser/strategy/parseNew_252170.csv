												First of all, I like Anomaly Series I have played and completed the 1st and 2nd series for the PC.But for this I rather not recommend it. This is for the mobile devices not for the PC.I think this should have been just stick in the mobile device platform, no need for 11 bit studios to bring this to PC.There are many elements have been removed in this version.ex: The cutscene, some voice, Cpt. Evans as player, no keyboard shortcut, etc.The sound & image quality have been downgrade.tl;dr this is the simplified version of the PC version.Go get the PC version guys.But if you purchase Anomaly Über Bundle(http://store.steampowered.com/sub/46740/), just count this as a bonus game.

												Firstly, I would like to mention that I personally enjoy the Anomaly Series and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games. With that said, the original intention of creating Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign is to be played on mobile devices, rather than on a PC. As this is a game meant for mobile devices, it is pretty much the same as the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth, just that you would realise that there are no keyboard shortcuts, making it unfriendly for PC gaming. For PC gaming, my recommendation would be to get Anomaly: Warzone Earth, instead of Anomaly: Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign as I find the PC version more enjoyable and with keyboard shortcuts, making the overall gameplay more convenient rather than having to use the mouse all the time.

												Initially designed for only mobiles, the game has now been customized and released on PC. If you have already played the PC version of this game, you may wonder what the developers wanted to achieve by doing so, since the game adds nothing new to the original concept or storyline. This game differs from its PC kin in that, owing to a mobile keypad's limited control abilities,  there is no commander to guide its cavalry. Consequently, the way the Hacker and the Energizer work is also slightly different. Unless you want to be able to tell everyone that you've played this game and know what it's like, don't spend your money on this. Buy the PC version instead. It's much more interesting and offers longer gameplay.			"

As part of the ""Anomaly"" game series, this plays as ""more of the same"", which can be a good thing if you really like the Anomaly series.This doesn't continue the Anomaly ""story"".  It's more of a re-hash of the same story, abbreviated, for those who haven't seen the story before (in the full ""Anomaly Warzone Earth"").  Which is understandable as the ""...Mobile Campaign"" was likely introducing the story to the mobile market.  However, perhaps being a mobile-targeted app, the campaign is short.  I was able to complete the entire 12 mission campaign in approx 2.5hrs, not defeating every turret on every map, but nearly so.Anyway, I got used to the massive sized-for-smartphone buttons (having also played ""Anomaly: Korea"" which is also a smartphone-targeted game) so that part of the controls weren't too annoying for me.  Quality-wise, to me, this game seemed a little better than Korea.  In fact, this was almost as good as the full ""Anomaly: Warzone Earth"" game.On the plus side, I liked not having the separate commander run around and get lost in all the action on the screen.In the end, the Mobile Campaign is worth a play if you really like the Anomaly game series.  7 out of 10.

												I had my dose of fun with original Anomaly Warzone Earth game. Idea of reverse Tower Defense game is great. So, how is Mobile Campaign? It feels so good, like normal game. Really. Think of it as of DLC, or maybe extra chapter, for base game. Sure, maybe it's more easy than original, it have those annoying TAP this, TAP that, things but that's all. If you enjoyed first Anomaly game then you should play Mobile Campaign. And if you never heard or played any Anomaly games, then start from beggining. This one, in my opinion, is something for fans only.			"

Anomaly Warzone Earth - Mobile Campaign Estimated gameplay hours: 2-4-9After playing and completing Anomaly 2 I found no reason to play this game from the begining, only for achievements & cards.Ended up rage quitting at mission 5 & uninstalled the game.This game has also 3 'Squad Assault' modes that I haven't tried but overall you do have some game time to spend.But what can I say, feel free to skip this game and move straight to Anomaly 2 (the enhanced version of this game)Overall Score: 3/10* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale.****** Recommended On Full Price.

												Anomaly Mobile Campaign is, as the name suggests, an additional campaign for Anomaly Warzone Earth, primarily designed for mobile devices, and later ported to PC.Gameplay is the same tower offence style where you buy tanks, APCs etc and select the route they will use to travel around the map while destroying or avoiding the alien towers. The biggest difference is you don't have the commander unit running around, but you can still deploy powers like repair and air strike by just clicking where you want to use them.The campaign is quite short at 2.5 hours, there is an extra wave based mode but except for the lack of commander, its identical to the same mode in the original game. I didn't encounter any bugs, but there's a lack of keyboard short cuts compared to the original, clearly influenced by the mobile control scheme.Overall its worth playing if a) you enjoyed the original game and b) you pick it up on sale - I recently bought it for 90% off which seems like a fair price.

												It's anomaly warzone earth without the human to control, and with 15 missions and a bonus playing scenario that are all fairly easy to beat in any difficulty.   If you haven't played any Anomaly game, then this one might be a good first start with.  Just remember, the original has a human on the ground that you control and is the one that lays out the powerups for the units.  All in all, this was fun.			"
