												The game indeed looks nice. But once the first impression fades away, you realize that it plays worse than Battle Isle 1 or Battalion: Nemesis or even Advanced Strategic Command (these games are either significantly less expensive or even free), The biggest downside of this game for me is that the UI is sluggish and not as assistive as it could be. As you play the game, you realize that it takes quite long, because you wait for something all the time (UI to respond, animation to finish, CPU to make a move). Note that I have a 2.9GHz Haswell i5, so the sluggishness is not about weak HW.The story is not great, in-game popup story dialogs are not something you look forward to.The AI is OK, sometimes stupid, ignoring you while you move around and take an advantageous position, but you are going to be grateful for that.I don't recommend buying the game for more than $10 unless there is a significant patch fixing the issues above. The authors had such great examples to learn from, but they probably didn't play the game much. Otherwise they would have concentrated more on gameplay than on visuals.Patch 1.1 update:The developers have addressed some of the most painful issues, and the gameplay experience has improved considerably, but there is still room for improvements. What now stands out is the passivity of the AI The enemy has much more units at its disposal, but they basically just react to you when you start your offensive. Very sad when you compare it to Battle Isle 1.The game is IMO worth $15 after the patch and the Battle Isle series is well recommended prior to Battle worlds: Kronos			"

												I backed this game when showed up on Kickstarter so I very much knew what I was going to get along the way reading the updates and discussions going on during development. It tries to be in a way a throwback to the Battle Isle series and such games like that, on that level it feels some what similar but for me does not quite hit the sweet spot that those titles hit from an enjoyment factor. The game itself I found to be at times hard but only if held off using the reinforcement system but other than a few missions where I feel they might have pushed the difficulty up a bit too high...the rest I considered to be about right for me. Gameplay mechanics they tried to add a few twists to the format that Battle Isle series used and while pulled it off just about I never felt it blew my mind or felt that was much better than the simpler older systems used in the past. Maybe that's more to do with my age than the mechanics themselves though...hard to tell from my own perspective since I am biased. The story is predictable and generic but it's adequate though like with most strategy games the gameplay is the major factor in deciding to purchase these type of games rather than the storyline, the cinematic sequences felt low quality but I kind of expected that given how much funding the game got so I can't hold it against them too much. It does it's job and I have seen far worse animation quality in other more popular games. I did not like having to log in to their servers all the time though, the autosave is not great but since you can save anytime you want manually it does not detract from the quality of the game too much. Music I felt was nice enough overall or more specifically some tracks were very nice while the rest was okay. The game feels about the right length from a story perspective given you play first one faction then the other follows right after but it could of been longer, the padding of 'cinematics' shown as segments within the campaign were it felt to me a way to disguise how few missions in the campaign there was but if they had hidden the segments (all of them from view) then I would not have noticed if I am honest. It was their visability that made it blatent to me. That has a slight negative effect much like knowing there is only x amount of chapters in a book prior to starting reading page 1 or knowing that your reaching the end of the game which I feel detracts from the experience. Not many people want to know the day the world will end for example, yet games that list every mission or sequence of the game in the campaign menu feels like someone waving a 'the end is nigh' banner in your face all the time.If I was to rate the overall experience however, despite it's flaws...it was a positive experience and worth backing on Kickstarter or buying on Steam if I had not backed. But like all games it does have flaws. I would consider this an okay turn based strategy game that tried to recapture the older turn based titles some of us TBS fans loved back in the day but while enjoyable it does fall short on reaching those lofty heights set before it. If I was going to buy a game like this I would still pick Battle Isle Shadow of the Empire over this game and maybe couple others but if like turn based strategy games and was a fan of the Battle Isle series then you will probably enjoy this game. It may not be my favorite game in this style of turn based games but it is worthy of picking up if like that sort of game.			"

 Summary   +Turn Based Strategy, Advance Wars style +Long campaign (I haven't finished it yet) +Skirmish mode (custom maps)  +Varied units with slick designs  [1] [wiki.battle-worlds.com] +Tactical and challenging   git gud   +Map editor  [2] [wiki.battle-worlds.com] +DRM free (look into the game folder) +Available for Linux (though not the Map Editor)  -Difficult for newbies to the genre -Multiplayer can be bothersome due to low playerbase[3] -Lack of variety of factions [4]  Conclusion  This kriegsspiel is an overlooked gem when it comes to tactical TBS games (as opposed to the more strategic 4x genre) that will offer you long hours of entertainment and challenge. Don't let the skill gap intimidate you. Every movement counts, but mistakes aren't fatal and learning the ropes is part of the fun. [1] The Battle Worlds: Kronos wiki [wiki.battle-worlds.com][2] Map editor can be found here [wiki.battle-worlds.com][3]You can't choose the tempo of the battle; the next move from your opponent might come in 10 mins or tomorrow (hotseat mode). Which is a feature, actually, but cuts both ways. Fortunately you can have up to three matches going on at the same time, in case some of your opponent goes afk for hours. This can lead to the opposite situation: having to fight several battles on the same day. [4]Coming from Advance Wars, this isn't really an issue for me, but it's worth mentioning. The two factions are the Invaders and the Residents. The Invaders have three subfactions, each one with a special unit.			"

												A turn based strategy game focusing  on combat rather base building or politics, in this game you will be constantly outnumbered, outgunned, and out of resourses.You'll have to use range differences between different units and units that counter different armour to full effect to win.The game has a heavy focus on keeping your troops alive, and going up against the enemy head on will usually end poorly for you. Units gain veterancy which can be spent on new abilities, or to heal the unit for a good amount, and as you can only level up each unit twice you have to decide which is more useful in the long run.All resourses in game are area specific, so you'll need to transport ammo to artillery, fuel to airports, mines to the front lines and supplies to unit production buildings and repair units meaning that you need to keep supply lines open and hold on to buildings that produce these resourses (as they are quite rare).With a nice long campaign, and a good difficulty level this is a true ""just one more turn"" game for those who enjoy turn based strategy in a semi-futuristic setting.

												It is very difficult, perhaps to the point of being unfair in some missions.This is exactly the way it should be, Battle Worlds delivers exactly what I wanted out of a Battle Isle inspired game. For the new lower price with the extra content? It is a great buy.Just be aware that there is a steep learning curve with this game. And when I say steep, I mean you will fail the first mission over and over until you ""get it"".A few tips:* save often* You can call for reinforcements, once every 10 turns. Use this until you get the hang of the game.* Capturing buildings will often get you new units. You are probably doing better than you think.* Move your units first, then attack. You get a bonus for having multiple attackers ""flanking"" an enemy.* In the first mission, move North as quick as you can, taking the left path and ignore the South East base. Once you take the North East base, the rest of the mission is easy.Good luck!			"

												Well worth the effort to learn a very challenging game. From the reviews it seems many people are put off by the difficulty level. It is difficult, but if you stick with it you will learn strategies that will let you win, even without reinforcements. I'm not that great at games like this but I""ve managed to win the first eight scenarios without ever using reinforcements.However, I do make liberal use of frequent game saving. Every turn or two I save the game and if things don't work out I'll try a different strategy. On a couple of scenarios I've had to go back 20+ turns to make another attempt. All the more rewarding when I figure out what to do.			"

												Great remake of Battle Isle.Computer is not so difficult to beat once you master the tactics of using given equipment efficiently to the point you can win without any loses. I am just on mission 4 and game is designed so far that the computer is not on an offensive - I am. I will see if this the case through the whole game but I doubt it. Still it feels epic long term entertainment to me.Grpahics is just right. Very detailed units and really nice map which you can zoom in and out.Sound - is there. Not annoying. Big plus.What it lacks is rally points so you can give the units to go on their own in certain direction. Perhaps developers could fulfill the need for this feature?I wish these people foocused on making remake of History Line 1914-1918. I miss the news taken from newspapers scrolling on the screen which was giving the sense of actually fighting these battles. Nevermind.This game is worth the bucks and as a remake is certainly not dissapointing.			"

												If you want to enjoy this game, prepare yourself for long winded tactical combat. Also, prepare yourself for restarting campaign missions quite often. Due to the turn based nature of the game you can easily lose all your troops before you even know what to do or where to go in a mission. That is annoying, I have to say. Other than that, it's a neat game though.			"

												This game might be for you but it certainly wasn't for me. The game is very challenging, and while this isn't a bad thing, it makes it feel as if there aren't any options. I am a huge fan of turn based strategy games. My favorite is XCOM ('94) which is definitely a very difficult game. It can be cruel but it's never boring. Battle World feels like there's only one solution to each problem and if you don't know the right strategy then you're going to lose. It doesn't give you a lot of options. You have very basic units, a basic leveling system and a map. There isn't much you can do to modify your army or change the way of the game. It's more like a puzzle game with the UI of battle isle. I strongly suggest playing through th demo before buying this game. I didn't have the chance as it was a gift. Also, if you're looking to play online it is a ghost town. Even though ASYNC play is incorporated it's still difficult to get a game going. I have been in several open games and haven't had much luck getting them filled.Play the demo before you buy this and make sure you're ready to play it alone.			"

												Played already about 14 Hours of it on the DRM-free version of the developer until i got a steam key.Its a very complex turn-based strategy game with great mission design. Playing the campagne will take a good amount of time. But its not an easy game and has no option for changing the difficulty, but you can make it easier by dropping a few additional troops every ten rounds. Eventhough the game is not 100%ly polished in terms of comfort, the core gameplay mechanics are brilliant. Also the multiplayer - that was buggy after release but works good these days - is extremly fun and it will hopefully create a long lasting multiplayer community with intense battles.			"

												This game is very challenging, and very rewarding. It's the Dark Souls of Turn-Based Strategy, and even when you have a grasp of all the mechanics it doesn't make the game much easier. There's no difficulty levels either, so if you were planning on scooting through the game on easy mode that won't be possible.Patience and persistence are key here. I failed the first mission like seven times before I beat it. That can be disheartening. I had to walk away from the keyboard a couple times and let my levels of frustration lower. What kept me from rage quitting was that I could see exactly how I died in each try. Each failure, gives me data I can use to win, bringing me closer to victory the next time. That's a good choice on the part of the developer.There's a few campaigns and some scenario missions along with hotseat and online multiplayer. There's also a built in scenario maker and the community has built dozens of maps, maybe even hundreds. The quality of those maps obviously varies, but there are bound to be a few gems in there somewhere.I'd recommend this game for people who like a challenge. Make sure you read all of the tooltips. This is one of those rare games where they can give you lifesaving information.			"

												Uninspired turn based grind. This game has almost nothing new to offer the genre and I quickly became bored by scenario 6.

												Even though I rarely finish turn-based strategy games because they're so time-consuming (and often insanely difficult) in late missions, I kinda enjoy them and played a few like Battle Isle series, History Line, Nectaris, ... New games in this genre are rare, so I gave Battle Worlds: Kronos a shot. Here's what I think of it:Singleplayer-------------Don't get fooled by the fact that the campaign only has 13 missions because they're quite long - I took me approximately 40 hours to get through them. That's not even counting the additional official and non-official singleplayer maps. I'd say there's enough value for your money. The first 3 missions aren't that interesting but then they start adding some new twists. In mission 6 for example you only get a few snipers and have to avoid open battles until you ""liberated"" enough units from depots. There's more than one right way to achieve your goals - In mission 7 I blew my way through a heavily defended base to capture a truck (the target) only to realize that the sea in the middle of the map froze after a few turns, opening up a shortcut... which was then used by the enemy to launch a massive attack while the bulk of my forces were tied up somewhere else.In another mission you have to sit back and try capturing units from two factions fighting each other until you're strong enough to destroy them both.  Sounds difficult? Well, situations like that can get tricky but it's not as hard as the game itself claims to be. I'm not really an expert in this genre but had no problems to get all bonus objectives/achievements on the first try with far less turns than the game expects you to. As long as you don't blindly charge into the usually superior enemy forces, you're fine. Mechanics-----------Unfortunately, there's relatively little unit variety - Pretty much standard with few surprises. I like that units gain ranks and with them bonuses or new abilities though. A veteran Bandit (light artillery) for example, can get surface-air missiles. I was complaining that there aren't many tactical options like bonuses for encircling enemy units - turns out there are, it's just not explained very well. I was already in mission 10 when I paid attention to the loading screen which tells you about this. I suppose the manual does so too but who's looking at that, right? :D Well, since I didn't need such tactics, it kinda shows that the game isn't that difficult.Aircraft need to refuel back at a base after a few turns (which is good), but due to their small fuel tanks I find them to be rather useless. You rarely see them in the campaign anyway (2-3 missions), the main focus is on ground combat.A.I.----Bad. Doesn't seem to understand the rules which becomes obvious when it doesn't utilize units captured from depots. Never seen it using its factories either. It prefers to cheat - reinforcements just appear out of nowhere. Doesn't seem to know the words ""tactical retreat"" and, even worse, is very prone to ""idiot-bait"" - sacrifice a low value unit and the AI will happily swarm it, getting in range of your clearly visible artillery or giving you time to get into a better position.Graphics---------Imho not really important in this genre, but I certainly won't complain that BW:K looks quite nice. No need for me to explain - since it's turn-based, there's not much difference between the screenshots and how it looks like ""in motion"" ;) What you don't see, is that the animations and effects of units firing and exploding are also not bad either. Everything just ""fits"" and resembles the look and feel of the old Battle Isle titles. Just don't look too closely at the animation quality and models during the cutscenes - they're quite bad.Music/Sound-------------I play turn-based stuff in windowed mode with sound/music off, so I don't care. Sound assets are ok though, so is the music. The latter gets repetitive quickly however.Multiplayer-----------Turn-based games take ages in multiplayer - I never played one. Checked the community though and it's pretty much non-existent. If you like playing online, it'll be hard to find a match.Verdict-------I'm really trying to like BW:K and I do have a decent amount of fun it, but with better AI, more interesting units it could've been so much more. As it is, it's not bad, not great (but could've been, which is kinda sad)			"

												I backed Battle Worlds: Kronos on Kickstarter, and in the end, I'm really glad I did! This was a fun turn-based wargaming experience, challenging in the best way. There are a lot of interlocking combat systems, each fairly simple on its own but adding up to create a wide array of things to think about as you try to manage your forces, and the AI plays fairly well - it's smart about using units and avoids being baited and kited, but it does often act fairly passive, which allows you time to get your limited forces into position and plan properly. The story is kind of campy, but in a perfectly sincere and enjoyable way, and it does its job at providing narrative context for the warfare that's going on.There are some issues with the UI and tutorials, and several systems are never very clear. I think the tutorial talks about a swarming bonus, where you deal more damage to units by having multiple of your own units next to them, but given how unit damage changes based on a units' health, this isn't very clear, and I never stopped to do studies of it. There are docks you can't dock with for unclear reasons, and the reinforcement option was never really pointed out (but as a result of not using it, I got lots more achievements). But beyond these communications issues, I don't really have anything to complain about.In terms of strategy games, I found Battle Worlds: Kronos to be exceptionally challenging, but not overwhelmingly so (caveat being that I'm pretty bad at games, generally). Every time I lost or had to restart, I felt like I was learning and improving my game, which is perhaps one of the most important things to have in difficult games. I definitely recommend giving it a shot!			"

												Battle Worlds: Kronos has been abandoned with no patching or updates done in nearly 2 years. There are outstanding issues left such as achievements not working and numerous clunky UI issues. Multi-player died a long time ago, all that is left are the single player campaigns. The first campaign has a decent storyline and I have to say units and tactical strategies diversity makes this title not an entirely brain dead experience. However, the game relies on cheating far too much. The game play quickly becomes a question of knowing where it cheats, how to position units to avoid it and just grind each mission.Overall, the game is just too crippled to be recommendable. Maybe with some last ditch effort it would be worth the asking price.			"

It would encourage more purchases, thus keeping the online community alive, as well as giving more people the opportunity to experience this type of turn based strategy.			"

												A punishingly brutal turn based game with a mundane story, a sluggish and unhelpful UI, a AI that alternates between absolutely useless, and mindreadingly overpowered. Missions turn into a trial and error of knowing when and where enemy units will activate and how they'll react, rather than being a fair assessment of strategy and tactics. The entire game feels like a poorly put together puzzle of trying to see where enemies will react and when they won't react to you being juuust enough outside the fog of war.Multiplayer's also a completely dead ghost town.I love Advance Wars, and this didn't deliver Advance Wars for me at all.

												This is a review for the finished article. a lot of reviews seem to be for the game while being developed.This is a turn based strategy game  in the spirit of battle isle but you already knew that.there are quite a few refinments,tweaks,extras that are not evident straight away but with play become available.such as capturing buildings and powering up units,pickups on the battlefiels such as repair kits and ammo.the AI is brutal and shows no mercy. it will gang up on you exploit weakneses,regroup,chase you down etc and all with litle or no downtime. The hard skill level is ofset by the ability to get reinforcements every 10 turns but if you do you wont get those elusive achievments your chasing. the graphics are clean smooth and colourfull and explosions are cool. i am loving this and will be hooked for some time. some missions seem impossible but if you study the battlefield and use all you can to your advantage you can win and the victory is soooo much sweeter. only bug i have experienced thus far is lockups if you try to restart a failed mission rather than loading or backing to the startup screen and starting from there. not a game breaker but a little annoying.Im enjoying this greatly			"

												Nice game for fans of the ""Battle Isle"" series.  I've played all of those games, and I think this one is consistent with the game mechanics ""theme"" of the other titles.  Also, it has nice scenarios with a complete story, cutscenes, etc. that tie in with the ""Battle Isle Universe"".But: This game also suffers from the weakness (IMO) of all titles but the first of the series - the really long scenarios and the stupid AI.The original ""Battle Isle"" was a sequence of ""puzzles"", where only the very last few scenarios had large maps.  There, the strategy of the AI was part of the puzzle.All of the later titles - including ""Battle Worlds: Kronos"" - had huge theatres of war, where the only strategy was a war of attrition against an awfully stupid AI that hugely outnumbers the player (to make up for its stupidity).So: If you like to continue the series you will enjoy this game.  But on its own, it is a rather weak member of the turn based strategy game category ...			"

												There was much potential here, but overall it missed the mark.It has a beautiful game engine, on par with CIV V, with detailed maps and good fx.There are only a handful of units in game, which really takes away from the immersion. The scenarios are interesting but completely unbalanced; many times you will find yourself fighting an infinite wave of fresh enemy units, while your units slowly wither away.  "

												First Impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/video/battle-worlds-kronos-first-impressions/Battle Worlds: Kronos is a turn-based strategy game developed by King Art Games. It’s got plenty of gameplay, online features, and quite a learning curve.I started off the game immediately by playing a live multiplayer match with a friend of mine, as that’s what I do with most strategy games. This may have been a bad idea, as we both had trouble figuring out what to do for the first hour or so of our game. The game plays a lot differently than what I’m used to in any strategy game, with a lot of interesting mechanics that I’ve never seen before in a strategy game.The game plays extremely slow in multiplayer. On top of the fact that the game is turn-based, there’s lack of a turn timer for each player, so, basically, each turn can last an infinite amount of time. Each turn is saved server-side, so one can even leave their current game while another player takes their turn. It took us roughly two and a half hours to complete a single game, partly due to the fact that we both were figuring out the game as we played.The game looks great, reminded me of Starcraft, the way some of the units and buildings appeared. There’s also a wide array of available units, including my favorite, the hoverboat (which had a proper name, I just cannot recall it. I believe it was “alligator” or “crocodile”).A few of the game’s mechanics were a bit difficult to grasp, especially the resource collection. It took me quite some time to figure that one out, and this is coming from someone who plays strategy games on an almost-daily basis. Aside from the slight learning curve, the game was quite fun, even more so in singleplayer, due to the length of each skirmish. I do recommend learning more about the game before jumping right in, however.			"

												good strategy game, fun to play with an easy interface and simple learning curve. Graphics are nothing to too impressive butthis is a strategy game after all. Both sides use the same units, game mechanics work well but dont expect much here. There are some quirky things in the interface that will frustrate you initially like unloading big carrier ships are ports. there is a lot to keep you busy, with asynchronous multiplayer which is a great feature. In addition to support for ipad and mac. I would personally recommend this game despite some of the things I complained about as it is still fun to play if you are into turn base strategy games.			"

												Good turn based strategy game on a hex grid. All military with very little economics for troop production. While the game is pretty quick paced since there are no cities or technologies to develope, the battles are not short. It is cool that promoted troops can be carried forward to the next battle as long as they are maxed.			"

												This game could have had some great play but the missions and the senarios are all unbalanced.  The enemy is always coming in elite while your guys are just basic.  The enemy is leveling up while just a little bit of dammage versus a heavy tank as well as  not being able to do as much dammage as a machine gun jeep.  The game play needs more thought and not just a bunch of numbers generated by a computer.  The game is way over priced and should be half as much as they are charging.  Dont waste your money on this one.			"

												At long last, a worthy successor to the old Battle Isle games from the '90's. This is a hexagon strategy game that doesn't pull punches. While there is a tutorial, this game doesn't hold your hand in the single player scenario. Because of the difficulty curve there is the option to call for reinforcements - at the cost of a lowered score on the map. You may have to try a map several times if you do not wish to use the reinforcements. That means you have to sink in a lot of time to get that map right, but it is worth the satisfaction you get from finally getting it right in the end.			"

												I've heard comparisons of this game to Advanced Wars and Panzer General which influenced my purchase. Let me tell you this pile of junk is far from those two titles.The mechanics of a turn based game are all here, yet the real thing that one wants in a game are missing that being a GAME. This ""game"" feels empty. Your presented with a corny video sequence with grafix strait out of the late 90's. You'r dropped in a ""tutorial"" scenario that is poorly executed, and almost every unit in the game is immediately playable. There is no buildup. The scenarios are really long and unimaginative. Then there are these popups from people talking to you about some stupid war you have to win, but the thing is nothing has been presented to me to show that somebody cared enough to put a good story in the game, so I don't care about the story either. And that is the general feeling I get from this game. A general ""the mechanics rule, we don't care enough to polish it into something unique"" sort of attitude pervades. Very tone death to quality this game. Wast of money. Don't support this kind of poor quality garbage.			"

The graphics are mediocre but sufficient for it's needs. I liked the music (it refreshing not being forced to hear dubstep in this game). My suggestion is to wait for it to go on sale for around 15$ if you are into very difficulty games. If not, I wouldn't bother unless some sort of difficulty scaling is put into place.			"

												Great game, very fun, succeed well to remind me Battle Isle transposed into a modern AAA game, something quite unique in that genre.The campaign is great, with a good length, and with a great diversity in missions. Many maps/missions are quite big and long and that's very cool. The gameplay is rather deep but keep it enjoyable for players not fan of pure wargames. There's a great gameplay diversity along the missions of the campaign.It's a genre that disappeared many years ago. I don't suggest try first the old classics because they didn't aged well. And there's no real contemporary competitor.So a clue is if you like turn based strategy games with an immediate and strong appeal, not too serious, and not too complex but with a good depth, then you should consider this game with attention, it's a great one in that very large category (Civilization, Endless Space, XCOM EU, Heroes of Migh&Magic, King's Bounty The Legend, Dominions 4, Jagged Alliance 2, Age of Wonders, and more).

Unfortunatly the game has some game design faliures. For those of us who like strategy games it lacks the good game design approaches of games, specially thesse, like Advance Wars, Civ 5(since it's a Hex game) or some Slitherine's games and etc. It doesn't have a supply system. You can't resupply, as you(would) wish, the chain of production, and etc. I am desappointed with it. The next game should be more like Slitherine's and Intelligent Systems' games!! Then I'd totally be buying the next iteration of it. So, if you are a hardcore strategy gamer.. Don't buy it.			"

												Preface, yo: pretty graphics make me happy, and good gameplay with minimal or retro graphics make me happy.  This game don't make me happy.  I'm probably naturally pushed towards discontent being that I was a kickstarter, but as far as graphic fidelity I was hoping for, at least, something along the lines of Dune 2000 (which recollection serves me none at all when it comes to when it came out but I'll hazard a guess that it was around 2000).  And I was hoping for gameplay depth at least around the level of Dune 2000.  And as a pledgeman, a reach goal was depth around the level of MAX 1.  Forget setting the bar as high as MAX 2. As the project progressed, I learned that there would be no real base building component to the game and worried about my pledge (not that anybody promised it -- I just dreamed it).  It still seemed like the developers had a passion for mechanics so I stayed interested.I might be jumping the gun, and I know for a fact that I have gotten pussified as the years have passed, but such a disappointment.  Like combining the worst of a table top tactics game and a pc game.  You get damaged, you just drive over a tile with a wrench icon.  With maps hundreds of tiles across with instant healing and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI?  Just wander, stumble, shoot, lose, memorize the pattern and try to iterate a better plan.  Nothing pretty to distract you from the mindlessness.  A total derth of emergent behavior.  Not my version of fun and a pledge wasted.Postface:  I could have tried to get involved, and had I been ignored I'd have a more substantive complaint.  I didn't.  Just a review of the finished product.  May get more involved in Unsung Story?			"

 Battle World:Kronos review This game is a very hard strategy which has it's pros and cons, although it seems nice at the beggining, that buff will not last for long. So if you're new to this genre, get out. If you're okay with these types of games, you should probably also get out. If you're a master, welcome to where you're life will turn insanely addicted.Please take to mind, this game is Hard, very hard. I just suck at this genre. Graphics This is a very pretty game with so many different effects and textures. Think of a stategy game made by Square Enix sprinkled with some more playabilty, less fairness (see Gameplay for details). It's nothing new here, move along if you're into some extreme graphics where you can see close ups of everything that's happening. Gameplay The game stated itself to be 100% fair by a developer. Which I could possibly agree with, although not entirely. On the first level there's quite a big number of enemies, and loads of objectives that take you into the feel of this game straight away, but it's just too fast! The game  does not  teach you about any of the units such as Priest (I still do not know what units a Priest can attack, as a sniper unit he should be able to be used as support), leaving the enemy (computer controlled, knows what all of the classes are used for, layout of the map ect) at an upper hand since it has all of the knowledge leaving you needing to fail many, many times in order to win. It's a wierd angle to play at, but it's surely a new one. Fail to succeed, never thought of that. So it's innovative, but because barely anyone is used to this type of playability, it's hard to pick up any speed, or even get past Level 1 if you suck at Strategy games like I do. How realistic is the game The answer in short is, not very, but also is quite realistic. Let's take a war, I should be able to know at least a bit about my units that I put into battle if I'm a commander of a squad, so I will not make a mistake of placing a small pistol airpilot who has crashed, against a giant cucumber-man who has a flaming minigun. That would cause me to lose the war since I didn't know my unit was terrible, or that the other sides' was powerful. This is like Dark Souls where I absolutely need the community to help me figure out who does what in the game, without those guys, I would still be at the first level, looking at my first unit and studying it, which would make me learn who is a good and strong overlord unit, but would take too long, it wouldn't even be fun anymore. Yet I still did that. Pros and Cons Pros:Graphics are prettyGood for people who enjoy strategiesCons:Not very fairThe first level is a bit long, while it should just tell me the basics, to let me know what I'm doing, kill a  few  enemies of all types so I'll be able to complete the first mission.A bit costlyI'd like a little more variety in difficulty Overall A fantastic game which made me a lot more skilled in the genre. Get's an easy 7.5/10. Great game if you're a master at Strategies.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow Original Curator Group  Check out the Original Network Groups.

												Slow and boring gameplay, kind of stilted graphics, terrible acting and even worse writing. May be fun in some sort of skirmish mode, I don't know.			"

												They refused to give Steam Keys to those that bought it on their website. Companies like this you simply don't support. Especially when they were voted in via Greenlight. Get Pandora from Slitherine instead.			"

												I backed this on kickstarter and was very disapointed when the game came out.  Cheap looking UI, graphics not that great... and really it takes forever to really ""get anything done"".  I think the problems stem around the ratio of big maps to movement speed - and the overall map design.  You spend a lot of time getting your army across a bridge to kill a few units - only to have to bottleneck all your units at the next bridge again.I'd probably be more patient with the game if the graphics didn't look like they were about a decade old. :( Summary: Nothing to look forward to in this game.

												The game is way to bright, you can even see it to some extent in the screenshots its like everything is washed out very noticeable when fog of war is up. It makes everything look kind of blurry even you can see that in the screenshots as well. You don't notice it so much in the screenshots but once you play the game you will really notice it, tried all different graphics options and nothing seemed to fix the problem, have no problems with any of the other games I play. It is almost like a blur affect on everything in the game hurts the eyes.			"

												Can't get into this game. Too much overly-complicated gameplay and UIs with not enough fun.			"

												This game is a very challenging game and is very addicting.When i started Battle Worlds Kronos,i thought it was going to be boring,but as soon as you start playing it for a while,you will feel that this game is very addicting.For those who are not sure if you want to buy this game,take my advice:do get this game.That is all i have to say about this game.

												Just for the statistics: I'm a passionate player of turn based strategy games, I've played a lot of them and I was never fearing a tough challenge. I really wanted to love this game, but like many others, all I found was frustration. The reasons were dicussed well enough. I will not repeat them.The Dev's response related to this critism suggests, that they do not see any (design) failures on their side and that they are not willing to intoduce corresponding changes. Well, that's ok - its their game and there seems to exist a certain fan base which favours b]their approach . But hence, this will be my conclusion: Deinstall BW:K and discourage my friends from buying/playing it.Best regards,paxSeb			"

												In the tutorial there is a pretty big headed talk about how difficukt the game is, and how sh*t you are if you cant beat the game without losing a single unit. -2/10. If I fail and Im told Im not good, thats still mean but fine, but telling me Im♥♥♥♥♥♥while I literally learning how to do basic stuff like moving is NOT cool.			"

												Looks like a good beginning for a great tactical game but not like a ready product. Company is not a bad. Multiplayer is a main thing but have very big lack of functionality.. Result: 6/10			"

												I really like this game reminds me of Fallen Haven which was similar, Like any game you need to understand your units and their strengths and weaknesses also weapons ranges and when you know then it becomes easy and down to tactics			"
