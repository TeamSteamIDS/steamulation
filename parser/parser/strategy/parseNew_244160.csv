												EDIT: Crash bugs right now if you have texture size turned way up. The classics are working fine for me. By the way, you must download the DLC to be able to play the campaigns in the remastered edition. Issues thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/244160/discussions/0/617328967243529430/Let me tell you something about homeworld (1+2 AND the lost game, homeworld cataclysm). Even 15+ years later, it's still the gold standard for 3D RTS. Here's a few big points:Very intuitive controls. Movement control is a simple two step, where the first sets horizontal movement, then *optionally* holding shift or click and drag for height. I've yet to see another 3D RTS which even comes close to how quickly and simply that I can give move orders in a 3D space, even though mice and monitors are 2D devices.Extremely helpful *contextual* visual indicators. When in the process of giving a move order, a lot of supporting information for movement then pops up. For example, to show how high other ship's height are above yours in the 3D battlespace, an ecliptic disc is drawn centered on your ships in the move order interface, and vertical lines are drawn from that disc to those other ships. It GREATLY aids in plotting the movement order so you can order your ships to intercept over long distances. Once the move order is given, all of this goes away so there isn't information overload.Battles actually take place in 3D space as well. Skilled players WILL use height to flank from above and below to avoid being subjected to a full broadside of guns. Fighters zoom around ships without regards to direction, attacking from multiple angles. This isn't ""2.5D"" as I would call it, you NEED to use height, especially with fighters.Two camera modes. One is the standard battle camera, which you spend most of your time in for orders in a small area, and a strategic camera, which is an ""at a glance"" of the battlespace with a LOT more information and large map wide movement. The space bar is the simple key to switch between them.In the story, you must be somewhat careful of losses (but it's not so bad that it inhibits gameplay). Every mission brings the resources, ships, and research that you have from the previous missions. You are quite literally a nomadic fleet. Resources on each map are *not* regenerative, even in multiplayer, so grab what you can! Think starcraft in terms of resources: it's plentiful, but resources will run out in a prolonged battle.The story itself: It's of loss and sacrifice, hope and victory. It's quite a roller coaster of emotion.Soundtrack: Very ""spacey"" feel that is well designed to suit each mission. Plus, mission 3 on HW1 had the best freaking use of a classic choir song (Agnus Dei - Adagio for strings) I've ever heard.My only regret: the source code to HW:Cataclysm is lost. There's no remastering it. It's not considered canon, but it was still fun playing as the mining faction's ship ""Kun-Laan"" and fighting the galactic cancer known as ""The Beast"".EDIT: Made a grammar mistake, fixed. Kun-Laan is the mining faction's ship, but I forgot to mention that their faction name is ""Somtaaw""			"

												As a kid, I remember asking my father about all the different ships as he was playing the original Homeworld. As soon as the Remastered version came out, I had to buy it.Overall I'm very happy with the game. The remastered version is beautiful, and in my opinion one of the best things about it is that it has a great storyline behind it. While I understand that not everyone cares about that, for me it makes the game so much more. Homeworld offers a rather unique experience as a strategy game in a 3 dimensional enviornment which isn't really like anything else I've played.Both HW and HW2 remastered versions seem to be optimized well, as I've never had any lag or framerate issues. I can't speak for the mods, as I haven't yet felt the need to utilize any - there hasn't been any that I've seen that have caught my eye as a ""must have"".Some people have complained about scenarios being more or less difficult depending on how well you're doing throughout your campaign. Say you fail a mission, but you rememeber what's thrown at you and plan accordingly beforehand - the next time you start it stronger only to find there's even more enemy ships. Personally I kind of have mixed feelings about this aspect, it makes the game more unpredictible and more challenging, as you can't plan for everything the way you can with most other game's missions/scenarios.As a negative, I have encountered a couple small glitches with scenarios, such as objectives not checking off as complete even though you've finished it, therefore making the scenario impossible to finish. I also don't particularly care for HW2, the storyline and ship variants just don't do it for me. In my opinion the first game is far superior but that's simply a matter of opinion. I can't say I have anyone to try Multiplayer with but I think it would be an excellent MP game with a few friends looking to out-strategize one another.In conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking to try out a new type of strategy game in a 3D space enviornment, or anyone who gets their kicks out of a great back story like myself.

												Here is a full ist of the changes made from classic to remaster:http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/another-ye-olde-homeworld-players-view-on-remastered/98847Homeworld is a space strategy game that redefined the RTS genre, and remains today as the only game that did it right. A deep and thrilling story (30 missions over 2 campaigns), powerful and anomalous music, and a very unique style of play. A true space opera!Even though games are nearly 15 years old now, the mechanics and gameplay don’t feel outdated. Instead, they are still unmatched by any other space RTS that have released since. The three dimensional environment requires a whole new level of thinking when it comes to strategy.Now let’s talk about the Remaster and a company that actually put effort into a remake. This was crafted with the assistance and guidance of the original creators as well as the help of a passionate fan community.Here’s a list of some of the changes:+ Significantly upgraded visuals, including high-res textures and models+ Up to 4k resolution+ Sound and music overhaul+ Upgraded cut-scenes with clean artwork and some new 3d animations+ Redesigned UI for HW1 (from HW2 which also got an update)+ Mod compatibility and workshop support+ Compatibility with newer operating systems+ Combined Multiplayer between both gamesAs you can see, they put a considerable amount of effort into this remastered version of Homeworld and that's why I totally think it’s worth the price tag, unlike any other HD remake out on Steam. You also get both of the original games with this package, which were previously hard to get ahold of, and they are even updated to be playable on modern operating systems.If you enjoyed Homeworld 1 and/or 2 in any shape or form, you should strongly consider buying this, as it really is a whole new experience! Let’s show the industry that there is still demand for strategy games like this, so that we can expect more in the future!			"

												Let me start by stating this: - I did not play the original games, so my review comes untainted by fandom both possitive and negative.OVERVIEW:At this time the game is best enjoyed single player. The campaign in HW1 Remastered is amazing and I expect HW2R's to be great as well. The story, cinematics, music and atmosphere all get 10/10CONTROLS:Some players have a little trouble getting used to the controls and while this is in part due to the fully 3d nature of the game I also feel it is in part down to the developers descision to keep the old control system rather than improving upon it. That said, everything works nicely and I found everythign easy to get used to. 8/10GRAPHICS:The game is simply stunning close up, ships are well detailed, docking ships looks awesome, the enviroments and FX are great. Could they be better.. Probably.. Are they good enough, definitly. 9/10MULTIPLAYER:PvP is still in beta, so it is hard to judge, but so far things seem real good. There are objectives and that is something I find very interesting as it is unheard of in other PvP games I play. AI is skilled enough for skirmish games and will give you a real run for your money, Changing tactics from game to game and really testing you. Only real issue is possibly balancing still needs to be done on some units. But hey, this is something completely new to the franchise so it was always going to take time. There is however no co-op campaign.. Something I find sorely lacking as it is my prefered game mode ussually. 7/10OVERALL:An exellent game, I highly recommed it to anyone who loves, RTS, sci-fi, or who is just looking to try something new or find a great story to be immersed in. 9/10			"

												The first thing I noticed on playing HW:RM was how the HW2 UI and seemed to be everywhere. It was as if the whole HW1 game had been transplanted into the HW2 engine... turned out I wasn't far off. Homeworld 1Unfortunately there are a few things that bring the quality of the remaster down as a whole - players aren't able to experience HW1 with it's Ballistics physics engine intact (shots fired could be evaded or go on to hit something else), instead shots fired by ships generally always hit (some RNG seems to be involved) the selected target as in HW2. This is a large part of what made HW1 stand out from other RTSes at the time (in fact most RTSes nowadays) and made certain manoeuvres such as doing increased damage to ships when attacking them from behind, etc, possible since damage resistance was also modelled as part of this engine. As far as I can recall this was not something that was taken through to the original HW2 or the Remaster. Pretty big deal in my opinion.Formations in general are completely borked, meaning that a lot of the tactical (and at the time, genre defying) flavour of HW1 is completely absent; while I don't particularly miss the fiddly micromanagement and lack of context sensitive clicks, I do miss the extra depth of tactics that formations offered. If Gearbox ever start work on a Homeworld: Cataclysm remaster (the original HW:C = my favourite game of the series) they have to get this fixed. Good news is that a patch may be on it's way to restore formations to their intended form.Overall I still enjoyed playing through the HW1:RM campaign, and ultimately found it more ""playable"" than the original (especially while using a Steam Controller). Basically I found the game easier and more accessible than it used to be, which for newcomers and busy old-schoolers like me is not a bad thing. I think it's a huge shame we never got to see the original ballistics physics etc on todays capable machines however.Homeworld 2Being completely honest I originally played Homeworld 2 the least of the games in the series, however I feel that the remaster did a solid job of restoring and enhancing the game for compatibility while staying pretty faithful to the original. The remastered graphics really shine here, fleet battles are a thing of beauty. Seriously, pick a fight and soak in that goodness, JUST DO ITSince the remaster has been so good to the game I have in effect enjoyed HW2 anew - I'd basically offer this collection as an instant recommendation for fans of the original. The only issues HW2 fans might have is that the voice actors from HW1 have been used instead of the ones they may remember from HW2, as well as a few other VA changes here and there (notably Makaan).GeneralGearbox have been patching things up slowly, with various bugs and issues like bad pathfinding (crashing into asteroids) being fixed. There are still issues like formations not working properly and friendly ships merrily continuing to pour heavy firepower on ships you are boarding/salvaging to add to your fleet, amongst other things.Scoring based on faithfulness to the spirit of the originals;-GFX/FIDELITY 8Glorious hi-res Fleet battles and Furballs, gorgeously updated and retouched. The UI scales perfectly and there are sliders allowing you to adjust the scale of varying UI components manually. -AUDIO 7Remastered audio (apparently; I can't tell I'm no audiophile), original voice actors (notably Fleet Command/ Mothership from HW1) brought back and re-recorded. HW Classic sound effects are particularly dated and low-def when compared to the remaster, so good job I guess. -GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS 6In regards to HW1 the best I can say is some patching is definitely needed.HW2 on the other hand is in a good place. If Gearbox attempt a remake of Homeworld: Cataclysm, I hope they get a better handle on what made these games great in the first place.As a Remastered Collection It's a good update on the originals, however it's not perfect by a long shot. It's also a shame that some of the technical limitations that held the old games back have not really been challenged (in fact the opposite, much has been dumbed down). The unfulfilled potential is pretty crushing in my opinion.Multiplayer is also a bit hit and miss, in that Gearbox are clearly putting a lot of work into the facilitation of mp matches, but the bugs/missing mechanics are keenly apparent at higher levels of play.In any case I have to thank Gearbox for bringing back these games, and can only recommend this Collection as an essential for RTS fans, and those gamers who enjoy a good story alongside a challenge.

												Sadly, as a HW player since the first game came out, (Back in 1999) I cannot recommend this game.  The first time I played Homeworld, I was a young boy about 8 years of age. My grandfather introduced me to the game, and whenever I go see him I will still play LAN games against him, on the same two disks that we have always played on. Now, with that being said, at 8 years of age I didn't really understand tactics or how to win, the main objective for me was to build a heavy cruiser and try bum rushing the enemy mothership, praying that my prized cruiser didn't get salvaged in the process! As I grew older and understood the game more, I enjoyed it more as I began using formations and tactics to alter the outcome of battles, some of which were against slim to none odds.   The depth and complexity of this game was really what hit the mark for me as I grew older. I played Homeworld nonstop until Homeworld 2 came out. I enjoyed playing that game as well from time to time as well, but my Homeworld life changed forever when the Complex mod came out. This mod essentially combined the tactical and strategical gameplay of HW1 with the beautiful graphics and upgraded UI of HW2. I have played this mod since it was released, all the way to 9.1 which is where it sits now.   Now fast forward to 2014, when I learned that my favorite strategy game was getting remastered. I poured over screenshots and gameplay, developer interviews and every last piece of media I could grasp my hands on. The promise was simple, updated graphics, and no changes to the original engine this game ran on. Unfortunately, this was a lie.   When I first booted up HW:R I was amazed with the beauty of the game, but felt betrayed as I continued to play on. The most important feature of early combat, even going forward to endgame combat, the formations and tactics features, do not work. This is a gamebreaking feature people, because strikecraft are worth their weight in gold at all stages of the game. The fact that you can no longer use bombers and corvettes to their full potential will ruin the game for anyone who has played this before. The developers essentially put everything HW1 onto the HW2 UI, all for the sake of being able to play Kushan VS Hiigarrian in multiplayer. While this introduces great improvements, such as better 3D movement and harvesting, the developers lied in their statement of, ""Nothing but the graphics will change"". The month is now June, and the Dev's haven't even made a comment of when these issues will be fixed, no issued an apology for their lie.   Also, mods will STILL not work the way they should in the classic versions of the game. I would be fine if I could still play Complex 9.1 on the classic HW2 game, knowing that the fix will come eventually and formations will be able to be used again. However on bootup the mods (and I'm talking other mods too, the star wars mod, the halo mod, etc) will crash and burn, leaving you empty handed. The dev's should have kept these engines separate, as even on multiplayer, HW2 strike craft will always slay HW1 strike craft, because the HW2 squadron formations still work.   As a man who has played thousands of hours of Homeworld, and in light of this 60% off steam sale going on currently, I strongly advise putting your hard earned dollars, euros, pesos, or whatever currency you're using into something else, unless you have never played this game before, because you may be able to enjoy it for what it currently is. If you have played even one skirmish vs cpu match on the original HW, don't even bother picking this up.**UPDATE**As of today, 9/20/2015, the game is still borken, formations are still not usable, and now mods are ceasing to work as the dev. launches half ***ed patches ever two months in order to justify a poor excuse for a ""Supported"" title. Folks, for your money id say buy an actual HW2 disk, so at least you can play the great mods that have been released. This, sadly, is not the Homeworld Remaster we were promised or expected it to be.			"

												At first, I was not pleased with this game. It was very buggy and frustrating, with numerous other issues like HUGE pathing problems, stupid ai and automation problems (Several harvesters waiting to get to a single asteroid to harvest when they're surrounded by unnoccupied other ones). However, the largest problems lay in the fact that ""Homeworld 1 remastered"" was essentially just homeworld 2 with homeworld 1 ships, because a lot of mechanics which gave the original tactical depth had to be removed so it could fit into homeworld 2's engine. This meant that the whole collection was a buggy, broken, imbalanced shadow of the originals.But then the June 7th update happened This update (in my experience so far) fixed everything that was wrong. It has fixed formations, ballistics, tactics, pathing (mostly), targeting priorities, balance, and all general bugs (that i've experienced so far).I can now safely say that:  Both campaigns offer an amazing narrative experience, complete with incredible music and visuals.Both campaigns provide a great challenge, as does the AI in singleplayer modeEasy to use and pick up basic mechanics, with complex ones to pick up laterTrademark 3d movement and map are very well implementedIncludes the 2 original games, fixed to run properly on modern OSs and hardware Maps allow for potentially hundreds of small fights at once which can be really intense as larger strategies take shape Gorgeous visuals and sound, which all run very well Multiplayer supports up to 8 players I think, which can lead to some titanic fights.Overall a great experience and a very solid recommendation after the update. 8.5/10  "

												Let me start out by being fair and pointing out what Gearbox got right with HW:R - the ships look beautiful, it's quite obvious a lot of time and effort was spent lovingly crafting them and they feel very solid and real. The other eye candy like HDR and shadows is very welcome and really calls out to my first experiences of playing HW1 in 2000. Sounds and voice-overs are also remastered to a very high standard though some of the inflections aren't to my personal taste, but that's just me.Now then, onto the bugs and why I can't recommend HW:R in its current state. If you've read the other reviews by now you'll probably have found some pointing out the bugs with formations and strikecraft in general. I am no purist, but quite frankly I think these issues have been understated so far. Not being able to put your fighters or corvettes into formations massively affects the combat effectiveness of your strikecraft (less so for capitals). Since they refuse to maintain formation (regardless of tactics set) they will not fire en masse and you the player cannot position them precisely where you need and want them. A wall of just 9 heavy corvettes in HW1 would easily demolish a flock of enemy fighters if managed correctly. In HW1 the same force takes at least 3 times as long to complete the same engagement and you’ll probably take losses. I've seen positive reviews on here downplaying this issue which I find hugely disingenuous to say the least. I'm going to have to make a video showing HW1 and HW1:R side by side to really illustrate just how much this affects the game and almost everything you do in it, it really is that fundamental.Formations aside, the path-finding for strikecraft again is quite poor. Ships like the heavy corvette with heavy forward firepower seem to insist on circling the enemy and trying broadsides to no effect, which is probably why the fights take forever to finish. Because your ships refuse to stay in formation they will also largely ignore player attack-move commands during combat (ctrl+A).Other reviewers have already pointed out the firing system changes as well, but I really have to emphasise just how much this negatively impacts the game. Basically, in HW1 your ships would fire bullets that would actually travel through space i.e. no hitscan or RNG. Since this is no longer the case your ships are at the mercy of the Random Number Generator and setting them to evasion tactics has literally no effect where as in HW1 it could vastly improve the survivability of your strikecraft.I understand a lot of these changes were implemented to allow compatibility between HW1 and HW2 to enable multiplayer which is just fine imho. However, I consider the formations and tactics issues as bugs since they severely handicap HW1 strikecraft compared to their HW2 counterparts, not to mention that it robs the player of a huge degree of tactical control.I love Homeworld, but being unable to control my strikecraft effectively reduces the whole thing to pumping out ships, sitting back and hoping for the best. The pathfinding and formations issues are major bugs and I hope to the almighty Gearbox get on top of this crap.			"

												It's a real shame that one of the better games of 2015 was originally released in 1999 and 2003, respectively. Homeworld Remastered is beautiful. The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release. The only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga. If you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger. I couldn't recommend this game any higher.			"

												We all know what made Homeworld great. We all know Gearbox made a visually stunning remaster. What needs to be said now is what Gearbox did to make the remaster a disappointment. While the following things may sound petty, they fundamentally change how the game is played and the emotional tenor of the story:-removing formations-removing stances-removing fuel for strike craft-reworking repair mechanics (repairing is now not feasible in combat, it's more meant for between battles)-making diffculty scaling much more aggressive-replacing the ballistic simulation for random number generation combatHomeworld was always a story of disempowerment. Of overcoming long odds at the brink of genocide. You were perenially starved for resources, and forced to be extremely careful when shepherding your tiny little fleet. Put your craft into evasive mode and they'll live longer. Put them into aggressive mode and they'll kill faster. Use your support craft to keep expensive ships alive from mission to mission. Use the almost Napoleonic wall formation to concentrate firepower, but don't try complex maneuvers with it. The level of care you had to put into your fleet assets, great and small, contributed a lot to the overall feel of the game.Now, stances have been removed. Formations have no effect, and fall apart the moment your ships enter combat. Fuel for strike craft has been removed. Support ships are now so unwieldy and take so long to engage that they are only useful outside of combat. Individually these changes wouldn't be so bad, but taken together they rob Homeworld's story of it's gravitas, and it's gameplay of almost all its depth.It's hard to care about your fleet because your ships are now throwaway items, and honestly there isn't much for you to do with them other than throw them at the enemy fleet and designate targets. What was once a game of tactics and risk management has been reduced to a laser light show. Pretty, but ultimately there isn't much for you to do but sit back and watch.If you want a pretty game with all the familiar sights and sounds from the Homeworld we played back in 1999, then this fits the bill. If you want a game that captures either the spirit or the tactical depth of the original, then sadly you should look somewhere else.			"

			Spent like 13+ hours and I was excited about the remake of this game, it is amazing and quite frankly breathtaking. I been at it nonstop 13 hours straight so I added some awesome gameplay for you...		

Pros + HD graphics supporting up to 4k wow and the ships looks amazing.+ Really well done UI that makes the game easily mangeable.+ Redone sound effects that is amazing+ You get HW1, HW2 remastered and the classics + The game runs very smooth and the system requirement isn't too insane game is 4 gigs total.+ The backdrops and environments bring back nostalgia and really well done.+ Multiplayer is being worked on but it is damn fun.+ Compelling story and voice acting redone with tasteful cutscenes.+ NO DLC BS+ MODS ENABLED, Compatibility for mods.Cons - It isn't a remaster vets were hoping for, they took away somethings such as fuel, some tatics etc from homeworld- HW1 is actually in HW2 engine, so if you didn't research you would not know this. The mechanics from the old one is changed up a bit.- Formations are breaking sometimes, is this a bug?- Some bugs and crashes but it can be ironed out hopefully- The engine to the battles feel less projectile like but more dice rolling battles on the attacks			"

												Just one word... AmazingGearbox did an astonishing job with Homeworld. It really got what it deserved. The sound and graphics were amazing for the time (15 years ago for the ones that don't know Homeworld). With the remastered edition they did such a great job with improving everything and keeping the game practically the same. The sound is amazing. I did the first mission in 30 minutes. I was just listening to all the gorgious sounds. And i haven't talked about the looks. The graphics are so good looking now. It all looks really high detail even upclose. And the cool thing about up close view is the new Depth of Field. I just love watching a huge destroyer firing its guns at some frigates in the distance. It sounds amazing. It looks gorgious and it plays wonderfull. And you can get some amazing screenshots when you turn off your HUD (Backspace).TL:DRIf you love Homeworld, you will love this. If you love Space RTS, you will love this. If you just love amazing sounds and graphics, you will love this. Like i said. One word... AmazingBig applause to all the guys that worked on this at Gearbox and for the original developers and voice actors (Which helped with remastered). You guys made a masterpiece into an even better masterpieceOver 9000/10			"

												Beyond incomplete. The Homeworld 1 ""remaster"" has removed :- Fuel Mechanics- Ballistic Damage Model- Formations- Tactics (Defensive/Agressive modes for vessels) The above are not ""bugs"" because they are features that were crucial to Homeworld 1 which have just been completely left out. Bugs include :- Functional Resource Harvesters (Often do nothing, bump into things forever etc)- Function Salvage Mechanics (You now must individually select salvage targets from large groups of targets)- Functional navigation (Often ships just collide and do nothing forever)- Numerous bugs in missions. Crashes etc. Many players can't get past mission 3 because it never loads. Homeworld 2 Remastered is much more functional but still experiences many of the above bugs. Homeworld 1 Classic. Chris Faylor said in an interview : ""We had to make sure that the classics were out there no matter what, as untouched as they could possibly be for the sake of history.""They removed multiplayer LAN from the Classic - not the Remastered - version. Homeworld Multiplayer Beta? Don't get me started. - Massive Balance issues - chronic disconnects- no re-joining mechanics to games - CHRONIC DISCONNECTS			"

												Some games define a genre.Some games define a playing system.And then you have games that define a generation.Homeworld is one of these very few games that define how games make you feel totally immersed in the actual game.The game is extremely well made and just draws you into its universe.The graphic update for the remastered version is something that all game developers should look at. If you want to relaunch a old game just update the graphics. Dont ruin the game by trying to add your own idea.But for me the crowing jewel for this game is the music. This game has music to sooth the savage beast. I played this game for hours at a time just to listen to the music.i was close to tears sometime when the music coinsided with some very dramitic game play.If you have the money then you must add this to your game library			"

												I was 12 years old when Homeworld was published.....now I'm 28 year old....play Homeworld was like to go back in the years. There are some bugs but....the game is completely playable and enjoyable...and is a must have for veterans of 1998...but it can be a really challenging and wonderful space RTS also for younger players.Pay attention to which strategy you use during the 2 campaings because the game is very challenging (particularly HW2)..I warned you because people are whining: ""The Game is unbalanced!! The game is boring! Gearbox is not serious!"".....don't pay attention to those people..Buy It!			"

												Such a shame... What I though was going to be a true-to-original remaster, was too far off to keep playing. Being a fan of HW2, and reading the reviews and complaints of HW1 carefully, I thought I would pick it up on sale. Playing the first two HW1 missions, I saw what some folks were talking about in the way that GB had changed the fighter behaviors, and other details. I also some improvements they had carried over from 2 such as being able to select units from the space map. Being a fan of 2 I thought that this was ok since I had always seen fighters as being OP in the original. I once beat the game with NOTHING BUT fighters and bombers.The deal breaker for me came when I started the third mission. I had built 6 salvage corvettes in anticipation of ""stealing"" the coming frigates and using them against the enemy as I had 15 years ago. To my horror, as each frigate was captured, nothing came back out. I was like ""where the hell are my frigates?!"". Then I noticed that my RUs had grown substantially. I quit the game right then and started reading more into the forums and saw that this was now part of the game. Then I started looking in the Workshop to see if anyone had made a mod to fix this, and sadly there was no fix. Salvaging was one of my favorite parts of HW1. I don’t understand why someone would take a classic that was so well received and decide to cut it up as much as GB did, and describe it as being true to the original. Remasters are a common thing in the music industry. Old master tracks are taken back to the studio and are mixed down again on new hardware to bring the sound quality up to par with current music quality and to fix any “noise” that may have been in the original to clean it up. Imagine if you went to the store and bought the remastered version of your favorite band's album, only to find that someone else is playing guitar, and your favorite songs from the original are missing even though the album cover makes no mention of it? Its a beautiful game with great sound and gameplay, but a remaster of the original it’s not. Maybe one day GB will get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and put the game back like I should have been in the first place. Watch the video that Bobamelius has posted in his review carefully if you are thinking of getting HWRM. Hell, watch it two or three times and know what you are buying. Thanks to Steam's new refund policy I'm on to the next game! "

												Via reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2xcwdl/homeworld_remastered_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly/I've spent about 8 hours with Homeworld remastered re-living one of the best game experiences I can remember, and have to say that there are ups and downs to the remastered version.The good:    The graphics are beautiful yet look like I remember them. That is to say Gearbox has done a great job of updating the graphics so that the game looks as it should through my rose tinted glasses of fond memories :)    They stripped out some mechanics that were a real pain in the original, specifically fuel for fighters.The Bad:    Stripping out some of those features had unintended consequences. For example, strike craft used to automatically fly home to refuel from time to time and would automatically be repaired and re-armed. Now since they don't have fuel they don't return to base on their own and die very easily left to their own devices.    Gearbox removed the 'aggressive' and 'evasive' posture from the original which used to be very handy for keeping your ships alive longer. In the original game you could re-position your forces, withdraw, or wait for reinforcements without taking crippling losses, but now these situations lead to crippling losses.    Formations don't seem to be working right... you can put your ships in formation but they break that formation if so much as an enemy fighter shows up.    Automatic harvesting was added but works inconsistently. This was a Homeworld 2 feature meant to be a time saver so you could hyperspace out when the mission was done instead of waiting for 40 minutes for your harvesters to finish gathering resources. It's broken though so it seems to harvest random amounts and not everything on the map.    Another homeworld 2 feature they seem to have dabbled with is dynamic difficulty, which I personally hate. It basically punishes you for playing smart on prior missions and removes most of the incentive to do a good job rather than just scrape by. They should have left it out or put in a difficulty level selection.The Ugly:    Frequent crashes to desktop even with updated drivers and directX. There are some bugs in the graphical portion.    Myriad scripting errors including...    Some missions can't be completed about 1/3 of the time. For example the mission diamond shoals has a nasty bug where after you clear the minefield the bentusi may or may not show up making the mission un-finish-able. As if this wasn't bad enough the bug also exists in the automatically made quicksave at the start of the mission, so if you get stung by this error you have to reload in the previous mission.    In the previous mission there's a scripted event where fleet command tells you about enemy defender ships and how you should research your own... in my game the research option didn't show up, so I literally cannot build this type of ship for the rest of the game.    On later missions similar bugs appear where you finish all the objectives but just can't finish the mission.    Some AI seems to have been lobotomized in transition. The garden of kadesh used to be very tough, but now most of the enemy ships don't do anything... "

												Homeworld is sacred. Homeworld is art. Homeworld is one of the greatest PC games of all time.I for one, embraced this remaster and embraced the return of the the great art that is Homeworld.That said, this remaster might not appeal to the hardest of the hard core HW1 players.If you prefer HW2, then by all means, get this now.If you're extremely picky about all the HW1 mechanics, there's a lot of HW2-ism that clashes with it. Formations, tactics and certain game mechanics (and bugs at this point) are making it very obvious that it's a HW1 port in HW2 engine. I've never been a huge multiplayer player in HW1, but I'm a huge single player fan. I've played a few LAN games with my brother and friends, loved it, but I was never a master player in the ""Internet ladder"" sense.That said, I'm a much much bigger fan of HW1 (never even finished HW2 completely), and played it a LOT back in the days. The remaster didn't kill any of the experience for me. Sure, I prefer a lot of the stuff from the vanilla HW, and would love to see it return, but I realize, not all of it is possible by patching the game. And I'm ok with it. Now I can't wait to play through HW2 campaign too, and try out the MP.So yes I do recommend this to die hard fans of both Homeworld 1 & 2, but only if you're not extremely picky about old HW1 mechanics and are willing to play through this game with slightly different approach.If you've never played HW games before, get it now!Oh, and you get both old classics along, so this to me, is a great deal. Thumbs up!			"

												Can some people have fun with this game? Yes. Can I, personally, recommend this? No, sorry. You licked my lollipop, rewrapped it, and then sold it back to me; what did you expect.Full disclosure: I own the original disc versions of HW1, HWC, and HW2, and have been a big fan of at least the first two.I played the crap out of Homeworld 1 and Cataclysm for years, both the campaigns and multiplayer. I rediscovered them all over again several times, when unpacking boxes or reinstalling a new PC. They are at the top of my all-time favourite games.HW2: I think I finished the campaign once, and not in one go. It just felt like a step back from the previous ones, for several reasons. Still, it entertained me for a good while and in some way stilled my hunger for a continuation of the HW1/HWC line.Was I excited about a remaster? Absolutely; I like shiny new graphics and better sounds, and I looked forward to having the games install and work 'out of the box' on current day OS. But for me, that was literally all they needed to do. Because functionally, HW1/HWC already worked exactly as they were.For me, they could not have done this remaster any more wrong if they'd tried:* They picked the wrong engine. If it was at all true that they could not do a remaster of both with each their own engine, I would've picked HW1 over HW2 every day and twice on sunday, From my perspective, it would've made their job easier: just dumb down the HW2 races/campaign to ignore the superior HW1 formations and strafing and ballistics, et voilá, HW2 on HW1 engine. Besides, this argument reeks: they went to the trouble of completely redoing/reinventing the HW1 campaign and ships and balance on a HW2 engine... and that was somehow less effort than simply keeping those parts of the existing source code unchanged? Hogwash.* They picked the wrong UI. Yes, it took a few moments and maybe a peek at the manual to figure out how to call up the HW1 UI, but the almost entire absence of it made Space(tm) feel Real(tm). I agree that the research/build/launch dialogs would have benefited from an overlay implementation, but functionally they worked much better than HW2.* They picked the wrong camera movement. In HW1, when rotating the camera with right mouse click, the pivot point is the ship or object you focused on. This feels utterly natural, because that is what focus means: maintain your view on your point of interest while rotating to get an overview of all that surrounds it. In HW2, the camera instead pivots on itself. Aside from breaking immersion (wait a minute, am I part of this story, or am I filming it?), it does not maintain focus on what you told it to. Homeworld is not an FPS!* They killed the AI in so many ways. Strikegroups break formation the moment they start moving, or never form up the way it was intended in the first place (sphere guard, anyone?), broken pathing makes ships get stuck in places, ships forget halfway what they were ordered to do and need to be reissued so they don't either stop in the middle of nowhere or decide to do some suicide move on their own.* The remastered graphics and sounds, while pretty and certainly a significant step up from the originals, end up being underwhelming when compared to community mods like Complex which have been available for years.And as if messing up the Remastered versions wasn't enough:* They messed with the 'Classics'. Yes, they included a 'Classic' version that supposedly kept the original experience intact for those who may not like all the changes in Remastered. Which I would've been happy with, except... they kept the bugs/shortcomings intact (no widescreen/high resolution support unless hacked through registry), but they messed with things that should and could have been left alone (load/save no longer compatible with original savegames; LAN multiplayer removed; D3D/sw rendering removed).Why? Especially that last one: it was already becoming difficult to make the originals work on current hardware and OS... and they go and remove compatibility options that existed in the originals! What exactly is the point of including HW2C then? It's not as pretty as HW2R, *and* it's now almost as bad about backwards compatibility. Pointless. If you need a lighter version to run on somewhat lesser hardware, just run HW2R with all graphics options turned to minimum. (except now, since they removed the other pre-existing rendering options, it's OpenGL 3.3 or nothing. Sucks to be you if you don't have updated compatible drivers).I played a few missions into HW1R before I got too irritated and went back to HW1C. Two missions short of the end of that campaign, they then published a patch for the Remastered version that somehow managed to break load/save in HW1C, making it freeze and crash on loading savegames created just days/hours before.  So I ended up playing halfway through the campaign on my original disc versions before even feeling like trying again.Did I miss the remastered resources while playing HW1C / HW1 original? Quite honestly, not in the least. They are a shiny bonus, indisputably, but simply have no bearing on the masterpiece that was and still is HW1.In the end, I just feel duped for letting my nostalgia win and buying into the pre-order. This collection does not deliver: it removed what was good and added new gripes, in exchange of some shiny graphics and rerecorded sounds. On top of things, where my original dics versions came with the soundtracks included, now they want additional cash just for the soundtracks (which are not even complete btw, something about licensing quarrels).I noticed some people keep arguing that it's 'only' been days/weeks since release, that we cannot expect everything to work right yet, that we should allow them to get feedback and patch things. I regard this a non-argument.Under normal circumstances, with a production from scratch, that argument already makes me grit my teeth. Software/gaming has to be the only industry where consumers not just accept, but even *defend* incomplete and bugged-to-hell product releases. This should not be acceptable, and if consumer rights were anywhere near any other industry, we'd all be eligible for a refund.BUT THIS IS NOT A NEW RELEASE!! They had full access to the original sources. Again: they started with full access to the original source code. They even had the original developers assist them! And even with all that, their release is broken through bugs or intention. They do not get to claim 'needing time to fix inevitable issues' when those issues are in most cases clearly caused by meddling with code that did not need to be touched to begin with.Whether some people may like HW1/HW2 Remastered the way they are is frankly irrelevant to me. I'm sure there's plenty of people that feel Mona Lisa's smile could use a little retouching. It still does not make it right to put a marker to the master piece. If the original developers felt like they didn't get to make their 'definitive' version of Homeworld before, they could've saved that for Homeworld 3, or more likely, a future DLC for Homeworld Remastered.End verdict: A lot of money for shiny graphics and rerecorded sounds packaged with broken functionality, which makes at least this vet go back to the originals.P.S.: for the ones asking about Steam showing my play time increasing - that is me trying out the dozens of mods already coming out trying to restore what Classic/Remastered changed from the originals. Just let that sink in: the community, with limited tools and gimped access to game data, making right what the developers couldn't do with full access to everything.			"

												What is there to say about this game?It's 16 years old, putting some fancy graphics on it literally makes every Space RTS of the past decade run in fear.The Music is top notch, screw your Dubstep and Hipster music, this game has Classic music and you will love it to death (and one rock song in the credits).The Story is intriguing and atmospheric, if you are one for the story part of a game, this will be your Mousse au Chocolat on cheesecake with a cherry on top.The Gameplay is easy to understand, at first it might seem overwhelming, but the learning curve is not too steep.The Graphic has improved, thanks to the Remaster, to a very to-date level with many options to fine tune it to your liking.What you get for 30€ are one of the best RTS (And for me THE best Space RTS) games ever made, plus it's sequel, in a fancy new look while keeping everything that made Homeworld the outstanding game that attracted a huge fanbase 16 years ago, and if you don't want to play the updated graphics, you also get the original classic versions as well!10/10 If you are a Homeworld fan this is a must buy!

												I'll start with the obvious: yes, the remastered graphics and sound are absolutely beautiful. That alone almost makes this a worthy buy. HOWEVER...This is Homeworld 1 re-created in the Homeworld 2 engine, which is actually a major downgrade. There are major differences that make this bad.- They removed the ballistics system. Ship attacks are all random-number generator rolls now.- They removed the ship tactics. You can't select aggressive or evasive tactics anymore.- Formations still exist, but they don't actually work.- Unit pathfinding is pathetic. Ships can get stuck easily.Aside from the 3-dimensional game space, these were the things that made the game unique and exceptional. Without them, Homeworld 1 loses its most important elements, and you end up micromanaging your units instead of leveraging the brilliant ship formation and tactics system.			"

												Hands down, one of the Best RTS Games of All Time.And now that it finally has the ability to not only work properly on Modern Day OS'es, ALONG WITH Updated Gameplay, Remastered Graphics, Improved Multiplayer, etc.... AND the fact that I get both the Classic Versions AND the Remastered Versions of both HW1 & HW2 in one?! Why the hell ANY FAN of this game in the past would turn this game away is just beyond my♥♥♥♥♥♥The fact that we can now fight each other in Multiplayer with all 4 races from both the 1st and 2nd Homeworld Games is just absolutely fantastic. That was something I always wanted to do in the past, and now I can do so without mods! How could I possibly say ""No"" to this game?!However, there are some things to note. A lot of people have been complaining about some of the balance changes specifically regarding Frigates and Capital Ships. Primarily the fact that their HP has been DRASTICALLY nerfed since the originals. And unfortunately, I completely agree. I find this nerf to be very unnecessary and kinda makes capital ships and frigates to be a lot less useful as they used to be. Thankfully, however, there is a fix for this in the workshop.There is a mod called ""Remastered Re-Balanced"" that is available to get in the Steam Workshop that fixes nearly Every Single Problem I have with the Rebalancing Changes that Gearbox made. If you wanna play this game and fix all the problems that are present with the Remastered Versions with Frigates and Captial Ships, along with many other things as well, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND getting that mod. It will make your game 10 times better. You have my assurance on that one.Now with that said, some people are gonna be confused as to why Homeworld: Cataclysm was not included in the Remastered Collection. The reason behind this is because the Original Source Code of Homeworld Cataclysm is currently Missing. The original game developers of Cataclysm are long gone now. But Gearbox has said if anyone has any leads to where that Source Code may be, to report it to them immediately. But honesttly, it could also be said that it might just be easier to re-do the whole game from scratch at this point. But regardless, there's already a mod in the Workshop right now that allows you to play as the Somtaaw in HW2 Remastered. So that's definitely a start. But I still would have loved to play as The Beast again. Hopefully someone will make a mod of that too if Gearbox doesn't remaster Cataclysm.But the bottom line here is this:This Game is a MASTERPIECE. If you love Sci-Fi RTS Games and if you love things like Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Mobile Suit Gundam, etc.... This game will MOST DEFINITELY be something to pick up........What, are you still reading this? GO! Buy this game right now! Stop reading and do it! It's worth every single penny in your wallet that you spend on it! It's a Legendary Spart RTS, for Christ Sake! GO! NOW!			"

												Take yourself back to a simpler time. A happier time. A time when PDAs were cool, people wore really high jeans, and when Homeworld was released.That's right. Take yourself back to September of 1999. I was 7.This was a time when strategy games were designed to be pursued and beaten over the course of weeks or months, a time when game designers weren't afraid to kick you in the balls and tell you that you were terrible at their game, and a time when thousands of Homeworld players ripped their hair out after spending hours harvesting resources only to have their fleet obliterated in one short battle.As a 7-year-old, I did not possess the mental faculties to fully understand the majestic space banana or its purpose as the salvation of a species. I was completely unable to tactically order my fleets through the three dimensional battlefield.  As such, I had no hope of navigating the campaign, but what I could do was build hundreds of space fighters, frigates, capital ships, and carriers, and watch in awe as an epic battle between two armadas unfolded before my very eyes in all its polygonal glory. Many happy hours were spent watching interceptors swerve around capital ships while my ion frigates bombarded them from afar.Oh that magic nostalgia feeling. How welcome it is. Homeworld remastered has taken the elegant design of the original game (something I'm now more equipped to appreciate) and made it more palatable with gorgeous visuals and streamlined interfaces while keeping the incredible atmosphere, mystery, and♥♥♥♥♥poundingly difficult strategy that we all know and love. A million thumbs up.			"

												7/10Essentially Homeworld 1 skins in the Homeworld 2 engine.  If you've never played the original Homeworld, the remastered version is the game for you.  If you have, however, you'll come to realize that Homeworld 2 was a step back in terms of strategy and micromanagement of your fleet.  The formations in the original Homeworld, for example, allowed ships to move in an ACTUAL formation.  In Homeworld 2, these formations break apart as soon as you move in any direction besides forward.  Another thing is ship intelligence.  In the original Homeworld, heavy/multigun corvettes tended to strafe around the target, with their fronts facing the target.  This allowed maximum damage since no gun was obstructed by another.  In Homeworld 2, the ""strafe"" of corvettes is just a circular movment around the target, no fronts facing at all.  This meant that damage output is reduced, since the guns on the opposite sides do nothing.  Oh, and difficulty scaling.  Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ difficuly scaling (Sea of lost souls mission on remastered...like no..just kill yourself).  These three things are the most disappointing aspects of the remastered, in my opinion.  There are a bunch of others I didn't cover but I'm sure somebody has in the reviews of this collection.  All in all, this collection is really just a nostalgic trip down memory lane.  Graphics are top notch and so is the UI.  The original versions of the games are also included (which is freaking awesome).  Get this collection even if you have or haven't played this game.  For the old vets, it's a nostalgic trip and for the new players, its an experience you don't want to miss.			"

												I was bored and waiting for a train one day in August and saw an issue of PC Gamer, a ""100 Greatest PC Games"" special issue. Homeworld Remastered was at spot number 62. I tend to suck at RTS but I added it to my wishlist for later. I impulsively bought it the other day, after games higher in PC Gamer's list didn't quite click with me, and it's shaping up to be one of my best purchases on Steam ever.You play as a race of peoples whose culture and history have been erased, but have managed to preserve a map to their ancestral homeworld. Your attempts to reach the homeworld are resisted by an Empire, with whom your people have had contact thousands of years prior. The story is wonderfully enigmatic, and poignant, and thrilling. There's a curious religious element several stages in, which I also won't spoil. Mission objectives are varied, with unexpected twists and emergency changes of plan when things often go awry. The interfaces are beautiful and clean, and the mechanics of the game are fairly easy to pick up, with a short tutorial that should cover everything you need to know.So yeah.TL;DR -- Doesn't matter if you're not a strategy or RTS buff. Unless you don't like space and are allergic to fun buy this now. P.S. And if you're curious how this game looked in 1999, you have the option to play each of the games in classic mode.P.P.S. Damn Homeworld II is way harder than Homeworld I ;_;			"

												Singleplayer review Homeworld, first released in 1999 and developed by Relic Entertainment, is a science fiction real-time strategy game. This was their first breakout success and was met with critical acclaim and successful sales, which lead to a sequel. In 2015, Gearbox decided it was time Homeworld became accessible to a modern audience. Working with most of the original development team, they painstakingly remastered the two original games. Their time and effort really paid off with this beautiful and lovingly crafted remake.PlotFor a Space RTS one would expect the story to be a bit one-note. Thankfully that isn’t the case with Homeworld, as the story is one of almost movie quality. It begins 100 years in the past. The world you live on is a harsh desert world, with its people split into warring tribes and factions. One day a crashed spaceship is discovered in the desert. Inside this spaceship, a stone table is found. The only two things on it are a map to a planet and the word ""Hiigara"" — home. The discovery of this tablet proves that the people are not as alone in the galaxy as they thought and this unites the factions. Jump forward 100 years and you start the game at the grand launch of the ""Mothership"". Thanks to what was learned from the crashed spaceship, this is the first ship capable of traveling at hyperspeed. What starts of as a routine test of the Mothership’s hyperspeed engine quickly turns into an ambush by an unknown enemy. To say any more about the story would lessen the impact it would have for new players. So the main mission is to overcome many perils and to guide your people to the lost homeworld of ""Hiligara""GameplayHomeworld doesn't really break the RTS mold, as the main focus is still on gathering resources, building a fleet and using it to destroy enemy ships to complete objectives. The one thing Homeworld does differently is the movement of ships. Because Homeworld is set in space, ships can move not only forwards, backwards, left and right, but can also travel upwards and downwards. This adds a whole extra dimension to fighting. You are not limited to a flat plain, but can use height for tactical advantage or even retreat to escape enemies. With this you have two view modes in which to control your fleet: Standard mode, which is the standard view mode with which you can select ships or watch battles or Tactical mode, which gives you extra details on where your ships are heading and gives a much easier representation and understanding on what height your ships are at compared to enemy ships. This mode is mainly used for precise movement of ships through the battlefield.Level and game designThe campaign for Homeworld 1 is broken up into 16 levels, with Homeworld 2 being structured very much the same way. The player starts out with an objective and then must accomplish this objective before they can proceed to the next. In between each level is a voice acted black and white animated cutscene, which acts as narrative progression. While common today, it was a very unique way of telling a story back in the days before 3D rendered cutscenes. The look and feel of the game goes without saying. Anyone, who has played a Relic RTS in the past, can expect the same smooth and responsive unit control and well detailed vehicle models. The game is full of beautiful backdrops of various parts of space, from moons to bright and vibrant suns, they really set the mood and feel of the game. To also accompany that is the amazing soundtrack that just helps add so much atmosphere and wonder to the whole story. The use of orchestral instruments and choirs during the beginning of the game just gives such a sense wonder and vastness, which fits the fact that your people have to travel the vast void of space in search of a home. But as the game goes on the tranquil music turns to strange tense hunting music, drums and alarms to really put you on your toes, knowing that the enemy is everywhere trying to hunt you down. Sci Fis of the time, such as Battlestar Galactica, obviously had a huge influence over the soundtrack.If any complaints have to be made, then it can be said that the movement system can be a bit tricky. Due to the 3D movement of ships, it can take a while to understand and get used to at first, as it isn’t very intuitive. That being said, there's a tutorial at the beginning of the game. Another minor gripe is the steep difficulty curve. Some missions are a walk in the park with others being extremely tough. It does help to make the levels very rewarding to beat though.In conclusion, Homeworld Remastered is a very solid and complete package. This is a perfect example of what a remaster should be, not only including the original unedited non-remastered versions of the games, but also reworking everything from adding a new game engine, re-recording voice lines by the original voice actors and a fully remastered score. Relic has outdone themselves by putting so much love and care into this re-telling of an amazing story. With two games and multiplayer modes for each, Homeworld is sure to keep players occupied for hours on end!			"

												On the positive side: The game is very, very pretty when it works correctly, and it includes the complete untouched originals as a bonus, except they actually work correctly on Windows 7 64-bit from what I'm seeing. Homeworld remains one of the greatest PC games ever made. The uniqueness and originality of Relic's game is still unmatched and it required very little touch-up work to remain breathtakingly beautiful.On the negative side: Homeworld Remastered has many bugs which you will discover rapidly. I certainly did, in my first few minutes of play. The tutorials do not work; the voice instruction speeds by without waiting for you to hit 'ok' to continue, and hitting 'ok' will in fact skip a section of voice. The tutorial in HW1R is in fact for HW2, not HW1; it includes HW2's ships. Achievements do not work; they only unlock when you leave the game, and even then it seems to be a fifty-fifty tossup whether you get ones that you earned in your last play session. The game is highly unstable; I had to uninstall and reinstall it multiple times due to the game entering a state of crashing whenever you did anything at the launcher, and I'm still not sure what's causing the instability. If you have any sort of desktop overlay software running, for example MSI Overdrive, AMD Raptr, Stardock's Windowblinds and Deskscapes, or even apparently the steam overlay(!) you will suffer graphical glitches including transparent ships, broken UI effects and broken HDR effects.I'm keeping the game because I like having a version of HW classic that works on my machine. I wish the remastered edition worked equally as well. Hopefully in the future patches will fix this, at which point I will change my opinion to positive.			"

UPDaTE:the devs have finally decided to update formations, ballistics and AI behaviour.I will thoroughly test it and as those are the major downsides of the Re-release so far I might give the game a recommendation if those issues are gone after the patch!Until HW1 remastered formations are fixed you can't claim that it's an improvement over the original. Formations and stances are the very essence of Homeworld. If you mess this up, you failed. Get this fixed, and the remastered collection will be very close to a recommendation!HW1 classic is (apart from the graphics) still the superior version. This shouldn't be.The Good-graphic engine updates are awesome and it's a joy to look at-succeeds in recreating the original atmosphere-many bugfixes since release, see patch logsThe Bad-still bugs in ship behaviour (some got fixed!, see patch logs)-minor campaign mission design flaws that were not there in the original (lots of fixes here, too)-HW 1+2 races mixed in multiplayer. Pretty much unbalanced, because...(see next chapter)The Ugly-HW2 engine for HW1. This means: squads not working properly, stances broken. Strike craft behave...just wrong. Sphere formation while guarding broken. A nuisance!-refueling for covettes/fighters gone. I did like complexity...oh well.-squishy cap ships-HW1 ship management tuned down in complexity. Many tactics don't work because stances AND formations are broken. See above. So, some flaws will be patched, others may be modded. Until then, don't buy if you're a true fan and conaisseur of the original HW series. I hate to say it, but I'm rather disappointed. Wait until they get their job done!			"

												Please watch this critical review video before buying: 


YouTube™ Video: [HWR] Critical Review of Homeworld Remastered: Why Formations and Tactics Matter 

			Views: 7,722		

			Update: a lot of the changes I suggested in the latter part of the video have actually been implemented into the game in a major update (not to make it sound like I actually influenced that...		

My review. First of all I want to start off with the positives. The game has been beautifully remastered. The graphics are unimaginably improved from the original 1999 release and runs smoothly even on the highest graphics settings. Ive heard though some people have been getting black screens on startup. It is the first release of the remastered collection so some problems like that are expected.Now I have to get a bit Nit-PickyIf you are thinking this is truely Homeworld1 remastered, think again. Many parts of the gameplay have been changed from how they were in the original. For instance fighters no longer require fuel, research costs money, ship count limits have become stricter, etc. These changes are welcomed by some and detested by some. The remastered version also uses Homeworld2's UI. It is cleaner and more modern than that used by HW1 but many argue that it provides a lot of meaningless information and takes away from the more simplistic feel of the original.There are many more bugs in the game than I expected. Formations for strikecraft are completely useless as no matter what tactics you assign to your fighter squadrons they always break formation when engaging enemies. A lot of the original formations and tactics functionality has been destroyed. The AI pathfinding is pretty bizare. I formally sent my findings regarding these bugs to gearbox and they tried to assure me via E-mail that they are working hard on the issues mentioned and are trying to pop out a patch within the month. Not sure it will actually happen but I am happy about gearbox's enthusiam for improving their product.Despite the bugs and sometimes unwelcome changes I still reccomend the collection to anyone. I advise older fans of the game like me to do more research into the changes in the remastered before being completely commited. That being said the collection still includes legal no-cd versions of both original games and is alone worth the money. The remastered versions and revitalized multiplayer are welcome bonuses.= UPDATE =After a long wait formations and tactics have been returned to the game. Now it is so more like the real old thing that it is worth everything to play again. It is once again a great game and I strongly reccomend it. Now that it has proper working formations tactics and ballistics the game is so much better.			"

												A few years ago I began searching for a space RTS. I found a game called Homeworld. Allthough I was unable to play the game due to it not being downloadable and the region I am in. So I played other games and kept Homeworld in the back of my mind. Last week when i noticed it was coming to steam I jumped all over it. After playing Nexas Jupiter Incedent and the Sins series, I was left with a want of more. I wanted Sins openness of the skirmishes and the relaistic feel and look of Nexas. My first hands on with HW was great. I love the viuals and its feels relistic too. The radio chatter is very good as well. The only issue for me is how the campaign is mission based (I would like a big galaxy to build my empire and live amoungst the others) so I tried skirmish. The maps are too small and really result in quick deathmathes in skirmishes. All the while I am still loving the game I just needed it to offer more freedom. So I went looking for the perfect mod. I found Complex mod. Its exactly what I wass looking for and in my opinion makes the game what it should be and to me the best space game out there. Complex has a skirmish map that is 60000 km. Its basiclly a galaxy for you to skirimsh on. But its so big you have to use hyper space to travel long distances making it hard to be found and easy to disapear. If you like space, rts games, and you feel u havnt found that game yet. This game migh just do for you what it has done for me. I suggest using complex mod. It can only be used with classis HW2 for now, but you will not regret it. Remastered is great but with no mods to help me immerse myself into the galaxy, I will stick with HW2 classic for now.My Verdict:Visuals 9/10Sound 10/10Gameplay 10/10Replay Value 9/10Mods 10/109.5/10 without mods10/10 with modsThanks for reading.

												Homeworld 1 and 2 are still the best RTS games out there. They were way ahed of their time when they were released and they are still amazing. Epic tactical battles in 3D enviroment, fantastic music, fantastic ship design. Gearbox made a nice remaster and I can recommend it. I didn't had any problems so far, but it seems some people did so check your recommended configuration before buying it. Atmosphere in this game is also worth mentioning. It's not some dull zerg-rush RTS, it has interesting story (HW1 story better then HW2) and it's definately worth playing. If you're an old player, then you'll want to bring back memories and if you're new, believe me, in all these years I still haven't found better RTS.Mothership is standing by...

												While I'm a big fan of Homeworld franchise and nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself when they've announced a remastered edition, I must say they didn't do a very good job. 1st thing, the most important, is that the ships from the 1st installment (especially fighters and corvettes) behave the same way as in the 2nd game. And this is terrible, since fighters and corvettes work different in both games. Now in Homeworld1 I can't order my corvettes to stay in formation and unleash a wall of destruction upon their targets, instead they are flying around targets, and utilize half their guns at one time to hit the target, instead of all-gun barrage. I can't order my interceptors to stay in X formation and become a serious threat to single targets, instead they disperse and get destroyed by ridiculously accuracy-boosted assault frigates. And navigating in sensors manager is not as good as it was in original games (both of them). I do not reccomend this game, since it destroyed the gameplay mechanics of the first installment of the series.			"

												Oh god, I love this game. Not only does this game have the benefit of the nostalgia that I so deeply cherish, it also has the benefit of a kickass developer pulling the reigns. Gearbox are just good people, they took a well known and beloved classic and wanted to make another game in the series, but before they did that they decided to remaster the original games from the ground up, while preserving the original feel and design to the game.To add to that, they also just optimised the original games, leaving the memories completely intact.It also doesn't hurt that this game is just, ♥♥♥♥ing, beautiful. I just have eye ♥♥♥♥♥♥s whenever I play, it's fantastic.(To enable Theatre mode: Press escape twice, press backspace four times, more games need this feature.)I can't recommend this game enough, if you are looking for an intense Space RTS experience that kicks you in the balls during the story and in gameplay, then this is for you.Please, for the love of all things RTS and classic, buy this game, show big companies that a faithful remaster is all what the fans are looking for, teach AAA developers to do more things like this, to not♥♥♥♥♥♥on beloved franchises just for the sake of a money grab, to be good people.Buy this game, you won't regret it.

												This review assumes you've already played Homeworld 1 or 2 before.tl;dr If you were hoping for a faithful and direct Homeworld 1 port - I'm sorry. You aren't getting it. This is Homeworld 2 with Homeworld 1 assets dropped in. Almost all HW1 related gameplay mechanics that made the game stand out, are gone.Pros:Upgraded graphics and UI; better multiplayer options (Relics, objectives, tech level, etc.), higher quality audio. Some under the hood changes to make HW2 mods easier to port and give modders some more tools. In the end, there's not really much to say on the pro side. We already know that both games are pretty good. Quality storyline (though the second game doesn't follow through like the first does) good art design, detailing, etc. If you've played the game before, you know all that. As such, most of this is...Cons:Most gameplay elements from Homeworld 1 have been completely stripped away to shoehorn it into Homeworld 2's engine: Ships do not stick to formation during attack runs; missile destroyers output a constant stream of missiles instead of a short high-dps alpha strike; Support frigates are essentially useless - they no longer repair larger ships, and with the removal of fuel requirements, strikecraft no longer dock and repair automatically at them; you can no longer exceed fleet limits with salvage in HW1- probably one of the most-liked defining 'bugs' of the game; multiplayer requires a 3rd-party DRM/sign-up to play; there is no way to disable mouse acceleration/smoothing or change mouse sensitivity; on multi-monitor setups panning is frustrating because the mouse isn't captured to the screen; UI elements come in four sizes: Big, really big, humongous, and jesus christ it's huge; multiplayer is in an unfinished beta state.I bought this game specifically for Homeworld 1 multiplayer - the original is no longer playable because it relied on a 3rd-party system called Gamespy. This remastered version of the game now ALSO relies on a 3rd-party system/DRM check called Shift, so who even knows how long multiplayer will be available. Certainly not nearly a decade like the original Homeworld 2.The rub is this:If you are like me, and you wanted to play Homeworld 1 like it was, in singleplayer or multiplayer; skip it. This is Homeworld 2 with Homeworld 1 ships in it, repackaged and resold. Modders have already done this with Homeworld 2. None of Homeworld 1's game mechanics made it into this ""remaster"".If you are only interested in Homeworld 1 or 2 with an updated coat of paint, and don't care for Homeworld 1's game mechanics, then it's worth a buy after a price drop. (As of writing, the game is nearly $40).Frankly, this game is an insult to Homeworld 1 fans. I can't say I'm surprised that the dev team took the easy way and just dropped HW1 assets into HW2 without doing anything to actually make them work - we're talking Gearbox here. I should've known better than to put money down with them at the helm.-----That said, most Homeworld fans have only played the second game, so in terms of mass appeal, this game still works. A lot of people are excited about their favourite Homeworld 2 mods - Complex, etc. being ported, and these people will likely be quite happy with the game. If you're a Homeworld 1 fan though, you got shafted.			"

												I don't think that ""remastered"" means what Gearbox thinks it means. While the game has had a significant face-lift bringing the graphic detail of the units and surrounding space to current resolutions. The major drawback is that they didn't really remaster many of the controls or flesh out some much-needed tactical options like ""don't deliberately crash into asteroids"" or ""hey, guys everyone come here… except you, go chase that guy and die!"". A lot of the UI feels a sloppy instead of being tightly bolted down and intuitive and much of what you didn't like about the original is still there in large parts. In a few cases it's made worse with widely variable strafing that will make you question whether your frigate captains are actually cats high on catnip. The graphics are fantastic, but the game is largely unchanged and not improved upon where it was sorely needed. As an unnecessary bonus, I can make the menu UI take up 90% of the screen.			"

												Homeworld is possibly one of my favorite space games in terms of game mechanics, music and visual art style this game does a fantastic job at it. Especially now that it's remastered. Not only does this game offer the remastered first and second game. But also the classic versions as well!I won't spoil the story in this review. Simply because it needs to be played. The only thing I can say bad about this game is persistent bugs. (Yes, you read that line correctly) for instance some mission triggers don't happen right away or not at all forcing players to reload an autosave or outright starting the mission all over again. But as everything else stands? This game is playable.Also there is an active modding community bringing intersting mods to the game. The tutorial is really straight forward so you won't get lost at the controls. Now the missions themselves, while some of them are straight forward. Other missions can be a pain in the butt. You will have to micro-manage your resources in order to survive some of these encounters as it can go from ""All quiet"" to ""IT'S A TRAP"" in a matter of minutes or seconds. Overall if you like space battles on an almost epic grand scale. Then I recommend the Homeworld Remasted Collection.			"

												Homeworld Remastered was released in February of 2015. In spite of being a Homeworld fan, I decided to wait for the reviews; and I was glad that I did. While the game was not short of impressing people for its new visual enhancements + the merging of both games units and assets for a unified game, the developers neglected some very important details on the game that we all love. The formations in Homeworld Remastered were screwed up. In the Original Homeworld, people remember the fact that formations assigned to groups of units actually impacted their ability to effectively and efficiently dispose enemies. As explained in details by one of the reviewers: that whole aspect was stripped away as a different method for damage calculation was done on ship to ship combat. The problem was, individual ships didn't feel individual anymore, the formations did not chew up hostile ships like they were supposed to; and that right there frusterated me, which believe it or not: deterred me from buying this game. It was only over a year after in the fine month of June 2016, that the game developers decided to release a patch which RESTORED this crucial gameplay aspect. The formations are back and are effective again! The only complaint is you can't make larger formations (large spheres would be nice). Two hours into the game, I have been satisfied with my conclusion that the game is now fixed, and the good old mechanics have returned! Coupled with the new visuals, multiplayer support, mod support and Homeworld 1 and 2 content merge; I would say this is a rather spectacular title that is worth grabbing. The 2.0 patch really did it a good number, and even though I have my doubts about Gearbox; I am honestly surprised. If you like Space RTS games with 3-dimensional movement, formations, tactics and fleet battles; I highly recommend this game. Originally made by Relic; Homeworld was and still is a one of a kind RTS game to me. Pros:+Unit formations work.+Content merge of HW1 and HW2 for interesting battles.+Very nice visuals.+Multiplayer support.+Mod support.+Modern OS support.+Everything that made Homeworld great. Cons:-There is no way to save custom paint schemes, preview for ships allows no rotation for viewing models.Overall: This game is worth it now, kudos to a company for listening to its critics and fixing something, rather than ignoring them altogether. There may be hope for gaming.  "

												Homeworld is one of the best space RTS games ever created. Slower paced than modern frenzy RTS games, Homeworld lets the vast quiet of space sink in as an amazing soundtrack acompanies your journey. The story is top notch and the voyage  hits all the right emotional notes. The remastered version looks amazing and holds its own against all of the modern RTS juggernauts. Purists will also be happy to know that the original Homeworld 1 & 2 come packaged with this version as well. If you have never experienced Homeworld or are an avid space/rts fan, you would be remiss to not play this game.			"

												As someone who skipped the original series I would definitely recommend this game! Music, arts, voice acting are working together to create amazing atmosphere. I'm not sure I've experienced anything like this before. Campaign is interesting, can't say it brings something unexpected but it's decent. Just finished Homeworld 1 and looking forward to play Homeworld 2.Graphics looks good. Good effects, loots of options. Can't say that it's optimized well though.Can't say anything about multiplayer, I'm not really interested in it.Bugs: don't be fooled, it has some. One crash, one uncompletable mission and few minor bugs in controls and behaviour of units, but overall it's ok. And they fixing it, in particular that mission was fixed the day I've encountered it. :)In general it's one of the best games I've played in a long time, definitly the best in this year so far!			"

												In a word, dissapointed.If you are looking for remastered HW1 do not buy this game in its current state.  If you are looking for remastered HW2 you will enjoy it.  The remaster is HW1 ported into a tweaked HW2 engine.  The HW2 engine has limitations that break or substantially change core mechanics for HW1.The Good:-Looks fantastic.  Manages to update ship models and graphics while keeping the feel and asthetics of the orginal-Its pretty-It really does look niceThe Bad:-Formations (one of the best and most important mechanics in the game) are flat out  broken in HW1  (HW2 limitation)-No bullet ballistics, hits are determined by RNG (HW2 limitation)-No Evasive mode for units-No fuel for fighters (Probably a HW2 limitation)-Good number of crash bugs, sound bugs, and gameplay bugs of varying seriousnessHopefully formations will be patched but the cause is a HW2 engine limitation so dont hold your breath. All this really needed was a new paint job but unfortunately core gameplay was lost in the process.  Currently this is a dissapointment and I wish I could get my money back.			"

												When Gearbox ""remastered"" it they screwed it up. It seems that they belong to the ""only multiplayer matters; wreck singleplayer at will"" mindset; as a result, while skirmish and multiplayer works quite well, the HW1 single player campaign is badly messed up by their methods for combining HW1 and HW2 into a single multiplayer environment.From the start you're plagued with insufficient resources to build enough ships. You're almost guaranteed to fail the second mission, unless you know the trick: while Heavy Corvettes have been badly screwed up, salvage corvettes now steal anything bigger than a fighter. So you go from, ""Wtf? 3 Interceptors just wiped out 5 Heavy Corvettes?"" to ""Wow, if I have interceptors and salvage corvettes, I can steal EVERYTHING.""So the game goes in a flash from stupidly, head-bangingly messed up to OP'd and too easy, and has been transformed into a pirate game. Also, the option to play the campaign through as Taiidan has been, frustratingly, removed.Needs a LOT of work. NOT recommended in present form.			"

												Note: This review was originally written prior to the 2.0 rebalance patch.  While the 2.0 patch gets the game to much better state, the original version of Homeworld 1 still remains better playing than the Remastered version; I have to stand by my thumbs down.---Homeworld 1 is in my opinion the far better of the two games and is unfortunately not well maintained in the Remastered version.Homeworld 1 was a game of relatively slow naval battles.  There was time to plan meaningful maneuvers, and the game has a certain grace many other RTSes lack as a result.  Carefully managing the units you had was in many ways more important than simply building a large number of units or even always matching units against their appropriate counter-units in fights.Homeworld 2 was headed by a new lead designer who decided to throw out most of what made HW1 feel unique and just make a Starcraft clone.  Rock-paper-scissors balance taken to extremes; huge fleets that could be wiped out in seconds; a game won more by clicks-per-second and sheer numbers than strategy.  It lost much of its grace and was a massive disappointment for me.  On top of that, another of its problems was a very poorly implemented dynamic difficulty system that scaled the number of enemies you'd face on some missions based on your fleet size and resources at the start of the mission.  On paper it's an ok idea, but in practice it punishes you for keeping your fleet alive and wasn't well tested or balanced so that sometimes you would face an unreasonable number of enemies.Homeworld Remastered puts the first game in the second's engine, and it is unfortunately rebalanced to be more like the second - complete with poorly implemented dynamic difficulty scaling.  Version 1.0 was nearly unplayable due to the balance being so bad.  The 2.0 patch pushes balance a bit closer back to true Homeworld 1 and reigns in the unreasonable difficulty scaling, but it still doesn't feel right.  Fleets that were viable with careful management in the original game still get wiped out too quickly.  Strike craft aren't as effective as they should be.  Plus there are AI problems with the units not engaging enemies the way they should.This isn't just a matter of me wanting the game to exactly duplicate Homeworld 1 due to nostalgia goggles.  I replayed the original recently and I still think it's a better balanced, more entertaining game than the compromised version of it they crammed into the Remastered engine. It's an incredible shame because the updated graphics of the Remastered version are great. I'll grant that building essentially two Remastered versions from scratch (one based on HW1's engine and another based on HW2) would be a bit too much to ask, and I'm thankful that they included the original versions in this package.  However, given that the Remastered version is a fairly big departure from the original, it is disappointing that they couldn't then do a very bare minimum of work to make the original versions more easily playable on modern systems.  Specifically, it's always been possible to configure HW1 to run in modern widescreen resolutions but it requires a registry edit to do so - not too hard for a savvy user, but still annoying.  Would it really have been that hard for them to do minimal things like update the options menu to be able to directly select modern resolutions?			"

												An excellent remake of an excellent game. The games hold up extremely well, even though the games are 16 and 12 years old. The devs reworked everything from the ground up as opposed to improving some textures like in most HD remakes. I finished the first campaign and played a few skirmish games and haven't encountered any bugs. The multiplayer is still in beta at this time since they are letting all the factions across both games play against each other, and things aren't balanced yet. There is a new UI and controls, mostly revamping the HW1 controls to make them more like HW2, and getting rid of refeuling for strikecraft in HW1. Ignore people that are complaining about this because it makes HW1 10x more playable. On the down side the formations from HW1, that were crucial to using strike craft don't work in the remastered version. Hopefully this will be fixed in a patch, but if you want a faithful HW1 experience the set includes both HW1 and 2 in their original untouched forms. Also I believe the campaign has gotten easier. I can't verify if this is because the game is simply easier or because I have played so much of it over the years.HW has a slower pace, so if you prefer 5 minute multiplayer matches HW might not be fore you. The story is very good, a rarity for a RTS, also the soundtrack and art is also amazing. The HW franchise was so ahead of its time that it is still innovative more than a decade on. No space based RTS has ever come close to besting it. The modding community has been active for the past 2 years for HW2 specifically, so you can expect a lot of mods comming out shortly. I wouldn't be surpirsed if HW: Remastered won many RTS of the year awards, like it did when it came out years ago. These games are a must play if you like RTSs or space based games.			"

												First of all: This is a wonderful thing. If you have not played this game before and like RTS Games, ignore anything I type below and just get the game. You will like it, especially the single player story. The name of the game is Remastered. Sadly, due to the use of the Homeworld 2.5 Engine, Homeworld 1 suffers. This may get fixed in later patches and does certainly not take away any from the remarkable experience. It will just be different as to how you remember it. This is however worth your time.			"

It has the Advanced UI from Homeworld two and any otherimprovement for a today worth Game. It has a well done and long Story with the Original Actors including Heidi Ernest for Homeworld 2 Remastered, also it features well done fights against theCPU what offers a good challenge. Multiplayer is at the moment in its Beta phase because itneeds balancing and it will get opened shortly.I only can recommend this Game, you get four Games Remastered and Classic for a fair price.It is one of the best RTS Games of all time updated to the actual Standards and offering a great amount of fun.

												HomeWorld Games are hands down one of my Favorite RTS Titles  Next to Warcraft Games.  This was Really the first game to do space battles Correctly and my opinion the only one to do it correctly. I Nearly Played 200 hundred hours on the Original disk version.  So much in Fact i Warn the disk out Two times.  How you might ask well after playing the original campaign and playing the multiplayer and VS AI to death.  I wanted to see if the game had any mods so i looked up it moddb page and i was surprised to see it had one of my favorite TV show BSG as a mod and looking at that i Downloaded that Right there and started to play that into the ground.  im a big sci fi fan and this games Fan are nuts.  You like Star wars theres a star wars mod.  You like halo they got halo mod.  Pretty much got anything you can dream of on there.  But now that it has Been Remastered i cant wait to see what happens next.  Buy This Game Because it Offers More Play time than your average game Plus the Base game it Fantastic too.			"

												Homeworld 1 made history when it was released many years ago. Being the first 3D space combat real time strategy game. No one has ever made space game other then FPS or Turn base strategy until homeworld. Everyone loved this game and I brought original homeworld classic as soon as I heard about it. I remember there were alot bugs and salvage corvette was way too over powered. It was one of the first good game I got on PC. Homeworld 2 released several year later but I didn't get chance to try it until now.Frankly I really think this is one of the best digital Remasering of an old game ever. It brings back all the joy and intensity I had from many years ago. Great new graphics, Great new Sound tracks, Awesome story scripting, breath taken ingame-cinamatic and execellent replay value now it's got multiplayer. And Yes.. After soo soo many years. IT's still the best Space RTS Strategy ever made from my honest oponion.9.5/10 for a well done remastering of a Legendary space game. A true space game fan must not miss this game!			"

I still like Homeworld and this is STILL fun.They NEED to give the lan play back to this game so you can still do lan partys.anywho good Homeworld 2 pack to have.IF your a Purest then I don't recommend this game for you, BUT if your someone that likes homeworld and mod it or likes  Big space battles this is a good game still.""Show them no mercy!""=Hiigaran scout			"

I have fond memories of going to LAN centres, amassing armadas of Battlecruisers and using their Hyperdrives to warp to and destroy my friend's Pride of Hiigara.Game works well. Just like I remember it being back in the day. Having the whole 3D space as your battlefield just gives the game a greater sense of scale and epicness to your battles.10/10			"

												To start, I played all of the games in the homeworld series for many years. I have been waiting for this reboot since it was announced. I think they did a great job on the textures/models for the reboot, but there are an absurd amount of bugs in this remaster. PLEASE make sure you support your product by releasing patches fixing all these issues. Some of the bugs I've run into, when you build the research vessel it warps in at random locations instead of coming out of the mothership. My harvesters will just stop as soon as they finish all close RU clouds. The resources take waaaay longer to harvest then they used to? I've increased the multiplier and it's just awful how long it takes to gather enough RUs to play the game. There was something lost there in translation. I wasn't able to move my newly constructed probe in the tactical map but when I zoomed in I was able to move it. In short, I recommend this game, but I really feel like gearbox let us down and I really hope you guys fix the errors you put in this masterpiece. PLEASE SUPPORT YOUR GAME AND FIX IT!!!			"

Since the patch 2.0, the last awaited feature (efficient formations) is here, and you have the most beautiful, strategic, and immersive RTS I've played since ... forever (I'm 40).StorylineThe storyline is epic, even though the HW2 one is less interesting than in HW1, you'll enjoy doing it from start to end.Is it required to clear HW Deserts of Kharak before ? No.Is it interesting to clear DoK for the story ? Yes, but not mandatory to fully enjoy HWR story. DoK was released (2016) long after HW1 (1999) and HW2 (2003), even HWR (2015).MultiplayerI didn't play multiplayer at all (yet ?) but for the solo part, it is fully worth it.I know there's a lot of popular mods for multiplayer, and Gearbox worked his♥♥♥♥♥off to make everything possible for modders.I hope you'll love this game as much as I do, it deserves it.

												""Homeworld Remastered Collection"" is a great buy if you're looking for the definitive edition of ""Homeworld 2."" Unfortunately, its predecessor's campaign and gameplay leave much to be desired. I've yet to finish the remastered campaign of the original ""Homeworld,"" but I believe I've played enough to notice the various nuances that strengthen and diminish the product.While the reconstruction of the original game in the ""HW 2"" engine brings some welcome additons, like panning, strike groups and better visuals, it also introduces some new problems. Instead of listing them all out ad nauseum, let me just say this: The differences in the remastered edition of ""HW 1"" are likely to irk a good majority of classic fans.Regardless, there is some great potential in this product, and it is still the great set of games you remember. I can see some enterprising modders fixing a lot of the issues that many players are complaining about. As of 3/2/15, I would suggest waiting several months or even a year before purchasing this game.			"

												The enemy sent Destroyers at me. I sent a crack team of foul-mouthed experts in Salvage Corvettes to subdue the capital ships, yelling at them over the comms as they jam them sideways into my mothership. I am now the proud owner of a Destroyer and a Carrier. On mission five.The game looks fantastic and the UI is very smooth and an improvement over the old interface. This is just from my experience of playing the Homeworld 1 campaign.If you've never heard of/played Homeworld in any way shape or form then consider this a hearty recommendation for a game that doesn't hold your hand. You're given objectives to complete and you decide how to do them. ""Destroy the enemy fleet and take out their resource operation!"" Or if you're feeling fancy, capture them.Graphics options are varied and versatile so you can probably run this on a toaster. Better yet crank it all up, attack move into the enemy fleet and watch all the pretty lights and explosions. Trust me when I say that Gearbox has shown a lot of care to this franchise and really with the market for RTS games being basically 'Starcraft 2' and not really much else you owe it to the genre to buy this game and experience the joy that is Homeworld.I feel like I've gone on and not really gotten my point across so...TL;DRes good gyme gud grafic gud remasta ver prett			"

												There are very few if any RTS's that stand the test of time like Homeworld does. The work that Gearbox have done to this timeless masterpiece is fantastic the graphics have been updated beautifully, the control system still feels the same 95% of the time there is the odd glitches here and there with certain fleet formations and occasionally having to redo a mission due to an event not triggering. But considering they’ve been working with code that is roughly 15 years old I can forgive all that. The missions are still challenging as ever, which seems to be lacking these days with quite a few AAA titles. Gearbox had a lot to live up to with this and from what I’ve read they’ve done the most intelligent thing any company can do with reviving a franchise they engaged with the community continually and took on board their comments and suggestions and still post release.

												HW vet says something different, still disapointedLong post get readyI played the games when they first came out of course... im 31 and was just a young kid at the time. The game was the greatest of its time as so many have pointed out. The Ui at the time was revolutionary, and so many games have tried to reproduce it but failed.The many great points of this game is what kept many playing and playing again. And for good reason, it has stood the test of time with the greats like the starcraft/warcraft series, age of empire series, and command & conquer seriesFirst some changes that I like...Fuel for fighters (except for the fact that ai fighters never had the fuel restrictions)and thats itThe ""Reboot (because it is not a remasted edition in my eyes) Edition"" is a complete farce because...--There are no more tactical fleet setups- no need for interceptors now that you can build bombers- no need for assault frigates, you have access to drone frigates- no need for frigates at all cause you can build destroyersThe original game had this, if you had a fleet of assault frigates you were gonna die to a swarm of fighters. why was this changed? It is intuitavly a tactical desicion thats missing--Formations no longer matterAgain so many have said this before but so many new players do not realize why they were so integral to the game. or understand why people complain about them-a wall formation would attempt to hold that formation as they attack while retreating-an x or claw formation would hold that formation while strafing-a sphere formation would attempt to guard the strongest ships at their center while attackingAs it is now every formation devolves into chaos at the first sign of enemy contactAlso The 3d management of the map no longer matters (or exists)As stated in even the first mission of Hw 1 you can do more damage on capital ships from below, above, or behind... Without the cohesive formations we had before this is a non-factor now because once they engage its a free for allCampaign Difficulty ScalingThis was something else way ahead of its time, instead of a difficulty slider the campaign progressed based on how good you were doing... the original did this well by placing a few more corvettes or frigates in at innopportune times.The new version just slams em in there.""oh you played smart and made 5 interceptors on mission 1?""""im gonna destroy your world and put in 20 light corvettes before the mission starts""or""you had just a mothership? oh you must be a noob, there will be no fighters to defend the carrier on day 2 ever i dont care how many you produce there will never be defenses for me cause you are such a noob""Test this one for yourselfIt is my hope that every new player to the franchise finds this post helpful as to why those veterans of the franchise fine this game so frustrating and disapointing.I know a lot of balance changes were made for the players of hw1 and hw2 multiplayer but that should never have been done, let the players choose which game they want to play multiplayer and balance accordingly dont intermingle that bull.

												You will be hard-pressed to find a game that is both deeply challenging and provides a narrative that makes each loss you take feel like a personal failure. The game does not hold your hand, and you are *forced* to think about each strategic decision you make.The remastered editions are beaufitul, exquisitely detailed and worth a few multiplayer matches lost due to gawking at the battles. While there are some significant day-1 bugs, GBX and BBI have promised support and the community is heavily involved in scouring the game for any and all necessary improvements.The classic versions are just as I remember, and they no longer require edits to command line options or registry content to get them to run correctly.Buy this game.

												The Homeworld games are both timeless classics, and one of the greatest tragedies in Gaming history is the fact that despite their success, no other developer ever attempted to emulate their particular, iconic style.These games are gorgeous. Their stories are enthralling. The gameplay--a tangible joy. Granted, the strategic aspects are a bit simplistic, but the sheer polish and intuitiveness and fun more than makes up for any percieved lack of depth.This remaster collection updates the visuals to look just as good today as the original games looked in our memories. So good, in fact, that they put many modern games to shame.Homeworld and Homeworld 2 are both All-Time Classics. This is an absolute must-buy for any gamer.			"

												Review in short: Awesome. If you have never played and are thinking of buying it, start with HW 2.I never played the original Homeworld, but I am a big fan of Homeworld 2. It still is one of my absolute favorite games. As you can imagne, I was rather thrilled. I still am thrilled as I play through HW 1. I have read several complaints that HW 1 Remastered has become too HW 2. How do i feel about this? Meh, never played the original. Only played 2. So I think its great. I loved homeworld 2 and have no problem with the remastered game.Multiplayer/vs cpu is a different story. Its beta so there is a bit of grace there. Some maps have next to no resources. Must have been HW 1 maps, Thats my biggest complaint. On the right maps it is a ton of fun. Love having relics as the center of some epic space battles. My inner 12 year old is happy. Can't wait for some sick new mods. I hope they flesh out some of the other factions that you encounter in the games.			"

												'Homeworld Remasted Collection' is a package that includes the remastered version of Homeworld, a game from 1999, as well as the remastered version of Homeworld 2, that was released in 2003. Additionally the package includes the classic version of both games. Although Homeworld and Homeworld 2 are both very similar real-time strategy games, they both play and feel very different. The discovery of an ancient stone plate showing an engraved course through the galaxy, triggers your people on a journey through space to find your original home world. As expected this journey comes with many obstacles and as commander of fleet it is your task to overcome them. In other words, you have to fight. Think of Battlestar Galactica and you get the idea.The concept of the game is really cool and takes you on an intense science fiction journey that feels very unique. Every hyper-jump brings you to a new level in the game. Your remaining fleet arrives centred around your mother-ship. The mother-ship is capable of constructing all kind of different ships. Frigates, cruisers, corvettes, fighters or destroyers, you name it. Additionally you can research new technologies to upgrade your equipment. In order to build new ships you need to collect resources. Resources can be found in asteroid fields and shipwrecks.As for Homeworld 1 most levels are slow paced. Most of the time you are not attacked unless you engage the enemy. This allows you to take your time, which is a wonderful thing. You can drink a cup of tea or relax with a glass of whisky, harvest nearby resources, explore your surroundings and plan your strategy. In this way Homeworld 1 almost feels like a game of chess.Homeworld 2 is the complete opposite. In Homeworld 2 you are constantly put under pressure by never-ending scripting events that force you to permanently fight for survival. Additionally the amount of enemies seems endless at times because the developers implemented a variable AI that automatically adjusts to your fleet size and makes sure it's stronger than yours. The relaxing atmosphere from Homeworld 1 is diminished to a few isolated occasions in Homeworld 2, which makes both games two very different experiences.Both games are generally considered to be hard games. And while I really had to struggle with some levels in Homeworld 1 I was always able to manage them by re-trying one way or the other. This is not necessarily the case for Homeworld 2. The achievement statistic on Steams shop page shows that many players gave up on Homeworld 2. This impression is mirrored in the forums. Homeworld 2 is an extremely difficult game and can be very frustrating at times.Pros: (both games)- beautiful graphics, still not like games from today but considering the age of the games the developers did a great job- tutorials- good keyboard interface- very good music- good voice acting, well designed ship communications- option to manually save at any time, very important!- addictive, after failing to complete a level I went to bed and woke up at three o'clock at night, re-tried and made it :-)- interesting story- very good cutscenes with regard to contentsPros: (Homeworld 1)- relaxing, great atmosphere- difficulty is well balanced, rather easy in the beginning and pretty hard in the end (but still not as hard as every single level in Homeworld 2)- freedom to self-initiate the hyper-jump to the next levelPros: (Homeworld 2)- resource collectors and repair ships are now combined in one unit- more ship upgrade options- Cons: (both games)- games come without manual. Thankfully players provided links to the manuals in the forums that left me with four documents of 173 pages, nice- if you end up finishing a level with a remaining fleet that is unfit to beat the next level you need to replay the last level to make sure your remaining fleet is prepared for the upcoming challenge- one achievement asks you to play the tutorial of the classic game. Unfortunately this is not possible because the classic version keeps crashing. Forums are full of players with this problem. Adding this kind of achievement was a really dumb move from the devs.- Cons: (Homeworld 1)- last level seemed a little to hard- Cons: (Homeworld 2) - stressful most of the time- can be frustrating at times- too difficult- if your last main objective has been completed the game automatically hyper-jumps into the next level. This can be a huge problem if your fleet is diminished after a lengthy fight and you jump right into the next fight. In order to prepare your fleet before jumping you have to wait before completing the final main objective- salvage corvettes make no more sense because they have become far to expensive to justify the risk- maximum number of ships in a group is restricted. In Homeworld 1 you can exceed the maximum number by capturing enemy ships.- stuttering cutscenesAll in all I really enjoyed both games. They offer a very unique atmosphere. I don't know any other game with a similar mood. Homeworld 1 deserves a 100% recommendation while Homeworld 2 deserves a recommendation for the hard core fans but probably not for everybody.			"

												While it's great to have Homeworld looked at again, especially as games like No One Lives Forever fades into being forgotten as a result of publishers not giving a ****, Homeworld Remastered Collection boasts some impressive visual updates at the cost of some of the gameplay mechanics that made the predecessors what they were.The best part happens to be the visual updates involved with Homeworld 1's remastering. It's absolutely stunning, texture detail beautiful. For Homeworld 1, this comparison is outsdanding, but for Homeworld 2 the improvements aren't as radical due to the game still being in the same engine. That's not to say that both aren't improved, but it's much more significant for the original.Some of the audio has been re-recorded and while it sounds alright there are portions where old (albeit not as compressed) samples are used. This makes it sound jarring since the same settings aren't used between both recording as well as the actor's ages have dramatically changed since the original releases. For Homeworld 1, it's nice to not hear as much compression on things, giving better clarity.The biggest problem with Homeworld 1's remaster is that old tactics aren't working. Formations are fundementally broken, shedding the fact that these fights are in space and momentum is a thing, instead going for a jet-fighter approach. The problem is that makes guard orders useless as you might assign a sphere formation around a target with guard orders, but as soon as enemies get within range, your ships break off and take forever to get shots on target.The good news is that having the Classic version is great, but while the Classic version does run, it does have problems with multi-monitor systems.

												FantasticIs it a perfect remake? No. Some of the mechanics in HW1 in particular have been removed, and make certain missions that were monstrously difficult (at least when I was young) rather easy - like Gardens of Kadesh. The removal of strike craft fuel and the change in formation tactics makes it a very different level. There are also some bugs here and there like you'd expect from any new release. None of them I encountered were game-breaking.What surprised me is that nostalgia didn't cloud my recollection of this series. These games are truly incredible, and unlike any other game you'll experience. They require patience and deliberation that many games now have done away with, but it is every bit as rewarding as I recall. A millenia-spanning story, gorgeous visuals done the justice they deserve, and demanding, yet oddly relaxing gameplay married to one of the most unique UI's in all of gaming. Thank you Gearbox. I had considered this series lost in IP limbo until the THQ auction, and now a new generation can appreciate a flawed, astounding masterpiece along with its excellent sequel. TLDR: If you haven't played Homeworld and you like the RTS genre, buy it. You're in for something truly special. These remakes are awesome, and if you don't like the changes made, enjoy the originals in all their glory.			"

												It has some small improvements from the original, but all the improvements seem very worthwhile.Firstly the question that needs to be answered: Has the original game miantained its great gameplay?Yes, it has. It is as good as it once was.Secondly: If I own the original is it worth getting the new versions?Probably not. Sure the graphics are better, and there are some UI improvements, but oveall the gameplay is not improved. If you care about graphics then upgrade, if not then stick with originals.Thirdly: Why should I get it when i can get the originals for a few bucks?Becasue by buying it you prove that such an awesome game deserves developers to be rewarded. Homeworld remains one of the most unique and awesome strategy games. Show how much you love it by buying it.			"

Posted: March 11, 2015
												Disclaimer: I'm assuming a long-standing familiarity with the Homeworld series here, for anyone who reads this.I'm very torn on this game. On one hand, I am a long-time fan of the Homeworld series of games. From the moment I'd played the original HW demo prior to the game's release, I was in love with the game. So much that over the years I've wound up with several copies of it so I could play with friends who didn't have their own at the time.Fast forward past Homeworld: Cataclysm (since it's not in this collection), to Homeworld 2. I was still quite happy with the game, although I was not so impressed with the new game engine. Also, I was quite confused with some of the continuity errors introduced into the units. Why were capital ships no longer capable of jumping themselves, with the exception of ships that could build the hyperspace module? In HW 1, all frigates and up were jump-capable without support. Why were formations and tactics effectively non-existant? They played such a huge role in carrying out a successful combat action in the original. The list goes on.So, here we are today, with the Homeworld Remastered Collection. As a lover of the series, I'm thrilled with its existence. From a collector's standpoint, this is a wonderful addition to the Homeworld Universe. It preserves the story and music from the original versions, and does indeed do a very nice job of updating the appearance of the setting.Now, the gripes...First off, they made subtle modifications to the classic version of Homeworld included in the collection. There is a queue-limit, restricting how many active build queues per mothership and carrier. Want to queue a whole mixed corvette wing at once? Nope, you can only build 2 types at once, regardless of how many of each. This continues on through to capitals ships. Also, they removed all capablity for multiplayer. There isn't even a LAN option. If LAN was still an option, through some network trickery people could still play multiplayer, even if there was no ability to just find and hop into a game like before the multiplayer lobby finally was shut down.Regarding the multiplayer side of things in general, I've only tried one game over the beta system (well, beta as of this writing, anyway), and I was unimpressed. About 15 minutes in, just as my teammate and I finished fending off an initial assault from the other players (6 went in via lobby, 4 of us wound up in game), the game just up&closes on me. No error, no crash message, nothing. Just back to my desktop.Now, onto my gripes with the ""Remastered"" version of Homeworld 1. In short, it's just a mod for the original Homeworld 2 engine (as ""improved"" for the remastered version of HW2). Unit caps, insanely-decreased hangar capacity on the mothership, a queue that can only build 2 or 3 different things at a time per production ship, RUs required for research (and no parallel researching anymore, just one tech at a time no matter how many sections you build for the research ship), and otherwise the same failings of the Homeworld 2 engine that the original HW2 suffered from. Namely the joke they called tactics and formations. And the same, clunky&screen cluttering interface (I loved the simplicity of the original HW's interface, it let me spend more time dealing with events in the gameplay, rather than trying to wrestle with which panel or convoluted ""shortcut"" I needed).As it stands now (and any patches/updates aside, will ultimately probably remain so), I really can't recommend the game collection. I really only bought it for the inclusion of ""Homeworld Classic,"" and while mostly happy with that part of the collection, I still have some complaints about the changes made to the game.Only get this if you have a similar love of the franchise as I do, otherwise you should save your money and look for something else to scratch your space RTS itch.

												It's almost as if they said to themselves, ""Let's make homeworld look twice as good, but play half as well"".I can't say much about homeworld 2: remastered since I haven't played the original too many times  but homeworld 1: remastered is a tragic disappointment when compared to the original. I wish I'd read the reviews before buying. It's baffling that they haven't ironed out such major bugs in such a long time.Bottom Line: I can't recommend this game to new comers with all of the broken elements that made the original so good. You will be left wondering what all the fuss is about with such a mediocre game.I definitely can't recommend this game to veterans who've already tasted the goodness of the original. You will go 'Wow' when you see the graphics on level 1, and then you'll be mounting frustration as you discover one broken feature after the other.Details:- Formations: Don't work. Ships break formation as soon as they engage enemies which defeats the purpose entirely. Battles are basically a free for all. This occurs in hw2 as well.- Tactics: Don't work. There is no discernible difference between the 3 tactics. The buttons are just eye/ear candy.- Tactical map: Homeworld 1 allowed you to specify a 'move to' point, then hold the shift key to lock that point while panning with rmb to adjust elevation. This is no longer possible, and you have to specify both the 'move to' location and the elevation from a single angle. Not possible, not impressed. Also applies to hw2.- Salvaging: It's nice that they've made it possible to salvage those standard and missle corvettes in the early missions (without painful scuttle tactics).  It's NOT nice that the 6 assault frigates from mission 3 simply disappear when captured (and are down to 4 for some reason).- Resourcing: Nerfed to 500 RU's per load (down from 600) for no apparent reason. Takes an eternity to collect resources. Also there's a whole lot more resources available in each level, severely hurting the fine tuned balance of the original game. But I guess that was an easier fix than trying to fix the balance.- Balance: Downright terrible. Battles that should be over in a flash take forever and with unacceptible losses. An army of 21 interceptors, 7 heavy corvettes and 4 assault frigates should suffer no losses when facing 5 interceptors + 2 corvettes. Neither should they take more than 5 minutes. But that's not homeworld ""remastered"".- Interface: I, for one, preferred the original build manager to the homeworld 2 multi page build manager since it's easier building everything from a single page.If it ain't broke, don't make a half-a!$@d attempt at 'remastering' the game.

												The 2.0 update adds everything that was lacking from the initial release (bar the HW1 credits music). The newly added physically stimulated ballistic weapons, strike craft formations and intelligent strike groups have combined the best tactical features from HW1 and 2 into this masterpiece.If you're getting this revitalised classic (2 remastered games AND the 2 originals) on sale you're getting an incredible bargain. One of the best space operas ever available to gamers, well worth it even at full price.  "

												Nostalgia aside, this is one hell of a grand remake.Better Graphics, Better Gameplay, Better UI, and Better AI.The Multiplayer and Skirmishes have been redone and improved.Homeworld has an excellent and deep dark story that is gritty and tribal.The Music is great and very atmospheric, dark and epic.This remastered edition is one to pick up for those new and old to the series. It combines both Homeworld 1 and 2 into Skirmishes and MP and lets you use factions from both.Still has a few bugs here and there but it is still early days.Most importantly it is one of those RTS games that keeps the immersion and the darkness of space.Has beautiful dustclouds, explosions, nebulas and planets.11/10This is not just an RTS or a simple game,This is Art, THIS IS HOMEWORLD.One that is timeless.

												Yes! If you never heard of this game, learn about it now.I have both games (and the other one in between - Cataclysm - that they didn't relauched) on CD since 1999 (the first). Once sierra vanished from history, i lost all hope from seeing these games disapearing as well (for multiplayer pourpuses ans such). Now, i have my hopes for the 3rd again!The remastering did an amazing job both on graphics quality and game improvements, without taking anything of the original titles. It is great not to have a full screen research for example. On homeworld 2 they had if fixed, and the remastered made it a pattern for both games.The games their self are great. It's easy to see the product qualidity here - both in history (yeah, these games you'll stop to watch their cutscenes BECAUSE THEY ACTUALY HAVE HISTORY CONTENT AND IMPORTANCE!) and in game play. As an strategy game, there's everything you may want. It is really a journey, and you'll feel that.Great job! And good gaming.			"

												I heartily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys real-time strategy. The remaster of Homeworld 1 is imperfect, unfortunately, and not as well-executed as the remaster of Homeworld 2, but regardless it remains an excellent game, and still up near the top of the space RTS genre. Seeing as the classic versions are also included and are now fully compatible with modern systems, there is no reason not to get this game.Homeworld Remastered is basically the four best space RTS games ever made all bundled together. Two just happen to be remakes of the other two.			"

												Simply put, a game everyone needs to see. If you love RTS and atmospheric stories then dont pass this up. I wont try to ice it over, this game has some aggrivating bugs at times, and I wouldnt recommend trying the multiplayer yet (or if you do prepare for some... ""fun""). I wish they left the first games mechanics how they were and not to implement the seconds into it. That way it would have kept its original feel. Recommend this game? Of course! Hopefully they fix the problems and support this game like it should. Those complaing have good reason to do so, however there are a few faults in their accusations:1: These games are from a different era where you had to really think and plan ahead, most may find the game a bit hard and frusterating as each mission always throws loops at you so in a sense you had to keep in mind what you brought to the table each time you finish a mission and start a new one.2: They CLEARLY SAID that they were integrating HW2 mechanics into HW1, sad but they emphisized this multiple times3: Many memebers of the Original Team were involved in this...dont go blaming Gearbox. Games must evolve, and adapt to changes in the industry. I also dont agree with everything but you have to ask yourself the basic question ""Is it fun?""As someone whos played this game since its first release and still have the original disks, I bought this for 2 reasons. First being Steams support (Which could add a much bigger fanbase, and easier way to setup mods) and that I simply felt the need to assist this series by buying it. They were never perfect but they were inspiring in their time... Just like now, its not perfect but why get so upset? Especially when they INCLUDED THE ORIGINALS!			"

												TL/DR: Game breaking bugs.  Wait for bug fixes and the next steam sale to get this one.I have fond memories of the original Homeworld, so I decided to pay full price to reward Gearbox for refreshing a classic franchise.  With all the good reviews from critics and some of the original Homeworld devs working on the project I was confident it would be a solid experience.  Gearbox you burned me on this one.  I didn’t pay full price to beta test your code!  Frequent crashes.  Also game breaking bugs.  For example, if you have to reload a mission from an auto save, mission events will fail to trigger, preventing you from completing it.  Serious bugs in the AI behavior too.  Critical to success in Homeworld is capturing enemy ships.   Imagine my frustration when my own ships continue to shoot enemy vessels after I’ve captured them, often destroying both the captured ship and my own salvage corvettes in the process.  I almost threw a monitor.  Don’t reward Gearbox for rushing this out the door and expecting us to Q&A it for them.  Refuse to buy it until they’ve resolved the issues and it goes on a big sale.

												If you are planning to buy this because you were a big fan of HW1, don't. Much of what you'll remember of HW1 was lost when it was brought over to the HW2 engine. A few changes to HW1 (Most not for the better)-Fighter/Corvettes no longer require fuel-Formations don't hold in battle (all) and often do not work outside of it (sphere, parade)-Minefields require constant maintenance-Ship evasion is severely diminished-Research costs RUs and Research ships can no longer research independently-Balance of many missions has been changed, often for the worse (looking at you Sea of Lost Souls)Despite being very pretty, this game feels rushed. As a community, Homeworld fans were kept in the dark regarding what the remastering was going to bring to the table. Updates were non-existant and the only newsletter I got after signing up when it was initially offered was the release date email a year later. I imagine mounting negative feedback on this got Gearbox to kick it out the door before it was done =/Gearbox did not do right by fans of the original title.			"

												I played the old homeworld games and was pleasently suprised with this addition. As many have experienced these remastered games are often just disapointing and might aswell buy the games on GOG for a cheaper price with more content, see HOMM 3. This game is an exception to the rule, the games has become easy to control and easy to master, the graphical upgrade has been done with thought and is a completely new experience. If you're new to the series i will strongly recomend this Space RTS, i can't compare this game to something similair as this game is quite unique. They've made it easier for newcommers without dumbing it down for the veterans.The story is great, graphics are great and gameplay is unique. What more do you need?i've come across one game breaking bug, but it was fixed with a simple restart of the map.Welcome to Homeworld!Edit: If you're a veteran and is skeptical about the user interface changes, they've enabled you to play the old games, so you basically bought 4 games:p			"

												After playing HW1 classic, I was foaming at the mouth to play this game. Then I get into the game. Fuel is no longer a thing, which has a huge tactical concern. Now its not. Formations don't work. Pricing on all units from HW1 was changed. In the single player resources are THROWN at you in massive amounts.  For example, in Sea of Lost souls. I had a large enough fleet to absolutely destroy the entire thing, then it became a game of just whittling down the alien ship with attack bombers. I'm sitting on over 50k RU  with 8 destroyers and 3 heavy cruisers. Enough complaining though. Is this game worth it? Yes. It's fun. Even with the drastic freakin changes its made.

												It's odd that one of the best space musical performances on PC ought to be an incessant theory redirection, however that is the appeal of Homeworld. Over 15 years after its excellent discharge, Gearbox have remastered Relic's creation and its continuation with high-res surfaces, bolster lighting and another UI, suitably modernizing a champion amongst the most troublesome and suggestive structure game-plan ever manufactured. It's an incredible thing, particularly in the event that you have a getting a charge out of for spaceships doing spaceship things, for instance, shedding squadrons of assault workmanship and shooting mammoth lasers over the void. Regardless, Homeworld's splendor runs energize. It's in the sound course of action—the blending use of Adagio for Strings; the brief, devastate comms from your manager; and the way Homeworld's three-dimensional doing combating mirrors debacle and destroying over its battles. Both are stories of survival among the stars. Your species' last trust is a goliath boomerang called the Pride of Hiigara, a titanic mothership with the best way to deal with make an economy of more minor barges, from unassuming mining vessels to plane and assault make. The Pride's capacity to make military makes her your imperative opposing instrument, yet that rich arced carapace ensures the cryogenically established remains of your species. Her setback recommends mean vanquish. Homeworld astutely plays on this strain. One early mission makes them protecting ranges of stasis-bound tenants from criminals. Your ship's PC declares ""100,000 spared"" with each safe, appending an unsavory loss of life the vessels the bandits absolutely take off. Military units and general subjects you shield are passed on through from mission to mission as you reinforce your goliath space family and bring your species toward the day's end from the skirt of aggregate catastrophe. The team's turn from removed individual riffraff to military storm is shrewdly paced, and the battle stands today as the best use of the RTS as a portraying instrument. It's attempting, in any case, and consistently fiddly. Micromanaging troops transversely over gigantic segments in a 3D situation takes hone and sensible utilization of the concede key. Might want to contribute gatherings of essentialness isolating your qualities into control social affairs and sending them after particular targets – contender units, or the subsystems of some huge war vessel. Vessels are around amassed into opposing to contender and against capital classes, however their size, relative speed and the updates you get some information about fluctuate their parts essentially. There's far to go, and missions pound you with astounding goals. It's ordinary to deal with two or three battles in the interim, all while keeping up an economy and keeping your construct lines included. It's cerebrum boggling, and purposefully so. Crusade missions can wind up being unfathomably troublesome on the off chance that you dismissal to secure obliges amongst missions and the unpretentious components of battle—like micromanaging units to strike the gentler top protected layer of frigates—persuades the chance to be difficult in Homeworld's most unmistakable scraps. The great craving to hold information is outright protected paying little regard to the exertion, nevertheless, for the dream of organizing such a fantastic get-together of smooth, shining vehicles, and for the scene when they help into fight. That is upheld by Gearbox' striking update work. They've rehashed Homeworld's creating foundations and ship surfaces concerning Relic's uncommon vision. Lasers cast light on vessels, a noteworthiness of field impact redesigns the sufficiently especially made notion segment amongst distinguishing strength and the updated UI makes cycling between era line units less troublesome. Just a few minor issues meddle, similar to the impression of ship classes to subjective geometric shapes in menus, regardless they're minimal bandy given the method for the bundle. Homeworld is just personality boggling and everybody ought to play it.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												Homeworld Remastered is a remake of two classic and very popular games, Homeworld 1 and 2. It's a real-time strategy space game that is basically the best one to this date with no game to overcome it, in most peoples eyes.This is going to be a thoughts on the game, my thoughts, as a person who never played the originals, and a friend who did play them and now playing the remake. Also, neither that friend or I have finished the game, just to note.Both of us thought that the graphics are, for how old this game is, compared to the classics, it's beautifully remade.The ship models are a lot more pleasing and awesome, same with the background (space), and the UI is adjustable which is neat, but for me that UI could have been better.The story, for my friend has always been great, and to me it is just great. The presentation is fantastic, which include the story, the cut scenes, and the battles, all of which are awesome and emphasizes that space is scary and there's a lot of powerful forces out there, showing that to you directly opposing your power.The only complaint so far for the game is that me and my friend thought that moving the camera around can be a pain, not hard, just annoying, and most of the other issues for the game are coming from the fact this is a remastered game, of an old game, that didn't get a makeup of modern technicalities and controls that we get in most new games nowadays, which isn't necessarily a negative thing, but it would have been great if it were tweaked to have them.So overall the game is great, for new players and for the fans, and for the price it has, for two remade games in one, with the mixed multiplayer, it's a great purchase, and a cleaned up superb old/new game/s.Shameless link[ksalue.com] "

												Definitely a good game, quite pleased with the graphical update, audio update, and also the UI update. It plays very smoothly and I am having loads of fun in both the campaign and multiplayer. Definitely recommend anyone to give this game a go, especially if you like space opera and a strong story coupled with good RTS gameplay.However, it does have some bugs. For example, the speech audio sometimes randomly mutes itself during the campaign, which results in me needing to save and reload the game to get the speech audio back on. Another bug both me and a friend encountered was with the garden of Kadesh mission: When you attempt to enter hyperspace and fail and you have your units docked, it will force them to launch  and you cannot dock them again. The swarmers then wreck my salvage corvetts.Also, it would be nice if the game were more 'unified'. In other words, I want to be able to access HW1 campaign, HW2 campaign, and the multiplayer without needing to close the game and open the launcher again. Those should all be options in the menu, not separate 'games' you need to launch.Despite that, I tend to overlook bugs and UX issues on the first day, as long as developers get them fixed in good time. So for now, I shall keep my review as overall positive. Definitely looking forward to the many more hours of fun completing these campaigns again!			"

												Everything I remembered it to be and more.  I remembered the tight controls and surprisingly simple style for tactics (BTW definitely play the tutorial).  I remembered how cool it looked to send squadrons of ships in claw formations against enemy carriers (which looks amazing now compared to then).  And I remembered how the game gives you simple missions at first to ease you into the action.  But I forgot (I'm not sure how) the gripping narratives of the two games.  I was immediately sucked back into the journey across the galaxy and the aggressive response to enemy threats.Now I've barely touched the remastered game thus far: hardly restarted the story as of writing this.  It may be early for a review.  They could have bugs further on that I don't know about yet.  So far it's played smooth and error free (despite turning my gaming laptop into a blast furnace).  But I've played through the old versions before and this stands up to and exceeds my expectations for a modernization.Pros:                   .Gripping story       .tight controls               .great visuals.gentle learning curve (simple missions at first familiarizing you with the game).Bug free and plays smooth..Two games plus expansions in one!Cons:.You better play the tutorial or that gentle learning curve is going to be much steeper..new visuals (outside of the new lighting and weapon effects) are simply hi-res textures pasted onto relatively simple ship models from the original game so don't expect elite dangerous graphics..You don't own it yet.

												Great remaster for those of us who had major nostaglia for Homeworld RTS gaming back in the day. The texture and graphics updates are very noticable (go load up the classic games to see). Still lots of fun, HW2 story is still not as good as HW1, though I liked it more than I remember liking it back in the day. Lots of explodey ship fighting. Some of the, uh, 'fun' difficulty spikes in HW2 are still there though.Still stands up as a decent game even without the nostalgia.			"

Still it is pretty effective as far as a space game goes. "

Homeworld is unlike anything that's out there, it's a game who defined the space strategy genre as we know it, becoming a high standard. I remember myself playing with friends when Homeworld2 came out, the amount of incredible games we had, and still have. That was the best experience I had in strategy video games thus far.As much as I love strategy games, I fell in love for this title the first time I played it. I will probably always consider it as my favourite one, and that's probably the most valuable reason I started developing mods on it, not just because I wanted to create something related to my favourite science fiction universes, but because this game brought us so many possibilities that I had to do it.I seriously believe Gearbox gave Homeworld the respect it deserves, like other people think. This Remastered version is definitely what we can consider as ""Remastered""... in opposition to other studios who tend to promote remastered games just because they changed the textures or the screen resolution. It's not a Remastered version, it's.. a Renovation. Now highlighting high definition score, great voices, Full-HD animated cutscenes and one of the latest version of OpenGL, Homeworld Remastered makes the whole game really epic, with a well-told story.My unique complain is that they decided to remove audios from other languages (such as French, Spanish, Italian...) while they still have them and that the original records are already in HD. They said that ""they don't have them anymore"", so they would have needed to remake all of them with foreign recording studios, and I don't believe Gearbox wanted to spend money on this, as they're not a publisher, and don't have the same amount of ressources.Pros of this Remastered Version:✓ Brillant and stunning visuals.✓ A better campaign (improved cutscenes).✓ A great multiplayer mode.✓ Far better Interface, and god we needed it.✓ A great User Interface, which proves Homeworld rhymes with Modernity.✓ Awesome multiplayer games in perspective.✓ New tracks and remastered awe-inspiring score.✓ Better movements and improved AI.✓ Steam multiplayer platform, a good point to play with your friends.✓ Mod tools, although not finished.Cons of this Remastered Version:✖ Audio strictly limited to English. A shame because foreign languages had really great voice overs.✖ Some missions could have been improved (strange movements).✖ Formations and BC should be improved as well.✖ Steam exclusive. Even the CD version requires Steam, which is something I consider as ""bull****"".There are cons, of course, but let us all remember than this Remastered version is a way for Homeworld fans to support the future of the franchise. Thank you Gearbox, command line green. Homeworld Forever!VERDICT: IT'S A MASTERPIECE! "

												I'm writing this review mere minutes after beating the remastered Homeworld campaigns. Bear in mind that this review talks about the remastered games ONLY.I cannot overstate how much I looked forward to something like this, since Homeworld never had a digital release (good luck getting those old CDs to run).The remaster is done well, but not perfectly. My biggest gripe being ship squads. In multiplayer, the Homeworld 1 races simply don't stand a chance in the fighter/corvetter categories. Of course that could change with future patches (as I'm sure it will).Campaign wise, the Homeworld 2 campaign feels nigh-on identical to how it was before. The Homeworld 1 campaign though definitely felt different. It seemed a bit easier, maybe because of the rock-paper-scissors combat system associated with the Homeworld 2 engine. Either way, it was fun and a great trip down memory lane... except it looked a hellova lot better!But there are some issues, almost all being Homeworld 1 related. Formations need work, simple as that. If I put my ships into a sphere I expect them to hug around a guarded ship, not sit next to it in a ball. Fuel is gone, but TBH, to me (!) that was a positive change overall. The UI is neat and better to me than the old one. This one (like Homeworld 2's original UI) allows you to monitor the action while issueing build and research orders.Most of the other changes are minor, such as Kadeshi Multibeam frigates not doing a barrel roll when firing or research ships not spinning anymore. All of that could be patched in later though, or modded.If you can live with the above differences and consider the amazing visual upgrade, then this is absolutely a good buy!Homeworld is an RTS franchise you OWE yourself to at least try.

												The best stab at a truly 3D RTS the gaming industry has ever taken. The easy and intuitive interface, and the three dimensional weak spots on assorted craft makes your movement on the field of battle meaningful. The story, artwork, and voice acting bring the struggle of the inheritants of the former Kushan empire to life in this unparalleled masterpiece.After languishing over a decade in relative obscurity, Gearbox has brought the universe of Homeworld back to the forefronts of our imagination in a master stroke born of proper reverence for the titles. The Remastered Collection breathes new life into the game's backdrop in a way that does it more justice than our own imaginations could during the game's initial release. The magnitude and quality of the effort—and the joy it brings to my sense of nostalgia—cannot be understated.			"

												I would not recommend this game if you played homeworld 1 or homeworld cataclysm in their original state. It is VERY broken. Especially harvesting. AI is dumb, formations dont work (which also breaks many tactics you would use in the original), harvesters have to attach to items, multiplayer is a beta, the homeworld credits song is gone, and you cant play as the Taidan in the redone version, which is dissapointing since you would think the WHOLE game would have been redone. Harvesters also need to constantly be retold to harvest. They will think they are done, when they are not. This game is an offense to the original homeworld.			"

												just brought our mothership to the outter space and encountered the first wave of enemy fighters. cant wait any longer to give you this battle report. GB has shown great respect to the old version of this fantastic story driven space RTS title, every element you see and feel in the remastered version brings you back to old days, but with a greater enchanced graphic, sound and interface. Until now i have not seen any downside of this remastered version, unlike what most of other HD remastered game did that changed alot of things which made those games more like a 'half new' title.For those homeworld fans, you might wanna play the tutorial missions first since GB changed some hotkeys so that its no longer the keys you familiar, for example the right click menu, now its Shift + right click. For now, there is only one word that can describe it - Beautiful!will see what happans next.Dont miss it out. Buy!			"

												Homeworld Remastered: The 90's gave us many great RTS games. One of them was Homeworld. Sadly, I missed out on playing this gem. However thanks to the folks at Gearbox Software, we now can play it in full beautiful HD. With redone graphics, cleaned up audio and more. Homeworld Remastered brings back this 1999 classic in style. The story and music are fantastic. The RTS side of Homeworld is a whole different beast though. The usual high paced, high action style of games that we get these days is slightly different in Homeworld. Its a much more relaxed experience. Leaving you plenty of room to decide your next move. Sometimes this leads to unnecessarily long missions. It does enable you though to come up with a master strategy. Like a general on a battle field watching from above. In all Homeworld Remastered does the game justice and then some.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												A truly unique RTS (and the only one I know of that truly has 3d maps), HWR gives you the ability to move craft in literally any direction.  Don't know if the videos shown display this ability or not, I do apologise.  The remastered version is about as close to the original than any other game I have ever played that has been remastered to such an extent except for the 1st halo maybe. I have not played it, I will not buy a console for only 1 game (**** you square enix, for making FF15 exclusive to PS4).  All craft are very unique, in what craft they are intended to combat.  The story is very rich for what you can expect, ships communicating to each other with icon thumbnails that are usually not an actual face (outside of some cinematics between missions).  There are 4 different playable factions, each with their own unique strategies for multiplayer and skirmish mode.  Only 1 race is playable in both games during storymode.  There is only 1 type of currency for both games, mined from asteroids (or dust clouds as well in HW1).  Most missions require careful tactics, lest your currency dries up before the next mission (still possible with just resources that are in each map - but not likely.The only critisism I have seen from the community, in the remastered versions, is that weapon projectiles function differently from HW1 classics.'  I personally didn't really care enough to get upset by it, I was just happy enough for the remastered versions to be as good as they are, but there are some players who are not too happy about that.Be aware, however, most missions can take a substantial of time to complete.  Although, there are setable parameters to make multiplayer games go faster and during anytime you can save on singleplayer.P.S.:  there is a third homeworld game that occurred between HM1 and HM2 named HW:Cataclysm.  I do not know why it wasn't remastered but the story of it not essential to the plot of HW2 (outside a near extinction event of a non-playable species). "

												Fun, old sci-fi strategy games in space that got a pretty good ""facelift"". Includes Homeworld and Homeworld 2, both in classic and remastered versions, that work on modern systems.It's not easy game at first and it will take you some trial and error to complete the campaign. All ships have their strengths and weaknesses, some are better at dealing damage yet can't take much damage themselves, others are faster and more agile so they can overwhelm the larger ships if they have the numbers. Ships have either a projectile attack, missiles or energy weapon attacks. Some may have combination of all three like few of the larger capital ships.There are many different starships in game that are divided into fighters, corvettes, frigates and capital ships. Some ships you will use for specific tasks, not just attacking but repairing, gather resources, cloaking allies, capturing enemy ships, disabling them, shielding allies from damage and much more.In battle, ships can miss their shots, so 10 on 10 fighter battle can have different outcome depending on how lucky your shots are. And in large battles it's all about tactics and knowing your enemy weaknesses. Apart from solo campaign there's skirmish and multiplayer for some custom matches with friends.Homeworld 2 bring all that was great in Homeworld and adds more enemies, ships, modification modules, new research options for ships as well as new campaign. It's hard to review a ""bundle"" of sorts, because it's 4 games in one package, even though they are similar, the remastered versions have a lot of new features as well as improved visuals and game user interface.[Tutorial lady]: If you liked this review, click OK to continue.[ OK ];8)			"

												Homeworld remastered is a broken and disapointing PORT of the  origonal Homeworld into the Homeworld 2 engine.Due to being a port into a different engine, alot of the base mechanics just dont work anymore, major changes have been made to ships health, cost, unit caps, and damage to try and balance Homeworld 1 in the Homeworld 2 Engine. there are still many features that still just dont work, formations,  the cease fire command, captured carriers cannot build and contain enemy fighters after capture (fun!).if your looking to play a graphically updated Homeworld 1, this is not the game for you.if you have never played Homeworld, you will probably have fun, as you wont notice the changes.But as someone who absolutly loved the origonal to bits, it hurts to play the remaster, seeing the shortcomings in every facit of the game.

												I usually do a bit more research before I make a Steam purchase, as a result most of the games I own were either given to me or I bought because I knew I would love them.I was a little wary of paying $35 dollars for a 15 year old game no matter how ""remastered"" it sounded, but I genuinely lovd the original Homeworld so much I decided to go ahead (I thought it would be great to be able to play online against friends for the first time in ages, as well!) I was worried about that when I was still using the traditional definition of Remastered and not, ""turned into complete trash."" Between the bugs and the changes the game flounders near the area of unplayable. For examples of changes, fundamental tactical abilities like telling your fighters to be ""evasive"" has simply been ripped out of the game. Whether or not this was to foment HWI vs HWII multiplayer is as irrelevant as it is uncertain, it renders figher groups so much less meaningful or useful. Fighters instead seem to behave in a sort of constant half aassed evasive which means that their aggressive behavior has also been scuttled. For examples of bugs, from mission to mission my groups would fail to properly select. If I hightlighted, say, all the ships in group one then they might all show they were in group one, but if I actually hit one, only a few respond to the hail. I have to reselect and reassaign them all to ""rebuilld"" between missions. But this is nothing compared to ships simply REFUSING TO OBEY ORDERS. I have tried playing The Wastelands three times now and in each instance a point was reached where some group of ships simply refused to move or engage no matter what they were instructed. I was especially impressed by my salvage frigates staring dumbly at me as I repeatedly tried to get them to capture a destroyer or, indeed, any ship as they slowly got picked off one by one. I have never before felt compelled to write a negative review for Steam. It's one thing to simply make a bad game, that happens all the time. But this is a case of taking a masterpiece and destroying it. And I've been offered the chance to waste $35 dollars for the priviledge of watching one of my favorite games of old trashed in this manner. Simply releasing the games for $5 apiece and rebuilding the multiplayer environment would have been the right move. As it stands, I regret this purchase without reservation and cannot recommend it, at least not until the myriad gameplay issues have been resolved. Even then, the graphis upgrades hardly justify $35. In my opinion, if you make this purcahse you are probably getting ripped off.			"

												The short of it: grognard vote of approval.The long of it: Homeworld (its demo, in fact) was the first game I installed on my first computer. I've kept at it constantly through the years. The Remastered edition does contain Homeworld and Homeworld 2, they are as good as ever, and this is reason enough for a thumbs up.The Remastered edition adds a lot of visual improvements, and some gameplay modifications as well. The awesome Homeworld story is brought into the Homeworld 2 engine - some players might choose this opportunity to experience it, since you can now issue orders while the game is paused, and thus deal with the more hectic moments of space combat.Apart from more detailed textures, 3D models, lightning system, here are some pros and cons at a glance:PROS:- the gameplay tried to remain faithful to the original- game runs well- good sound quality- everything said in cinematics has a subtitle, including the launch game-engine cinematic- good first day support (got a game update immediately after my first crashed, which got fixed)- you can pit Kushan against Hiigaran, or any of the 4 factions of the two games in skirmish- it is funCONS:- though technically impressive, the visual aspect of the game needs some more polishing and fitting together- some HW1 ships don't work well yet, like Hive Frigates- HW1 Salvage Corvette numbers are now drastically limited; doing the campaign junkyard style seems doubtfulNitpicking:- The starting cinematic ends with the view centered on the Resource Collector; however, due to the orientation of the camera, the backdrop is outer space, rather than Kharak, as was in the original game. I feel this disrupts the narratively important visual repetition of Kharak (multiple times in the starting cinematic, then contrasted in mission 3), and I would like the developer to 'fix' the narrative element back.Bottom line: good, fun games, done in the spirit of the old and improved upon. Still need a few patches.			"

												I bought this on sale expecting to play HW1 with better graphics and to have a copy of this game forever preserved on the cloud somewhere, even though I have the original CD. So far, things have been a huge disappointment. The following only applies to HW1 as I have not attempted to play HW2:+ The graphics have indeed been modernized and fleet combat is spectacular to watch- Every single ship has had their resource cost and battle prowess completely changed- The AI of strike craft has been completely changed,  making fighters nearly useless in every type of battle- Damage dealt by larger craft has been greatly increased, shortening combat and making tactical movement orders unnecessary- Enemy fleet scaling has been completely changed, causing some missions to be stacked ludicrously against you and punishing you for playing wellThe net result is that battles play out completely different. In HW1 Classic you had a framework for what to expect in combat: fighters would beat capital ships, capital ships would beat corvettes, and corvettes would beat fighters. Several craft would break these rules, but you always had the option through smart gameplay to even the odds - formations, tactics, and tactical movement could swing unfavorable fights in your favor. Now, in the Remastered version, all of that is pointless. Spend all your resources building as many of the biggest ships you can, and just drag a box around the enemy fleet to issue an attack order. Whichever side has the biggest fleet wins in a matter of seconds.No thanks.+ The classic HW1 game is included if you don't want to deal with any of this nonsense. Unfortunately, my experience with HW1 classic has been filled with bugs and crashes, something I do not experience when I install from the original CD			"

If you have played the old HW's then you already know what this is all about, and yes the remastered editions live up to the legend. For those newcomers, this game sits easily within the top ten best computer games ever created. Even if the multiplayer is a little buggy the epic  campaign is well worth the thirty or so dollars.

												Great Classic Game RevivedHomeworld and Homeworld 2 are now old games that have been classics within the gaming community for years - at least for those of us that remember it.  The epic and grandscale of the game is brought back to life with the Remastered Collection.The gameplay overall is still somewhat unique even in this day as there have been very few games that offered true 6DoF movment for all units.The only downside however is many of the older scripting bugs that existed in the original Homeworld and Homeworld 2 still exist but I can only assume that they will be fixed in short order.

												If this is your first time playing homeworld, go ahead, get this and enjoy, you will probably love it. But if you spent your childhood or your younger days playing the original homeworld for hours on end, to the point of having a ridiculous amount of the campaign memorized, dont get this. Or at least get it and ignore the Remastered ones and only play the classic, because they managed to change it to the point that it just isnt homeworld anymore. This isnt Relic's Homeworld Remastered by Gearbox, this is Gearbox's fully legal almost the same ripoff of Relic's Homeworld.			"

												Why, Gearbox?  Why couldn't you have either just cleaned it up, or given it the love it needed?  This frankenstein's monster of a game is offensively disrespectful to your history and your legends.The upgraded graphics break the game - many people report a 'general failure' any time they try to load, and disabling many graphical features seems to be the only (unreliable) fix.  Formations and simulated projectile bullets are gone, both foundational mechanics.Whereas HW1 achieved it's balance by making ships and weapons actually function according to their role, HWC:RM achieves its balance via HW2's rock/paper/scissors balance, by arbitrarily weighting certain ships to function less effectively against ships they aren't meant to be useful against. Actual simulated projectiles and formations were never made to function in HWC:RM.If they had just upgraded textures and models and called it a day, they would have shown this game more respect.  Instead, they crammed it into an engine it wasn't meant for, ignored everything that became broken because that new engine doesn't support foundational game mechanics, and released it with numerous game-breaking bugs that after almost two years they never bothered to patch, despite a number of balance patches.

												I'm not entirely sure what they were thinking with Homeworld 1 remastered, especially putting the original in there beside it. Strikecraft, tactics and formations feel incredibly neutered and pointless in the remastered game. All it does is just confuse a fight more times than it helps, unlike the original where it was an important part of small unit tactics. Still, the story and pacing are mostly the same and it feels right.Homeworld 2 remastered... Where do I start? The story they give you is strange and vaguely nonsensical that wrecks some of the plot points from the first one for absolutely no reason that is apparent to me. It lacks the relaxed pace of the first game with crisis' piling up in your lap before you have a chance to deal with previous ones. Your opponents, the Vaygr, not only vastly outnumber you in each mission, but you quickly notice the quality of their craft also outstrip your own in most instances, this leaves every single engagement an attempt to overwhelm them and the fact that the mission automatically ends (also unlike the first one) means you have no chance to rebuild or reinforce your fleet before heading to the next mission.The game looks pretty, but I feel that was Gearboxes ONLY concern when they remastered this game.

Its shining multiplayer skirmishes when players work together to defeat the opponent, where matches feel like a tug of war with players contesting resources until the final battle big battle with fighters and capital ships each filling out their repeated roles. Homeworlds beauty is in the campaign, each mission allows for the ships that survived to remain with you, and if your lucky you can keep that elite group of fighters that you get a the beginning.

The combat is fun and the plot sucks you in. However I find the first Homeworld to be incredibly buggy with everything from broken quests, wrong army size displayed and extremely slow unit movement. In addition I found the difficulty to be completely unfair and a chore to finish. I think you will have a LOT more fun to just play Homeworld 2 remastered edition. Overall I highly recommend 8/10.

YouTube™ Video: Homeworld Remastered - One of the Best Remakes Ever! 

			Views: 406		

			Homeworld is one of the most unique RTS's ever made! There is still no other game (that I know of, anyway) that's anything like it.		

Homeworld is one of the most unique RTS's ever made! There is still no other game (that I know of, anyway) that's anything like it. Not only was the fully 3D environment groundbreaking, the graphics had a beauty unlike anything ever seen before. This is how space games were meant to look!The remastered version is everything that the original was, and so much more. This isn't just an update to make the game compatible with modern machines, this is an honest, thorough HD remake of the game. The game looks fantastic, even by today's graphical standards. The gameplay still feels fresh and unique. I've played this game 15 hours since it was released, and not ready to quit anytime soon! In all those 15 hours, I have not run into any bugs or game breakers. The game has been smooth the whole way through,. I haven't tried multiplayer yet, as I want to finish the campaigns first, so maybe there are some bugs there (it is still in beta, after all) but the single player experience is flawless.If you were a fan of the original Homeworlds, this is a must have for you! If you have never played the originals, then now is definitely the time to experience this gem of a game!			"

												I played Homeworld 1 not long after it first came out, some 14-15 years ago. I got stuck early on as it was too hard for me, but I still remember it well. I was pleased seeing this come to me from Humble Monthly, as I kept hearing how good the originals were. Maybe the remaster is just as good?I suppose most people don't expect an amazing story when they go to play an RTS. And this is how Homeworld stands out in my eyes. Sure, some strategies had really cool campaigns (ex. Red Alert, Starcraft...) but Homeworld is like a class of its own. In terms of lasting, emotional impact it is perhaps unrivaled in its genre (although still not a tearjerker proper since it's still a strategy). The ""we are away"" moment at the beginning of the first campaign is - for me - one of the most memorable moments in all of gaming and how they redid it at the beginning of the second? Excellent. The whole game just feels surprisingly artsy a lot of time. Maybe it's the semi-choral pieces. Maybe the ambient, dead-silent camera pans at the height of drama during cutscenes. Maybe the gorgeous backgrounds that fail to convey the size and scope of the universe but do their best trying. Maybe the attention to detail in the writing and establishing a vast world.Before you run off to get it, let me warn you. This is not an effortless feels dispenser. This is still a remaster of a game designed and made in the 20th century. Back then they made games hard. I mean hard. Homeworld got a graphical facelift but it's still as difficult for me as it was 15 years ago. Giving move and attack orders in 3D in the middle of battle without pausing, when all the forces intertwine is a right cluster*uck. You can actually pause and give orders but the tutorial didn't say so and thus I had to complete the whole game without it. But the absolutely worst thing is a system that scales up the amount of enemies spawned against you based on your resources. That means not only the ships you have on the field but also the amount of resources (money) you have in the bank. If that sounds as abhorrent to you as it does to me, then you probably've guessed that this game had a close shave with the thumbs down button. Luckily, there is a brilliant mod here, which allows to adjust that mechanic (or turn it off altogether). With this, the game is actually manageable.I had fairly high expectations for this game and it lived up to them. Both in the quality of the source material (which was unknown to me up to this point) and its remastering into a modern product. If you'll hear people say Homeworld was a milestone for gaming they generally are not lying, although it was a bit niche due to its uncompromising difficulty and thus this milestone was quickly left behind.

												I cannot tell you the countless hours I've put into the original homeworld series. I was a super huge fan of the entire thing, even the never mentioned cataclysm. To say I was excited to see this game remastered was an understatement.For those that are not familiar with homeworld: It's a fantastic space strategy simulation game. You use your massive motherships as space factories and face off against other ships/factions. The scale of combat expands quickly from smaller fightercraft all the way up to massive capital ship battles. It features a harvesting economy, salvage, ship theft & invasion, and a lot of research and development to keep your fleet operating and developing in a fashion of gameplay that you enjoy. The HIGHLIGHT of this game is that it's fully 3D. You can make attacks and travel along the Z axis freely.As a returning player, the remastered game has exceeded all my expectations.1) The new graphics engine upgrades are gorgeous, giving you a much more believable/enjoyable visual experience.2) Multiplayer: Has been masterfully reworked so that the kushan, higaaran, taidan & vagyr all fight in the same maps. Each one has it's own distinct (yet familiar) style of gameplay, and benefits.3) With Steam support, the mod packs of this game are exceptionally easy to use! You can quickly ""subscribe"" to mods, and flick them on & off at a whim!I HIGHLY suggest this to anyone who is either a returning player wishing to re-kindle some nostalgea, or to new players who wish to experience one of the best space tactical games out there to-date.P.S. For those who throught homeworld was great buy easy, try the complex 9.1 mod! It upgrades the game in almost every way!			"

												This was one of the very first space RTS games I have ever played back in my early teens. With the remastered edition, graphics are slightly updated and everything (especially UI) is given a better polish. For it's age (and update), it can still hold value for space fans.I haven't completed the first Homeworld but have the second (and am still sort of unfamiliar with the story). Basically, you play as this race called the Hiigarans. The game starts with the Hiigarans attempting to finish constructing their mothership but are quickly interrupted by attacking Vaygr enemies. From what I understood from the first game, there are 3 ancient power cores in the universe that if all three are collected by the wrong people, ""end times"" can ensue.The gameplay follows a somewhat unique sequence. There is no base to build. There are no supply depots. There are no factories. There is only the mothership! The mothership is capable of building resource collectors, battle units from interceptor to capitol ship size and mobile resource centers. It is the headquarters that will provide everything necessary and will take your leftover units to the next level. Capitol ships and space stations are also units that can create more units. The issue here is that certain units require certain modules to build. A capitol ship cannot build frigates unless a frigate module has been built. Same concept applies with the space station. The challenge here is trying to balance out the fleet while being conservative with resources. The RTS factor to the game is unique in the sense that most of the crafts you build come in squadrons (except for the larger units like frigates). The space in which you can tell the units to move is on a 3D plane (the Z axis positioning can be modified by holding shift and the right mouse button). This adds some substance to the game as you can ambush your opponent in 3D! Having the right setup and formation can really bolster defense. Choosing units isn't too much of a hassle. If you find that your selecting repair units as well as military units, there is a special setting within the options to prioritize selection of military units. This is a good way to keep your peon units out of fights. There can be a lot going on at times and it can be hard to keep track of units. Pressing space will allow the player to zoom out and see the ENTIRE battlefield. This is a good way to manage your units. To make the camera go up and down for a better view, simply press insert or delete.There are a few categories of units : strike craft, utility class, capital and frigate. Strike crafts usually come in groups (of 3 to 5) and consist of interceptors, bombers and corvettes. Bombers are more or less meant to strike larger ships and structures. Corvettes are quite slower than interceptors but pack more of a punch in their armor and weapons. Frigate classes have the ability to heal themselves but quite slowly. There are two types of frigates, marine and flak. Flak is meant to deal some heavy damage to structures and larger ships while marine frigates are meant to invade and seize control of structures or even opposing ships. Capital ships consists of carriers (which can build ships) and two battle focused units : destroyers and battle-cruisers. The mothership is the only ship capable of creating such behemoths. Destroyers are quite obvious and are meant to be like boulders rolling from afar but battle-cruisers are definitely devastators. They are able to have 5 strike crafts docked with them and give an additional 2 module slots. These guys are definitely the bad boys of the game. Resources are harvested by specialty units called resource collectors. Resource collectors need to be told where to go in order to start their operation. They may stop in their tracks when there are no more resources left in an area and will most likely have to be told to move on to somewhere else. A mobile resource center can be created to cover more area and allow your resource collectors to submit their resources there instead of going all the way back to the mothership. Resource collectors are also able to repair units and structures but require additional research to unlock this ability. Research upgrades are available for a lot of units to improve their defense, mobility or offense. New unit types also have to be unlocked through research. Additionally, a few units will have special abilities available to unlock (such as corvettes laying out mines).The visuals are pretty good. Definitely an upgrade from the original. The sounds are good and provide a decent atmosphere. The explosions sound varied as well as the weapons. The dialogue is as intriguing as the story line. Honestly, going from the old graphics to this is really enjoyable. I feel though you could have done just a bit more to make it that much more appealing to the eyes.Overall, a good game. The ability to fight in three dimensions coupled with it's unique approach to creating units makes the game poke it's head from the crowd. I found the price to be a bit steep and bought this game off a humble bundle. I think if it's for sale under $15 and you're a real space fan, you'll like it. If you're looking for ground breaking space RTS/battle simulator, this isn't it.RATING : 7.35/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots :  Ship size varies greatly in this game You can target sub-systems What the view looks like after pressing space Even though I'm a little overzealous in saying that the graphics could have been better, it's still pretty good Welcoming a destroyer to this world The camera is quite flexible "

												I played this game back in 2000, and it consumed a good part of my freshman year of high school. It's a perfect storm of perfection - perfect music, perfect crackling, crisp audio comm from your pilots, perfect sound effects.The graphics in this remake are stunning, just as the original game was stunning back in 1999. Seeing the re-meshed, re-textured ships for the first time again as they fly out of the Mothership's bays is like greeting old friends after years away. I may have actually shed a tear of delight when I saw the good ol' bug-shaped Salvage Corvette, ready to steal slow moving Ion Cannon Frigates at my command.If you like RTS games, there is no question that you should get this game. If you've never played Homeworld, you're in for a treat.(my only downside is that Gearbox seems to have been a bit overzealous in bringing Homeworld2 engine-based strategy into Homeworld. There are plenty of threads about this elsewhere. I'd prefer if they patch the game to make the original game remaster as close to, well, the original game, as possible).			"

												Well, 15yrs later I returnSadly, I think its a game that was probably better in the past, due to its ground breaking nature. Its lost none of the appeal however, but kept the bugs you had long forgotten!Returns are the bad formations, when your forces are slow to move and allocate firepower, that allow the AI's smaller forces deal more damage to you. Firing at salvaged ships. Building fighters that do nothing. However, you get to relive the story mode, which gives you love for the faceless race you represent. You travel the known galaxy in your attempt to see your old Homeworld. You get to feel the immense power of having a Heavy Cruiser. It really is about reliving your past with this game, is it worth the money you spent to get the game? probably not, but thats not the point of this game. You write the story as your people return home!In all, I'm enjoying the game, its nice to see a game where just building a massive force doesn't mean victory. Brute force means nothing if your taking damage from a Super Nova. Or when your larger ships become enemies versus a ghost ship. Then you get to try to fight enemies on your terms, using your tactics...which mostly involve salvage corvettes....I would say get the game, its past of your past, and with Steam Workshop, the endless mods should add hours of gameplay.Pro'sImpressive and heartwarming storylineA 3D enviroment Con'sDodgy formations which can give the enemy the advantageStrange ship discissionsHarvasting system is very strange and just plain annoying, as they spend ages getting place to place. and when you hyperspace, you are given ALL the RU's on the map, making the harvasting of little point (the hyperspace tip is fantastic for the super nova mission, where you can lose all harvasters)			"

												Spoiler Free Review: Once you step into the realm of Homeworld, a flood of memories will hit you like an onslaught, meeting an old friend, a friend who is out to kill you.  I remember the game being hard, but I totally forgot how hard.  If you like a challenge, this is the game.  It is both engaging and challenging.  You're not playing for the story, which is contrived, but it's the game play where this game shines. Controls are excellent for moving in 3D space, and the graphics are quite an improvement over the originals.  I wish the graphics were a bit better though, they aren't the best of what is currently out there, a little room for improvement.Be prepared for a challenge.  You'll replay levels that you won just so you can have a few more ships and resources left over to give you an edge in the next mission.   Rating: 8 out of 10. Recommended.

												Do you remember 1999? I doDon't buy this in its current state if you played and liked the original.If you are buying this game for HW2 then I would recommend it. HW1 remastered does not play or feel like the original, it feels like HW2. I played HW1 soo much when it first came out and I loved it. I  have finished HW! remastered version and the bugs  drove me crazy. All the bugs you have read about elsewhere on the internet are true. On top of that it is not the original game, why remove fighter fuel? it added so much tactical depth. It does not feel like HW1 rather the engine of HW2 with the story of HW1after the first patch the game is a lot better but not great.			"

This is Ender's Game meets Civilization by way of Starcraft-all the way back in 1999.For those of you who played the originals, it's Homeworld with better graphics.Very intuitive controls, and you have the option to play the originals OR the remastered versions.The AI can be somewhat wonky, but it isn't a deal-breaker.Having played the original Homeworld a lot back in the day, it's refreshing to play it again after a long hiatus.  The reason why my time is so low on this is because Steam doesn't register playtime when I'm not hooked up to the internet.I definitely recommend it.   "

												Homeworld is my favorite game. That said, I can't help being disappointed with the treatment of Homeworld 1 in the Remastered Collection. The game is buggy as hell. Formations no longer work, strike craft are now useless, and the tactics settings no longer work properly. There are more (!) game breaking bugs than in the original. I thought 'remastered' meant improved. It's not a good deal for thirty bucks if only one of the two games included works right :/			"

												I remember when I first played Homeworld in 99. It impressed with it's captivating storytelling, visuals and soundtrack. It was the best space 3d RTS anyone knew at that time.Remastered version has all the great aspects of the game intact (mechanics, UI friendliness and controls of HW2, epic soundtrack) but where it really delivers is even more tuned narration and suberb graphical overhaul (light rays, shaders, textures of immense quality, motion blur, bloom and depth of field effects).This is a legendary gem, carefully polished and brought out to public once more to grace it's status of still being one of the, if not the best space 3d RTS game made to date. Homeworld is deep, captivating, incredibly atmospheric and now stunningly beautiful aswell with Steam multiplayer support. Only downside is that Cataclysm (standalone expansion of original game) has not been remastered and classic version is not included in the package. Homeworld is one of the best games I have ever played and still is unbeaten champion in it's genre 16 years from its original release. Use the chance to experience the game in all of its glory. It is that good! /props to Gearbox9.5/10			"

												I cannot in good conscience recommend this ""remaster"" of Homeworld 1 & 2. The new graphics are fantastic (when they aren't glitching out) but the game takes a step backwards in almost every other regard.Fuel consumption is gone, which while convenient, almost entirely negates the necessity of support frigates and carriers. Fighter screens now break formation at the first sign of enemy contact, and tactical stances are seemingly nonexistent.Some aesthetic flourishes from the original have been removed, things only a vet would notice. Research stations no longer rotate idly. The game automatically collects all resources between missions, which bugs the heck out of me. One of my favorite atmospheric touches in the original was the time spent quietly and patiently gathering minerals after a fight. The sluggishness of this process gave you time to reflect on the story, made you admire the beautiful outer space vistas and felt like something a real life space commander would have to endure. It was cool. Now the game just slurps everything up after it's too late to make any use of it.The song ""Homeworld"" by Yes has also been removed from the credits, due to legal reasons. Give me a break.What bothers me the most, however, is the complete removal of title cards for in-game speech. A nifty rectangular box with a character portrait used to pop up whenever someone talked to you. Now it's just a boring line of floating text.Some of the in-game triggers no longer function. In the last mission, Captain Elson never showed up with his relief fleet and I was left to attack the enemy flagship on my own. And before I forget: Every other time I played the game I'd be greeted with flickering textures or see-through ships. No matter how many graphical options I switched on or off, raised or lowered, nothing could be done. It was distracting. Unacceptable for a release priding itself on its updated graphics.Lastly, the game just feels dumbed-down and generally easier.Basically, Gearbox just ""upgraded"" every design aspect of Homeworld 1 to that of Homeworld 2, a game which, despite the graphical overhall, inspired ship designs and stellar soundtrack, always failed to capture my imagination. The lack of manual Hyperspace is ultimately what killed it for me.Perhaps the most grievous sin in this ""remaster"" is the absense of the best game in the Homeworld series: Cataclysm. Yes, I understand they've ""lost"" the source code. How hard would it be to rip a copy off the disc and include it in the download? If you haven't played Cataclysm, you are missing out. It is one of the best real-time strategy games ever made, and probably the only title in the genre to fall under the unique label, ""horror-RTS"".If you have never played a Homeworld game then this is a must buy, as classic versions of both 1 & 2 are included. If you were already a fan, like me, skip it or wait for a proper patch.			"

												The term ""HD Remake"" is thrown around a lot these days and conveys almost the same amount of infamy as ""Early Access"". Homeworld Remastered, however, is an absolute exception. Gearbox seemed to have made it their goal to stay as true to the original as possible, while still carrying it over to 2015. Very successfully so, I might add!Quick overview:Homeworld's core game mechanics have been entirely preserved for Homeworld Remastered, down the smallest detail. It is delightful to see how extremely well Homeworld's rather unique approach to 3D real time strategy has aged.Graphics have been revamped while absolutely keeping in line with the game's distinctive art style. It's beyond anything I expected. NB: The original Homeworld 1 user interface has been forfeited in favour of Homeworld 2's much leaner and less cluttered UI. Smart move, really.Sound and music, both in terms of recording quality and ingame sound engine, had major overhauls. Very noticeable. After all, they got none other than Paul Ruskay himself, who scored Homeworld's original soundtrack.This ""remastered"" version was clearly done by people who appreciated the original game for what it represented back in 1999 (and many years to follow). They gave it a loving, respectful, much desired and much needed facelift to bring it to modern systems.The result is nothing short of stunning. Players new to the series are absolutely recommended to take a closer look at the revival of an RTS cult classic; Homeworld veterans will immediately feel at home and - as in my case - nostalgic as hell.10/10, easily.

												TLDR: Wait a few months for gearbox to fix it or for the mod community to fix it.If you were a huge fan like myself you may be dissappointed with the First homeworld remastered game. As that was the main one I was looking forward to. It makes a great first impression till you start to realize that the hotkeys are now more complicated then they were in the past. So it feels like you are trying to dance with the keyboard. Having units autotarget friendlies and enemies is a tedieous task. The worst example is with repair vessels. Before you could tell them to fix any damaged ships you selected. Now they only focus on a single ship till you tell them to change. Sphere formations guarding a vunerable ship was a great startegy in the past. Not anymore. If you tell a ship to guard another. It would be distracted by something as a single probe and forget about its target you told to guard. Because of this I have the odd feeling that is why they decreased the number of enemy ships you have to fight on some missions. Because they must have been like  ""Oh crap we made this game harder then the orignial to play. Maybe we should give them a tiny bit of slack if we want them to micromanaged every single ship. Also you know how you could easily select formation of ships in the orignal as well? not anymore. Now you select every single ship of that type on screen when you double click. And not just the formation you want to seperatly move. That is all I found so far before I gave up and replayed the orignal to make sure my memory of how it controlled and played was the same. Sure enough the orignal plays as great as it always has but this remastered edition feels like 1 step forward and 2 steps back. Wait a month or two before buying and maybe gearbox might patch some of the old gameplay features back in. If not we will have to rely on the mod community to help fix the remastered versions. So far they been doing a good job but to fix everything is going to take awhile. If they ever make a homeworld 3 I will not buy it because gearbox tricked me into thinking it would be fun. They made it look pretty but not fun. If you don't beleive me and having troubles with the remastered version. Go give the orignal version a try and you will see how much better it controls.Only nice thing with this collection is the inclusion of the orignal 2 games to make up for the fact they dropped the ball in various areas.

												Where to begin? Homeworld 1 and 2 probably form the basis for the late THQ's success in the RTS genre; an excellent story driven campaign, X,Y,Z axis space combat, an epic sense of scale in relation to said combat and one of the best soundtracks to any game, not to mention the stylish cut scenes that convey the story to the player. However the remastered collection has reworked both titles (HW1 and HW2) in an improved homeworld 2 engine and thus delivers what we all wanted; HW1 in high definition jaw dropping glory. Also players can now enjoy a combined multiplayer experience with the factions from both games available to play against one another; so if you ever wondered who was the more hard core out of the Tiadan and the Vagyr you can now find out! Last and by no means least the steam workshop adds mods from many diverse sci fi franchises such as star wars, star trek, BSG, mass effect, wing commander etc etc. Therefore in conclusion I am rather grateful that nothing crazy like Homeworld 3 was attempted as the original two games have been unsurpassed for over a decade - until now.

												The good-Mothership-A classic restored. Homeworld is a gem i regret missing out back in its hey day. There is a reason why its the Granddaddy of space RTS.-RTS is rock solid. You assign control groups into several different formations. There is a good reason to delay finishing a mission to harvest resources. Surviving untis carry over to the next mission and each has a purpose, some have abilities, but each has strenghs and weakness to consider. -Each level bring a unique obstacle to overcome. -Some enemy units and tactics can feel cheap but preperation and good strategy will always win out. It helps to be patient and methodical and it feels tremendous when you overcome.-Tactical overlay is awesome and i wish more space RTS had it. -Strong narrative. The lore is an interesting take on space fantasy and the far future. Its dramatic, somber, compelling and well paced.-Remastered visuals are pretty. Explosions are vibrant and explody. Wear and tear show up on selected ships and debris liters space. You can pause the action to take snapshots if compelled.-The audio is outstanding. The voice work, sound effects, the OST in particular is, in my opinion, the best in this genre.The bad-The game can and will crash. Its a given with games today sure but when you're  30mins+ into a mission that's going well nothing is more irratating than an unexpected crash.-Unit management can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Despite ordering a group to be defensive and gaurd another unit (which you assume they would hold their ground and fire at incoming enemy) they'll go off and chase an enemy and get slaughtered.You really have to consider what all units are doing at once which gets tricky when the fighting heats up. Just know that units you assign to gaurd WILL fly off to assault what the gaurded is ordered to attack. Formations is key.-♥♥♥♥ the Junkyard Dog.-Some mission objectives might not register despite having done excatly as instructed forcing you to restart Steam or at worst redo the whole mission.The ugly-My system more than meets the requirements but the game can get glitchy in long play sessons. RUs and captured units can dissapear from the screen but be in game.-Units can freeze in place-Acheivements, whether you care or not, might not unlock forcing you to redo missions. Despite the bugs if you're an RTS fan, Homeworld is definitely worth playing and worth the price of admission. Thank you Gearbox and Blackbird for restoring this classic. Thank you Relic			"

												Homeworld is two games I have spent hours and hours playing. From the (incredible) main campaigns to the excellent mods for them. So Remastered comes and polishes them up (and ports HW1 to the HW2 engine) which seems like the perfect of perfects. Except its not. Except it is.HW1 mechanics are flawed. Badly. Sometimes hilariously. The port of the game over to the HW2 engine is not as smooth as I hoped it would be. They nerfed the salvette everything strategy, but the HW2 AI is kind of laughable in HW1's tactical situations anyway, plus the addition of default ""jump with all map resources"" from HW2 takes out the need for fleet tooling and resource op micromanagement which was kind of a staple for me in the first game. But it does (largely) function like it should. Homeworld 1 still feels like Homeworld 1. And it. is. glorious. But where remastered really shines is with Homeworld 2. Designed for the engine already the gameplay and visuals are just absolutely flooring if you've played the game back in the day. It's easily the best looking space RTS. Even beating out Sins. Gearbox nailed the graphics and sound for both packages and the game is gorgeous and plays very well on my system, even in large engagements. There's rough areas, MP is broken, it took a while for me to even get the game to launch, and HW1's mechanics are iffy at parts. However this is still the Homeworld I remember, redone in highest quality that could command AAA prices. I have no personal ties to Cataclysm though, so I can't comment on that too much. I know its some kind of hugemassive problem for some people. They shouldn't look this gifthorse in the mouth though. 10/10 AI still reks me at mission 3 of HW2 :|			"

												As much reverence as I have for Homeworld, this game feels like it's in beta.Broken damage from ion cannons and capital ships, pitifully low salvage corvette cap, fighter pathing issues that will make you throw your monitor, dumbed down missions, dumbed down resource collection (rendered moot after misison five due to auto collect), dumbed down AI (refusing to use capital ships to defend primary missions objectives, not using gravity well generators, not using cloak generators), and most importantly, the game RANDOMLY HAVING MISSION OBJECTIVES GO BLANK, which renders your current mission unable to be completed.That was fun, after I took three hours to capture the entire enemy fleet on mission 14, Bridge of Sighs, and my objectives went blank, refusing to let me finish the mission despite destroying the inhibitor array.The game feels watered down and panders to the ""can't be bothered to figure it out"" type of gamer. Much as I dislike badmouthing studios, this is the reason gearbox is sketchy. It honestly feels like an EA product: well intentioned but relentlessly frustrating. If steam had better customer support I'd try to get my money back.The pretty skins and good memories of creepy space don't outweigh the absolute frustration of trying to bumble my way through this trainwreck.

												I played the original game way back in 2000. I played the two sequels when they came out, as well. I loved them to bits. But then I heard Gearbox was doing a remastering of the games. Say what you will about Gearbox, they hit it out of the park with this collection. I nearly cried when I started Homeworld up for the first time in a decade and a half.The good: Basically everything. The audio was remastered based on the original recordings and it all sounds incredible. The graphics have been updated and look gorgeous. The UI now using the Homeworld 2 UI for both games, which is a massive improvement over the original Homeworld.The bad: No one knows what happened to the source code for Homeworld: Cataclysm, which was a cool, albeit strange, spin off from Barking Dog Stuidios. Therefore, the Collection is, in my opinion, incomplete. Maybe we'll get lucky and the source code will turn up.The takeaway: I had felt that Homeworld had held up pretty well, given it's age. I still think that, but the Remastered Collection brought the game to being as close to perfect as a game can get.			"

												The game that redefined a genre, 3D Space RTS. I can't recommend this any more. This game was my childhood and to see it remastered with updated graphics just brings tears to my eyes. Homeworld will forever be that pioneering game that made space beautiful to everyone.  "

												If you had asked me to review this Remastered version of Homeworld back when it released.  I wouldn't have rated it very positively.  The big problem I had with the game then was that the Homeworld 1 assets and campaign were superimposed on the mechanics and engine of the 2nd game.  Unfortunately Homeworld 2 changed the way fighters were built and controlled from the first game.  This creates a game-breaking problem in the Homeworld 1 campaign (which is worth playing on the original release).The latest 2.0 update to Homeworld: Remastered has largely fixed those issues.  Fighter formations and behaviors for Homeworld 1 fighters have returned which is crucial to success in the campaign.  I have yet to try this in Multiplayer to see how this affects balance.  That being said, I'm very happy with the update Gearbox has made to this game with regards to the single player campaign and I look very much forward to completing it again in the remastered edition.

												(only addressing HW1R, not the others in the set)A beautiful reskin of the original, but a surprising amount of gameplay bugs are pretty readily apparent:- formations do not work AT ALL: ships can be moved into one, but they disintegrate entirely upon combat, and strike craft are now almost a complete waste of money since they get individually picked off way too fast.- no evasive tactics mode to harass/delay enemy units- salvaged ships can't be retired until the next map- friendly units will fire on ships on their way to be salvaged- salvage corvettes can't intelligently divide up multi-ship captures anymore- healing units don't watch over not-yet-damaged units correctlyOther surprising design choices:- research cost a bit of money now (OK)- LOTS more resources on maps, including salvagable capital wreck scap, means things feel MUCH easier now- strike craft no longer use fuel, reducing need for forward support frigate/carrier deploymentThis game need one or more patches BADLY.I will be happy to change my review to recommend it once the issues get fixed, since it's still a solid design at its core.

												Ive been playing homeworld since about 2003-04 and I always loved both 1 and 2, I am extremely happy to see a game series I dearly loved in my yonger years revived with better graphics and easier modability and brought to better systems. For anyone who does not know of this classic game, it is, in my opinion one of the best space RTS games in history, being one of the first to use 3d aswell. The classic versions (which are included in the remastered) are still worth getting into, even just for the old nostalgia. The game can be a little buggy at times but I havn't noticed anything majorly gamebreaking in my experiance, overall I would rate a 9.5/10			"

												I know there are far more detailed reviews out there, and far more emotional, too. I'm not trying to compete with those, just expressing my personal feelings.For those that haven't played HW1, just two words: go ahead. This won't disappoint, and you won't even notice the things us ♥♥♥♥♥♥s are unhappy about. For the likes of me, however, here's what to expect.First off, this is not Homeworld 1. Close, much closer than expected, but still no. All those tiny details will make you feel something isn't quite right, no matter how well or poorly you remember the original. The UI, of course, is probably the worst offender, feeling too modern, too... I just don't know the right words. I guess the UI aesthetics have changed greatly over time, and I am sad to see Gearbox going the HW2 route when it came to styling (hopefully, it's not as clunky as HW2 was, but the overall UI art is on the same track). But this is a minor issue, and once you get over it, you will notice it is quite playable. Make no mistake, the old one wasn't perfect either, it was just much more ""in theme"".Next thing you notice (unless, you crash on mission load as I did numerous times, in that case make sure you aren't overgenerous selecting texture quality), it looks gorgeous (albeit, a bit too ""sleek"" when compared to the first game. That is just a feeling, and it comes from the game defaulting to HW2 colour scheme, nothing else. Once you select original HW1 colours you're back with the old feel of ""newbies to space"". It is a great thing, really.They did choose to port HW1 into HW2 engine, which made the game lose some of its original features, like simulated projectiles, and it fails miserably at holding formations, plus there are differences in resources available, ship costs, oh, and research now costs too. That all said, I am glad to say I didn't pick most of these things till I've been told about them. And, what's most important to me, the original feeling of being alone out there, a small island of life in the middle of cold indifferent space, it all has translated well into the remake.Furthermore, most of these changes weren't there to ""make the game better"", rather because the new engine wasn't capable of supporting these things (although, research costs seem like a strange thing, it's not that difficult to set cost to 0, while timers are all there already). And, while it may be a minor thing to some, fighters SHOULD cost 55, not 100.And assault frigates were at 625, unless I'm mistaken.Ok, enough, I'm just being too picky. This is a fine remake, none the less. It actually tries hard to be as close to the original as possible (although, heaven knows, we'd love to see nothing but new textures here). It is far more honest to the original than X-COM was to its grandfather, X-COM: Enemy Unknown, the latter I'd call a major disappointment - you don't make an excellent game better by screwing with it. This one isn't screwed nearly as much.In the end, is it worth playing? It sure is for me - I did try to replay the original again, but that game has aged visually far too much. There are two space games for me that define the 90's. MOO II and HW1. Sadly, 3D does age faster. Playing this doesn't make me cringe as bad, as trying the original would. And yes, it is an enjoyment. Maybe there is this uncanny valley for remakes as well, when the original and the remake are just too close to be called a different game, yet are still not 100% the same, and this would fall into it. But, again, HW:Rem is almost where the original is. X-COM was right in the middle of that abyss.Be a bit more open-minded about it, and you'll love it. Just don't forget you can't enter the same water twice.			"

												Really short review. Probably won't update in the future.The whole package is great, especially for me since I'd never played the originals. It's important to note for Classic players, though, that there are a few changes to ship behavior and mission structure in HW1R(remastered). Aggressive/Evasive tactics are out, literally removed, and some of the missions appear to have been nerfed for some reason, the Kadesh in particular. The game also hosts a dynamic difficulty setting based on your fleet size, though the specifics of its behavior evade me. Strike group behavior is also altered, making behaviors like setting a Defender squadron to Sphere Formation and guard your target behave differently from Classic. The way damage and accuracy are rolled when ships fire are also different (iirc, it's based far more on dice rolling now).Why is it like that? Well, HW1R runs in the HW2 engine.That being said, I enjoyed HW1R a lot. The story is very vague and built on a lot of mysticism and prophetic themes. The game itself was enjoyable, although I wish that the AI on ships were far more intelligent. You do have to babysit your units (in HW2, too).HW2's a lot better as a gameplay experience though, although its story is a bit less interesting. I felt like a greater number of my ships were valuable throughout the course of the game, vs HW1, where the majority of the units you can build become obsolete very quickly.HW1 had a huge pacing problem because there was no form of time-compression to harvest resources, leading to post-mission lulls lasting over 30 minutes at a time where all you're doing is waiting for utility ships to mine up the money. HW2 solved the problem by crediting you with the resources when a mission was completed, and its overall campaign pacing is much more intense and demanding, definitely welcome, than HW1.I wish Cataclysm was in the remaster pack, but apparently Gearbox couldn't secure the source code for the game.Lastly, I haven't played multiplayer.

												I sit here at my computer desk in the wee hours of the morning after just completing the first part of the Homeworld: Remastered games that were recently released on Steam, and as I type away I find it hard to come to the correct words for what I just experienced, so here’s me trying to sum it up for you with what to me is no longer a game, or a footnote on a sheet to check out and play sometime in the future without really ever getting to it, but an idea that was realised in it’s fullest potential and is now at the public’s door once again.Let’s get one thing out the door right away, I never played the original Homeworld. I was too young at the time to really decide what I wanted to play, and what I did play was mostly Starcraft: Brood War (Still in my top games of all time) or rummage through the bucket of Lego in my corner.  So when the news that Homeworld was getting a remaster… I didn’t really celebrate at all and I certainly did not pre-order out the door like I do for way too many games.  Though as the ball kept turning and the time of it’s release drew nearer and nearer I grew infatuated with Homeworld, it’s lore and story that drew me instantly into it, and the sheer scale and effort being put into a game that was cracking on by now.  So this Monday, which is Monday the 2nd of March (I am writing this review on the 7th, in the early hours) I bought it as soon as I could, and here is the result.Homeworld is now what I consider the best story told in gaming.Or at least up there with the greats, of course.The way it was told to me, and how it slowly started to show me this lore that spanned back millions of years in the games universe, the different races and characters I met along the way all felt amazing and diverse, each one beautifully voice acted and all done with space ships on a screen.  There’s no portraits, we aren’t given a face, it’s voices we go on in this experience, and holy hell it knocks it out of the park with that regard.It’s game play (While frustrating at times) is brilliant fun to toy with, there’s nothing more satisfying then launching a full Missile Destroyer attack on the unsuspecting foe below as your attack bombers soar in to deal the final blow, it’s god damned addicting and the fun just comes from finding the ways to out manoeuvre your enemies in the slyest of ways.And finally it’s the music, and how it complements each scene perfectly to the point I was left in awe at what was beset upon my eyes, to the point where this game brought me to tears with the myriad of feelings it produced.  Emotion is key with this tittle, and for the first time in a good long while I was feeling it while playing a game, the twinge of my heart as my favourite Frigate bit the dust, or the cut scenes I will not spoil.Homeworld is an experience for everyone, RTS and non RTS fan alike need to play this game and make it through to the end for the most satisfying ending in gaming.  This game gets my rating of ‘Bury it with me so I can take it to hell’			"

												Be careful before you buy.If you were expecting a complete port of the original homeworld with a graphical update then this is not the game you're looking for, save your money and play the classic version. There's features in the remastered HW1 that aren't working as intended, Tactics and Formations are broken and are (apparently) not likely to be fixed. It is impossible for anyone who played HW1 to not notice that these things are broken and any claim that they're working as intended, or that it doesn't negatively effect gameplay is patently false. Listen, I'm not a purist but the developers had to of known this wasn't working correctly. Why they couldn't have been up front with people and say that there were certain things they couldn't port and let us decide whether or not we wanted to make the trade offs for the better graphics? Probably because they now have my 30 dollars and don't really give a crap. That sort of dishonest buy-now-patch-later crap is what is ruining PC gaming.The game is playable although buggy, and from what I am reading HW2 is working as intended, but not going to lie when I say that HW1 remaster is a let down.

Homeworld 1 Classic & RemasteredThe original unaltered Homeworld 1 Classic is part of the collection & worth every cent. Homeworld Classic is a masterpiece. Homeworld Remastered is a mess. Gearbox Software threw HW1 models into HW2 engine & looked what sticked. The result is one amazingly good looking game with game mechanics broken beyond repair. HW Remastered is a broken, quick & dirty assembled piece of scrapmetal.Homeworld 2 Classic & RemasteredThe only game in this collection that benefits from the Remaster is Homeworld 2. You can play HW2 Classic & HW2 Remastered & you won't see any difference in game mechanics but can enjoy prettier graphics.ConclusionYou have two options here. You either buy the Remaster on a very high discount & only play the original games, or you give Gearbox the middle finger and don’t support their business philosophy to screw their customers over every freaking time.

												I just want to thank you, Gearbox, for messing with one of the best game that I had played in my life! Indeed you improved greatly the graphics, but in exchange you broke the AI. Formation, for example, only work when the ships are standing, but at the first shot the ships start to doing whatever they want, and this will gonna ruin any tactic that you had planned. And there is the Repair Corvette, whose dream is to be a fighter at all cost, even you giving the guard command repeatedly. If you are a fan of HW, prepare to get disappointed and, probably, you gonna pay $35 for playing HW classic version (that I already have in CD).			"

												I love Homeworld. I read about, and waited for the original. I managed to get into the original beta (I have the CD framed). I played this game for hours and days on end. I was depressed when it turned out that the remote turrets were op in mass, and a created nearly unbeatable playing strategy. I felt like a hero when I found a way to beat it. I endured many losses, and more victories playing friends online. I once managed to steal an entire enemy players capital ship fleet with my own fleet of salvage corvettes and a cloaking frigate. THIS, This was Homeworld. Strategy, intuitive interface, as may ships as your computer could handle, and ships that did what you told them.This is not what Gearbox released. They didn't understand the game they were remastering, and because of this, they created an atrocity compare to the original. It is as if they tried to recreate the Mona Lisa using Crayons. They didn't get it. I was afraid this was going to happen when Team Pixel lost the bid for the THQ Bankruptcy. They got it, they understood what made this game so amazing. I was right to fear. GearBox didn't understand; they thought that they could just make it pretty, and as simple as possible. They didn't get that what made Homeworld great wasn't the beauty of the game (though it was spectacular visually), but rather the way everything functioned. If you never played the original, you won't know what you are missing. You will probably enjoy the game just fine.  If you did, don't bother, this game will just make you sad. It will kill off part of your youth. P.S. Most of the hours I have played were just trying to get the game to work on three monitors. "

Graphics and audio are really well done and atmospherical however unit AI, formations and controls are just as wonky and 2000 like the original. Hell even the Salvage-Corvette powerplay to trick the force-limit has been carried over. All in all 9/10. Would have wished for a bit more improvement on the AI and Interface-Front but for 30 bucks I can't complain too much. Loved this game back then, still love it now and I happily throw this kinda money at people allowing me to re-play one of my old-time-favourites on a modern 64-bit machine with upgraded visuals.			"

												Art.If you plan on playing this to the end (which you should), search for the restored credits with the song from Yes, you can find it on youtube, as a Homeworld veteran, finishing this game after more than 10 years and seeing those credits roll up with that song almost brought a tear to my eye.The new patch fixed up pretty much everything wrong with the gameplay.The result is one of the most amazing experiences you can have with a videogame.""We follow the sun, we follow the sun, we follow the sun...""

												My only regret is that I cannot update my Steam account to show the 16 years of game time I had with both games. It would be around 400 hours at the least. Homeworld is a serie like Wing Commander or FreeSpace but for RTS. Story and plot are top notch and even seven years the first Homeworld was considered graphically good looking..game ahead of tis time.			"

												In the past I've heard a bit about how cool Homeworld was, and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed. Being a big fan of the RTS genre, when I heard about this game I immediately wanted to try it out, but alas, it was unavailable. So when I saw ""Homeworld Remastered"" on Steam's front page a few weeks ago it went straight to my wishlist, and I ended up buying it the day before release.I was concerned that I might have impulsively spent $30 on something that wasn't really worth it, but now I have no idea why.Having played around 4 hours of this game over the two days since release, I've only gotten more endeared to the game and how epic it feels. Building a huge fleet of frigates, destroyers, and battlecruisers and then proceeding to wipe out some poor AI... Awesome.Some Quick Pros and ConsPROS:-- Phenomenal feel, moving ships around in 3D space doesn't feel confusing or difficult. While I have yet to employ it significantly, I'm sure it will make things quite interesting.-- AI is, for the most part, pretty smart. While it makes some dumb moves from time to time it doesn't give up unless all is lost.-- Oh my word, the visuals are incredible! Next time you have a large group of fighters engaging the enemy, select one of them, focus and zoom in. Large-scale, small-scale, everything looks beautiful, even on my puny GT 630.CONS:-- There's some minor bugs, like when moving ships I'll occasionally lose my mouse cursor for a second or two. Every so often the sound skips and repeats 1-2 second snippets of a clip.NEUTRAL:-- Gameplay moves a bit slower. It requires patience to build up a sizable attack force and deploy it to wipe out the enemy, but once that combat starts you really grasp the benefit of taking the time to work.I may expand on this review as I spend more time playing the game, but if you're still doubting whether you want to buy this, let me eliminate any doubt. The Homeworld Remastered Collection is an awesome piece of work. For $35, you get an incredible RTS, its sequel, and the remastered versions of both. Hopefully Gearbox will provide a demo at some point, but if you're a fan of the RTS genre, purchasing this shouldn't be a question.			"

												An epic and artful strategy with finely tuned mechanics and plenty of replay value. Includes 2 distinct single-player campaigns and 4 (but more like 3) playable races in multiplayer mode. Recent updates have helped to clarify the roles of each unit in the game and to allow for different play styles. Though the online community is relatively small compared to other AAA titles, the game rewards those who come back to it with depth and variety, making it worth the asking price in my opinion.			"

												I loved Homeworld when it was first out (yes, I am old).   The remastered version did rekindle that space-opera feeling that the hope of my species lay in the balance and the balance was significantly tilted toward oblivion.   The game's story arch is as beautiful as the remastering, and if you have not played the game, it is worthy of your time.However, beautiful the Remastered version is beautiful, the game crashes on me continuously in missions, which I am now too old to shrug off without comment.   When life was good and time an ocean infront of me, playing and replaying missions and games was ok... I expected more from Gearbox's remastering to cure bugs, not add to them.			"

												The entire feel of the orginal games has been lost in a failed attempt at remastering them. Somehow even after considerable time after its release, the collection still feels broken. Pros: -Everything is beautiful compared to the very aged graphics of the originals.Cons: -The AI is buggy at best. HW 1, Mission 5 I had enemy intereceptors doing loops across the map endlessly. Other times, your own units failed to listen to orders at random. -Somehow units are defaulting themselves to passive stance, and while they do stay in formation, all they do is stay, and die. -In HW1 remastered, you are punished unexpectingly for building up your fleet in the previous mission. Mission 3: Captured a bunch of Turanic Raider corvettes in previous mission only to find 6 Taiidan assault frigates obliterating the cryopods I was to save. Redid mission 2, scrapped all corvettes, 2 frigates in mission 3 second time around. Wtf? This happens again in mission 5 where the AI throws 5+ destroyers at you when you cannot even build one at all. Well, that escalated quickly, so much for preparing ahead of time for the battle. -There are many other cons I haven't the time to write a novel to explain.			"

												Home World series had (The only real one) the new genre (back the late '90) and the last so far. It was an amazing sure the space didn't have the up and down, but the 3 Homeworld games had an addictive playablity. Also, it had the best, and most enjoyable game. I played it fron start to finish a couple of dosen times.This, the remastered one, is truly, brought it up to date. The game is basically the same as it did, except for the quality and some ""additions""/""improvte"" in the game. I had my doubts, but a few hours playing and it really worth the price( a bit low if any).  The are a few ""bugs"" in the game, but nothing I saw that caused it to crash. The 93% may have been the old one, but I'd say with things, over 85% at least!			"

												I honestly don't see how anyone could not recommend this game, unless they're some opinionated COD kiddo who wants everything handed to them.This is without a doubt, the best game of the decade 10/10(I'll probably even rank it higher than Fallout 4, if that game ever comes).pros:- difficult gameplay, actually strategy required.- ships. lots. of. ships.- customization- new graphics(the game was already fantastic graphically wise back in 2003 - HW2)- campaign isn't recurring missions like most RTS games now a days. Every mission is unique.- 3D gameworld. I honestly can't think of another RTS with a 3D gameworld(besides Star Ruler, but even that isn't really a 3D field). The closest thing otherwise is EVE Online(by 3D I mean, ships aren't locked to a single axis-field, such as sins of a solar empire would have).- [-VFG-] Approved!cons:- stock up on food, you may lose your job and never want to leave your computer, despite your bloodshot, blistering eyes.- You aren't handed thing. You actually have to think(This is why COD kiddos would negative rate the game...)- old mods like Homeworld 2 Complex, don't work on the remaster... yet....			"

												I have had a great time so far with this game. Kind of Battlestat Galactica-ish. After watching BSG on NetFlix I like to play a few rounds of this game.

They are just sitting there? Hmmm, must be the EPS manifold induction chambers acting up again. Prepare to release and regrapple when Jordy has it fixed!""Well, I may mix sci fi shows a bit, but so what, it is MY head!  Anyway, I really am enjoying this game.

												What can I say....I played Homeworld 15 years ago and now I remember why it was one of the best games of that era.I can say that on a 980ti hybrid SLI configuration this game is even more incredible in the highest settings at 4k UHD. No other game captures my imagination like Homeworld. I can almost see all the desperate people in those ships as I help them reach their final destination. My advice would be to read the back story from the original manual that shipped with the game 15 years ago. It has a complete history leading up to the events in the game.Homeworld is one of the reasons we call games works of art.			"

Posted: December 28, 2015
												Before I get into the review I want to address the criticisms of the game's units. There's been a long standing criticism that the game's ""rock, paper, scissors"" gameplay, where everything has a counter. It appears some people are pretty irritated about that. Well, here's the thing: that's warfare. Look at modern militaries today. Everything has a counter. Infantry carry shoulder fired missile systems to destroy vehicles and hard points to remove those threats. Tanks carry both AP and HE rounds to deal with infantry and vehicles. Aircraft can be shot down like nothing by guided missile and surface to air missile systems. Everything has a counter. The game's system for units is actually the more realistic one, believe it or not. So, I don't understand the gripes about it. Just make sure you've got solid recon and you're fine. It's important to note though that even modern militaries have combined arms forces, so don't think that just because you've got the counter to something that you won't get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked. A well rounded, combined arms force, regardless of its composition, is still a big part of your overall fleet strategy. The next thing I want to address is a big gripe I've seen about fighter strategies. With the hindrance given to fighters in the remastered edition, interceptors no longer play a large role in the battle. They're weaker, and that's also realistic. One thing that should be understood is that air superiority and interceptor aircraft are made for a single purpose: to fight other aircraft. Unless a large ship has no support, there's really no reason why you should be using interceptors to attack a large vessel. The fact of the matter is that you're not going to make a dent in the hull of a ship with a massive superstructure, and a hull designed to both take weapons fire and the force of gravity, in the vacuum of space where a hull breach vents an entire compartment, and possibly an explosive decompression. It just isn't logical to believe that you can make that happen. Historically, the Japanese in world war 2 would run suicide kamikaze attack against a large ship, because that's really the only way a fighter can cause a severe amount of damage against something that big, unless it's carrying bombs. The same goes for any unit in the game, where every unit has a purpose, be it specialized attacks against certain kinds of unit or support for the important vessels in your fleet. But, I digress. If you're looking for a deeply strategic and tactical space simulation with an excellent storyline and back story (seriously, it's fantastic!), then you've come to the right place. With mods being ported over to the Remastered collection, you won't have to wait long for your replay ability value to skyrocket. It's even better that, as I write this review, the game is discounted for the winter sales. You should already have this game in your steam library. As far as I'm concerned, it's blown games like Sins of a Solar Empire off the planet.			"

The needle ships you will see in the Garden of Kadesh and Caherdral of Kadesh missions are not as deadly as they were in the original campaing. Overall, the 3-D map combined with epic looking warfare, tons of units and multiple different factions and Ships makes for a great time.

												Homeworlds 1 and 2 are among the best games ever made for PC. This ""Remastered"" version does a good job of preserving that legacy and also adds increased graphic fidelity and performance. The single player missions are engaging, the original's voice acting and artwork remain haunting and first class, the storyline is compelling. If you love science fiction and don't get goose bumps at least once, there is something wrong with you. My sole complaint is that for a game which championed free movement in three dimensional space, that element of strategy is often overlooked in the campaign: like Kahn, your enemies suffer from two-dimensional thinking. But if you've never played Homeworld and you see this game on sale, don't hesitate.Meanwhile multiplayer remains a shabby amateur mess with horrific balance issues, even after a one year wait for patches, and the bulk of the ""community"" is toxic beyond belief, but this is Gearbox and Steam, so you already knew that.

												I missed Homeworld the first time around and I absolutely do not regret picking up the remastered collection. This game is a must for RTS fans for the campaign alone. Having units, tech, and resources arry over from mission to mission makes the campaign feel connected rather than random instances. You actually feel attatched to your mothership in way. The story is actually worth paying attention to and is aided by some great voice-acting, scoring, and a beautiful graphical update. The UI take a bit to get used to but is solid and has options to make long-time Homeworld players feel at home. The implementation of actual 3-D space isn't just for show either, it had me thinking about formations and unit placement in a whole new way.TLDR; There's a reason this game is often considered the best RTS of all time and it isn't nostalgia.

												TL;DR version: If you played the originals or just like RTS games BUY IT!! well worth it.Now as a Fan of the original games. this hit all the right spots for me. Looks amazing, plays amazing and the remastered soundtrack is incredible and i really appreciated the little details that they put in such as the little gun ports on the motherships and carriers where in the original game they just fired from the walls,  as far as bugs go... there were a few on the ship graveyard level (i hate the junkyard dog) but nothing gamebreaking or unfixable by either restarting the level or just quick docking at the end. as far as everything else is concerned, there isnt much to say this is essentially the original games made to look really pretty (and by god does it look good) sound better, but still play the same as the originals with some UI tweaks here and thereone thing i wish they had implemented though is time compression for HW1...would have cut my mining time down alotand while im at it, would have been nice to choose the colour and race of my fleet like the original did but that being said perhaps i didnt see it.if you liked the original Homeworld games.

That certainly changed in time!I knew I'd love this game because it was conceived by Relic and, as a long time RTS fan, I'd never played one set in space before!One minor grievance is probably simply that the callouts for nearly every unit are identical and spoken in a rather monotone voice and the dialogue lacks any humour or personal touch, from my experience. The music is the absolute opposite though, beautiful and with a uniquely middle eastern flavour! I'm definitely lucky enough to be perhaps one of the rarer people here who are able to enjoy these masterpieces now for the first time, with shiny graphics! "

												Only played 3 missions, and im loving this, its stunning, epic and the feel you get from replayingthe original with all that beauty on top is amazing, the people you will find screaming about functions lost and methods of original play changed are i think forgetting they also released the classics untouched except for the ability to run clean on modern systems, and due to the classics being included, every single complaint utterly fails to make me even consider them as a true issue, i am no fanboy, i laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off at the epic fail that was colonial marines, and borderlands feels so damn sull and empty for me i cant play it myself, but this game, regardless of who the releaser was, is fantastic, take the games as they are, and forget the idea of changes cos you have the classics if they bother you.

												TL;DR version: If you played the originals or just like RTS games BUY IT!! well worth it.Now as a Fan of the original games. this hit all the right spots for me. Looks amazing, plays amazing and the remastered soundtrack is incredible and i really appreciated the little details that they put in such as the little gun ports on the motherships and carriers where in the original game they just fired from the walls,  as far as bugs go... there were a few on the ship graveyard level (i hate the junkyard dog) but nothing gamebreaking or unfixable by either restarting the level or just quick docking at the end. as far as everything else is concerned, there isnt much to say this is essentially the original games made to look really pretty (and by god does it look good) sound better, but still play the same as the originals with some UI tweaks here and thereone thing i wish they had implemented though is time compression for HW1...would have cut my mining time down alotand while im at it, would have been nice to choose the colour and race of my fleet like the original did but that being said perhaps i didnt see it.if you liked the original Homeworld games. BUY IT. you wont regret it, i know i don't			"

												Don't look at the number of hours as I have way too many of them off steam ever since 1999 when the first Homeworld brought to the world a new class of RTS and combined it with a great narrative story. In regards to the remastered collection, this is a great value for both old fans and anyone new to Homeworld universe. Two absolutelly great campaigns on modernized engine! RTS games hardly can get much better than this.			"

												Most real-time strategy games I've played are quite lacking in storytelling.  This is not one of those games.  The original creators of this game, Relic (known for the Company of Heroes and Dawn of War Series) are masters of blending storytelling with real-time strategy while not ignoring the importance of replayability through multiplayer.  Homeworld probably has the most poignant stories I've ever seen without the need for fully animated, fully voiced, lip synched characters.Without revealing the plot, I can tell you that you will feel invested for the safety of the people you are commanding and fighting for.On the more technical side, this game was way ahead of its time in 1999 and holds up well for being nearly 20 years old.  The graphical improvements are a welcome change and a more modern, post-dialup era multiplayer lobby is also welcome.  The voice acting of the narrator, the Mothership's computer, and all your units is outstanding and has not changed from the original.The music also deserves an honorable mention for its ability to add to the feeling of every cutscene, every battle, and every dialogue you encounter.  Top notch stuff.  Especially if you like ambient electronic music.The game is not perfect, however.  Like most RTS games from the 90's, it can be heavy in the micromanaging department.    I also have to dock the games for having somewhat clumsy default controls, a UI that leaves a lot to be desired, and a rather steep learning curve.Another con for some may be the rock-paper-scissor formula that Relic is known for throughout their games.  In this game, there are units that are simply a hard counter to another unit.  In later Relic RTS games, you can see where they added in more unit versatility and soft counters through combined arms.  This leads to some rather spammy gameplay that might be a turn-off for some.			"

												Review is separate for HW 1 and 2.Edit: Homeworld Cataclysm is not part of this remastered edition, since it was developed by another studio and the source code got lost when that went out of business, though there is a mod that is trying to recreate it. At the time of this writing there are no campaign missions though, only skirmishes. Generally there are quite a few total conversions available for skirmish play.Starting off with HW 1.What is Homeworld? It's a space RTS game taking place on a 3 dimensional plane. The maps are always round and you can order your ships ""up"" and ""down"". You can either do that on the normal game screen, which is pretty beautiful in the Remastered edition, or you can bring up a tactical view, which makes it a bit easier. The camera can be freely rotated, but zooming on the other hand is pretty limited and finicky thanks to the 3D aspect. Basically you have to anchor yourself to a unit in order to make the most out of zoom. I guess pro players will mainly use the tac display anyway.So far so good. The interface is pretty decent now (uses the HW 2 one I think). Since there aren't too many different combat units (variation of fighters, bombers, different corvettes, frigates and destroyers as well as a heavy cruiser class), there's not that much micro management, although letting your bombers attack into a multi attack corvette screen is generally considered to be a bad idea, which brings me to my first point of critique: The smaller strike craft feel almost useless later on in the game when destroyers and heavy cruisers are in play and you have some interceptors or stealth fighters or said multi attack corvettes...maybe even drone frigates; there's a lot of sturdier bigger craft that can fulfill the role of anti-fighter and anti-capital better than investing in easily destroyed strike craft. Maybe I'm just bad, definitely possible, but the game also never really explains what benefits certain ""formations"" have. I found out by accident that the ""sphere"" formation is a very bad idea for bombers or fighters, since then they remain stationary and surround the target. They work in conjunction and soak up a lot of the damage, but I found myself replacing them almost constantly, while my bigger craft were mostly untouched.Next critique: The game's UI needs work, seriously. There is a button that displays what kind of craft you have and how many, but there is not button to select these craft. For example, try finding a particular craft, perhaps a resource collector, quickly and you're almost despairing. Speaking of resource collectors: Those buggers never seem to mine automatically, mining takes ages and then you need several resource controllers so they don't have to make the trek back home to your mothership every time, which takes, again, ages. And now we've moved on to the glacial pace this game can evolve to. In the later stages, trying to get your capital ships ANYWHERE can easily take 15 to 20 minutes. They turn and move really really slowly. Yes, that feels epic, but sitting there, waiting quarter of an hour for your ships to go SOMEWHERE is the antithesis of fun.Graphics and sound are pretty decent, however, you are either going to dig or hate the music. It's very space epic-esque.The campaign: Homeworld 1 consists of 16 missions (plus 1 bonus mission that can be found in the extra missions section of the main menu...no idea why they cut this one from the main game, because it fits right in there after mission 4 or so and is actually quite fun). Yes, fun, that's something that varies a lot in this campaign. To understand how the campaign works you need to realize that your goal is to reach your Homeworld (who would have thought) with your Mothership, which cannot move during a mission. Neither does it have any weapons...it just sits there and dies if you're not careful, but who cares, since you rarely get attacked anyway. In any case, your units are permanent, meaning, you take them with you to the next mission if they don't get destroyed. This bit is important, since that can either make the campaign really easy or pretty difficult. There is no difficulty setting, but even so I found myself challenged only a handful of times, but once your armada gets big enough, you should not have any problems at all. Some missions are gimicky, destroying asteroids in your way, moving in areas to avoid radiation. Those are pretty interesting, however, the main issue is that they are either over very quickly (mission 15 literally takes 3 minutes to complete...it's a timed defense mission...what!?!? That should have been part of a bigger mission), or take ages to complete, while you slowly crawl your way forward with your big capital ships of which you can only build so many before the supply limit stops you. Haha, BUT you can always capture more and just get a ridiculously large armada. I think I had 6 Heavy Cruisers, about 8 destroyers and 4 missile destroyers or so...while the game only allows you to have 3, 6 and 2 respectively. Add to that 21 frigates (mostly Ion), a full complement of multi attack corvettes as well as some 70 almost useless strike craft and the enemies did not stand a chance. This is the campaign in a nutshell...the story is pretty threadbare, neatly presented in kinda animtated, but still static images and moderately good voice over (all very downtrodden), but it barely makes sense and you're not even rooting for your own team, you don't feel resentment towards the enemies and there are no characters to identify with. Took me 9 hours to complete, but I had to repeat some stuff, and I guess at least 50% of that time was spent building stuff and waiting. By the way, all unmined resources will automatically transfer to your account after a mission ends, but that doesn't mean you should not replace any lost craft before you jump away, since the next mission can literally drop you in a terrible situation in which you need every ship you can get...Actually that happens quite often...MP is well, I dunno, in HW 1 all races seem to have the same units, so...what's the point besides different designs? All in all HW 1 is a good game, but by no means is it as good as people make it out to be. Unfortunately, if you're into this kind of genre, there's not much else, at least nothing contemporary. Sins of a Solar Empire comes to mind first, but that does not have a campaign either and is a 4x cross breed rather than a true RTS.HW 2:You can expect the same engine and gameplay, but in the campaign as well as the MP there are some serious changes. Also for some reason it just looks better to me. Weird.- I find the campaign to be more engaging to be honest. It's also a bit more cohesive, but it's still space opera and in the end you have more questions than answers- The backdrops are just GORGEOUS- The music is more space nomady than space opera now. Better imho- Small ships (anything not capital or special) are now built as a squad, which makes micro managing your ♥♥♥♥ing fighters and corvettes a lot easier now. Also these ships are now stronger in my opinion. They still die relatively quickly in large fights, but at least they do what they are supposed to do and you can rebuild them quicker.- Resource collectors have taken over the job of the repair corvettes, because resource collection in the campaign doesn't matter anyway- Salvage corvettes are now marine frigates and utterly useless (at least in campaign), since easily destroyed, have to remain stationary for ages to board a vessel and if you already have the max no of vessels you can't claim any more- The game FINALLY auto saves- Missions end automatically, which is bad, since you can no longer replenish your fleet after a big battle, which may mean instant failure of the next mission...stupidAll in all cool campaign, but some design decisions are questionable...

												*Note This is a work in progress review, it will change if devs address the major issues with a few of the mechanics.Even though the graphics, audio and UI redesigns are good I cannot recommend this game right now. It seems like gearbox has broken gameplay mechanics entirely in the remaster of HW1 because of the porting of engine to HW2 engine. Here are just a few of the issues:-The formations are wonky and don't work. You need formations to strike enemy ships effectively. In these games they just use their own flight patterns after they get close to enemy and don't stay in formation.-Game is not using balistic system of the original and instead uses rng, so there are too much hard counters to everything. It is not physics based.-Support frigates are useless unless you get them to follow around and make sure they are healing targets.-Capturing mechanics broken, it is too easy.-salvage corvettes easily capture enemy corvettes because evasion mechanics disabled(they are not part of the rng system)-Salvage ships not showing their beam animation-Why is queues limited to 2?-Collision system is broke, stuff like resource collecters and other ship crash into astroids or other objects and then attempt to push through them instead of moving back.-Some shortcuts do work but its inconsistent, like some keys open certain menus but don't close them when pressed again, while others close when pressed again. Its weird.EDIT:Seems I was wrong with some of the UI mechanics. You can highlight and then choose what ships to select, or you can double click a selected ship and it will highlight all similar ships nearby. You can also select military only ships to be highlighted.This is a very good UI mechanic in the game, just wish they would explain in the tutorials.			"

Yes there are just a few items I could complain about verses the classic but all in all you can tell the developers really took their time and put their hearts into the remastering of this game. Beautiful Artwork redesign well thought out UI redesign.Gameplay is almost exactly what it was in the classic versions, the strategy involved is fighting with the correct units not out building you adversary (especially in HW2 even if you cheat with cheat-engine it will populate the enemy to match you in the storyline).

												I was a big fan of the original, so i'm wondering wtf have Gearbox done? It's the fact that it's shipped in massively buggy state for a start. The tutorial asks you to click the ok button when it isn't there, the fact I replayed mission 2 (!) some four times before it would complete which doesn't bode well for the rest of the game although I did manage to struggle up to mission 5.I was stuffed at that point as part way in, the game crashed to desktop losing all my progress. So I fired up the DLC original, which crashed after 30 seconds of play.Unnacceptable. The QA on this was non-existant and frankly needs a major patch and another three months of effort on this. In it's current state (as of 1st March 2015), I would recommend you avoid.			"

												AWESOME ! Was 17 back in 1999 when HW1 was released and it was epic then, but with a modern system, 5.1 digital speakers and the whole remastered malarky........goosebumps from the intro alone. The detail....wow. The sounds......♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. On mission 2 while writing this review. Can't wait for the Return to Kharak. I dunno wtf ppl are on about no intro, Beta, no tutorial...it has all that. Just the multiplayer has to be tweaked (beta), for balance reasons, obviously. Since MP will be HW1+ HW2 ships.OT: Someone please please find the damn Cataclysm source code so that too can be remastered ! Also: Make it even more scarier then it already is ! The Beast is terrifying.			"

												""Homeworld 2 fans will likely be delighted by this remaster, it adds a new layer of polish to an old classic without changing anything gameplay wise. Sadly, the same cannot be said for its predecessor which undoubtedly will irk some diehard fans, including myself. Luckily, even with these changes both games are still a testament to the series’ quality whilst serving as a reminder that RTS titles can still provide deep, engaging experiences and having the originals included as a bonus further seals the deal.""Full Review Here: http://www.tech-gaming.com/homeworld-remastered/ "

												Homeworld is perhaps one of my favorite games of all time right now. It is fun, exciting, and challenging all at the same time. Though I did not play the original Homeworld series, I know see why so many love it. If you are someone like me who loves RTS and Sci-Fi games but want it to be a little more simple, unlike Sins of a Solar Empire, get this game. It is totally worth it.			"

												wow. they only had a decade to make this remaster work. It's not like anyone was pressing them to release it asap. Yet, even now,  over a year after release, the game is bug-riddled and elements are still in ""BETA"". elements like, the stats screen?.....I should have looked at the more recent forum postings instead of remembering the excited forums around release; I wouldnt have bought it (since it was Humble bundle I can't refund). People are having even more issues than I had. Some of the prevalent issues I had: CTD, or actually, crash when exit (lots of reports of ctd on forums)KEYBINDS DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY - NO MATTER WHAT, MY KEYBIND MAKES CAMERA GO TO A RANDOM POINT OF THE MAP AT THE HIGHEST POINT. EXTREMELY AGGREVATING.transparent ships/ resources / etc (not that often)Ships getting stuck. OFTEN. irritating tutorial. meh. (the ""OK"" bug. obviously this is a minor point, but builds upon the poor quality)disappointed.The worst part about it is instead of fixing the game to be fit for a release & especially re-release, these developers instead worked on an extremely watered-down 'expansion' to Homeworld. ehh I'm pretty annoyed overall. It was fun to get back into HW again (I own retail cd from way back) but it frankly wasn't worth it, and probably wasn't worth the 12 or 6 bucks (depending on how you look at it,) because I tend to like games that arent broken...that ♥♥♥♥ing Keybind bug... That♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so bad. Remasters are supposed to be polished and awesome. This is neither.			"

												Some bugs but I have faith in the devs patching them out in due time.The Good:-Sounds awesome.-Looks awesome.-Smells awesome.-Tastes awesome.-Still able to give your ships sexy coats of magenta and green paint.-The level of detail makes you want to zoom in on enemy ships and marvel as they panic to get away from a swarm of salvage corvettes.-You will look simply exquisite as you don your admiral's hat and pipe.The Meh:-Feels almost good but until the formations and tactics work better I say meh.The Bad:-I'm now 15 years older than I was when this came out originally.-I have to keep going to this damn job of mine to keep the electricity on.-Disproves the Bible.The Gardens of Kadesh-No withdrawl.-Too limiting, join or die type asshats living here.-Why the heck does this place still creep me the hell out?-Space zealots.-My synesthesia makes the place taste like cotton and burnt sunflower seeds.

												One of the best games from the late 90's has been overhauled and finally been given the look that the game deserves. Not only has this game sent me back to my own youth but its also rekindled an unhealthy relationship with the game series that I spent most of my teens playing, mainly when I should have been doing my homework! Homeworld Remastered beings homeworld 1 and homeworld 2 into today with vastly improved graphics and a remastered audio track. The look and feel of the game is very similar to homeworld 2 as both the remastered games use an upgraded version of the HW2 game engine but with upgrades to improve the look.Neither game however have lost anything but only gained. Infact homeworld 1 now plays with the options you had in homeworld 2. Homeworld 1 remastered even let you build in single units rather than small groups of fighters as you do in 2.The campaigns are better than ever with the storyline not changed, the increasingly difficult missions of HW1 gets transfered over in homeworld remastered nicely. The player vs CPU, or skirmish mode has a stange feel to it, but has been upgraded to feature some new modes including tasks such as harvest x resources for a bonus; and crates. However the best feature allows you to pit HW1 factions against HW2. Although in BETA at the time of writing this review, the multiplayer mode shows some promise.I do feel that the pitting of sides from HW1 and HW2 against eachother is a nice feature, it does need some ironing out. So far the HW2 sides seem to have the edge on the HW1 sides. It would be nice to see some new features other than game modes. Maybe some more maps, special units for skirmish, maybe even a turanic raiders or kadeshi faction to play in skirmish/multiplayer.Not only do you get the remastered games, the classic versions are also here too for that ultimate look back.I do have to admit though, it was nice to play the entire game in a few days and it took me back a fair few years. I can highly recommend. If you loved the classic games back in the day, then remastered is for you.			"

												One of my all-time favorite games; played both the originals when they came out.  The persistence from level to level is novel and really ties the single player campaign together: build early, build often, move it all cautiously, and zoom in after you issue orders to take in the massive battles.Word of warning, though: you can't capture Vagyr capitals in HW2.  Doing so just disables them.  Still useful, but won't net you +1 capital ship.			"

												i have been playing a lot of RTS games revently and a lot of them are older games like the first star craft and dawn of war and this game which is almost as old as i am is probably the best playing RTS i have ever played and the story is very well done with few games even coming close to how good the story is this is a perfect way to make a story for this type of gamethe difficulty is very wierd in this game there are some missions where if you just have a lot of frigates and capital ships its a cake walk because all the enemy had brought is interceptors that are useless against bigger ships. and then there are others that are hard because they are confusing and dont explain to you how to do them like the dust cloud mission where the game at this point never told you how to change your ships altitude so you ships are lost from radiation. then there is the last mission where i felt it was unfair and to the point where i actually went back and replayed the second to last mission just to change my fleet to be capable of winning because the enemy in the first wave goes full force right off the bat at your mother ship and at first it seems to be impossible to beat when the enemy only uses bombers ion cannons and capital ships which are all the hardest hitting ships in the game and they ignore your fleet and only attack the mother ship. it catches you so off gaurd because the last few missions where not all that difficult and then the mission starts off with a full on assault and when you arent expecting it because most missions give you some room to breath and build ships or set up strike groups and the enemy ends up killing your mother ship in about 2 minutes other then that i feel like the game was well paced.the whole way through and the whole time the faction you play as is very misterious because you dont know much about them and it seems that most of them dont even know much about their own race either all they know is the name of their homeworld written on one of their artifacts which is a map and you slowly learn that you where at one point a huge empire that ruled the galaxy and then reduced to nothing and most of your race is wipped out and exiled to a desert planet its a very intersting story which is unusuall for a RTS game i have not played homeworld 2 yet but honestly i think this game is worth buying just for the first game alone its strange that a game that came out in 1999 plays better then most RTS games that have recently came out			"

												The remastering of the original Homeworld is at heart a modification of Homeworld 2. The places where the second's engines places limitations on the translation of the original are seemingly minor, but have a considerable effect on the gameplay. One example is the way HW1 smallcraft performance is affected. Some of you might recall that scouts and fighters in HW1 behaved in a semi-newtonian fashion, being able to change their orientation without affecting their current direction of travel. This meant that HW1 fighter formations could radically change direction very quickly; for instance fighters attacking a target in X formation would make their pass and then do the ""Starfury Flip"" a bit of a distance away from the target. This is no longer reflected in the Remaster. The result is that fighter formations are more or less useless in Homeworld Remastered. Unlike larger ships, unmodded HW2 fighters generally have to bank and turn as if in atmosphere unlike their predecessors. This means that the entire formation must wheel around to affect a change in direction, which has the affect you might expect on their ability to fight effectively. Small niggles such as these will affect your experience if you look for them. Thankfully you can compare the differences for yourself by trying out the original once again, as it is bundled with the altogether very affordable package. So long as you keep this in mind you really will not be affected, particularly due to Homeworld's gorgeous visuals. "

												When it comes to classical games being remastered, I struggle if I should buy it or not.Just within 2 months, the HD remastered version of Resident Evil, Homeworld Remaster Collection are examples of good remasters that released in early 2015, note this its just 2 months in 2015.Homeworld is a game series produced by Relic, which the IP(Intellectual property) is now acquired by Gearbox after THQ's defunct, promising to remaster the nostalgic video game series started back in 1999, Gearbox delivered more than they promised.Other than upgrades/improvements for graphics and interface, costumers, i'll use ""players"" for more friendly, are able to play both Homeworld 1,2 remastered, along with the classical version, and the addition of improved multiplayer. For short, it plays the same and feels the same as it's orignal, If you are a fan of the series, give it some support, they did a good job in delivering the final product. |For new players, don't HATE the game, it is was designed and made in the 90's, respect the design of games that are developed at that specific time periods before start flaming|9 childhood saved out of 10 [3D Cartesian coordinate system]			"

												Many moons ago I use to own this on my old trusty 486 DX, and I love it.  I remember getting lost in the games atmosphere and story, I found the game both calming and challenging.  As years gone past I eventually lost my copy of Homeworld and I very much missed those moments I spent with the game, I could not find another working copy any where (not even on gog).  So I was very happy when I saw the promo for the Homeworld Remastered Collection, and more so to see what a stellar job Gearbox has done.  If you loved the original Homeworld then you will love this, if you love a good RTS game then you will love Homeworld.			"

												Only just getting back into these great remasters, but without doubt the amount of effort expended here far surpasses most other ""HD remasters"".The Good:-The textures and cinematics have been updated and have improved in quality to a staggering degree,-The Audio, both music and dialogue, are excellent and crystal clear,-The gameplay is just as fun and immersive as I remember.-A plethora of new built-in skirmish features such as king of the hill style elements and of course the cross-race battles, all optional, and all great additions that keep the gameplay more current. -Also retains its predecessors' knack for displaying beautiful graphics with very light load on the system, even older computers should make it look very fancy indeed.Any downsides? Well:-One or two tech hiccups, in particular a CTD graphics bug which, for me at least, was solved by turning off shadows, not a huge sacrifice, especially in space, but a little annoying. -I have heard of other bugs, though have experienced none of them myself, but so far my game time is limited to the campaign and skirmish.-You also have to create a third-party account for multiplayer - painless and quick, but you have been warned. Conclusion? All in all 100% solid gold angel-moon cheese! A certain buy for any long term fan of the series, and VERY highly recommended for any fan of RTSs in general wanting a breath of old (but ironically, very fresh) air! Get it now! "

												After playing this game for a few hours and reliving the nostalgia of my childhood I'd have to say that the game definitely delivered. However! There are a few bugs or irritations (namely 2 during my playthrough) that should be prioritized for a fix above all else if I'm to call it the ""closest to perfect"" remaster and that is to recalibrate the formations so that they actually have a meaning in the game. There have been so many instances (practically the whole game) where formations didn't decide the flow of battle. The units just scattered in combat and thus left a lot of undeserved casualties.The second thing to fix is the AI for the harvesters. In the original you could send them out to do their business and wouldn't need to worry about them unless being attacked. But after finishing the first nebula mission and sending them to harvest the rest of the area, they went out, took care of one vein and then just went stationary like there wasn't any resources left (but of course there still were). So I had to manually send them to another vein and have them continue.These need to be fixed if it is to be remembered fully to the original. Many things have been done great but there are still a few things that just ruin the game for me. Overall it is of course a beautiful remaster of the game and the graphics are set on. Just needs a bit of fixing but since it just released I can definitely give the developers some time.			"

												One does not simply recognize that this is already a 15 year old game without being told XDAfter 15 years this game is still the best at what it does and it has certainly aged beautifully. Why so much complaining?My advice to those with issues, complaints or problems :* Wait for bugfixes or the modding community to fix it, which they certainly will :D just be patient. You have to bear in mind that this game is already 15 years old and was just remastered, not remade.* Play the Homeworld 2 Classic ( which what Ive been doing ) . I honestly think it is better than the remastered version ( looks aside ) because of all those great mods! Which are:a. Complex modb. Homefront mod ( they have very awesome looking ships )c. Complex Enhanced ( kinda like complex but without the ranks, energy and research points )d. Tactical Fleet Simulator ( makes the game more fast paced and has cool new ships ) e. FreeSpace: Fleet CommandThese mods make the classic better than the remastered and i could never again go back to playing vanilla homeworld because they just add so much more to the game You can all download these mods in the workshop with just a single click.I hope this helped! See you in the Homeworld everyone! Because of its fair price and the 4 games that it contains i give it a score of:9/10 Please start developing Homeworld 3!( might be 10/10 in the future when they patch things up and some awesome mods gets released )			"

												When it comes to classical games being remastered, I struggle if I should buy it or not.Just within 2 months, the HD remastered version of Resident Evil, Homeworld Remaster Collection are examples of good remasters that released in early 2015, note this its just 2 months in 2015.Homeworld is a game series produced by Relic, which the IP(Intellectual property) is now acquired by Gearbox after THQ's defunct, promising to remaster the nostalgic video game series started back in 1999, Gearbox delivered more than they promised.Other than upgrades/improvements for graphics and interface, costumers, i'll use ""players"" for more friendly, are able to play both Homeworld 1,2 remastered, along with the classical version, and the addition of improved multiplayer. For short, it plays the same and feels the same as it's orignal, If you are a fan of the series, give it some support, they did a good job in delivering the final product. |For new players, don't HATE the game, it is was designed and made in the 90's, respect the design of games that are developed at that specific time periods before start flaming|9 childhood saved out of 10 [3D Cartesian coordinate system]			"

												Only just getting back into these great remasters, but without doubt the amount of effort expended here far surpasses most other ""HD remasters"".The Good:-The textures and cinematics have been updated and have improved in quality to a staggering degree,-The Audio, both music and dialogue, are excellent and crystal clear,-The gameplay is just as fun and immersive as I remember.-A plethora of new built-in skirmish features such as king of the hill style elements and of course the cross-race battles, all optional, and all great additions that keep the gameplay more current. -Also retains its predecessors' knack for displaying beautiful graphics with very light load on the system, even older computers should make it look very fancy indeed.Any downsides? Well:-One or two tech hiccups, in particular a CTD graphics bug which, for me at least, was solved by turning off shadows, not a huge sacrifice, especially in space, but a little annoying. -I have heard of other bugs, though have experienced none of them myself, but so far my game time is limited to the campaign and skirmish.-You also have to create a third-party account for multiplayer - painless and quick, but you have been warned. Conclusion? All in all 100% solid gold angel-moon cheese! A certain buy for any long term fan of the series, and VERY highly recommended for any fan of RTSs in general wanting a breath of old (but ironically, very fresh) air! Get it now! "

												Many moons ago I use to own this on my old trusty 486 DX, and I love it.  I remember getting lost in the games atmosphere and story, I found the game both calming and challenging.  As years gone past I eventually lost my copy of Homeworld and I very much missed those moments I spent with the game, I could not find another working copy any where (not even on gog).  So I was very happy when I saw the promo for the Homeworld Remastered Collection, and more so to see what a stellar job Gearbox has done.  If you loved the original Homeworld then you will love this, if you love a good RTS game then you will love Homeworld.			"

												There are already plenty of brilliant reviews for this game. I just want to add a very simple ""thumbs up"" and recommendation here as well. Absolute classic games, and best in the genre (strategy, space). Truly awesome campaign, story and writing. Stunning remastered graphics, especially HW2. Excellent soundtrack. However: The learning curve (for controls, 3D movement, hotkeys) can be steep, but it is possible with some patience, and very well worth it! If you're still having trouble, or not enough fun, you can easily modify the starting RUs and build all the things (although the difficulty will be scaled to your massive fleet). Bravo to RELIC and GEARBOX. My rating for HOMEWORLD RC: 9 out of 10.			"

												If you have never played any of the other Home World games you are in for a treat, jaw dropping graphics, beautiful visuals, astonishing audio. If you have, leave your memories at the door, they will be shattered. This is definitely not a remastered collection. This is little more than a re-imaging of HW2 with HW1 ships added in. If you have fond memories of the multiplayer lobby experience, don't come here expecting to make new ones, that key feature is totally absent and no plans are in the works currently to add one. This is definitely NOT a remastering of the originals.If you can live with those differences more power to you, me, I give it the following scores:Visuals: 5 out of 5Audio: 4.5 out of 5Controls: 2.5 out of 5Game play Single play: 3.5 out of 5Game play Multiplay: 2 out of 5**IMHO lack of a lobby seriously drops the score for multiplay, game play can be really fun, but no chance to talk with your team mates after a game or to discuss games in a lobby while waiting for games to start, really drops the longevity of the title.UPDATE:Since this original review was posted the developers surprized the community with a functioning lobby. It isn't the lobby system we had in either of the originals but it does raise the fun factor and multi-playability a tremendous amount. Now you can talk with anyone  in the main lobby or in the game lobby while waiting to get enough people to join. That alone is enough to raise the score I put for multiplay to 4 out of 5.The developers also released a major patch that fixed a lot of issues but there is still a load of work needing completion. The game is better now than it was at release and hopefully we will see the final polish put on the game in 2017.			"

												Stop reading reviews and buy the game. Trust me. Hours of enjoyment, complexity and looks beautiful again. Make the most of the MODs available too. Some fantastic ones (Mainly Complex 10 and Battlestar Galactica).Only slight issue is random crashes on Multiplayer for being 'Out Of Sync'. Can't work out why, is always the Player not hosting.But buy it. Buy it now.			"

												Loved this game back in the day and am happy to see it remastered. This game was made almost 20 years ago and hold up (with the updated graphics). Was a fun play-through though I remember it being a bit more challenging. Perhaps it's in need of some balancing tweaks to the campaign?In any case, was easily worth the $10 to have this classic in my library again.			"

												This collection is amazing. First about the collection itself, the collection has a whole bunch of content that at the time of writing I haven't even got to yet. Not only do they have the original homeworld 1 and 2, but also the re-mastered version which clearly had a lot of love put into them.Now, I know some people will call this blasphemous, but I haven't played the original versions, and I'll give a review for each game in the collection. There may be changes in the originals and remasters like the UI and apparently some unit balancing issues? Again, the changes seem small and don't seem to impact the gameplay for the casual or moderate homeworld fan.Anyway, onto the review, I'll go in order of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 had to be cut short due to me running out of characters. [grumble grumble]Homeworld was an amazing experience to go through, and gave me a feeling a game hasn't given me in awhile. This is a sense of mystery and the feeling of being a small speck in the midst of outer space. An insignificant spec, just managing to survive. But as you go along, the largest foe opposing you who seem like an unstoppable force that will wipe you out in the blink of an eye. But you just bite at the small, weak appendages of this large creature until you (hopefully) become large enough to stand a chance.But as the game goes along, and you realise you're hatred of this foe is not alone, you end up becoming stronger, as you gain more and more victories, and you become something greater than what you started, you don't feel weak against your foe, you end up feeling like you can just make it.Now, for the gameplay of the game, the gameplay is very strategic, much more strategic than what I was expecting. You can't just throw your mighty battleships at the enemy and expect to win, because since you may of destroyed their first offensive, you're heavily crippled, and it just so happens that there are, admittedly smaller, but far scarier foes awaiting just outside the range of your sensors, and they are hungry. I find myself later in the game attempting to break off their fleet in chasing something small, but leading them where my ships lay, and I have the advantage by planning the whole thing in advance. Your experience might be different but I had a blast.Now for some memorable moments from my playthrough of the game, some spoilers.The first moment I can think of is the first attack on the foe (completely forgot their name, some federation). When we warp in, my battle relay guy(?) notifies me that the hostile fleet is right ahead. Here, I'm a bit scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because I saw what they can do, and even though its weakened, they still have a substantial fleet. He gave the order to exterminate the fleet. At this moment of time, I still see that fleat as an unstoppable force, and they had battlecruisers and I didn't. Did I mention I was scared? Anyway, I mass produced these vehicle extraction units (forgot the name) which basically steals ships in hopes of capturing one of the ships. However, it turned out that I overestimated the foe (which is what I always do, it's better to overestimate and crush your foe with overwhelming force them to not be prepared for a superior force) and I ended up destroying most of their ships, except for one. I then got this evil grin on my face as this carrier was trying to escape from me, I ordered my ships to shoot out the engines, and I sent in the extractors. I ended up stealing their carrier as a trophy, a claim of ""I annihilated your force and now I'm using your ship against you"" sort of fashion. That ship eventually became invaluable to the fleet, acting as a medical station for the smaller ships and as a transport bay for them as well. Protection from attack.The second moment I'll share is this moment when you enter a nebula and there is deadly radiation flooding the area. You had to plan your moves carefully to not have your ship's be dissolved in the radiation (a bit unrealistic but it's a videogame so I'll let it slide) I'm moving through this cloud and I spot a minelayer. This is the first one I encountered one, I quickly destroy it and think to myself, ""Job well done, no mines! Onwards to glory!"" but a little bit later, I found the mine field it set up, it crippled some of my most powerful ships, and when I'm getting my repair frigates ready, I spot 2 destroyers peek out from the nebula. At this point in time, I had about 3 destroyers, the carrier (the one I stole earlier) and a fleet of frigates. ""Piece of cake"" I thought to myself. Bad mistake, because with them, they had missile frigates that were staying JUST out of sight, but firing on my ships nonetheless. And whatever the hell that destroyer was made from, my whole fleet of 25 ish ships was completely and utterly obliterated by 5 ships and a few mines. Then I started planning out my path for the target, and I had an escort, and everything, finding small bands of these ships and crushing them under suprise.The third, and final moment I can share is the junkyard. During this level, you enter a creepy junkyard, with a bunch of gun platforms dotting the place, protecting...something...still don't know what it was. No biggy I thought, but something didn't feel right, so I sent my capital ships in with caution, and to obliterate the gun platform obviously. But after I sent them out, I started doing some micromanaging at base, when I heard ""one of your ships have gone missing"". ""What do you mean, 'one of your ships have gone missing'? How the hell can you lose a capital ship?"" I'm thinking to myself. then I look over, and I see the missing ship warp back into view, but it was hostile. I had no idea what was going on until I saw this one small-ish ship coming in, only known as the Junkyard Dog, and it was barreling straight for one of the capital ships. The it just snatches it and warped out at a becon. I was stunned, but also very♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥so I restarted the level. After about 3 ish restarts, I got very♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at this dog and after my attempts of sending small ships through the junkyard failed miserably, I got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and made ships that could freeze it. I had like 5 of them, so the dog couldn't escape. I had my whole fleet waiting nervously for any signs of the dog. And when my guard was low, it came within 1 km from one of my ships! I know, 1 kilometer seems far, but remember, these ships are several kilometers in length so that was WAY too close for comfort. I froze it and with all the might of my fleet, and about 10 minutes of continuous fire from all ships, I finally killed the dog. I was never so happy to kill a dog until now.After all the praise I gave for homeworld, you would think I would give homeworld 2 as much praise, but to be honest, it was a bit disappointing. I feel the collection is worth it for homeworld alone. So just buy it, and if you want to play homeworld 2, just do it. It's still enjoyable in a morbid way. Sadly, steam won't let me finish the review, because I have a lot of worlds for homeworld 2 that's not exactly flattering. But again, just buy it and see it for yourself. You have nothing to lose (Except for possibly your time) so just do whatever you feel is best.			"

SummaryI love this game, but it has some serious growing up to do in the genre of Sci-Fi.One thing about this game that I love is the wide variety of ships we can choose from and also the ability to customize our ships to our liking. Now the one thing that saddens me the most is the fact the Frontier Developments basically stated that they player will never be able to pilot ships as big as Farragut which puts a dampers. One the greatest feelings in space theme games is piloting a capital class ship, commanding squadrons of fighters while laying massive firepower that turns the tide of a battle or defending the ship against ambush of fighters. Eve Online brought a never ending hunger for player driven wars between two player ran corporations or alliances over vast expansions of space in attempt to control the non-settled frontiers of space. There is also player built stations, player build fortifications, player held planets, player owned solar systems, and player owned shipyards that make it feels like the galaxy is alive. For such a vast open end game, it feels like there is very little purpose for the player except for tagging along for the ride, we barely shape the galaxy.Why Capital Ships Are Unobtainable?By limiting players ability to interact with your galaxy, you are faced with the outcome that players will not be able to do much in a vast open end world that you have created. The only thing that us players do have forward to look too is playing the vast variety of ships available in the game. When you deny two ships to the players who play, Frontier Developments are hurting their ability to be flexible in their approach. Basically you are putting a artificial block on the growth of ship variety by doing this, you can never build bigger than that single capital ship. Once players hit Corvette and Cutter, they can’t advance any further while NPC have Farragut and Majestic class ships that dwarf player owned ships. It isn’t because these ships are rare and limited in numbers, in-fact they are very common because you find them throughout all conflict zones regardless of where you are in the galaxy. We should be asking why capital ships are unobtainable when they are not unique or rare?Why Can’t Players Have Groups?Groups are so important in massive multiplayer online games, it connects players together and helps them do things that they can’t normally do alone. Look at Eve Online that is built around players working together, they achieve amazing and epic accomplishments that are a envy of thousands of players while being big enough to be featured in national news articles. This advertises the game in a way that no other game has achieved because players want to be a part of this and willing to dedicate years to achieving something. By offering the ability to own solar systems, stations, shipyards, and factions; they are not only giving room for this game to grow, they are creating a environment that will advertise itself and help the game community to grow. By letting players be able to shape and expand the galaxy, Frontier Development are basically making it easier to establish the world around the players as things evolve and grow. Why must you limit the expansion of the bubble to your time schedule?The Point?So basically what I am saying is, stop trying to force the galaxy to grow, let it grow on its own by giving the tools to the players. You can shape the basic story-line which players will follow without much of a issue, but once you are trying to micro-manage a galaxy of players, you will be limited severely to the point you will practically lose steam quicker. Players love the ability to shape, choose, and control their galaxy more than  tagging along for the ride with limited options to experience it. So do yourself a favor, be more flexible.Rating: 8/10 "

												Preamble:I played HW1 a long time ago when I was too young to really appreciate it. I only had vague memories of it coming in.Homeworld 1:A simple game that still manages to make a great impact thanks to it's beautiful presentation. You really do feel like you're leading a group of nomadic exiles in search of their new home, and all the bizarre scenarios they find them selves in. I love the idea of being able to take everything with you to the next mission, although it did create some really nasty situations, especially during the Nebula missions, and the last few missions feel like a cakewalk if you over-prepared (Not that it makes the last mission any more beautifully done).Homeworld 2:Will play soon.

But we also got renewed HW2, which wasnt changed in terms of gameplay as I know (didnt played R version much yet). Think they deserve likes, not hateful comments, the frunchise is alive, finally! We just get 1 great remake with stunning graphic instead of two (and a good reason to complete the second part of the game for the ones who was disappointed in it after glorius original). Ah, and no Cataclysm because of technical issues, still I wanted them to include classic version of it :/			"

												I think my sentiment for this version of Homeworld echoes every single one who played the original: this game is a huge disappointment.I played the orginal Homeworld, Homeworld Cataclysm Homeworld 2 and countless mods of HW2. By far, Homeworld orginal is my favourite. The atmosphere, the feeling of panic when overwhelmed by enemies, the awe of the Graveyard... Homeworld itself was astounding. Even the music keeps you wrapped up in the HW universe; you really feel as though you are safeguarding the last of your kind with every little ship you capture or build.What has been done here is the story and script of Homeworld has been plopped into the Homeworld 2 engine, which is a completely different game. Different UI, different mapped controls, different AI.  HW2 is designed as a massive Space Battle RTS. Original Homeworld is a strategy game, but the emphasis is not always on battle; you are encouraged to use whatever strategy you need to get the better of the Taidan.The result? A very busy UI, many interfering visual elements and a flow of information completely unsuitable to the original Homworld story.What's worse is that the AI and control mechanics are awful. For example, any original HW player will tell you that the most fun strategy is capturing ships. In HW Remastered, this is completely broken. You can't just take a group of salvage corvettes with the correct number to capture, say, the Assault Frigates in Mission 3, Return to Kharak, and tell them to go capture. No, you have to pause, count the number of frigates, make a bunch of groups of 2 and tell each group to go capture ONE frigate. Totally ridiculous.All of this could be forgiven, it would be. And on top of this, the visuals aren't that fantastic. The textures and modelling are pretty bad by today's standard. The mod community had already done a fantastic job with several whole-game conversions for HW2... Now THESE are amazing, the attention to detail is crazy! Seems sad to think so little attention was paid to this.I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't get into it.			"

												The first mission on HW1 would not load. I tried a series of workarounds posted on both Steam and Gearbox forums to no avail. This is in June when the game has been out for some time and has receive multiple patches. Come on people, this isn't rocket science. GoG does this right every day of the week. The poor quality of this update to the originals makes me seriously concerned for any entry in the series Gearbox comes out with in the future.			"

												This game is amazing.  I was a huge fan of the originals and am very happy to see it return to modern operating systems.So far, I have only been playing the campaign and it is amazing.  The story is very good with each level difficult in its own way.  If you are a fan of RTS, you should play this game.Performance wise, it runs very well.  I have only had one or two crash to desktops throughout all my time and I expect that will be fixed with patches.  Just make sure you save within the campaing level.  I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but am very excited to get into it.  Currently, I do not see any matchmaking system and am unaware of any plans for one, so the matches will be limited to lobby games.I was not excited about gearbox winning the IP and had no hope for this product when they announced the remaster.  They have proved me wrong.  This is an amazing restoration of a classic that still holds up to the test of time.			"

												This is a remastered game from back in the day when RTS ruled the PC. Back in the day i used to love this game, unlike its competitors at the time you aren't fighting on a 2d plane but in an actual 3d environment. Given this is a space game you actually get a tactical advantage from attacking enemy ships from the top of bottom, so it added literally another dimension to the RTS genre. Another great feature of the game is you dont build a base, but maintained a fleet (think Battlestar Galactica), that fleet stays with you throughout the game. You have the mother ship that acts as production facility and when that is lost, its game over, all other ships can just be produced and captured. It adds a lot to the story.And the story that was told is great, for those of you who have never played it, i wont spoil it, but the story itself is kind of standard, but because you are with traveling with your fleet, you feel more connected to the story! And the best part is, that was how i remember it, and it all still holds true!! and now it looks great also. So i do recommend this game if you are into RTS games or really atmospheric games!			"

												Takes me back to the glorious days of building huge fleets and battling it out in the endless void. The visual advances are stunning and it's great seeing the previously boxy ships of the original Homeworld given a complete make over with new textures and lighting.However, playing Hoeworld 1 with Homeworld 2 mechanics just doesn't feel quite right. Having some of the formations missing and none of the original tactics options is a bit of a disappointment.In the end this doesn't detract from the overall experience and it is still a joy to play, especially with a friend or two.

												While not perfect, there is little reason not to recommend this game. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are a few ""unforgivable"" issues which Gearbox needs to address sooner rather than later in terms of impacting an RTS game's playability. - Mouse Input lag. This is a no-no of the highest order in an RTS. The good news is that this is not an RTS that really relies heavily on your APM. but mouse accuracy is pretty high up there, especially if you are zoomed out to control the battlefield. - Going to black screen somewhat randomly during the campaign is hard to fathom - but based on it's behaviour with a dual monitor set up, I wouldn't be surprised if they are related. - Speaking of dual monitor, it has some very odd behaviour related to the mouse to pan and dual screen set up. I generally don't mouse pan the camera due to a Starcraft background, but it is a bit disconcerting to nudge the screen in one situation, then have the mouse leap off the game completely in another situation with no clear reason why. - Finally, and much like mouse input lag, a fairly unforgivable issue for an RTS player - inexplicable freezing. This is a very intermittant, seems not to impact the Frame rate which can get up to 260 if you let it, and stutters the game. The game doesn't ask all that much of the system resources that I could tell. GTX 970 with a processor that chilled right around 30% with some other software doing it's stuff... so I really can't explain the freezing. On a non-bug topic, I find the tutorial to be woefully weak, leaving out some really pretty key fundamentals of the game - like the importance of some of the utility ships. So not perfect, and needs to pretty significant patching and updating to get some of these fairly regrettable bugs handled. That all out the way... The remastering of this game is a rare case where the term remastered actually applies. The audio (which is original) has been significantly cleaned up, and the graphical overhaul is... remarkable. Additionally, some advancements between 1 and 2 were retroactively added to 1, including some of the significant UI improvements. Some old-time players will feel this is a detriment to the game, but I think first time players of the game will certainly appreciate the changes. The campaign is very good - but I have not played through enough of the campaign to offer thoughts on any changes they have made the story, so I assume there aren't too many, so I feel safe saying... the campaign is very good. The game difficulty varies, during the campaign, between easy enough, and well... not easy at all. You will find the instructions for some of the objectives are a touch vague (see the point earlier about the tutorial deficiencies and say ... salvaging a larger ship), but the pace of the game is not such that you can't figure out most everything on the fly. There is, as I recall, some level of dynamic difficulty added - so that you can't build up a powerful fleet before the mission starts.The game is lacking it's multiplayer in any real way right now - though its in beta for a steam implementation. All in all, a pretty stunning ""remaster"" of what is still a top notch RTS  that I do recommend, but offer a few caveats. 1) If you are a big fan of the homeworld series, be ready for changes in the remaster you may not entirely appreciate - but you do get a digital version of the originals so that's probably worth the cash right there. 2) If you don't want to deal with the bugs, wait for some patches before you buy3) It is a remaster - so some old school game design elements are clearly in force, if you are looking for a slick reimagining of the RTS genre with a sci fi theme and new UI and design innovations, check out Grey Goo instead. twitch.tv/sanlumiere "

												Well well well....it seems that homeworld has finally made it back onto the main gaming stream at last, thank you gear box software. Onto what you all want to hear however, how does it play? Well then lets break this beast down.Age:Well lets face facts, homeworld one came out in the summer of 1999, and its sequel came out in the fall of 2003, so having said that, I bought both of these bad boys when they came out. I was so very young, and I was into all sorts of RTS games at the time. Command and Conquer, Starcraft, Warcraft, Red Alert, and Tiberian Sun, so I loved all RTS. To that point, this game destroyed all of them.Gameplay:Well since Gearbox was so very forward thinking, this game comes with a pretty awesome multiplayer, however its still in beta, and there are still some persistant glitches here and there. The campaign on the other hand is a differnet matter, long gone is the ability to choose between the Kushaan and the Tidann when starting the campaigns, you can only play the Kushaan (the mother ship race that is pictured on the box). While this is not a big thing, I was more of a fan of the Tidann mothership as well as the look of their fighters, however this is a small gripe. This game suffers from most RTS problems about missions, the curse of variety. What I mean by that is the pure fact that not ever mission is going to be, ""Warp in, look around, fight baddies, then warp to the next mission."" Some missions have you doing different things, and some of these things tend to slow the pacing down just a little bit. This is the only complaint, this game has brought me to tears many times as a child, the music, the atomsphere, everything is just spot on. Graphics:The first game looked amazing back in the day, this time around it just looks eye bleeding amazing, I could not ask for anything more. Also the cutscenes are still pretty awesome, and now that they are redone with some glorious 1080p resolution, they look even better. Think of the cutscenes like reading and animated comic book, if that sounds confusing then you will understand when you play the game. Controls:These controls are a little different than your standard RTS game, since you can move in three planes it makes controlling a bit different. Using the mouse works well, but to move freely you need to use the keyboard as well. It does take a little time to get the hang of things, but a pro vs a novice will only be able to look and move things faster in the end, it will not make or break gameplay.Overall: 10/10If you are a fan of RTS games then this thing should be in your cart before you finish reading my review, its such fun to play, and not to mention the pacing of multiplayer is both laid back and pure tense action. Get it, love it, and just enjoy the sin out of it.			"

												HOLY SHEEIT they messed up the HW1 campaign, simply by making resources WAY WAY WAY TOO ABUNDANT. At one point I had nearly 70,000! In the original HW1 you really had to scavenge resources and salvage enemies whenever possible just to beat the game. Now resources are so abundant that later levels can be beat just by kamikazing your strike craft into enemies and building more (lol).Also, the ship AI often acts kind of autastic, and they never stay in formation.Still recommend though, 2 really good games (and multiplayer which people are actually playing) in one. Hopefully someone makes a mod just to limit the damn campaign resources to a challenging level.			"

												Of all the remaster's I have encountered this is the best one by far. Gearbox didn't want to reimagine the game or reinvent it, they got the old developers back together and remade the game in all its glory. Hell if you don't want to play the remastered versions you even get the old classic versions  that have been updated to work on modern OS's.The new interface is a huge improvement and the game itself has been refined to work smoothly and painlessly. The multiplayer is still in beta but to be honest, if you buy this for the multiplayer you are going to be dissapointed, the core feature of the Homeworld series has always been about the story, the story of the Hiigarans.This game isn't just a remaster, this is the revival of a series, and it is very clear the developers didn't just want to create something the fans would love, but something they would also love, this game is a love letter to the fans to say thanks for the support.Also the mods are pretty great.

												The graphics are a huge improvement, and there are some gameplay improvements over Homeworld 2. But a ton of features got cut compared to Homeworld 1, and the multiplayer is out of balance in many ways. There are a lot of mods, though, which may save it from being bad (or at least disappointing to oldtimers).			"

												I nominated this game for the test of time award because the core mechanics of the game still stand strong after all these years.One of the best space RTS ever made! I have played it before, and now with the remastered edition and with support for mods it will sure give new life to the game for years to come.Pure fun!			"

												one of the best rts games i have ever played, the remastered version brings up to date the exact same excitement and brilliance of the first orientation. the modding community has came up in the hundreds to support the game once more. the controls and the reskin has made this game feel fresh and new and the developers have done a great job in reintergrating with the modding community which made this game into something else entirely. after playing this game again and reliving the experience again i am glad to say that this remastering is exactly what it says on the package, a complete and utter mastery of the same game that proved to define a generation and revitalise the rts theme.  10/10			"

Reason why i bought this game because i was a die hard fan of this game when i first laid my eyes on it when my cousin first played it. After playinng all the remastered campaign, it felt like it never left. It is a clean and a well polished game albeit a few scripting bugs, but other than that its a wonderful game to me.10/10 would play this everytime when im in the mood for something spacey in my games library			"

Posted: March 12, 2015
												So, this is my review of the Homeworld1 remastered. I have no interest in playing or trying homeworld 2 remastered because it wass pretty dull back in the day when it was launched and it propably haven`t gone any better in the last decade storywise unless some radical changes in script what i will highly doubt what is saw from the ""effort"" they put in HW1R.I`m going to list some bugs and issues from my playthrough of HW1R. (PRIOR UPDATE 1)Let`s begin.-Strikecraft fuel (so that is one gameplay mechanic removed)-Support frigates tend to bug out in groups(start spinning around in circles) and guard command does not seem to work with them(?)((only repair order)) -Military parade formation dont work (is in the game?)-Resource collector can`t seem to find resources sometimes and you have to issue scout parties to find nearby resource field + salvaging scrap metal won`t work as intented(?) all resourcers try to get the one only hunk of metal and follow single resourcer so...(i think this was issue too in the original but thought remastered would fix that??)-Once saw a invisible Heavy corvette(wow)-VOICEBUG FIX IT FIX IT(some ships leave engine sound even thought they are gone and the sound goes on)-detachment of formations while in combat(annoying to use attack bombers for example)-garden of kadeshi capital ships got stuck while retreating to kar`toba and were invicible that happened few times on level 08.-Captured carriers cannot build, only launch? (????)-Captured ships change or dont change colour(??)and it seems some change stats too. for example black ion cannon frigates after hyperspacing they change colour and stats.(woo)-Some captured ships (or most) cannot be retired before hyperspacing to next level.(so you have to scuttle them if you dont want horde of crap thrown at you on the next level)-some scripted scenes decided not to show up(???)-after cancelling hyperspace jump you cannot access sensors manager.-junkyard dog is bugged out totally(for example destroy the hyperspace gate where it is going to jump it will roll around aimlessly around non-existing gate)+ you cannot attack it when it has captured any of your capital ships except with fighters and corvettes.-invisible harvestable metal scrap-Autolaunch during beginning of every level(?)- research ship sometimes gets weird and goes to pieces in the middle of the level (like half of it docks with mothership and other half dont)-Docking issues with strikecraft during movement with carriers for example-NO TAIDAAN CAMPAIGN why?I really feel like devs could had done much better work with this franchise improving gameplay mechanics and overall enjoyment/replayability level of the game.To me this feels like they just tried to port hw1 to hw2 engine slap new UI over it and voila + the visuals ofc, but i gotta say game looks beautiful and sounds too but i feel i have much less now than with the original.No taidaan campaign was a big blow to me because i enjoyed the idea of playing both races and still no timewarp, even cataclysm had it. this is not a difficult game thanks to the HW2 style fleetsize based enemy force size manager.gameplay wise i dont think devs did anything to improve or add to the game, i wish i could`ve capture raider carrier but no or to find easter eggs i havent found before or to have something expanded to me what was not propably in the original game.this should have been called homeworld 2 remastered + homeworld 1 mod.remastered should be superior compared against original, this is not the deal here.Devs propably are not going to fix these issues.note to devs:do not try to do a remaster if you cant do it correctly.

												Gearbox has done an excellent job updating a classic space RTS, one of my favourite games ever made. The original Homeworld was excellent for its rich atmosphere and lore, which was supported by a fantastic art style and amazing sound production. Gearbox has kept the same nostalgic atmosphere while adding massive improvements and quality-of-life improvements to the game. On top of that, they've been very active in the community, responding to issues quickly and effectively, releasing new patches that have fixed minor issues.			"

												Homeworld is one of those exceedingly rare gems in gaming that seem to get everything just right. The story is set in a rich universe with interesting races and characters. The gameplay is fun and complex without being complicated.The sound design is captivatingly immersive. The visuals are absolutely stellar. Its rare enough these days to find a game that looks, sounds and plays great all at once, but Homeworld's genius is in how well all those apects are so masterfully integrated... What does that mean? Well, without spoiling the game for you, imagine loading into a new stage:...Your fleet just emerged from hyperspace. Judging from the earlier cutscene, you are heading to the outskirts of the system, a fact now illustrated by how distant the sun has become in the 3D space. You start to feel isolated, a feeling not eased by how haunting the in game music has become. Fleet command just issued an objective: Send a ship to investigate an anomaly. In response you open up your sensors manager to get your bearings. You find some resource asteroids and send your collectors to harvest them. The collectors reply with acknowledgments, you zoom in closer to marvel at how well detailed and utilitarian the design of the resource collector is. You hear fleet command reporting that they can research a new ship model. You glance at your resource unit indicator and calculate that you can do the research and build one new ship or forgo the research and build five more weaker but more manuverable ships. You decide to go for quality than quantity. You decide to split your fleet into two groups, one to go forth and investigate the anomaly and another to stand guard and protect the Mothership. As you monitor your fleets you notice that the music is changing, something bad is going to happen! you feel your palms getting sweaty as you issue commands to your ships, strikecraft to aggressive stance, set claw formation. You open your sensors manager, you see two large groups of red pings heading towards your fleets. Your uneasiness changes into fear as you realise how outnumbered you are and wonder if your fleet will make it... Homeworld is filled with amazing moments like that, moments where you will be immersed in the game; its tension, its conflict and  in how real the stakes feel. As one tactical mistake can end in strategic failure and your losses will carry over as resources are finite and your fleet is persistent. If you lose a ship, its gone forever. This makes all the defeats all the more painful and all the victories you will achieve all the more cathartic and meaningful.To sum up; get this game! you will not regret it!  "

Too bad that HomeWorld 2 classic wont work on windows ten but the remastered edition... Awesome! I highly recommend this game. Not only is it fun but it has the old campain... With new graphics so that just makes life awesome. I hope hw2 classic gets fixed for windows ten but great game or games though!Disclaimer: in order to play the remastered you have to download the classics... But dont worry they come with the game.

												HW2 Remastered's graphics are pretty and the performance/speed is indeed much better that the original. They did a decent job recreating the classic without destroying it.I am more interested in squirmish battles than the storyline so I wont review that part.  I played the original quite often with the Homeworld Complex mod by Beghins. The non modded experience is a little too simple and easy for my taste. Hardcore RTS fans might want to stick to the HW2 Classic + Complex 9.1 until the Complex mod is released for the Remastered Edition.  "

												There seems to only be one major flaw in this game. The AI...I will not pretend that it is as bad as Rome II at release, but its not exactly amazing. Even if you put it in aggresive tactics in expert mode it still doesn't pose much of a threat. It just builds a bunch of carriers then sends wave after wave of the same group of units at you. The AI also won't use hyperspace to any effect and will often use Gravwells to disable there own fighters even if they have the advantage.This thankfully doesn't affect the singleplayer campaign as the enemy is scripted but the player vs CPU is not very challenging.Despite all of this Homeworld Remastered is still a great game and I would still recomend it to you.

Posted: April 18, 2015
												I write this review from the perspective of someone who did not play the original HW, or its sequel HW2. Negative reviews by old-timers seem to focus on gameplay changes from HW1 due to that Gearbox based both HW1 and HW2 in their remastered versions largely on HW2...but the lack of 'tactics' and such didn't faze me much. I also didn't rate it negatively because of it being released (I had pre-ordered) with some nagging bugs which, among others, meant that I couldn't even get in for a week after a mis-guided patch. My 'thumbs down' is because I much disliked two core game mechanics which go back to HW1, into which I get after one paragraph on what I liked.The game has a lot going for it - it's pretty, the music is nice, and the setting and writing is suitably dark scifi. I enjoyed simply watching resource harvesting; little details like the related animations show that the developers cared about making this look good. When I got to battle, I found the battles engaging and fun as well...but here's:PROBLEM 1:You don't really get to battle. In the game, you receive a spacecraft that can capture opposing spacecraft. And it's very good at it. If you're the optimizing, obsessive type (I am), this means that you build this craft and essentially nothing but this craft (to its limit of 14, but that's plenty), then go capture (almost) the entire opposing fleet. My battles looked as follows: (a) I park spacecraft I already own far away so they don't accidentally as much as shoot at the enemy, and then (b) I go hunting for the incoming ships, which, once captured, I (c) park with the rest of my fleet. That's not very epic...but the following I liked even less -PROBLEM 2:Scaling of the strength of your enemy to your own strength. You carry over your fleet from prior missions. In an early mission (MINOR SPOILER), you enter the mission seeing the enemy attack six giant habitats which hold the rest of your race. I first entered this mission facing, I believe, 4-5 enemy ships, all larger than those you can have at that time. From a roleplaying perspective, it made me sad that I could only save about 2/3 of my remaining race...so I went back, this time diligently using what I describe under Problem 1 to amass a rather large fleet before this mission. I enter feeling good about myself...then see TEN or so big ships hammer away at my habitats, far enough away that, this time, they killed 2/3 of them before I even reached them. In fact, I think I saved 1/6, even though I abandoned the 'capture only' strategy I mention above and both hammered them and captured what I could.That's just stupid. I read in forum posts regarding the original, that the cool winning strategy in the olden days was to completely dismantle your fleet at the end of a mission (you get almost all the money back; and if you captured the ships for free, it's even better), then, as soon as the next mission starts, re-build your fleet.  As the game scales to your strength, you then face puny enemies in each mission - easily captured all, added to your fleet, dismantled with it at the end of the mission, and rebuilt at the start of the next...This completely destroys any kind of immersion. I'm not a fan of scaling-to-your-strength games anyway as that lack of immersion is almost inevitable.A shame.			"

												LOL, i thought Homeworld remastered. should be some interesting HD graphs with old fashioned controls.But i´m sorry to say the game is actually worse to play. controls are laggy and graphics are not good at all. i´ve tried to play the game for a couple of days but when i started loosing due to non responsive controls i deleted it. Too bad, as HM2 was a fun game to play in the early days . I can´t recommend it			"

												Totally dissapointed. All those lovely screenshots, fab videos but for me SHIP TRAILS are not working, completely ruins the game visually. One of the things I always loved about Homeworld was the beauty. No ship trails = No beauty.DON'T BUY UNTIL THEY PATCH / FIX or there's a mod to correct the ship trails bug.Can't believe they released it with this bug !			"

												After 15 years, the storyline and gameplay is very unique. Very few modern games immerse you as well as Homeworld can, even to the point of feeling bad for the fighter pilots. When I first played the original game, I was running an AMD-K6/2 w/3D-NOW at 500MHz, 64Megabytes of Memory at 100MHz, a 10GB HDD, a Soundblaster AWE-32 and a VooDoo 5-5000. Now I'm rocking an 8-core AMD 3.1GHz (o.c. to 4.1) CPU, 16Gigs of 1600MHz memory, apx 1.4Tb of storage from 2-SSDs and one HDD, a Soundblaster X-Fi and dual NVidia GTX-660Ti in SLI. All this power just to enjoy the game at maximum resolution, and it's SO FREAKIN WORTH IT! Of course, there are others with far more power than this, but I'm happy with what I pull at 60FpS.			"

												I never played Homeworld back when it came out, I was playing Starcraft and Warcraft.  Now I'm wishing I had.  Being that I never played the original, I don't have some of the complaints that the veterans do with the changes made due to importing HW1 into the HW2 engine.  I understand why they did it and it doesn't bother me.  It shouldn't bother you either.  The game is a blast to play, the storytelling is amazing and it really looks and sounds beautiful.  Yes, there are bugs at the moment (release week) but Gearbox has said on their forums they are collecting feedback for future patches to address many of the issues the veterans have (if possible within the constraints of the engine) and should have the first bug patch ready less than a week after launch.  So long as Gearbox lives up to that, everyone should be happy.  Is it worth $35?  If you like space RTS games (of which there are pitiful few available) then yes.  If you liked Sins of a Solar Empire but wanted a campaign for it, then this is what you've always dreamed of.  Get it today.			"

Gearbox has done a great job updating the Homeworld Games to modern standards and both games run smooth as butter. The multiplayer is still being worked on at this time, but from What I've tried it works pretty well. Don't listen to all of the trolls complaining about a broken release, they are completely wrong.			"

Posted: February 26, 2015
												Before I start I just want to mention that I’m structuring this review for three key groups: people who are looking at Homeworld for the first time, the Homeworld 1 veterans, and the Homworld 2 veterans. Overall, this Remaster does get my thumbs up BUT in its current state there are still PLENTY of problems that need to be addressed (and therefore mentioned). I would also ask that you ignore my “play time” because sadly on my older laptop I have not been able to get Homeworld working properly, but my brother has (for the entire night in a span of about 10 hours) generously let me play on his account. Now, let’s begin…The Homeworld Experience for the new:     Homeworld is a 3D RTS type game that is done in real time and on xyz grids that allow full 3D gameplay (in comparison to 2D xy grid games such as Starcraft or Command and Conquer). If you are a fan of RTS games, be it the two games I have mentioned or Sins of a Solar Empire, you should definitely try this game. In this game, you start off with your “mother ship” and resource collectors, and your goal is to mine resources and research new ship types, and then build those ships to make fleets and then blow up your opponent. During this process, your enemy(s) will be doing the same thing, and there are even possible side objectives or challenges that can be undertaken to gain more resources to help further your cause. In the original games, there were already hundreds of different strategies utilized in multiplayer, but with these new side objectives and challenges it allows for even further diversity.     Factions are also extremely interesting to note: you have the factions from both original games, Homeworld 1 and 2, merged together in the same multiplayer experience. They are, to my surprise, actually quite balanced in gameplay. The game has really brought out the “rock paper scissors” aspect of what this game was originally about, but now with all 4 of the factions present there is a lot to take in and know what counters what, it can be a bit of a learning curve to memorize it all. This, in turn, adds to the diversity of strategy and player style you will see done by the AI and (especially) other human players.      And let’s not forget the campaigns. Two 16 mission journeys that put you through breath taking scenarios, all about a race of Humanoids that must make the journey back to their ancient home (Homeworld 1) and then defend it (Homeworld 2). Each campaign mission isn’t your standard “here you are, go blow up that person” and offer varieties of gameplay, such as in Homeworld 1 there is a mission where you can only use strike craft to complete your objective, or you have three minutes to destroy a massive ship that will ram right into your mothership if it is not taken out. Homeworld 2 offers the same mission diversity, and even gives you unique ships to fight and use throughout the campaign.  On top of that, the research method through both campaigns makes ships limited to specific types as you unlock more and more by progressing through the campaign, which allows players to get used to every single ship type and see their strengths and weaknesses, making the campaign not only fun and interesting, but all in all can be boiled down to a giant tutorial of how every single thing in Homeworld works.     On a final note, if you ever get bored with the remastered game, I highly recommend playing Homeworld 1 Classic, it features the original UI and game mechanics such as no unit cap in games that can be very fun to experiment with.     Seriously, if you Love RTS or space games and have not picked this title up yet, I seriously recommend you do so. It isn’t perfect, but I assure you that you are not only getting what your money ‘s worth but also are going to really enjoy it!From the eyes of a Homeworld 1 Vet:     This section of the review focuses on the negative aspects and what has “survived” from the homeworld 1 game.     I think the biggest thing that irks me about the remastered Homeworld 1 is that they moved it to the Homeworld 2 user interface and model. In doing so they had to can a lot of Homeworld 1’s key features that made it stand out from its 2nd game, and now everyone I have talked to who preferred 1 over 2 has agreed with me that Homeworld 1 remastered just seems to be a decently gone mod for Homeworld 2. The following is a list of features that are not in the remastered from Homeworld 1:-Refueling: your strike craft can go anywhere infinitely without being tethered to anything, allowing them to operate in the game independently and much more of a threat to areas such as your resource operation.-Harvesting:  in the first game, your harvesters flew around the asteroid and made them shrink as they collected resources (as well as dust clouds could be harvested). Here in remastered, they must dock with the asteroid to extract resources because of HW2’s -Repair: ships have to dock with other ships to repair them. While this isn’t a change for strike craft, frigates, capital ships, and resource collectors could be repaired at a range in Homeworld 1-The unit cap can’t be turned off in Multiplayer. This takes out a big chunk of what made some of the craziest HW battles that crazy (we’re talking hundreds of strike craft per person duking it out for superiority in a 6 person game)     Also, formations are a little annoying, and if you don’t believe me, I want you to go onto Homeworld 1 classic, build 9 ships, and put them into wall formation. You’ll get a nice 3x3 2d wall of the ships in a nice and orderly fashion. Do the same in HW1 remastered and you’ll get this weird cross thing with random gaps, and adding more ships to it just seems to make the cross bigger. Tactics are also screwed up with formations, and ships in specific tactics won’t always behave the same in formations the same ways that you might remember it from the Classic game. There is a new learning curve here (or bugs) that do need some attention whether you like it or not. Ships also have a tendency to partially break formation while moving (especially sphere), and on a small side note, sphere formationing ships and telling them to guard something won’t automatically make them form a sphere around the guarded ship. Again, this creates a small learning curve for the vets.     And we will complain about it, but it’s Homeworld, and we will still play it and eventually get used to it. (more on the way)			"

												The Homeworld series is the prime example of a (space) RTS done right. Everything from level of detail on ships, to gameplay, to mod support, and optimization are excellent. Now, I have a terrible gaming setup, a ATI Radeon 4350 graphics card with a AMD Phenom x4 910 processor. For those of you who don't speak computer hardware, this is a low end PC from back in like 2008. A piece of junk. Homeworld 2 ran great on it, and much to my surprise, so does the remastered edition. I have yet to see any serious frame issues despite playing it on a PC that is almost worth more as scrap metal than as a trade in. Granted, this is with most of the graphical settings turned low or off, but this just goes to show that you don't even need a decent computer to run the game. But for those of you who haven't played Homeworld, here’s a little about the remastered edition of the game:Its space RTS involving 4 races with up to 8 players. Each faction gets 4 different classes of units: Fighters, Corvettes, Frigates and Capital Ships with quite a few other utility class units. There are 2 Races from Homeworld 2, and 2 from the original Homeworld. There are significant differences between both generations, which is kind of interesting, especially when you consider the fact that both games are so fundamentally different, that they basically are incompatible with each other without serious modifications. Because of this, the devs, being so considerate of the loyal fan base, even decided to throw in the original ""untouched"" versions of both Homeworld 1 AND Homeworld 2, which is absolutely amazing when you consider the fact that Homeworld 1 is so old that you can't even run it on most systems. All in all, if you are a Homeworld fan, this buy is a no brainer. If you aren't a Homeworld fan, you're getting 2 fully retextured, rebalanced, beautiful and tactical RTS games with their original untouched (and now playable on your PC) versions. This game is a true classic, and I can't wait to see what mods make it to the Steam Workshop!10/10, Why don't you own this game yet?			"

												I think they did a good job on this re-master. I have all of these games and the missing cataclysm game. I bought this off the shelf originally before it became GOTY in 1999. I played this until the game disk broke in a move 5 years ago. It’s my all-time favorite game.  I have been a fan since the first time I played the single player campaign. What makes this special? Why should I buy this RTS? If you like RTS games, and enjoy a challenge this is the game for you. This stands alone in the RTS world for many reasons. The 3D combat is truly 3D unlike other 3d perspective RTS games.  Persistence of units in the single player campaign is another major change to other RTS games that I have never seen. If you lose a unit in one mission it is gone forever. If you build a new ship of any kind it will follow you to the next mission as long as you can keep it alive. I have never seen this in any other RTS game like this. The economy side is a little simplistic but I personally don’t think it detracts from the game.  This is a 16 year old and 11 year old game, but it’s one of the best games I’ve ever played. Well worth the cost. The atmosphere is second to none in the original. I enjoy the story in both, but the story is a little weak in the second game. The re-master is beautiful. I have not had anything bad to say so far. I wish I could give it two thumbs up.  "

												I really thought I'll love this games when I saw the gameplay videos, the tactical options and the gfx. Sadly, I played about 10 hrs of Homeworld 1 remastered now and I am overly disappointed. The controls are the clumsiest ever, the whole game is buggy as hell (hey, try to reassign movent control keys..), and in the campaign I really did not get any feeling of a tactical gameplay. Since formations are broken, since the movement of squads and their behavior is neither well-controllable nor has any intelligent automatism, the whole tactic decisions come down to ""the-more-the-better"". In a battle you are often required to do sort of micromanagement with your fleet of fast-flying, hardly clickable ships, to tell them one-by one that they have to repair another ship, or have to do a special attack etc. Maybe I missed something, didn't play too long, but support-frigates that don't give any support/repair to the dozens of small crafts flying around them, without clicking each single one in action? Formations, the lowest, most basic tactical setting, simply do not work? And Gearbox talked themselves out of doing anything about that? I doubt I will buy any further Gearbox game next future.. Over 20€ for a game I really  dislike because it offers one frustrating moment after another is ways too much.			"

												I have only played for about 48 hours (at the time of this review) and its a short time so I will update this when I have more experience.This game is absolutley wonderful, for fresh people to RTS Games or for a RTS Veteran like myself (AOE, C&C) I found the game as a breath of fresh air as I never the got the chance to play the orginal. The 3D Environment can be difficult to navigate at first but it grows on you, the story is VERY narrative and frankly brilliant, and the mutiplayer (In BETA at time of review) is also incredibly fun and flexible. I would reccomend this game anyone looking to get into the RTS genre or RTS veterans looking for a new take on the RTS genre. A true masterpiece.			"

												Neat, I still have my original homeworld game disc played it many times over the years. This remake was about 90% of orginal game play. like missing the hotkey to select a group of your ships AND then hotkey and mouse highlet a group of enemy ships to attack. Was limited to only attacking one ship at a time but after they would attack any nearby ship. So it is still workable.Who knows they may still make updates after this post.New overlay of interface screen was a great improvement with info mouse overs. After 18 hrs I am am on stage 14, it is worth and eqaul to the game play price. Then I will countinueing on to the Homeworld 2 addition half of the game. I play a few stages and look forward to any game creation stuff if they include that. :) Cheers			"

												Overall this remaster is great and definitely worth buying if you like RTS games.  I rank it my 2nd favorite RTS of all time behind the original Starcraft and its expansion.  Heres my review of it:The good:The art is amazing.  The remastered textures, sounds, music, and models are all more than I had hoped for.  The new visual effects make the game as impressive today as it was when it was first released (the HW1 graphics were amazing for when it came out in 99).  Playing through the story is as fun and enjoyable as I remember it being.  I'll be spending a lot more time playing this for the next few weeks.  I like how my capital ships stay grouped up and in formation after hyperspacing from one mission to the next, that saves a lot of time setting them up.I haven't gotten around to Homeworld 2's campaign yet, but I doubt I'll be disappointed there.  That game is still easy to pick up and play today as it was 10 years ago.  So the graphical update to it will do little but make everything better.The Bad:While the remaster is great there are many changes from HW1->HWRM.  There are a lot of core changes to gameplay when the game was translated over to the new engine, many of which affected the strength of support craft, fighters, and corvettes in negative ways.  Such as: * Fighter/corvette formations having no effect on their behavior in a fight.  Corvettes don't face their targets when circling, meaning certain types of corvettes only use half of their guns in a fight.  This hurts Kushan the most because of the way their guns are laid out.* Guard works completely differently making it impossible to form defensive corvette walls and fighter balls.* Support craft healing abilities require them to be right next to the craft they are healing, as opposed to a comfortable distance away.  Making them both slower to heal because they have to maneuver into position and less effective because they cannot respond as quickly.  It also means two support frigates cannot heal each other.  They just circle around each other trying to sniff each others butts, like a pair of dogs.* Ships have wierd accuracy issues.  Many times their shots are no where near their targets, even when their target is stationary.* You can only build 2 units at a time.  In the original you could build 2-3 of each unit type simultaneously for a total 10+ units being built at one time (3 fighters, and 2 of each of the other types).  And that isn't even counting a carrier.* Research now costs RU and having multiple research vessels does not let you research multiple technologies at once.  Previously research was free and you could designate either a single or multiple research vessels to either research multiple things at once or one or two things very quickly.* Resource collectors will sometimes completely ignore patches of resources and claim that the map is dry.* Everything is less reponsive.  I think this is due to the engine, but I every click and command was crisp and responsive from the original.  In the new engine everything just feels more floaty.  Kinda like Starcraft 1 -> Starcraft 2 responsiveness.  I don't know why this is so hard to achieve in newer games but its something I've noticed.Because of that, the game plays about 60-70% accurate to the original.The Ugly:Of the new remastered graphics I'm very impressed with the missile effects ... when zoomed in.  When zoomed out they aren't there, and you can barely tell where the missiles are by the small missile pods.  In the original you could clearly see missile trails even when fully zoomed out.  And the ending credits are missing the music from Yes, but I heard that was due to a licensing issue.  If you want to see the original credits in their glory just visit youtube.  I have crashed once, and when getting back in game it completely screwed up my hotkeys in a mission where I really needed them to work from the start.  And finally, you need a ""Shift"" account to play multiplayer.  Its completely pointless to make one because they then force you to link it to your steam account before you can play.  Why couldn't you just use my steam account to begin with?I definitely recommend this game, but if you don't mind old graphics for HW1 you will find the original actually plays much better than the remaster.  As for HW2 its probably a direct upgrade, since this is just a modified HW2 engine the game is running on.			"

												I have played the original Homeworld & Homeworld 2 since years back and I am really happy that they made a remaster of both of the games. I recently finished the Homeworld & Homeworld 2 remastered campaign and it was absolutely brilliant. Imagine your greatest gaming moments returned to life with better graphics and smoother gameplay. The nostalgia may play a big part in why I like this game, but I'll try my best to tell you the about the remastered version and the differences between the remastered versions and classic versions.+ The three dimensional movement & combat is astonishing to look at and easy to control.+ The story is great and really gives the game an amazing atmosphere around it while you play it.+ The updated Homeworld 2 UI (which is used in both remastered version of the game) is easy to understand and use.+ They captured the emptiness of space perfectly and it really sets the mood while you are playing the game.+ The multiplayer has also been updated. You are able to play as Taiidan, Vaygr, Kushan and Hiigaran on restored maps with new bonuses and game modes that I've had loads of fun with after the campaign.+ The game is slower paced than games like Starcraft, which means, you don't have to have super fast micro managing skills to be able to play well.+ The game is easy to mod and uses steam workshop.-+ The fuel system has been removed from the remastered versions (This was a system that could be seen as annoying or just another gameplay element depending on what the player thinks. The reason that the gameplay element was removed was probably because of the annoyance of having your ships becoming completely static in the middle of combat.)- The Homeworld & Homeworld 2 races are a bit unbalanced against eachother in multiplayer (Keep in mind that the multiplayer is still development).- The Resource collecting can be a bit buggy sometimes (when recource collecters want to collect debris from shipwrecks for example)- Some cool and useful attack patterns and strategies have been changed since the both remastered versions are runing on an updated Homeworld 2 engine.Overall, this game is truly a RTS masterpiece and is, AT LEAST, a must try for those who enjoy RTS.

												Homeworld is a great game, a great franchise that deserved this great remaster. That being said, you must note that HW1 was basically ported to HW2, so if you are a HW veteran that absolutely despised the HW2 gameplay mechanics, you might find yourself disappointed.For everyone else, including those who never played any Homeworld game, this will be no problem at all - it's mostly a matter of personal taste.Only real downside to the game at this point: The balance. I have played through the HW1 SP campaign so far and I must say that after you get the strongest type of warship available, the game does get too easy. But Gearbox has assured us that balance (esp. in Multiplayer) is not final and will be worked on. (Thus Multiplayer BETA)And if all else fails, there will certainly be mods. HW2 has a very active and ingenious modding community and the remaster has been tendered to offer good mod support. So please don't take this warning as a turnoff, because otherwise, you would be missing out on a great RTS game like no other. Definitive recommendation from me.			"

												HW is easily one of my favorite games ever since it came out. Played it as a kid and still played HW1, Cataclysm, and HW2 over and over and would LAN it with my friends. Now with the remastered version I almost cried from just how great the ships look and the backdrops of space and planets look. Everything came out extremely well polished and awesome.If you have never played this game or a fan of the classic versions, definitely pick this up as it is amazing and always will be. Picked up the collectors edition as soon as it hit amazon a year ago and easily got my moneys worth already and more when people start to MOD the game and when multiplayer is finished.Love this game. Ok, back to playing it!			"

												I can't recommend the game in it's current state. Sure, it looks pretty but beneath it's rotten to the core.I played the original Homeworld and understand how dated the original UI is. However, I would expect an improvement in a remaster. This is quite simply a giant mess. The UI is clunky and sometimes only lists certain ships you need in sub-menus. There is no master list for all production so you constantly have to shuffle through your build orders. Overall the UI is ugly, poorly implemented and does a bad job of differentiating ship classes. It's a chore.....AI is far inferior to the originals. Mobile refineries often don't work, Tactics have been totally removed. There's plenty of glitches, odd AI behavior and random crashes 6 months in as well...Do yourself a favor and get the originals or play Sins of a Solar Empire.  Maybe they will eventually fix the game but I'm not optimistic.			"

												Disclaimer: last 2 day, 3 patches... I hope it's not going to stop and Gearbox fixes the game issues. Summary: Pros: Homeworld 1 Classic runs, which is great. Homeworld 2 as Remastered is great too.Homeworld 1 Remastered eliminates a HW1 limitation: enemy ships target the first ship on sight and do not change target until it destroyed or docked. (and yes, that is all)Cons: Homeworld Cataclysm - where I you? I still miss you and don't give a darn about ""canon"". Homeworld 1 Remasterd is Homeworld 0.8. Too many things on the scewed up/missing list. Starting with the formation, pathfinding, tactics mess, ending with that Remastered misses the iconic words: ""All ships autolaunching.""Gerarbox changed HW1 mid-mission animations in HW1:R. Not about making engine exhausts more glaring, but changing scene and the text.Occasional crashes, 6+ GB memory usage on HW1 Remastered on Mission 14. The long one (TL;DR):Homeworld 1 Remastered screws: - Mission timings, craft speeds, game speed, map sizes as a whole. Game is too fast and far too easy. Starting with time needed for the resource collector to fill up it's internal storage bay. I do not feel even the craft speeds proper... - I had difficulties to use special actions on multiple unit at once in HW1 remastered. - Gearbox altered the between mission animations, sound track, sound effects, noises. And some of the changes simply make no sense, like the Guidestone. - Maximum zoom in and hear the difference of the Taidan fighter craft sound. - This needs checking: but for me it seems that some sounds and effects come from the Cataclysm to the HW1:R.- HW1:R lacks formation & tactics as a whole as other reviewers said. So if Gearbox decided cripple Homeworld 1, why did not they add time compression? - HW1:R UI is an utter disappointment for me. Homeworld Classics runs 1600*900 resolution and UI is far nicer.  This is personal: some ships are nicer in the HW1 Classics than the Remastered. And this is valid for some parts of the space. HW2: Would not say too much about it. For me HW2 Classic was an utter disappointment in gameplay, story and found it ""too epic"". Too many things unexplained in the storyline and I'm fed up with referencing recent navy technology to spaceships (torpedo frigate - master degree in lack creativity). And meanwhile there was the Homeworld Cataclysm... Please check the videos on Youtube about HW Cataclysm. See story depth, the grimm and bloody fight against the Beast and I'm pretty sure that you will also find HW2 weightless.(Not to mention that most of the Cataclysm videos are shot on normal difficulty and using 8-10% of the game's strategic and tactical offering.)

												In 1999 I played a game that would forever impress meWhen I opened the box I was presented with a beautiful manual/lore book full of information and background for the game I was playing.It was beautifulThen I loaded the game up.I was stunned by the gorgeousness of the graphicsI marvelled at how times had come along so much that this piece of art was now in my possessionWhen I played the game the intricacies of the strategy and the challenge of keeping your fleet in one piece and seeing it grow, remembering that old ion array frigate in the last mission that you acquired in the third mission, the epic story as you fought for the right to regain your homeworld and I thought it couldn’t get any better.I was wrongA year later Cataclysm was released, a standalone expansion from the original, it used the same engine but it was altered in a way that changed the rules, following a story set 15 years after landfall on the homeworld, you follow a family of miners who uncover a dark secret and a parasitic virus and you must race to stop it. Again it expanded on the visuals, tactics and story, again I thought it could not get better, and again I was wrong…Homeworld 2 was released in 2003, and with it a rewritten engine, stunning visuals that reminded me of the opening scene from revenge of the sith, and a slightly retconned but no less epic story.100 years after reclaiming your homeworld, the old enemy have arisen under a new leader. Using the artefact of an ancient super powerful hyperspace engine, But you have one too, and there are legends of a third. To reclaim your homeworld once again, you must liberate the second core, find the third and unite the cores to end the threat once and for all. Can it get better?Yes, Homeworld remastered is all of these games (with the exception of cataclysm, which I hope they add at some point) with updated engines and even better stunning hi definition visuals. It’s an epic experience. If you have played the original and loved them, buy it. If you’re a fan of epic sci fi, buy it. If you like strategy games, buy it.Just buy it, go on click add to cart and put your money where it belongs.			"

												I'm still amazed on this game. I played it about 6-7 yrs ago from 1-2 and Cataclysm. At the time I was like why I never heard of this such great game before then was wishing a sequel. I enjoyed an old classic game back then. Now it's back again as remastered. Now it is far greater and better graphics but funny 'coz I forgot how to play this game when I first tried it as I have skipped the turorial. I find it hard to play as I dont understand it anymore for first time again that made me decide to quit right away. But last night I have tried to play it again by going through the tutorial so I can remember how did I enjoyed this game back then. Was 9:30PM when I started playing through and guess what, the next time I looked at the clock it's already 5:35 AM in the morning @.@ that's how did I enjoyed playing this game without noticing the time.PROS:+ Engaging Story and voice narrative+ Music is really captivating+ Detailed gameplay+ Strategic in play+ Lots of ship varieties - it's a big space fleet you're gonna create and command. I'm ENDER!+ Great graphics+ Camera focus - I just like seeing the battle upclose or following the specific group engage into battle/sction+ 3D, you can go make your ships go up, down and angled. Not just a tabletop!+ Four games in this bundle remastered collection(including the classic.)+ w/ Mod support+ w/ AchievementsCONS:- Controls can sometimes be frustrating specially when moving units going down/up y-axis or I'm just terrible with it.- Slow pace, moving from point to point can be slow other than hyper jumping some of your ships- Damn no trading cards! Zzzz..- I notice some bugs to be honest but ain't game breaking.NOTES & TIPS:- Go through the tutorial first if you don't understand how to play it at first. I know some of us just wanna get right into the action like I did but it sometimes end up terrible until you just say f** this game I'm going play cod or csgo. lolMY RATING9 / 10 - Highly Recommend if you like this type of game!

												Note - This review is ONLY for Homeworld 1 Remastered, I haven't started playing HW2 yet.'Breathtaking'  is a word I wouldn't normally apply to an RTS, but I think it genuinely fits here.  The audiovisual presentation of Homeworld : Remastered immerses you in the vastness of space, and manages to make each stage in the empty void feel varied and colorful.  Gameplay wise, you've got a fairly difficult single player campaign that forces you to learn the ins and outs of the various spaceships so you can counter your enemies in a rock paper scissors like fashion.  It's nothing groundbreaking, but it is balanced quite well, and generally feels logical and fair.  The story this game tells is also genuinely interesting, and unique.  I have yet to finish the single player campaign but I am already curious to see where things are going and what the truth is about the various factions I have encountered thus far. So .. yeah.  I recommend this game to anyone who likes playing beautiful looking RTS,  and likes a good story.   I'm not going to compare it to the original homeworld because I never actually played HW1 ( only HW2 ).   Compared to the original HW2, the remaster of HW1 feels similar, but it's been like 10 years since I played it, so take that with a grain of salt :)Well done Gearbox!			"

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!The ""Homeworld Remastered Collection"" was once a great game enjoyed by many, but after recent updates provided by the developers at ""Gearbox Software"" and enforced by ""Steam"" the game has become dysfunctional.At the time purchase this product was of an acceptable standard and retained the original value, gameplay and mechanics of the Homeworld series, however after the latest update I find the game to be completely unplayable as it has ruined my gaming experience.Further more the developers at ""Gearbox Software"" refuse to offer any support in relation to this matter, simply dismissing any requests or tickets by responding with a standard template stating ""We'll make sure to pass your feelings along to the team so that they are aware!""The code that went into recent updates was sloppy and mangled in an undesirable fashion to make the game more appealing to current non-existent users as an attempt to maximize profit.For classic Homeworld enthusiasts the developers even went as far as to change several core mechanics of the game, you can't even Research Level 2 upgrades with ""Hiigaran"" races any more, in affect making the ""Advanced Research Module"" completely useless.The Developers went beyond a ""Remastering"" when they started interfering with the core mechanics and gameplay.It's a mess with several performance and gameplay issues, a poorly scaled UI and multiple crashes.From a gamers point of view the developers have ruined a great game that I paid good money for.From a programmers point of view they.. Completely used up all the bug spay and broke the swatter (use your imagination).For those of you that have heard of ""Homeworld Deserts of Kharak"" don't be fooled this is not Homeworld 3, this is simply yet another failure by ""Gearbox software""I do not recommend buying any games from ""Gearbox Software""Don't waste your money on this purchase, it will only bring you disappointment and frustration!

												Was a fantastic game and franchise over ten years ago that never left my mind. I had been disappointed for years by the seemingly endless licensing hell the IP had fallen into  and was one of the people ecstatic by the idea that Blackbird would be carrying the torch with the Shipbreakers IP. Then when Gearbox accuired the HW IP and began working with blackbird all my christmases came at once.The remastered edition is all that the original games were with better graphics. They have tweaked some gameplay elements (some for the worse) but overall it is a very tight and beautiful package that captures much of the magic of the original game. The depth of the gameplay is somewhat lacking by todays standards while still true to the original but this being a remaster that cannot be considered a fault.Mod support and the all but promise of a Homeworld 3 if this remaster did well made this purchase a no-brainer. I look forward to many more years of enjoyment with this IP which captured my imagination and love of Sci-Fi when I was young.			"

												I was a big fan of Homeworld back in the day, so couldn't wait to play the Remastered version. It's still a good game, and looks fantastic, but compared to Sins of a Solar Empire (the other great space RTS), Homeworld Remastered seems extremely dated. I'm very surprised at how boring I find the gameplay, and how unexciting the battles are too, despite the glorious effects and ship models. Sins allows for huge RTS space battles too, but they are really thrilling, and because you can name you ships, and because they can gain expereince, there's a great connection between you and individual ships.  I'm really looking forward to where the Homeworld franchise goes however, as it obviously has a huge amount of potential.			"

												In my opinion Homeworld II is rather slow and the build options were quite limited.I did think it had an interesting design in terms of unit research and production being tied to installed modules on capital ships. The controls were inuitive but quite clunky and did not work correctly in all cases.Would pick it up for a fiver or tenner at max. But I think I have seen enough to not really want it.			"

												A true classic that defined the (space) RTS genre brought back to life and given a treatment worthy of its legendary status. This is the game that paved the way for titles like Sins of a Solar Empire, EVE, and many others.One complaint that I have frequently heard is that the HW1RM SP campaign doesn't quite live up to its original for a number of reasons. To this end, I would like to point out that Gearbox has been updating this game continuously since its release, and the various patches have already improved this aspect a lot. There are mods/patches available that do things like restore the HW1 armor values/building speeds etc. as well so eh, there are ways to mend it. For every moment you delay in buying this game, the Taiidan draw closer upon Kharak and another Hiigaran outpost falls to the Vaygr. It's time for you to do your part, commander.			"

												This game is one of the best RTS games ever made, it's really challenging (well at least, if you haven't played it for a while *cough* 10 years *cough* and if you start the campaign on the highest difficulty). Well, it might be hard for newcomers, because they might have troubles with the controls at first..but they will get them (sooner or later).Also the graphics of the remastered versions look really cool, even on mid or low settings (but the highest settings are definitely the best settings, because with these, the gam looks so ♥♥♥♥ing awseome (well, at least in the area of space RTS games, like ""sins of a solar Empire).The soundtrack of the game(s) are also grand masterpieces in my oppinion, because they give you a really atmospheric feeling, while you are playing, which increases the already great atmospheric level.The only thing, that doesn't work very well, is the Multiplayer, but it is still in the beta phase, so it is acceptable.Finally, it only remains to say:This game is just awesome and you should totally buy it, if you liked the ""old"" Homeworld games, or if you are a fan of ""Space ship RTS-games"", even if the controls are a little bit hard for new players.

												Its rare to find a dev like Gearbox who is truly passionate about a game as much as its players. Homeworld remastered is almost everything Kushan/Hiigaran  who were present on the banana-shaped mothership during the homecoming journey and along with fellow Shajuk followers shed their blood to defend their Homeworld, a decade ago, wanted, save for perhaps the multiplayer crowd. But I'm not into multiplayer so this is $25 well spent, despite only 20 hours in game.Pros: old homeworlds upgraded to their proper HD glory. Cons: the original narator voice actor are no longer here with us, and Homeworld 1 game play was changed quite a bit to accommodate to HW2's engine (which applies to both games).			"

												StoryHomeworld is a masterpiece. The stories still give me the chills years after playing them for the first time, particularly Homeworld 1. The voice acting was updated, along with sound effects which add to the updated 3D models of the game. These updates give the feeling of actually controlling a fleet in space, which adds to the atmosphere of this beautiful game.GameplayThe gameplay was unique when it was first released, and it is still one of the few games to do 3D RTS correctly. AI is great as well, and makes for a challenging experience. The 2.0 patch released in June 2015 changed the game for the better, making it so that formations were viable and usable across all races that you control. Gearbox has worked long and hard to alter the Homeworld 2 engine function in a way which Homeworld 1 and Homeworld 2 units could compete with each other.Bottom lineI recommend this game series for anyone who enjoys a great space opera narratives, as well as any Science Fiction fan. Real Time Strategy gamers will also find something here that doesn't exist in most RTS titles.			"

												Impressively broken. Resource collectors get stuck in thin air doing nothing while there are resources on the map. In the original I never had to worry about them, they would mine out the map. Here I have to babysit them constantly and spam the Harvest command every 2 minutes or they will get stuck. Also if you blow up an enemy capital ship they leave behind debris that can be collected, and that routine is COMPLETELY broken, all collectors will queue up to pick up the same chuck of metal and then they will do nothing even if you use the Harvest command. You also can't return those to a resource controller, you have to take them back to the mothership which may be 5 minutes away, during which time you are basically not mining anything because all collectors are stuck. Wow.Formations do nothing, they only work out of combat. When you are fighting, ships just break formation and go all over the place, so you can't micromanage or focus fire anything, you just CTRL-click and pray. The AI is broken. When you are under attack by a fleet, every enemy ship is prioritizing your salvage corvettes. If you dock them, they just kind of don't know what to do anymore, they just fly around taking occasional pot shots at your fighters until they get blown up. Your resource collectors never get harassed, I had them mining right next to an enemy fleet and nobody bothered them, instead they went for my salvage corvettes who were 20 km away.Audio is messed up, engine sounds will occasionally stop working or burst into static and kill your ears.Adaptive difficulty is a mess and very easy to abuse. If you leave the Kadesh missions with 25k RU's hoarded up and only build what you need when you need it, the campaign is a faceroll from that point on. You don't even need to capture anything ever, in fact it would be best to retire your salvage corvettes, thus breaking the enemy AI and having them fly around like headless chickens.Multiplayer is unstable and in beta.Just....ugh. The game needs like a year of patching, I'm not even sure if it's fixable at this point. Or if they will bother. DON'T buy this yet. Wait to see what they patch and wait for a sale.			"

A worthy remake of the epic space opera that pioneered the three-dimensional strategy genreI remember playing the original Homeworld in 1999 and marvelling at the fidelity and amazing graphics. Launching the ""Classic"" version today – only possible thanks to Gearbox recompiling the original code to run on modern operating systems – isn't quite as impressive as it was back in the day. How fortunate then, that they have done a stellar (pardon the pun) job with the Remastered versions of the two main games in the series.The graphics are top notch, with some incredibly detailed textures, impressive explosions and beautiful galactic backdrops. Both games now run in the same engine, however I would highly recommend playing Homeworld Remastered before Homeworld 2 Remastered if you're aiming to experience both, since the latter has even better graphics and many more polygons. The new and improved interface (used in both Remastered versions) also gets slightly more cluttered in the sequel, so you might appreciate the easier learning curve of beginning with the first game.Maneuvering a battlefield that goes in all directions can be a bit confusing at times, even when you've memorized all the controls. Occasionally you may find yourself fully zoomed in on an asteroid when all you wanted to do was to check up on your harvesters. If this happens, remember that you can use the Pause button to freeze the action until you find your orientation again. By all means, remember to use the Pause button even when you're not doing close inspections of rocks since it can (and will) seriously help with giving orders in the midst of hundreds of spaceships trying to destroy eachother. Also, a paused battle looks absolutely stunning with all the missiles, ion beams and explosions quietly suspended in space.Storywise there are a lot of things going on, with both campaigns more or less revolving around the Kushan (player faction) homeworld, Hiigara. While there is a cutscene between every mission that give brief explanations of past and current events, and frequent mentions of (and interactions with) other factions during the campaign, one generally feels a bit disconnected from the universe. The Kushan certainly seem familiar with the the friendly and technologically advanced Bentusi from the start, but who are they anyway? What do they look like, and where do they come from? What do they want? Naturally, those who are interested will find out more on the internet, but players shouldn't expect the games to pique that interest.While certainly not without it's (minor) flaws, if you're into space, strategy and/or Adagio for Strings, the Homeworld series is well worth your time and money. Not just because it started a new genre, but more importantly because it is undoubtedly still the king of said genre.			"

												If you had a tear blinking in your eye when you heard the theme music after 16 years, welcome friend, this remaster will give everything you need to bring back old memories, in HD!Homeworld had redefined the RTS games 16 years ago with its unique 3D space view where you could command your fleet not only horizontally but vertically. Since there is no terrain here, strategies are diverse, entrapping the enemy fleet in a crescent shaped formation was never more satisfactory.Combining the original beautiful story with immense graphics after 16 years, Homeworld Remastered Collection is definitely a must buy for both the old gamers who will re-enjoy everyhing in a more eye-appeasing manner but also for the people who have never heard of it, for this is the game coming from the best times of PC strategy gaming, where story and gameplay elements were put forward than hollow graphics. Good point is, now you can have both!Only downside of this collection is that it does not contain another classic; Homeworld Cataclysm. I would really like to go through the story of mere miners of Kuun-Lan against the vile Beast, but seems like the source code of the game was lost when Barking Dog Studios hit the dust.Overall, this collection is a must buy for all RTS lovers and ""dinosaur"" players who have lived to see when this game rose for the first time.""The Mothership standing by""			"

												Game is broken. Many have posted over the last few months that Mission 10 of HW remastered ""Super Nova"" will not complete when the mission objective is complete. The problem is not fixed. The ""solution"" is to reload the mission from the beginning and try again, over and over and over until it decides it wants to work. Come on now, if its broke, fix that or give a free save file for people who have the problem to skip lvl 10.			"

												hw1 is the best strategy game made in my opinion. engaging gameplay and story.the remastered version just isn't very good, graphics have been brought up to date but thats the only improvement. they completely removed several features that made the original so great and have brought it on par with its rather characterless sequel HW2. The remastered collecton is the only time i have ever preordered a game, wish i hadn't bothered.i hope that at some point a future homeworld title is released that can bring back some of that original HW1 and HW cataclysm playability.

												Since the vast majority of negative reviews here are misleading and either nitpick or make vague and uninformative complaints about failed launches, I figured I would give you guys a more comprehensive first impression of Homeworld Remastered. Before I start though, know that I haven't played the original Homeworlds and am new to the series. Also, the in-depth review will come a bit later, given that I've only played for a couple of hours. Here's a quick summary of the game's pro's and con's. Pros: + Satisfyingly simple yet beautiful visuals+ Ease of use [I was reticent about how easy it would be to control fleets given the scope of the game and my inability to micro efficiently but the controls are spot on].+ Audio---I can't stress this enough. Gearbox got the original developpers to contribute their original audio files—UNCOMPRESSED—for the remastered game. If you have headphones that are half decent or, ideally, have dolby 7.1, you're in for a treat. Also, the zoom level will give you access to different levels of audio. Zoomed out? You have the audio of high ranked officers and frigates. Zoomed in? You hear the dogfighting grunt screaming for his life as he's blown up. + Story: The narrative does a good job at not holding your hand too much. It drew me right in during the first few missions, and combined with the audio and headache free controls, nothing is really in the way of you experiencing the story without any hassles. +Depth. Again, I can't stress this enough. Try to imagine a complicated hierarchy of ships and tiers, combine that with coordinated strikeforces which utilize altitude and formations, combined with a great two tier command system of macro and micro commands, and you get a fantastically intricate rts which flirts with becoming overwhelming but never quite gets there. Cons:- While the graphics are satisfying, there are certain elements that seem a little oldschool. While I know this was done to maintain the nostalgiac visuals of the original, you get some weird combination of amazing textures on the mothership with odd and clunky parts. - The learning curve. If you're not into strategy games or are looking for something to easily jump into, this might not be the game for you. It's not a simple point and click. Like I mentioned, you have a 3d plane of combat, so you have to worry about attacks from above and below, as well as front, back and side. Also, if you weren't really into space themed games, distinguishing a corvette from a frigate from a carrier will take some memorization. Honestly, forget these chumps who are using steam reviews as a support or troubleshooting forum. They don't post specs, probally haven't even attempted to take the most basic steps in fixing these problems, and are just firing off ""Not Recommended"" left and right. While I acknowledge that my experience, however seamless, won't be the same for others, I think that a certain level of patience is in order given that it's launch day. I've seen AAA titles have much more horrific launches than this gem of a game.A B-List gamers review. Check us out on the Curators page for similar reviews.			"

												Homeworld is a fantastic game. easily one of the greatest games ever made.HOWEVER: there are a few glaring bugs in the remastered version. Including a showstopper.The most obvious thing is the fact that setting up formations for strike craft, just doesnt work. Once they engage a target, they scatter to the winds and do whatever they want. Supposedly the devs were going to fix that, but that was 6 months ago from the date of this review (will change review upon fixing)The showstopper bug, the game breaker for me... is in mission 14 of HW1 ""Bridge of Sighs"". You have to destroy 3 jump gates, battle through an incredible amount of enemies and take out a field generator.Well, I did that, and the objective never went to completed. So I figure.. maybe I'm missing something. And I commence destroying EVERY SINGLE ion frigate in the entire area. It takes a long, long time to accomplish. Still no objective completion. So now I'm stuck... on the second to last mission in the entire game, and no fixes.I can't rightfully recommend this game, not yet. Even though I ADORED the originals. Wait for another patch or 2, then pick it up.			"

												This is a game that I really really want to like. I love strategy and have played strategy games for well over a decade, both old and new. I love titles such as Sins of a Solar Empire, Command and Conquer (EA is teh debil) and Age of Empires. This game has a very clunky feeling control scheme that I cannot seem to get past, I don't believe I've ever really played this game more than a couple hours, I have a bad habit of clicking on it, seeing the launcher pop up and forgetting about it. I simply cannot get excited about this game. I have only played one skirmish to completion and despite the honestly, very interesting story, I can't bear to keep progressing past the first mission. I feel this game is something that old fans will enjoy, but for those of us who have never experienced Homeworld before it may be something you pass on until you see a -75% off sale.			"

												StoryHomeworld is a masterpiece. The stories still give me the chills years after playing them for the first time, particularly Homeworld 1. The voice acting was updated, along with sound effects which add to the updated 3D models of the game. These updates give the feeling of actually controlling a fleet in space, which adds to the atmosphere of this beautiful game.GameplayThe gameplay was unique when it was first released, and it is still one of the few games to do 3D RTS correctly. AI is great as well, and makes for a challenging experience. The 2.0 patch released in June 2015 changed the game for the better, making it so that formations were viable and usable across all races that you control. Gearbox has worked long and hard to alter the Homeworld 2 engine function in a way which Homeworld 1 and Homeworld 2 units could compete with each other.Bottom lineI recommend this game series for anyone who enjoys a great space opera narratives, as well as any Science Fiction fan. Real Time Strategy gamers will also find something here that doesn't exist in most RTS titles.			"

												Its rare to find a dev like Gearbox who is truly passionate about a game as much as its players. Homeworld remastered is almost everything Kushan/Hiigaran  who were present on the banana-shaped mothership during the homecoming journey and along with fellow Shajuk followers shed their blood to defend their Homeworld, a decade ago, wanted, save for perhaps the multiplayer crowd. But I'm not into multiplayer so this is $25 well spent, despite only 20 hours in game.Pros: old homeworlds upgraded to their proper HD glory. Cons: the original narator voice actor are no longer here with us, and Homeworld 1 game play was changed quite a bit to accommodate to HW2's engine (which applies to both games).			"

												Was a fantastic game and franchise over ten years ago that never left my mind. I had been disappointed for years by the seemingly endless licensing hell the IP had fallen into  and was one of the people ecstatic by the idea that Blackbird would be carrying the torch with the Shipbreakers IP. Then when Gearbox accuired the HW IP and began working with blackbird all my christmases came at once.The remastered edition is all that the original games were with better graphics. They have tweaked some gameplay elements (some for the worse) but overall it is a very tight and beautiful package that captures much of the magic of the original game. The depth of the gameplay is somewhat lacking by todays standards while still true to the original but this being a remaster that cannot be considered a fault.Mod support and the all but promise of a Homeworld 3 if this remaster did well made this purchase a no-brainer. I look forward to many more years of enjoyment with this IP which captured my imagination and love of Sci-Fi when I was young.			"

												It seems unfair to write a (negative) review with just a few hours spent, but the game simply doesn't impress me. This goes for the remastered versions, I haven't tried the classics yet.+ Beautiful. Nice settings, nice backgrounds, nice ships. All good.+ Sound/music. Some people might argue that there shouldn't be any explosions or sounds in space but...not me.+ User interface. Very easy to handle, gives you all the information you need. Very intuitive.+ Real 3D space battles. This is the one aspect that I still have a lot to learn of.+ There's a limited amount of resources on each map and you carry your surplus with you to the next mission.- Each battle feels like I just mass my ships and plunge them in there. No thrill, no excitement, no fun. Maybe I'm a natural at composing fleets that'll crush all opposition, but I don't know... The missions I've played so far has just been me waiting for my fleets to destroy the enemy and retreating damaged ships for repairs. And carrying tens of thousands of resources from each map means that I can build 2-3 new fleets if I should get my fleet wiped out.In conclusion, the game looks great and feels great but just doesn't give you a proper challenge. I would recommend the game if you are unfamiliar to the genre.			"

As it stands you can't relive good moments live them and return this product if you bought it I dont support broken products.Issue: starts, than after 5 sec crashes without producing an error log.Win 10i7-479016gb ramSSD 850			"

												One of my all-time favorite RTS games plays just how I remember it used to! A real gem back in its day, the ""Classic"" game manged to age exceptionally well and still looks good. But now that it graphics have  been improved and brought up to modern graphics standards, complete with UI optimizations that reduce screen clutter; one's view of Homeworld's epic space battles as they unfold is unfettered and rendered in sharp and breathtaking detail. It's absolutely gorgeous to behold and there hasn't been an RTS game to match its theme and style in 16 years! If you're an RTS fan and you haven't had a chance to give this title a shot in the past, you owe it to yourself to pick this legendary title up now! This old gem has been brought to a high and lustrous polish!			"

												Unfortunately, the remastered version of Homeworld is horribly buggy.  First off, if you have you research ship destroyed and have to build another, it will not restore your research tree and you can't research anything from that point forward.  The game is no longer playable when this occurs and you must restart from the beginning.  Many users have identified this bug since early 2015 and the developers have done nothing to fix this problem.Being that the game is no longer playable with this bug, I'm going to focus my review on that.  There are also problems with the general mechanics of the game and how they modified it, but that's child's play compared to that bug.The original Homeworld never had this problem.			"

												I am very pleased to get a working copy of HW on my system again and to play it at 4k UHD.  Unfortunetly, I have crashed a dozen times, had weird graphical glitches that resolved themselves with lowering graphical settings and restarting the client repeatedly and the story line missions are buggy as all get out.  MAKE SURE TO SAVE BEFORE JUMPING TO THE NEXT SYSTEM.  And saving between major events helps too.  If you restart a mission for whatever reason, or it crashed, using the auto-generated saves the mission often won't flag completion, you'll miss research and you will be very frustrated.All in all, the graphics are beautiful, controls intuitive, and the game nostolgic.  With all the bugs, this REMASTERing feels more like a visually pretty but unstable beta product.  They may fix the problems over time, but, I am quite dissappointed that my '99 experience of HW was more stable then this remake.*EDIT* On Mission 12 of HW1:RMI have reached a Can Not Continue bug where the mission objectives are not completing and the cloaked ships are not spawning.  HW1:RM is much too easy and not giving the same replability of Classic.  Lacking controls, UI, tactics and difficulty. Very disillusioned.HW2:RM feels much more integrated and even prettier then it was originally. I would suggest waiting for Steam Summer Sale and get HW:RM for 50%.  Hopefully they will have fixed the bugs, problems and multiplayer by then.			"

												Despite some technical problems I've encountered, these games are amazing! I just love the new graphic improvements, and the AI is so much more challenging to fight!Really, the Remasterd versions are better in almost every way, although the HUD is a bit harder to use, and some HW1 mechanics did not survive the transition.I would suggest this game to anyone. Stunning story (for HW1 at least), stunning graphics, amazing gameplay, and best of all, not very hardware intensive!			"

												Like stepping back 15 years in my life, I resume the voyage I took long ago. The music, the spirit, the heart ache and strife all comes rushing back to me. I stand on the edge of oblivion, wondering if my home is out there, and what villianous cretins stand in my way. I am 16 again, and all the memories of my life come rushing back to me like the hail of fire unleashed on Kharak. I am a big fan of the Homeworld series (as my workshop items are homeworld based and all over space engineers). The game also inspired me to program (A long time ago, pulling apart the code to make my ships OP, or both mine and the enemies ships extremely powerful). I have long awaited this remastered edition of a game, the original which sent me spiralling into my software engineering career. 10/10. Thank you. "

												The homeworld Remasterd collection is without a doubt an amazing piece of work.All the controls are the same (if you can remember back that far, 15 years IS a long time).The graphics, which were amazing 15 years ago, are even better in this remastered version. Even the cut-scenes have been updated and even look better. Everything has been completely updated including the sounds.Some things were added to the game, such as fleet grouping controls.For example:Selecting 10 vessels and groupling them as fleet 1 then selecting 5 of those vessles and making them group 2, all vessels in the fleet remain group one as well as the 5 that are also group 2.This was something that wasn't included in the original Homeworld when it first came out...at least as far as I can remember...lol...it has been 15 years.Gearbox also updated the play screen with fleet info, mission recall data, and que update that was included in (the lost homeworld game) Cataclysm as well as Homeworld 2. So some helpful bits have been added to make the game what it should have been 15 years ago, but Gearbox hasn't altered the game away from what it was, which was awesome in its own state.Even the tutorials are still helpful in playing the game. Even if you've never heard of the game and decided to buy it, playing a tutorial in homeworld will definitely give you all the info needed for basic game play. This also trickles into Homeworld 2 as they have the same controls ;-).As far as I can tell, everything that was part of the original is included in the remastered version. Since I haven't played through completely, I can't tell if the original song The Ladder- by YES was included as the end song. Its a little over 9 minutes long I think LOL, so you can't miss it.All in all, the game remains one the THE BEST RTS games in the genre. Definitely a must have...especially since the original PC game has a very good chance of not working on the newer and faster PC's, not to mention with the updated graphics cards.I've only seen a handful of games that have been remastered, but only a couple of this age. Gearbox has definitely done a great job with The Homeworld Remastered Collection.Definitely buy this game.			"

												They could have just retextured the entire set of games.Unfortunately, they tried to fix everything that already worked in Homeworld. Now, with an embarassingly buggy game, Gearbox has succeeded to turn this classic game into garbage. The resourcers get stuck, the AI has no idea how to play, and the formations for ships simply don't work. Even getting to the main menu was a task. My screen turned black and just sat there. Turns out you need to hit the ""Escape"" key just to get to the menu. Remind me how this is an improvement? In addition, they left out Homeworld: Cataclysm (Maybe I was the only one who liked it).Don't buy this garbage until they fix it or if you enjoy what is basically an Alpha version of Homeworld.			"

The homeworld 1 models and campaign were imported into the HW2 engine, ruining many features of the game. Apart from the multiplayer, which requires a special Gearbox account, there is just the updated textures and models. There were mods that could do this, for free. But this costs money. Pick up homeworld 2 for $10 online and you'll have the same experience, for cheaper.			"

												I have put hundreds of hours into the original HW2 game, played it with every mod imaginable too. Before the remastered version was even heard of i was still happily playing it with friends. But i always had a thought in the back of my head that this game needed so much work just to be even playable on my rig. So so many crashes, so many bugs that made the game impossible to play, so many times i'd stop playing too out of frustration to then come back later after realizing their is no other game out there quite like homeworld 2.To finally be able to play HW2 without error, without issues arising every time i load a single player map, or unable to connect to a friend to compete against due to incompatibility issues. Its  finally all over. i now have to simply press a few buttons and am away with the ships in a far away galaxy.The remarstered game is everything that i personally hoped for. These bugs that people are complaining about i personally haven't seen and even if i did i wouldnt care because at the end of the day a game 15+ years old finally getting the love and dedication it deserves trounces all that. I could never play the first homeworld and right now i've just completed the first games campaign and it was amazing. if you never touched the game before you'll love it. Its a hefty price for a great game, but entirely justified. They truely remastered the franchise and i hope that any company in the future hoping to relaunch a franchise will look up to gearboxes great example. Gearbox managed to keep everything the Fans loved, fixed everything we hated and added everything we wanted. Bravo to the team who did this!!			"

												Of the many games I have played over the years, this is one of those that stands out in my memories. Being a person that has little patience or time to complete games, I would normally use trainers to get through various sequences of a game to finish it as quickly as possible while absorbing the story. Not this one. It always had a certain 'spark' that kept me on the right path to follow it through to the very end. Few have done this for me.In my opinion, it deserved remastering and hats off to them - they stayed true to the original and gave it an incredible polish. The story, music, in-game interface, narration, graphics and attention to detail are as close to perfect that I can imagine.My only regret is not being able to purchase the collectors edition.			"

												Homeworld 2 absorbed my time for quite a while, and I regretted not having beat Homeworld 1, but the game was just too old and felt too clunky to hold my interest. So I bought this. Honestly this is hands down the best 'remaster' of any game I've ever played. It feels like it was developed this year, the visuals are crispy, the controls are improved as well as the interface.And this game has not changed. The story is still amazing. The music is still haunting. It will still kick your butt. This isn't your classic 'turtle and hoard' RTS. You're going to lose a few missions. You're going to have to adapt your strategies. In other words, its Real Time, clench your cheeks and make with the Strategy. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the genre, and to anyone looking to try the genre.			"

Although I am only a few missions into the campaign of Homeworld remastered, sat here on my 40 inch with my surround sound headphones the experience is as powerful as i remember and more, the graphical improvements are obvious and frankly this game being remastered is just wish fulfilment.To be very concise, if you like RTS and you like Space, buy this game, even if you only like space, this should be your one RTS, it's the ultimate space porn.Edit: Ok I finished 1 and every mission except the last on Home world 2 cos its ♥♥♥♥ing hard as ♥♥♥♥, LOVE LOVE LOVE this game so much, please make another Homeworld, or use the UI style for another space epic, if you have not bought this game yet WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?

												I have always been a fan of space based fleet combat. Since homeworld 1 came out I have yet to see any game capture the strategic genius that is the Homewolrd series. The modding community is great and I am really excited about the re-release of the game in a higher def. IMHO... it's the best RTS ever made. If you haven't played it yet, you are missing out on one of the greatest games ofall time.			"

												alright, before I begin I want to point out that I played the originals a long time ago. So when This came out, I went on a nostalgia trip. But, I will try my best to be fair in this.First off, They have done an amazing job with the graphical updates. the game is beautiful. The controls are all the same as before, the general system of doing things is the same and that's awesome. My main problem with this is something that was in the originals as well. In the matches, your opponent can infinitely go up or down. with a movement system that they have, that makes pursueing them a hassle.The actual combat is very satisfying, however. when a missile impacts your battlecruiser, there's an actual hole where it hit. so as the battles progress, your ships that have been around for a long time look increasingly battered and bruised. That's a very nice touch.At the end of it, I would definitely recommend this.-----------------Oh, I almost forgot. This has a launcher that allows you to play the classic version of both games. That is a seriously nice touch.			"

												I have not been excited for a video game release for quite some time, but when this was announced I was excited.When I played the original Homeworld in 1999 I loved it, even though I could never get past the 6th mission at the time, it’s a game that’s stuck with me for a long time.This game with the new engine is simply stunning. The visuals are incredible, the cut scenes are re-mastered and the sound quality is excellent.  Finally Homeworld still has one of the best stories ever delivered in a RTS, it’s hard to describe it without spoilers so I won’t, but I can’t think of another RTS that does the story aspect this well.An interstellar achievement of a game, thank you Gearbox for bringing it back.

												I played the original game, Cataclysm and HW2 and loved them dearly.  These are some of the games that made me a diehard PC Gamer.  I have tried to reinstall the games over the past few years in an effort to capture some of that nostalgia and joy, when they wouldn't install I thought them lost forever.  When the pre-order came out I jumped at the chance, with a great deal of hope and a bit of anxiety at the prospect of this game coming back. My fear are assuaged, this is a beautiful, truly authentic re-master of the original.  I am so happy that Gearbox took the chance to do this, and more so that they did it right. If you have any reservations about this being worth it, whether you played the original or not, please give it a chance you will not be disappointed. "

												I bought, played, and enjoyed Homeworld when it came out and Homeworld 2 as soon as it came out. Excited about the remaster? Yes!Happy with it? No ♥♥♥♥ing way.Homeworld 1 Remastered...Pro's: the graphics have been updated.Con's: special abilities are ♥♥♥♥ed (salvaging? useful repairs?), pathfinding is rubbish, the AI is usless, for some reason resources have increased tenfold. Formations barely work, the ships sort of move and then go YOLO as soon as an enemy ship appears. Most of the keyboard commands don't work. They have used the HW2 engine, so none of the fabulous features of HW1 have remained, but at the same time, none of the features of HW2 have been implemented.I bought this remaster without reading any reviews or criticisms, DESPITE having the original game installed and recently played. I never once thought that a 'remaster' would LOSE FEATURES. It plays like a buggy, poor thought out beta version. It has none of the easy playability of the 1999 release.If this review is unclear, I would like to state: there are very, very few gaming experiences that have been as disappointing as this.			"

												I don't recommend buying this until they get it fixed. Even after 11 updates (one just a day ago) it still doesn't work right. Formations (particularly the parade formation) still don't work, and without the parade formation, you haven't got any way to tell your ships to group up together by type, so selecting all the ships of a particular type to hot-key is next to impossible. Even figuring out what ships you've got is hard. I don't understand why Gearbox refuses to fix this aspect of the game. I'll update my review when (if) they get it fixed, but for now, either avoid it or know that playing it at the moment is a chore.			"

												The remaster for HW1 is absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately in so doing they gutted the deep AI system for the strike craft.  So one of the most engaging aspects of the original game is gone and it makes the early missions where you more or less rely on strike craft tedious.  I'm disappointed with the port on a lot of levels, but then I remember it's from Gearbox so I'm sure this means that Borderlands 3 will be better off. I was on the fence on whether to vote yes or no on this considering the original games are ported in their unaltered form.  I'd recommend getting it on sale just to experience the classics (so long as you don't mind the graphics or the UI being a little rough.)  Otherwise I'd say no, give this one a pass.			"

												I'll be up front and not wax prose when not needed: This is one of the most stunningly beautiful games I've ever seen. I loved Homeworld when it first came out, and hotly anticipated this release. There is no disappointment whatsoever. The 3 dimensional space combat is gorgeous and occurs to a breathtaking scale. The balance is still incredible. There are a few levels that you kindof have to game still, and sometimes the mouse goes crazy, but this game still remains possibly the most satisfying RTS I've ever played. It is engaging and relaxing all at once. I cannot recommend this game enough. Get it now, you're actually getting 2 games that will bring you to tears at once.			"

												This is a pretty cool game, and I guess famous? I had never heard of it until a coworker mentioned that he used to play it a long time ago. I saw that this Remastered version was on sale and that it has some seriously rave reviews and a huge (and aged) fanbase. Its definitely a great looking game and while the gameplay does take a little bit to get used to its really fun. My only problem so far is that is has crashed twice and I've only had it one day. I do have the Halo and Mass Effect workshop mods installed which I read can cause it to crash, and while I haven't played with those mods just yet, that may be the reason. I have not tried the multiplayer yet, thought I should mention that. If you can catch this while its still on sale, and you're a fan of RTS and want to try a space RTS pick this up!Pros:Simple resource systemLooks purdyGreat storySoundtrack is cool (almost BSG Rebuild-esque)Workshop items like the Halo and ME ships look insanely coolCons:Crashes with mods on occasion Learning curve with overall gameplayThe distances between places is bigger than you think and most of the ships move slower than how old people F*K			"

												Homeworld Remastered looks great, but I wouldn't call it a polished (or even finished) product. If you're reading this review, you're doing more due diligence than I did. I saw ""User Reviews: Very Positive"" and ""$17.49,"" and went for it. Ten hours of playtime later, my refund request has been denied and my local content has been deleted. I really really wanted to enjoy HWRC, but I can't. There are a LOT of bugs. I never played the original Homeworld 2, but apparently in converting HW1 to the HW2 engine, lots of unit behavior changed (or just went away), and unit balance is totally different. Strike craft are nearly useless now. You can't select-box-repair with a support frigate. Formations are more of a suggestion than an order. But the number one show-stopper for me is that resource harvesters will just ... stop. For no reason. I'll be on the other side of the map, micromanaging something, and notice that there is NO $$$ coming in. I'll focus back on my mothership and 5 out of 6 harvesters will just be stuck in space. This is unacceptable. I might come back to this game if Gearbox releases a comprehensive bug fix patch.			"

												(As of this writing I have only played Homeworld Remastered, not 2)I was a bit hesitant to purchase this due to the fear that these games weren't as great as I had remembered. I was relieved to find out that Homeworld holds up to the test of time and in this remastered version it looks better than ever.The one thing I remembered about Homeworld was the atmosphere which is enhanced ten fold thanks to the remastering. Nothing compares to sending in a large armada full of fighters, corvettes, ion frigates and destroyers against another force of equal measure and watching the battle play out. Fighters whip around in the void dodging fire and letting loose upon the opposition. Destroyers fire heavy volleys of missles and projectiles which crash into the enemy's ranks. Ships flame out and tumble into an explosion when destroyed or in the case of capital ships they spin around and emit a huge fireball complete with debris. When the battle seems lost you can order your remaining fighters to kamikaze in a last ditch attempt to save the mothership. The backdrops are incredibly beautiful and stunning to look at. This remastered edition makes the game look like I remember it looking.Now with all that being said there is a bit of jank. Scripting has a tendancy to break. Movement commands get a little fuddled sometimes. I have had a handful of weird audio bugs as well. The zooming in and out via the mousewheel is a bit weird considering the setting being in 3d space you would think you could just keep zooming out to move the field of view up but you can't. A small amount of other issues have me scratching my head sometimes.Taking all that into consideration Homeworld has always had a special place in my heart. This remastered edition has me skipping and jumping for joy down memory lane as I relive all those massive space battles I remembered having. If you have any reverance for these games buy this edition right now. If this is new to you I encourage giving it a shot. If you aren't hooked before the first two hours of play you can always get a refund through Steam but I am pretty confident if you like space, explosions and strategy you will find a place in your heart for Homeworld as well.

												Homeworld is a space RTS game released in 1999, it gained popularity by not only creating the single most intuitive space strategy mechanic to date, but also had an amazing story line and one of the most beautiful music scores ever. In Homeworld and Homeworld 2, resource management is key, every resource you collect on one mission gets transferred to your next, so it is a good idea to use it wisely, often relying on salvage ships to steal enemy ships over building your own. Space combat is done on a fully 3D plane, where ships can easily move in all 3 axis, which at the time was revolutionary.Gearbox did an amazing job in remastering this great gem, the graphics is amazing, while keeping the story and the music intact the game is truly perfect now. They made some UI and control changes but in the end it results in a smoother gameplay.There are a few minor bugs such as a sound issue with ship engines when too many of them are moving at once, and the tutorial being slightly broken (you get asked to press okay to continue to the next segment but the tutorial continues on as if you already pressed it), however these are minor gripes and does nothing to ruin this wonderful title.My ratings are as follows:Graphics 8Music 10Story 10Gameplay 9 "

												Homeworld Remastered is a redone, from the ground up, version of Homeworld, released back in 1999 or thereabouts. Gearbox has nailed it, with the graphics and sound being truly immersive, and gameplay even better.Once humanity discovers warp drives, and unknowingly breaks a millenia-old treaty with an intergalactic community, aliens are now tasked with erasing all of humanity with you being our only hope. You command the last human stronghold, a huge elliptical ship tasked with taking the fight back to them, and perhaps reign dominant or become at peace.			"

												Gearbox have done an epic job bringing this old classic into todays times.The graphics are fantastic and the game is very very well optimized as well.The new features are a very welcome addition to the game, bringing in some aspectsfrom other RTS games.If you were unlucky enough not to play homeworld back in the day, then this is the best timeto jump aboard, and if your a vet, then it's a no brainer purchase.Absolutely fantastic.

												(As of this writing I have only played Homeworld Remastered, not 2)I was a bit hesitant to purchase this due to the fear that these games weren't as great as I had remembered. I was relieved to find out that Homeworld holds up to the test of time and in this remastered version it looks better than ever.The one thing I remembered about Homeworld was the atmosphere which is enhanced ten fold thanks to the remastering. Nothing compares to sending in a large armada full of fighters, corvettes, ion frigates and destroyers against another force of equal measure and watching the battle play out. Fighters whip around in the void dodging fire and letting loose upon the opposition. Destroyers fire heavy volleys of missles and projectiles which crash into the enemy's ranks. Ships flame out and tumble into an explosion when destroyed or in the case of capital ships they spin around and emit a huge fireball complete with debris. When the battle seems lost you can order your remaining fighters to kamikaze in a last ditch attempt to save the mothership. The backdrops are incredibly beautiful and stunning to look at. This remastered edition makes the game look like I remember it looking.Now with all that being said there is a bit of jank. Scripting has a tendancy to break. Movement commands get a little fuddled sometimes. I have had a handful of weird audio bugs as well. The zooming in and out via the mousewheel is a bit weird considering the setting being in 3d space you would think you could just keep zooming out to move the field of view up but you can't. A small amount of other issues have me scratching my head sometimes.Taking all that into consideration Homeworld has always had a special place in my heart. This remastered edition has me skipping and jumping for joy down memory lane as I relive all those massive space battles I remembered having. If you have any reverance for these games buy this edition right now. If this is new to you I encourage giving it a shot. If you aren't hooked before the first two hours of play you can always get a refund through Steam but I am pretty confident if you like space, explosions and strategy you will find a place in your heart for Homeworld as well.

												Homeworld is a space RTS game released in 1999, it gained popularity by not only creating the single most intuitive space strategy mechanic to date, but also had an amazing story line and one of the most beautiful music scores ever. In Homeworld and Homeworld 2, resource management is key, every resource you collect on one mission gets transferred to your next, so it is a good idea to use it wisely, often relying on salvage ships to steal enemy ships over building your own. Space combat is done on a fully 3D plane, where ships can easily move in all 3 axis, which at the time was revolutionary.Gearbox did an amazing job in remastering this great gem, the graphics is amazing, while keeping the story and the music intact the game is truly perfect now. They made some UI and control changes but in the end it results in a smoother gameplay.There are a few minor bugs such as a sound issue with ship engines when too many of them are moving at once, and the tutorial being slightly broken (you get asked to press okay to continue to the next segment but the tutorial continues on as if you already pressed it), however these are minor gripes and does nothing to ruin this wonderful title.My ratings are as follows:Graphics 8Music 10Story 10Gameplay 9 "

												Homeworld Remastered is a redone, from the ground up, version of Homeworld, released back in 1999 or thereabouts. Gearbox has nailed it, with the graphics and sound being truly immersive, and gameplay even better.Once humanity discovers warp drives, and unknowingly breaks a millenia-old treaty with an intergalactic community, aliens are now tasked with erasing all of humanity with you being our only hope. You command the last human stronghold, a huge elliptical ship tasked with taking the fight back to them, and perhaps reign dominant or become at peace.			"

												This is a classic remastered! Sure its buggy but what the heck do you expect? They basically took and old classic and added some modern upgrades to it. Almost similar to adding modern parts to an old classic car, you are going to have your ""bugs"" and other issues, but in time you find them, fix them and soon its purring like a kitten (or you run out of money).  I look at it this way. Gearbox brought back this game to give some joy and nostalgia to those that loved this game (and of course make some money). And I am sure that it will be running right in time (fingers crossed). I still enjoy this classic even with the bugs. If you have played the game in the past, I would recommend you to turn a blind eye to the nay say'rs. Go ahead and get the game if you have the itch or wait for the sale.			"

												I read the complaints about HW1:R and I figured, meh, I just wanted to play the classic anyway.  So I got it all loaded up, got all geeked about the back story again, got into the first mission, engaged some claw formation, made my first kill...crash.  Tried again...and again...and again.  Any time a ship exploded, the game crashed.So, I figured I'd give the HW1: R a try.  I loaded the game...no audio.Refund is in the works.  This is extremely dissapointing.			"

												I'll be up front and not wax prose when not needed: This is one of the most stunningly beautiful games I've ever seen. I loved Homeworld when it first came out, and hotly anticipated this release. There is no disappointment whatsoever. The 3 dimensional space combat is gorgeous and occurs to a breathtaking scale. The balance is still incredible. There are a few levels that you kindof have to game still, and sometimes the mouse goes crazy, but this game still remains possibly the most satisfying RTS I've ever played. It is engaging and relaxing all at once. I cannot recommend this game enough. Get it now, you're actually getting 2 games that will bring you to tears at once.			"

												This is a pretty cool game, and I guess famous? I had never heard of it until a coworker mentioned that he used to play it a long time ago. I saw that this Remastered version was on sale and that it has some seriously rave reviews and a huge (and aged) fanbase. Its definitely a great looking game and while the gameplay does take a little bit to get used to its really fun. My only problem so far is that is has crashed twice and I've only had it one day. I do have the Halo and Mass Effect workshop mods installed which I read can cause it to crash, and while I haven't played with those mods just yet, that may be the reason. I have not tried the multiplayer yet, thought I should mention that. If you can catch this while its still on sale, and you're a fan of RTS and want to try a space RTS pick this up!Pros:Simple resource systemLooks purdyGreat storySoundtrack is cool (almost BSG Rebuild-esque)Workshop items like the Halo and ME ships look insanely coolCons:Crashes with mods on occasion Learning curve with overall gameplayThe distances between places is bigger than you think and most of the ships move slower than how old people F*K			"

												Read a few of the reviews on here and some of them ave some incorrect info.From what I was told by people is ""You don't retain captured ships in remastered"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you do.This game retains the qualities of the old HW's. HW1's interface is a little bit different, but in my opinion more user friendly. The missions still get harder as they go on with a bigger fleet... I lost nearly my entire fleet in the Catherdral of Kadesh which was still rather fun since I had a long fight in it.There is a graphical issue when you start the game up if you had a FPS tracker, or are using an overlay software aside from steam. I had to shut Raptr down due to this, so just do that ahead of time and you should be good.Enjoy blowing up those Taiidan ♥♥♥♥ers!			"

												For those who wanted to play Homeword 1 with a new coat of paint and maybe a some UI (User Interface) improvements, this ain't it. Instead what you get is a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mod of the Homeworld 1 capaign for Homeworld 2. Almost nothing works as expected. The UI looks awful, feels awful and is in most ways no improvement over the original one. There is a reason there was no Homeworld 3.The graphics look good. They did a fine job remodeling the ships. Unfortunately with none of the actual behavior modeled, the ships feel like empty husks. Turrets of corvettes don't seem to independently track and shoot enemy ships like they used to, and when big ships fire their giant cannons, there is no recoil on the turret. Everything feels like a 3d-Max model making pew pew sounds.Formations don't work. Instead of the giant walls of capital ships surrounded by spheres of corvettes and wings of fighters you get to choose between a few different amorphous blobs and any time the ships move or see an enemy, the blog disintegrates.Battles don't work. If you follow a fighter, you see that it couldn't hit a side of a mothership if it was docked inside it, making fights between fighters and corvettes take forever. On the other hand, assault frigates swat fighters out of the sky like so many flies. It's obvious Gearbox didn't even slightly try to match the balance of the original game.Salvaging enemy ships doesn't work. Or one could argue that in all their bugginess they work too well. Just make a few of these and capture the whole enemy fleet: fighters, corvettes, everything, and you are done. Just don't build any of your own ships because they will shoot at the captured ships. You see, Homeworld 2 had boarding frigates that captured the targeted ships in place, so the engine doesn't actually support salvage ships that take their prey back into the mothership, and it's obvious that Gearbox didn't want to make any actual changes to the engine, or do any testing.Homeworld 1 classic works. Too bad you don't get any graphical updates or UI features while playing it. Although, it's probably for the best since Gearbox doesn't seem to care about the things that made this classic great. Homeworld 1 is still a fantastic game and doesn't look nearly as dated as they make it look in their comparison videos. All they needed to do was these things:- Use the original physics and game simulation engine.- Update the 3d rendering engine to support modern resolutions and shadows. Although if that was too hard, updating just the models and textures would have been fine too.- Increase the simulation steps per second to at least 30.- Add time control.Instead of doing these things, they made some nice looking ship models for Homeworld 2.

												Wow. What a delightful surprise. I played HW1 casually when I was a kid, but when I picked up this remaster as an adult, the graphics, voice acting, and soundtrack blew me away.Never have I played an RTS and experienced so much beauty that I just had to sit there and gawk at the screen for extended periods of time. I found myself locking the camera on fighters and rooting for them in massive battles. After a while, I felt like I was spending the night stargazing and admiring the beauty of the cosmos, not playing a video game. In a break in the action, I thought to myself, ""I think I just had a spiritual experience in a video game...""			"

In 15 years nothing was developed that even came close to this gameplay.Sadly, however, the game has many bugs.

Also, this dog ate an entire bowl of LSD before commiting to the tasks you try to give it.Additionally, the map sizes feel very, very small.			"

It is riddled with bugs, even more than the original (which is saying something).  Even with Gearbox saying they rewrote the engine, I see some extremely similar issues to the old game.  I can deal with minor change such as ship costs (and apparently Fuel is no longer a resource for Strike craft), and I'm still a fan of the plodding pace and solitary atmosphere, but the issues I'm going to talk about make the price tag of this remake painful to have forked over.  It's amazing this was released in this state and I'm having a hard time believing that much work really went into it.Here is my current laundry list after playing for about 7 hours today (release day):Hotkeys and information.  Some ships have ""special attacks""; good luck finding out what those are or whether they exist, until you find the hotkey for it and try it.  There are no more detailed info panes for ships now, at least that I can find, so you have very limited info on anything's capabilities.  Also, this game causes some kind of interference with system hotkeys... including preventing my ability to use in-game Shadowplay, which is what I use for videos and streaming.  UI for units currently selected is very small, slow and klutzy.Queueing up multiple Research ship pieces will result in only one being built.Capturing and Salvaging problems.  Salvage Corvettes will fight over the same pieces, following each other around.  You cannot tell a group of them to capture a group of enemies either; you must pick them one at a time.  Friendly units will happily open fire on any unit you have in tow, even though it is on its way to the mothership to be assimilated and poses no threat.  Harvesters will also fight with them over carried salvage.  Salvage Corvettes or Harvesters carrying salvage will clump up and prevent each other from delivering anything to a Carrier or Mothership.  Likewise as above, you cannot target groups of salvage to gather with a group of ships; it must be one at a time, or waiting for Harvesters to try and do it on their own.  Finally, a personal gripe; why do they make it hard to distinguish what ships you own after capturing them?  At least they could have changed the color of the exhaust trails or something to make it easier to know what's happening in a battle.Pathfinding.  There are clipping issues and other bits of forgiveable things, but sometimes ships of any kind will lose their minds and do a dance in place until you figure out what direction they need to get free.  When you need groups of ships to engage combat quickly, sometimes they will spend 5-15 seconds trying to recover their formation before they'll engage.  Also, as with the original game, rarely (but comically, at least if you're not playing) a ship you ordered to move (whether part of a group or not) will decide to go off in some completely random direction and will not stop.  Ever.Asteroids.  Oh god, these are horrible... This was always a frustrating level, but now when destroying asteroids, they fade away for a moment, and then slowly create a few dangerous new ones that can't be shot at right away.  The biggest problem there is that you can't select these new ones to attack half the time; if you try, sometimes your idiot ships will just start driving straight into them.  Ships will do no defensive or proactive fire whatsoever against the asteroids.  To boot, when you start the mission, if your carrier ships are on Auto-launch, all your little brittle ships will line up in perfect parade order to get themselves killed.  Finally, when you lose the first dodge-the-asteroid mission, the screen fades to black, but the rest of the game keeps running.  No end screen or anything like that, and you can hear your actions on the keyboard still having effects.Drones.  These little morons will kamikaze into your own ships whenever you activate or deactivate them.  Oh by the way, how do you activate them, you say?  Must be a button or something convenient, right?  Nope:  It's Ctrl-Shift-D.  And you'd never know unless you went through the game options for the key bindings.  I also had issues getting a group of Drone Frigates to respond to this command when deactivating; I often had to do it for each one individually.Repairing.  Pathfinding issues aside, it doesn't appear any Repair Corvettes or Frigates will repair some corvettes that you've captured from the enemy, at least some of the time.  Groups of repair ships will also have the same arguing issues between themselves as Salvage Corvette/Harvesters when trying to patch up the same ship.I'm going to keep playing it to get my money's worth, but I'm afraid I can't recommend this remake at all, as compared to just going out there and getting free or almost-free copies of the original games.  The graphics are much prettier but they aren't mind-blowing for 15 years of progress, and certainly not worth this price.  I'll probably find more issues as I go along, but I'll try to stay optimistic.			"

												The ""remastered"" part is well done. Graphics, UI and all that, but I do not remember this many obvious bugs in the old Homeworld.- My research vessel for example is completly invulnerable. I just had 30 enemy fighters and a Heavy Cruiser (!) firing at it and it just kept repairing itself at about 40% health.- Then there is this shrieking sound that seems to come from Corvette and Frigate class ships. It stays even if you move away. Pausing and continueing the game is a workarround.- Captured Taiidan carriers are somehow unable to build anything. Capturing them is semi-useless that way.- Captured ships seem to play the lottery when it comes to their paintjobs. Some stay in Taiidan-yellow while others shine in Kushan-grey. (Edit: I even got one with pink stripes. YMCA-Cruiser!)And this is just Homeworld 1 to about half the missions. None of it is totally gamebreaking, like CTDs or crashes, but it shows a rather unpolished release.Gearbox also couldn't keep their hands off changing things. For example, Fighters don't require fuel anymore, making the Khadesh fuel ships obsolete. While the reasoning behind this is debateable (probably for HW 1&2 multiplayer compatibility), they were somehow unable to fix lacks in the user commands, for example letting Repair Corvettes guard a group of Salvage Corvettes so that they pick targets to repair automatically. This was okay 15 years ago, but today it feels really really annoying to have to micromanagement everything yourself instead of enjoying the broader strategy game in a true three-dimensional environment.Edit: Okay, now that I played through Homeworld 1 I can only say I'm shocked. This is a typical Gearbox game. The beginning is alright and due to the story events epic, but after about half the game it becomes a static ""move there and jump"". Its like the enemy AI is turned off. At the end I had 7 Heavy Cruisers, not of them built, and also 12 Destroyers. And guess what, the Taiidan rebels gifted me two more, like it wasn't easy enough yet.It was said the enemy fleet scales with what the player has, so I was hoping for an epic battle at the end. What I got was 3 enemy Heavy Cruisers. You can guess how epic that was.Another AI shutdown happend at the giant hyperspace inhibitor 2 missions before the finale. There are three jumpgates which you are supposed to destroy, because they'd send reinforcements otherwise. Thing is, there are no reinforcements, EXCEPT when you go for the gates. But then you are already there to destroy whatever comes through. If you leave the gates in peace, you can do your thing without the AI trying to stop you.This was the easiest RTS I've ever played in 20 years since Dune 2, simply because the AI does absolutly nothing. Combined with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying sound bug, Homeworld Remastered 1 is a complete waste of time!			"

												Much has been written about the improved graphics in the game. The screenshots speak for themselves. But, unfortunately, apart from enchanced graphics there are few positive moments to notice.The in-game speech seems to be recorded anew. I liked Makaan's voice. Fleet Command and Cpt. Soban are good, too. Karan is a bit… not like herself. But you won't probably notice that. Planet Killers theme from the last HW2 mission I've been anticipating the most is just absent. All the other aspects of sound and music are ok.Cutscenes are renedered in 1080p and look just awesome. But the in-game video player is implemented poorly: horrifying lags are obvious, while Media Player Classic plays the same smoothly even at x4 speed, let alone at normal.That is all for the good part. Now the bad part.First, despite nice textures, all the animations and VFx are left as it was. No new interesting additions (such as docking bays holding grip of resource collectors while unloading resource units or a destroyer losing a part of hull being heavily damaged). The repair beams and welding flashes stay as they were, while the soul craves for something more spectacular and immersive. Some of capital ships just don't fit the Mothership docking bay, going through textures. The Junkyard Dog turns ships in space as if they were made of near-weightless thin indestructible cardboard!. Hiigaran miners dock ""through"" Vaygr refineries, piercing the solid metal with antennas. Damage model is exactly as it was in Homeworld 2 — weird and unimpressive. And so on. Nothing positive has been done here since the Classics.Procedure of taking a ""clean"" screenshot is spectacular. To do that, you must manually disable all the HUD elements and deselect all ships, and having taken a screenshot set everything back as it was. All in all, nearly 10 key presses are necesarry to make a screenshot.As the game is about playing, not watching, and the Homeworld series is a thrilling experience to play through, in 20-30 minutes you will completely forget about graphics and concentrate all efforts and attention on gameplay.Hotkeys map seems to remain at the initial state. Most keystrokes are 2 or 3 keys combinations, scattered all over the keyboard without pretty much structuring. Learning and using those is a piano challenge. Nothing has been done to improve the keyboard controls.The campaign felt hopelessly easy. Closer to the end of the game (each one) the resource pool grows to 6-digit magnitude. That causes ""why don't I build a full fleet of these and try them on something hopelessly well defended"" thoughts. The overall state of the campaing indicates that by the time of release no one of the developers had taken a notepad and made a full playthrough of the campaign, marking bugs. When the junkyard Dog at Karos snatches a ship, you are supposed to lose contact with it, but you do not. The ships are supposed to be disabled after that, but sometimes they are not. Sometimes the Dog just tries to place the second ship to where the first is located, thus getting stuck. The Karos Proximity sensors Net is composed of freshly-painted sensors with Hiigaran insignia on them.... I have spotted a swarm of such mistakes during the playthrough.Enemy AI can make a grown man cry. No cooperation between ships is observed, and any signs of intellectual activity within the enemy ranks seem absent. Sending frigates wave after wave into the same minefield is just an example of a typical AI routine. The multiplayer AI seemed a bit better to me. In campaign there is none.Ship behavior is untouched (or even wasted a little). Single corvettes are ineffective (due to special placement of their turrets). That concerns all other ship types as well, so the ships with high coverage ratio are the most powerful ones.  Optimal attack patterns or any means to assign them manually are absent: a bomber can grind a resource collector just standing in one place, but instead it will move at max speed, and on the second run won't shot a single round because of asteroids blocking the shot. So, fighters and corvettes are a pity to watch at (especially single ones, with no squads and poor coverage). Whenever a ship escapes to safety through Hyperspace, rest assured: all your forces will target the enemy base to avenge the humiliation. Repair corvettes and minelayers will go in the lead, as the most agressive and eager to fight. The Gehenna border outpost will be as tough a target for a bomber aqs before: the start of the attack run is a fixed radius, the end is hear the enemy hull. So, the length of the run is negligible here and no real damage will be done. And that is instead of standing and grinding the target. There are worse things. Sometimes resource collectors just get stuck in place cutely blinking the engines instead of mining. Sometimes one of the ships boosts to 4000 speed or so and goes darting to the enemy lines or making enormous circles. My opponent once said his collecors are stuck inside one another and unable to move. Sometimes two corvettes try to repair each other, so they can't dock and go waltzing up to the uppermost boung of the map.  Gravitation Wells do not affect Vaygr corvettes, and Assault fighters had the kamikaze damage compared to a full-sized frigate each (has been corrected on 05-03-2015)The user interface. The only thing I did not expect of it is to get this much worse. The largest button on the screen is ""Menu"" — the button to be used 5-10 times in total. The next one in size toggles sensor view and is never used, as it is bound to the Space key (which is extremely convenient). Right under it is an enormous control group panel that does nothing. Fleet build queue reacts poorly (especially the pause button) and takes 3 keystrokes to open (3 more whenever a build-capable ship is built or lost). The lower right corner is occupied by never-used basic action commands, such as Attack or Move.  Everything listed above and to be listed below is to be scaled manually: extremely small on dtfault and clumsy and self-intersected on larger scales. Build and Research queues provide as few useful information as possible, and have to be scrolled due to the command panel below. Selection and commands do not work near UI objects, selection mechanism is suboptimal, so in combat situations the UI is bound to fail you constantly. Building 50 fighters take 50 clicks. 50 more whenever you change your mind. Overall element placement inUI and credits sequence indicate it has probably been done by a secondary school boy in exchange for a day off school. There is (maybe was corrected on 19-03-2015) a place where one of the names was covered with the white frame around a picture. I haven't even started a talk about possible improvements of the original: robust and fast probe deployment, fast access to compact build options, advanced formation and beharior tweaks (must be implemented in ""real life"", not only on the GUI.Balancing factions is a great work. Great work yet to be done, as the task seems untouched by the developers. This task is in tight relations with ship behavior, so I don't even know where to start. Stealth figters are worth a special mention: being the most advanced Kushan tech, they have less DPS than a scout, move slower, can't hit smaller targets at all, and can't do real damage to larger ones. With feaures this outstanding they should be permanently cloaked without decloak on attack.SUMMARY: to be straight and honest — this is an alpha. Totally raw; loads of aspects haven't received due attention. Multiplayer platform is good and priceless for seasoned players. Textures and models are great. Everything else has been neglected with or spoiled. And it is not the graphics what makes a really good game.			"

												The game in its current state is having a lot of mission bugs in HW1 for me. Unable to proceed and having to reload from the very start to try and progress.This issue should have been picked up from testing.The game however is still quite good. But I find that unable to progress in the missions to be unacceptable. "

												I've played Homeworld and Homeworld 2 several times since their release. With Remastered's release, I find myself fighting the interface more than the enemy.  Certain actions, such as repair, or capture, refuse to target mulitple targets as you could with both of the original games. One-command sending of a swarm of salvage corvettes against a pair of destroyers was one of my joys, which simply can't be done now, to say nothing of the removal of Military Parade formation (an easy way of getting your fleet back under control when it's all scattered) I have repeatedly lost simple battles simply because the revamped interface is so... difficult to work with, compared to the original games. It is non intuitive, unlike the original.Skip this iteration until it's been patched, possibly even a few times.			"

												I am a veteran of the original HW1&2 and HW Cataclysm.This game has numerous bugs and broken mechanics compared to the original HW1&2.The fleet management, unit behavior and strategic view are also broken and it is very difficult to control your fleet on the battlefield.There is a complete list of issues in gearbox forums/HW remastered reported by many users in case you need to know the details.Less but not least there a new voice acting which is weird, remember Gerabox that ambience is a very important part of this game. This ambience is destroyed by a weird voice acting.I don't recommend this game until the issues are fixed.			"

												The only concern I have is that the names of various locations and charaters in Homeworld RM: 2 are inconsistent in their pronunciations.Other than that, everything works together well in the single-player story. The music, however is a work of art in itself. I sit and listen to the soundtrack and it brings back memories of playing the game. (Diamond Shoals, how you torment me!). The modding community is really great, too with the ability to play races from the entire universe. The Kadeshi are the best, though. "

You can't adjust the mouse sensitivity.I try move actions 5 times before it works.The only way repairing seems to work is to select what you want to heal and then right click on the ship that repairs. There is an action for repair, it doesn't seem to do anything.Not much is explained. A formation is good is all the tutorial says. Good for what? Why are there different ones?Why can't I select all ships of the same type?I'm not going to fight a game to play it.			"

												Simpy put, Excellent game(s). While the originals were epic in their own right, the remastered version changes interface, the graphics (including new features like ""battle scars""), and several bug fixes. Plus, it doesn't change the story (at least  didn't notice any changes). another thing, is that it adds the ability to play both the first gen units AND the second gen units, in the same match. So those players that do the whole ""oh, X Gen was better than X Gen"". you can literally, fight them with those units to settle the score. Another thing is that thier are plenty of mods that change the way the game looks. that way, if you don't like the interface or the way an icon/emblem/ect looks, you can change it.			"

												Unfortunatly what other reviewers say is correct this game breaks many of the mechanics that made HW1 a classic formations dont work, Carriers don't process captured craft, you can't retire captured craft, support craft are now dumb and will only heal one craft and then still there. all the AI has been gutted. Yes the new ship skins look loverly but that does not make up for loss of AI. all this could have been lived with but the game is also increadibly unstable. It crashed to desktop all the time and believe it or not you can see what it is it's steam syncing with the game crashes it out did anyone actually god forbid test this with steam. Also any other sort of alert reminder on your pc will crash the game and it's not just a graceful crash to desktop a click on the icon to flick back to the game no the game completely just shuts it's self. Reminder from your antivirus to update you definitions HW crash, Itunes update nag HW crash, Steam sync of the game HW crash. this is particularly noticeable on missin 13 which can be long mission unfortunatly the game wont stay stable enough to complete it. The game should never have been released in it's current state.			"

Posted: June 22, 2016
												As I have never played the original Homeworld series before, my comments made here are based on my feelings playing this game as a new player, and not on whether this is a good remake of the original series.In this game, basically what the player needs to do is pretty much like all the other RTS games, such as harvesting the resource, creating a fleet, researching new technology, defending the mothership, and destroying all enemy spaceships, etc.The differences between this game and other RTS games include:1) There is only one type of resource in this game. It's simple but quite boring.2) The battlefield is in the outer space; there is no topographic features of any kind in this game. That is, no roads, no lakes, no mountains, no nothing to speed up or slow down the moving speed of your units. Futhermore, you can't hide behind anything to dodge fire; you can't plan ambush; and you can't make a detour or anything. You just go directly toward the enemy then fight, and so is the enemy. 3) When you assign multiple units in a fleet, you can specify its formation. However, there is no tutorial or hints to tell you what are the advantages and disadvantages of each formation. In fact, after several hours of play, I still have no idea at all whether the selection of formation will affect the attacking or defending ability of the fleet or not.4) Although the player can command a specfic unit to attack a selected enemy, normally you won't have time to do so, as you cannot pause the game and there are simply too many enemy to target and you got so many spaceships to control. As a matter of fact, the program always hung up whenever I continuously move my units around the map. I'm not sure whether it's the problem of my computer (which I bought around a year ago to perform some computationally intensive numerical simulation) or there actually is a bug in this program. As a result, all I did in this game was to produce spaceships, group them as a fleet, assign them to attack, then they will move straightforward to the enemy to kill or get killed.5) The strength of your enemy in each mission is scaled to match the strength of your army at the end of previous mission. You are triumphant to have won a tremendous victory in a mission? You probably won't laugh for long because in the next mission a much stronger enemy is waiting to greet you. 6) The research is boring too. There is no such thing as tech tree in this game. Basically you just click on the research tab whenever the game tells you that there is a new tech available for you to research. And in maybe 30 seconds, the system informs you that the research is completed, and then, you are done. Oh, I almost forget to mention that they didn't even bother to design the icons for the technologies. It's just a text box; you click on the box whenever the system reminds you to do new research.Of course there are some nice features that enable the game to have received an overwhelmingly good review from the players. However, if I were to know those game settings/features as listed above, I would not waste my time or money on this remastered game.			"

												Homeworld. It used to be considered one of best RTS's ever made set in space combat. After it was remastered it still is one of best RTS's ever created. I have never played original games, bought the game during recent steam sale. Money well spent. The game is just amazing. Homeworld 1 Remastered feels like one is playing Battlestar Galactica (2003-2009). On the other hand Homeworld 2 Remastered is more of war story while keeping up mysticism of 1st game.First thing I can tell you now the game is not easy, You need to learn its controls and how it works otherwise you will keep loosing. When you learn ropes of the game its extremely pleasant to play and most importantly enemy will still outnumber you, i.e. in 2nd game the enemy will have 10 battlecruisers while you have a cap allowing you to build 2 bc's. Quite unfair considering their firepower but frigates are perfect cannon fodder for that :PStory of two games is just amazing, both cause you feel rush and despair. Graphics in comparison to original game imporved really well fitting modern standards (including 4k if u can handle it). The soundtrack is purely amazing and is used in appropriate moments to affect us as players when necessary. Adagio for Strings choral by Samuel Barber is actually one of most beautiful songs ever created in our history. Yes, its used in best moments in the Homeworld 1 Remastered! Other soundtrack is also amazing but this very specific song is purest masterpiece of all, Gameplay. It's great. Cant say anything more. Combat is balanced, fights are challanging and its easy to loose if you're not using the thing in ur head at all. This is defiently not casual game where you hop in and immediately become a god in it (like designers of modern games do nowadays with games is just wrong!) Nothing beats sight of full scale fleet vs fleet combat. Bloody yet stunning.Homeworld Remastered Collection is great offer. You get 4 games (2 original + 2 remastered games) and if you are considering to buy it, do not hesitate. You will not regret spending your money on the game (sale or normally). Right now I feel like a thief for buying on summer sale. This game is worth way more than I've paid for it. I feel like I want to keep returning to the game to play it over and over. It is that good, great replayability value and satisfaction from it.To sum things up:+ Nicely improved graphics that fits modern standards+ Masterpiece soundtrack (and im quite hard to impress with music)+ Great Gameplay and replayability value+ Great story that actually makes you feel desperate, in rush+ Want more!+ Not casual...- ... which for some console peasants will be a bad thing.- some bugs - not well explained graphic settings in the video settings			"

												FULL OF BUGS and Original Homeworld 1 Gameplay mechanics removed. WAIT FOR THEM TO FIX IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT !!!Both of these things turn what should be a beautiful remaster into a frustrating game.List of bugs in order of appearance:Level 1 - Game camera Went BLACK permanently after a cutscene. I had to restart the level. (This was like 4 minutes into the game, seriously Gearbox have you never heard of BETA TESTING !!!)- 2nd Resource collector I built dissappeared on level 1 after I sent it to harvest some resources. THERE ARE NO ENEMIES ON THAT LEVEL !!!- When the game asks you to stop a Turnanic Carrier from escaping, I destroyed it promptly and it said MISSION FAILED and the Hyperspace button appeared to complete the mission but I could only use the restart the mission button....- Encounter with Bentusi to trade. Bentusi ship and Mothership have a Star Trek esque standoff right in front of each other. This blocks your Mothership from undocking Capital class vessels from its 'side door', so had the mobile resource unit I just built stuck for about 10 minutes.- Support ships fail to dock with resource collectors resulting in a very bizzare dance of the 2 ships which left both ships blown up on the Radiation field level.- Black Camera AGAIN !!!! when you're on the edge of the Homeworld system to destroy a hyperspace inhibitor. Yet another Mission restart.I haven't even completed the game yet but I believe that this prompt review/WARNING was warranted.This severe lack of bug testing tells me that the game was hurried into release, whereas all other assets point to what should be an amazing remake. The Retextures and new graphics look spectacular and really do look amazing.This game needs some serious patching and even more bug testing.			"

Sometimes pressing space to open big map stops working until you restart the game. I had fun, but the bugs are just annoying. So im going to stop playing until some of these are fixed, especially the map issue.			"

												So far i've gotten to the Great Wastelands...and i don't know if this is worth continuing. Attack group designations lost during hyperspace jumps Autolaunch can't be turned off. If you turn it off the fighters launch after jump anyway. Fighters/Corvettes won't all fit into the mothership (no carriers yet). Attack groups develope ""strays"" that don't move. Ships fall out of formation. Resource collector goes dormant from time to time.  Ships won't target asteroids in the mission after GW. No way to tell how many fighters in a group above 24. I've played the old Homeworld numerous times on much worse computers and never came upon any of these glitches.Sorry, the enhanced graphics aren't worth the agravation. I'll take the old HW anytime.			"

												Experience so far with HW1:R     1. Played tutorial to brush up on game. Computer would proceed to next step without me hitting the proceed button. Fixed that by enabling subtitles. Oddly, received achievement for finishing HW2:R tutorials.     2. Had to restart mission 3 three times as my salvage frigates were on enemy fighter but would not bring it back to mothership. If I would not already own and have played the originals, would never have known this was a mission advancement bug.     3. Destroyed enemy carrier at end of mission 4, game went to mission failed, yet computer was telling me I completed it and the hyperspace button was showing behind the mission failed window. Did entire mission again and it worked.     4. Stopped playing at this point, as I didn't want to waste time playing and hitting another mission advancement bug. Will definately keep going, but knowing that is a possibility is a turn off.     Is it fun? Yes. Does it look good? Yes. Does it(and by that I mean HW1:R) feel like it wasn't fully tested and rushed? Yes.      I bought two copies. One for me and one for my son. We both had same issues on two different computers.      Should you buy? Up to you. I got my codes off Amazon for less than Steam's preorder pricing, after release, and after I read great reviews. Would I buy again? Knowing what I know now, I would wait for it to go on sale. But that's just me. Hopefully they will fix the bugs.     That being said, as I said before, it IS fun, but knowing I might hit an advancement bug ruins some of that enjoyment. Graphic bugs, etc., I can accept, but not something that keeps the game from moving forward.     Edit: Finished mission 5 without a glitch, although it seems much easier than the original. Just basically spammed and sent ships out to the enemy. No real tactics involved other than that.			"

												I didn't play the originals like many reviewers have and have just completed the H1:R campaign, havent even touched the second one yet. I will post a review of HW2:R seperately.I will start off by saying I only leave reviews in cases of extreme, has to be so good or so bad to illicit a review. This game is definitely not the latter. I have played many RTS games through my life and very few were able to tell such a tale as well  as this one has. The journey was enthralling and gripping and has so many interesting events along the way. The combat is great and while the scenery leaves room for improvemnet it is hardly missed when your fleet engages the enemy and capital ships trade blows while fighters and corvettes dance through a three dimensional space. I enjoyed every mission many of which had different obstacles and goals to keep you interested and sometimes force you to use very different approaches, spamming a ton of two units wont get you far like many RTS out there. A must buy for anyone who enjoys RTS or space games, seriously get it.11/10 would make the journey again.			"

												The good:Using a Win 7 gaming rig, the game looks gorgeous, plays exactly as the old games did and I'm having ZERO issues (so far). Exactly what Homeworld should be.The bad:At launch point there seems to be a few complaints in the forums that Win 8 and higher machines are having issues of various types and certain bits of high end hardware are causing issues. I'm sure these problems will be patched asap but it is noteworthy if you are using newer PCs. In short, maybe hold off a little till it's patched.Personally I could not be happier with the game. Gearbox delivered and hopefully they rebuild Homeworld into the game series it deserved to be, It's certainly gives me hope that more classic games will be picked up and remastered for the modern gamer (such as xwing + tie fighter titles).

												I've been a huge RTS fan for the longest time, since I was but a mere child. I played Empire Earth, Age of Empires, Sins of a Solar Empire, the original Starcraft and, last but not least, Homeworld 1 & 2 and Cataclysm. I adore these types of games. I live, breathe these types of games, but recently there has been such a drought of RTS games, except the phenomenal Grey Goo. But here, here we have it; the pinnicale of the past; one of the greatest games remastered and available on a digital platform. I can only exclaim, YES.Now, that my rant is over. I wanna name a few of my favorite aspects of Homeworld. Firstly, the music is to die for. It's glorious, epic, space ambient music with new age singing overlapping. As a huge fan of music, but mostly of metal, I can say this OST rivals many classics. The visuals are another strong point, there's something to be said about a game that can make spaceships docking into a hull fun to look at and experience, and the awesome ""focus"" feature which allows you to zoom in to see battles close up. The style/aesthetic is another fantastic point, sci-fi RTS games are rare but this one is easily one of the best. Most of all, though, I love the story. The story is a breathtaking space opera of epic proportions, it offers questions and makes an imagination run wild, it makes you sad and unkempt, but picks you right back up more hopeful than ever. It's a rollercoaster.This version isn't complete yet, though, since bugs are rather rampant. I hope Gearbox takes heed and fixes 'em but be warned, this game still has some problems/glitches. I will omit this paragraph as soon as these are fixed.That said, BRB, gonna relive my childhood.			"

The game looks beautiful, it runs great on low-end systems too, lower than the minimum specified specs.They are rewritting the multiplayer code as BETA goes, which means it will be less and less laggy, it's already much better compared to originals.  There is workshop support.You also have the original versions included working on modern O/S if you are truly nostalgic.

												I bought this when it was in the Autumn sale, hoping for a better, more up-to-date experience than the original. Both the remastered and original versions are included. The graphics are indeed very good but then it goes downhill... The audio (music) is very similar but some of the voices have been altered - I prefer the originals. On my original PC this pushed the limits performance-wise so I was pleased when I could now push everything up to 11 - and it all worked well (only occasional crashes). But what has utterly ruined it is the interface. It's clunky, some of the key combinations dont work when they are supposed to, the key bindings have changed from the original game - and some of them cant be re-assigned. Coupled with the lack of *Military (the default) ship formation for setting up squadrons, this makes it sooo hard to play and keep track of everything. I gave up after a couple of hours and got my money back (thanks to the Steam refund policy).I'f you've never played Homeworld you may like it and you would accept it as it is, not knowing any better. Unfortunately if you remember the original as fondly as I do then you are likely to be dissapointed.*You can get the Military formation by docking then re-launching all your ships immediately - but its a faff.

												Really fun Blanced Game. The game as it stands currently looks great, easy to learn and just all around fun to play with your friends or to changllege yourself. But some of the con's are once one side or the other really gets a supeiror fleet up it ends up being a snowball effect unless you are good with hitting them where they don't expect it or if you have a friend to back you up. Also the game really acts like a rock, paper, sissors game with the fact that each ship class is good against other ship classes. But don't let that get you down about the game, it is still a load of fun to play and the more people we get the more people we will have to mod the living H out of it to make the game even better. I hope this review was helpful and if not please let me know why not so I can improve my reviews.Please note I like to write reviews that are short and straight to the point.			"

												Seeing how this game's price has completely crashed during the Autumn sale, I figured I would add in my own two cents.My dad introduced me to the original Homeworld when I was about 7 years old. That was about 13 years ago, and even after playing every single spaceship-related game I could get my hands on, I never found anything which went into quite as much depth with story, lore and gameplay as Homeworld. Now believe me I was just as hyped as the next person when Homeworld: Remastered was announced - in fact my dad would tell you I nearly brought the ceiling down with my enthusiasm, especially when I discovered that it was Gearbox, well-known for producing the Borderlands series (which I am also a HUGE fan of) was in charge of spearheading the project and bringing it to us. When it came out I didn't really see much of the shtick it got for myself, but after taking more time to play it since I have unearthed its little issues that the original game lacks. The good thing about this though is that you get the original games bundled with the remastered versions, so if the Remastered versions' issues become a bit much for you, you can easily revert to them to take a break. Now I'll give a breakdown of my own personal pros and cons, make of them what you will!PROS - - The game is, of course, remastered - graphically speaking, the game is stunning - the lighting is perfection, the backgrounds of matches are perfect, and the various ships look beautiful with their new models - the frigates even have moving turrets, which I think was lacking in the original game. There is not a single flaw in the graphical side of the remastering, at least in my opinion.- The campaigns for both games have remained pretty much untouched - but a new GUI allows for easier interaction with the game world and better control over what comes into your mothership and what leaves it. - The ship upgrade system located under the research section allows players to upgrade the stats of their various ships, including damage, defense, health and occasionally speed. They can also be used to teach some ships new abilities. In the campaign mode you are limited to when you get these upgrades however as many of them tie into the story in various ways.- The addition of mod support, although often shaky at times, does allow for the addition of custom races, ship logos, maps and I think even gameplay modes. Some of these mods can even be used in online play, which I think is fantastic. - While the original Homeworld soundtrack has been left untouched and rightly so, the Homeworld 2 soundtrack recieved a remastering which has drastically improved the sound of its music, which was in the original game something of a partial failure (Some of the songs sounded shoddy or rushed for example but these issues have been fixed in the remastered soundtrack).- The lore is extensive and beautiful for this game, but many people are often unaware of this without having access to the original Homeworld manual, which was a hand-me-down from my dad which I still read regularly. The details contained within the manual are available on the Homeworld wikia for those who are curious about learning the extensive background of this universe, as much of it isn't actually mentioned in-game or at least not in a way that some people would really understand or remember. CONS - - The original game didn't have any bugs or glitches that I can remember. This one has a great deal of them, however - simple things like unresponsive ships, the occasional crash and other silly things you could perhaps expect from a game, but still annoying due to how flawless the original felt. - Mods often deselect themselves and don't load after being used in-game for only one match. Sometimes mods don't work at all or crash the game, which is appearntly a very common occurrence.- The patches do help but often don't fix the really important issues, such as common issues with multiplayer and mods.- Some gameplay aspects that people really enjoyed were for some reason removed, such as the ability to Salvage (why they even bothered leaving the poor little Salvage Corvette in the game is beyond me, considering that in the main storyline of Homeworld 1 they are practically useless after the 3rd chapter now and just sit there collecting dust until destroyed by enemies) and also the need to refuel ships. While I actually think of this as a good thing, there have been complaints about it and I can imagine that for some people it must have taken some of the survivability element away from them. - Although I have no solid proof at this time, I've heard that there are serious issues with multiplayer on occasion. Multiplayer also allows you to play as any of the races from the two games, which in some cases could be a little unfair as the races from Homeworld 2 have packs of Interceptors rather than one Interceptor per construction (just an example, I know there are others too), as well as having better ships overall. Overall I'd say this game is worth its sale price, but maybe is only worth its true retail price to the hardcore fans who will appreciate it and can ignore its flaws indefinitely. Also another tip: If you are one of the owners of the original CD of the game which came with the soundtrack on CD, you don't need to buy the Homeworld 1 Remastered Soundtrack. It's literally the same music. If your CD is still around or in good condition, use that instead and save your money :P However the Homeworld 2 Remastered Soundtrack is different from the original as stated above and is very much worth the money in my opinion.

												This was one of the first RTS that featured a 3D feel to the battlefield, you could get your units not only to move on all sides,but to get to the bottom or higher,which does give you great tactical options for conquering and suprising your enemy! I wished for Win7 support for a long time,since i wanted to play with my friends and now i can finally do so without any hassle !!!! ITS EPIC AS BEFORE !!!!! but with new and better graphics ! Also full Win7 support hassle free!!!!! LOVE IT !! this was one of the best RTS ever made,thanks to the remastered version it still will be for a long long time...in a galaxy not so far away ;]			"

												I'm only a few hours in, but wow. I never played the originals, despite being 31 years old and owning an extensive collection of games in all genres. Somehow, this series completely passed me by. After two solid hours of playing the remastered version of the first game, I am in love. The UI and controls are intuitive and smart, and the game systems are rock solid. To anyone in my situation contemplating whether or not this is worth the money, I'd say go for it. What truly makes this stand out to me is that it feels like a space opera. The story has grabbed me right from the get-go, and the immersion is like nothing I've ever experienced before. What really does it, in my view, is that with each new mission/objective, you keep your fleet and resources throughout the campaign. I don't know of another RTS game which does this anywhere near as well. The game feels like a journey home, and reminds me of the (later) 2006 series, Battlestar Galactica. It's fantastically written, the soundtrack is incredible and the world feels gigantic.Probably the best <£30 game I have bought in years. Very, very highly recommended.			"

												Homeworld is a very niche game. If you like space battles and want to see the absolute best there is on offer from any game to be frank, you'd want this game. The actual game itself here is a bit of a rough diamond. The gameplay involves a spherical map where you can move your ships in basically any direction up or down as well as in the horizontal plane, which in theory would open up tactics and such. In practice, its mostly a minor annoyance, for all it is technically impressive. It is tactically useless, for the most part. You could the vast scope of the map, particularly its height to hide, but hiding is never practical to be honest - unless you're gimping yourself against the AI and carefully setting it up,  you're not making a battlestar galactica style comeback if you get smashed early on. The gameplay boils down to who has the best fleet and the best target acquisition.  You select everything, and send it into the fray all at the same time and then click the enemy to death. The aesthetics are really down to your taste but personally I hate the design of the HW2 ships pretty much across the board while the Kushan in HW1 are in the same boat as looking awful (fighters look like flying ice cream tubs)  the Taidann look far more convincing and the only ships I really enjoy looking at. The NPC races in the campaign look pretty atmospheric and fitting as well. The HW1 campaign is in the vein of traditional RTS games, where there are some missions with some absurd challenge that you need to try multiple times, which is a double edged sword but I think generally it works. It makes the game more interesting and about learning rather than turtling and then sending the biggest possible fleet at something. If you want the best experience, I'd never reload a save, (but you will spend hours waiting for resources to collect or fleets to build) and the reason for this is that with the gimmicky missions there's generally a key lesson that you'll learn or figure out on the first go, so the second attempt is really easy. In one mission, you'll find your small craft will almost always get wiped out due to overwhelming firepower. The solution is to just dock them in your carrier/mothership. Units carry over between missions. In the original game, this meant that if you spent hours waiting to collect all resources before moving on, you'd have a significant advantage in the next mission. In remastered, you get all resources all over the map at the start of the next mission. There's a clear reason why Gearbox has made this change but it makes the last few levels♥♥♥♥♥♥easy.The last 2-3 missions stop being unique like this and essentially become move and attack fests where you move your death fleet across the map and slowly destroy everything. The enemy fleets don't scale well to your own superfleet that is carried between missions and just about the most challenging large fleet action is in one later mission  where you effectively have to leave a small force of  capital ships behind to defend your mothership from flankers while you win the mission.HW2's campaign is better designed such that a few of these problems are less significant or non-existent. The difficulty is more consistent throughout unlike in the first game where the difficulty is far worse at the beginning of the campaign. The story elements in both games aren't anything overwhelmingly special but are pretty decent and get the job done. In terms of the remastered elements, Gearbox didn't totally screw it up, but they did do a pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job. If, like me, you have a fairly new AMD card with the latest drivers, you can't play either of the classic games as they will instantly CTD on launch. This issue has been around for several months and hasn't been fixed, and likely won't ever be fixed.  One graphical issue I've seen involves ships becoming completely see-through. This has been around since release and hasn't been fixed definitively, though there is a solution - its as overwhelming basic as changing the properties on the HW shortcut, so its pretty pathetic that its still around. In terms of campaign bugs, some missions or objectives fail to complete and particularly the infamous asteroid mission has artificial difficulty stemming from the stupidity of the pathfinding AI literally flying into rocks, and the long pause between being able to target split up asteroids. One of the main reasons you may want to get it is because of the brilliant mods made for classic that are being ported to remastered (though extremely slowly - none of the major ones have yet made the transition) that literally serve to make Homeworld a platform for simulating any space warfare universe imaginable. There's Freespace 2, Halo, BSG, Star Wars, Star Trek, even Wing Commander amongst other things. I'd say the game is still worth getting on sale, even despite all these faults. There is a net gain in enjoyment from playing this game, though be warned if you have an AMD card.  I'd give the game about a 7/10 on a scale where 5 is *the* average game, and not an ""average game"".  "

Its one of the few games that I won't mind going back in to spend a few extra hours in every now and then. I also won't mind replaying the single player campaigns again and again. p/s: If you haven't purchased this game and planning to purchase this, then you should get the prequel homeworld: deserts of kharak (out in jan 2016) and get homeworld:remastered free as a preorder bonus.

												This game is absolutely amazing. If this had released in 2015 for the first time and not as a remaster you wouldnt ever know. The graphics are amazing, better than sins for sure. Watching turrets independently target different enemies is an epic sight. As for strategy, there is a lot more flexibility than traditional ground based RTS's. For instance in a multiplayer battle I played today, I immediately constructed a mobile refinery, and placed it where my mothership was. Then I proceeded to fly my mother ship straight up way out of sight, and then flew it over my enemies base and built up a massive fleet above them. They wiped out my resource collecting spot but I had already pumped out several Heavy Cruisers and had plenty of RU's to spare. Thinking I was done they fought my teammates. I then sent about 100 fighters,25 corvettes, 2HC's, some destroyers, and my frigates away from my mother ship and then descended on them in order to hide the true position of my ship. I completely wiped out one of the players, but by this time I was the last alive on my team and they searched endlessly for my position. Well...turns out one of my resource collectors survived and decided to return to base from across the map and through enemy territory but I didnt notice it. It was at this time, thinking I was safely hidden, I went to get a drink. I came back to see the resource collector being followed by an enemy fighter squadron right to my mothership. Shortly thereafter 3 enemy battlecruisers hyperspaced in, right next to it and quickly ended my existence in a glorious flash of light...But it was awesome. Buy this game!			"

												I also helped make this and would recommend this game. I remember seeing this game on the shelf back when I was younger and at the time thought there was math or something was involved because of the full three axis it used(I was like 12 and didn't understand).  Never thought I would grow up and actually end up recreating art for  the remastered version. I grew to love the game very quickly, as I learned the basics of how to grow a fleet and what units fight best against another units. The battles are memorizing to watch. Its actually like watching an epic space battle from a movie, but you have control. I suggest to invest a little time, so that much more enjoyable time in the long run will be made. Was an honor and privilege to work on this RTS that inspired many games later on.			"

												When I was a tiny child, all I could do was just play the original Homeworld, and I played it every day for hours on end. I finished the campaign maybe only twice, though. On account that I wasn't very good at strategy at the time. When I found out that they made a second game, I also quickly got that one, and played it just as much, although I was never able to finish it at the time. In time, I moved onto other games, and I have long since lost the disks for both of these games.Every once in a while, I would check up on the status of the IP for the Homeworld series and would always be disappointed when I saw that it was tossed between companies, never to have a third game in the series. However, once I found out that it ended up with Gearbox and that they were going to be doing a remaster, I was ecstatic. At the time, many people were upset with the fact that Gearbox, who don't have a very good reputation with games, ended up with the franchise. I found no reason to doubt how good it would be, though. They would have actually TRIED to ruin a legitimate remaster in order to make it bad.Once the game came out, I quickly pre-ordered, and discovered that it lived up to expectations. Some parts were lacking, including tactics and some balance issues with multiplayer (to be expected. it's still a beta!) but besides that, the rich story was all the same. It still holds the special place in my heart as my favorite game series ever, and I'm excited to see where Gearbox goes with this next (I'm so excited for Sands of Kharak.)tl;dr: This game is very good.

Totally a train wreck of a game now.  The game 'dynamically' creates an enemy that will just curb stomp you no matter how well you build up.  The more you build up, the worse the enemy force will attack you.  Players have few choices now on how to approach the enemy.  This current game (single player campaign) is horrible.  Only one tactic can be used, you have to 'steal' as many of the higher end ships in order to win the objective.  Rubbish game now and stupid design since you can not adjust the difficulty even if you just want to 'learn' this, now lame, game.What a shame, the story is what made this game great.  If you prevent new players from experience it, you might as well close the store.Avoid this game like the palague...			"

Totally a train wreck of a game now.  The game 'dynamically' creates an enemy that will just curb stomp you no matter how well you build up.  The more you build up, the worse the enemy force will attack you.  Players have few choices now on how to approach the enemy.  This current game (single player campaign) is horrible.  Only one tactic can be used, you have to 'steal' as many of the higher end ships in order to win the objective.  Rubbish game now and stupid design since you can not adjust the difficulty even if you just want to 'learn' this, now lame, game.What a shame, the story is what made this game great.  If you prevent new players from experience it, you might as well close the store.Avoid this game like the palague...			"

												Itt's good for what it is. Fairly bug ""free"" and very well optimized. BUT the remastered first game, Homworld, is pretty un true to it's roots. It's the liittle thing that totally change the wayy it plays and thus the overall experience. Formations are UTTERLY useless, fighters degrade into a cluster ♥♥♥♥ sworm of bees instead of attacking in formation. There are no longer any ""stances"" which determine how ships fight while IN a fight. They only inform what they do while not fighting. Which is totally useless. I'd say buy it if it's on sale. You can find plenty of information on how many things have changed in the porting of the first Homeworld into the Homeworld 2 engine, which was regarded by most fans as inferior. While I appreciate the revival of the series and did have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun with the game these little things still irk me. Let alone the 2 original games that come with the title STILL do not work for me. Won't even launch.EDIT: It's clear what I was saying about HW 1 being totally different from original in terms of how ships operate. As devs spent nearly a year patching in the best fix possible. I thank the devs for their dedication to trying to get it right. Muchh appreciated and I will now purchase any and all games from them that I'm interested in. Game works MUCH better now too. Strike craft will actually form up sphherical formations around enemies now. Instead of doing straffing runs. And around friendly ships. The original games also launch now.			"

I also won't mind replaying the single player campaigns again and again. p/s: If you haven't purchased this game and planning to purchase this, then you should get the prequel homeworld: deserts of kharak (out in jan 2016) and get homeworld:remastered free as a preorder bonus.

												I never played the originals (back then) but i heard so much about them, tried to play the 1999 version and i simply couldnt, when i heard they were making a remake i followed the news until release when i patiently waited for a good discount before jumping in, my experiences are as follows:Homeworld 1 RemasteredThe gamePlay the tutorial, dont jump in recklessly. 3D movement is iffy, formations are useless-ish. The game looks beautiful and the intro missions really encourage you to continue on your quest. The balance of this game is off, leaning towards a mass of ion cannon frigates, destroyers and heavy cruisers. Hard counters are not hard enough, specially when facing a mass of fighters in one of the missions or several ion cannon frigates in another mission. It boils down to ""can i outgun you before you destroy me?"" with ion cannon frigates. The automatic balance worked very strangely during my run, giving me two very easy final missions. The AI can be wonky ni your favor or against you, some units may stay put, some will follow a single probe to infinity and beyond or sometime you may be relentlessly attacked, also movement in this game and the next takes time and theres no time compression. All in all if you played old time RTS like command and conquer (the first one) you should be fine with the interface and controls.Story and soundThe story has a good start a sluggish middle chapter and a fantastic resolution even thou the final battle itself is not that epic, i was enthralled at the start almost quit playing at mission 10 when a game breaking bug ocurred but pushed on to Mission 11 where stuff happens and it was one wild ride to the end. The voice acting is monotonous as it was on the first original game, i feel some of the ""feels"" were lost when no emotions are shown by the different voice actors with the exception of the mothership which is a ""machine"". Finally the soundtrack that really grabbed me in the entire game was the Homeworld version of Adagio for Strings that really enhances the scenes it is played on.Conclusion for Homeworld 1 RemasteredBear with the mechanics, enjoy the story, bask in the glow of ion cannons! Also someone needs to slow down those support frigates....Homeworld 2 RemasteredThe gameIf you played the first then the second uses the exact same mechanics but balances out some of the problems of the first game, small crafts comes in squadrons and fighters and bombers remain viable to the end game (mostly fighters). Ion cannon frigates are now for the most past useless-ish unless you can hide them properly behind destroyers and battleships. Formations are still broken, you need to macro manage your ship classes to prevent your corvettes or frigates form making contact with the enemy before your bigger ships which would result in the complete anhilation of your smaller craft. 3D movement is still wonky and the AI can be..how can i put this?...dense, for example in one of the missions you are tasked with destroying a ship, in the map theres another ship reinforcing or producing more units but these units stayed put until i destroyed the objetive and won the mission, so i felt no pressue. I did enjoy the tactical aspect more as i had to carefully position my ships to pull and counter the attacks during several missions. Small cradt counters work better now and capital ships can take move hits unlike Homeworld 1 were a few ion cannon frigates would melt a heavy cruiser or destroyer in seconds. In the end the balanced reamained in the capital ships and fighters craft to defend them.Story and soundThe story is much better told and presented, the soundtrack introduced songs with different rhythms like the one during the ""boss"" fights. The voice acting remains monotonous but the cast is more diverse this time around, still some of the ""feels"" are lost due to the voices.Conclusion for Homeworld 2 RemasteredBear with the interface (again), enjoy the story, enjoy the music, enjoy using tactics to engage some enemies.

												I have only played a few skirmish matches so take this with a grain of salt, especially with the numerous bugs that are apparently still in the game. Gearbox have a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥track record in my book so I was sceptical.Well the game looks and feels great and is an absolute nostalgic blast. Once you hear the Ion beams and the delightfully nonchalant battle chatter (a welcome distraction from the try-too-hard cliché military gruff stuff we are used to nowadays) you feel right at home. Controls still hold up, though I would've wished a middle mouse button camera panning. It's a nice throwback to when RTS wasn't about unit spam or superhuman micro capabilities.The visuals are neat. Seing HW1 in this fidelity is a treat, HW2 also looks nicer but the leap isn't that big comparatively. Ship damage is still just pre-rendered 2d sprites but even those got increased resolutions. FOV is also cool but really gimmicky. Overall performance is decent, could be better though seeing as this isn't exactly cream of the crop visually despite all enhancements. This is still a 15 year old engine at its heart.Negatives are that the AI wasn't improved and is still kind of dumb. They'll get stomped even if they keep up with your economy. Also the UI scaling doesn't affect the ever obnoxiously large sidebar.Overall a recommended buy, for the ability to play this on current systems alone.			"

												Level 8 of Homeworld 1 remastered is COMPLETELY BROKEN. There are no objectives, the AI just sits there and waits for you to kill it. It's a waste of time.In the level where you try to fight off incoming asteroids, sending small ships results in them RAMMING INTO THE DAMN ASTEROID because they didn't bother to teach the AI to move AROUND asteroids, rather than straight into them. This means that you will probably be replaying the previous mission.Having read around, it seems that HW1:R is nothing like the original in terms of tactics and main features. Apparently projectiles were drive by physics rather than RNG calculations. Spacecraft stayed in formation when the battle began (they don't now) and the game generally had more depth.There are other problems:The sound regularly glitches out.On my 2-monitor setup, the game does not bound the cursor to the screen. (it is bound initially, but after alt-tab it stops)Overall, it seems that they released this prematurely.  I'd get it when it's on a sale.			"

												I don't usually bother reviewing  games on steam but this one ugh the graphics are very good but the control system is completely ♥♥♥♥♥ed there is a bug in the outskirts of kharak if you send in a salvage collector before fleet command tells you then the mission doesn't complete and you have to do it all over again and in the diamond shoals your ships just fly straight into the asteroids and what happened to evasive maneuvers?  The rain of death from sphere and claw formation has gone and the ships don't seem to stay in formation properly either and sometimes if you change the formation of one group the other groups change formation as well.. weird.  All sorts of details just annoy. So totally annoyed but I should have listened to my own advice - don't buy rehashed franchises of games that have been played down to the wire if they do this to cataclysm that is what it will be.  ♥♥♥♥♥ with my keys man!

What I liked:  3D space RTS ( no other game does this well or at all)  Captures the theme of space to a nice degree ( think 2001 space odyssey if it was a game)  The balance of the game ( advanced rock paper scissors style)  The soundtrack has some great relaxing tribal instrumental music  Your fleet carries from beginning to end(no other game does this, why haven't they it's so cool)What You Need to Know:  Played this when I was a kid( but this review is not biased because of nostalgia)  Game is very slow paced and story isn't strong at all ( big maps don't help this either)  No branching tech tree, just simple upgrades to new tech  Flanking is real in this game, 3D flanking bro  This game is so easy to understand, and isn't like a 4X stratergy game  All units have counters, it's not asymmetricMy Score:A+Paid: $14 HW 1 completed in:  11 hoursHW 2 completed in:  8 hoursGames similar:   Supreme Commander   Star Wars Empire at War Shallow Space Improvements and Changes in the sequel  Game speed is way faster as units move faster  Squadrons are now used for anything smaller than a frigate ( makes game easier to manage, and more epic)  You use boarding ships to capture and some units gain abilities that gets rid of some ships  You get a villian now, but the mission designs to me are just kill everything on map, ( less unknown suprises )  Research and upgrading is improved with small upgrades every ship, instead of just tech upgrades to unlock new shipsI know the first game is very slow, if you don't like it. Just skip it and go to the second one. You don't want to miss the best space RTS do you			"

The UI is on the smaller size for higher res monitor but if you play enough. You'll know. Don't run this game with MSI Afterburner or you will get weird graphic glitches.And yes, it work with 3440x1440 and crossfire.

												Well what can I say about this that hasn't already been said but really it is something that is out of the world. For I remember playing the Classic Homeworld when it first came out and seeing it redone was just plain awesome. The new graphics and such are great. Seeing the old Mothership 01 redone was great. Seeing the old Classic ships redone was great. While I have yet to finish the Campaigns of either of the games I do admit I am looking forword to playing them in the near future for it shall be a treat. That said, there are some issues that I have with the game:No Time Compression therefore those long after mission resource gathering bits are quite boring. I actually liked the old Classic Manager Screens but that is not really a large issue and I can get use to it in time I am just a fan of the old screens. Scuttle can be used with one click of the hotkey or the UI Button on screen. I have lost a couple ships this way by missclicking which included the Mothership which was quite a shock for I was in the middle of a battle and suddenly I scuttled the Mothership. I want the old double-click scuttle back so this doesn't happen. The Campaign After-Mission Hyperspace UI Button is in the freaking middle of the screen. I would like to have it somewhere else in the UI so I can do final after-mission stuff like finishing harvesting and construction or researh before I head on to the next mission. No Raider Attack Mission, which if I rememeber right was supposed to be included with the Remastered Campaign but apparently I don't see it.  Anyhow, this game is great coming back from the grave and I shall see about going on to finish the Campaigns in the day ahead. Thanks gearbox for bringing back these great games. Now get to work on Homeworld 3 or the Shipbreakers game.EDIT:Alright I am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I just realized a couple things while playing the game which really made me get a bit upset. First of all in HW1 Remastered you cannot fully capture ships. You can grab them with your Salvage Corvettes and take them back to the Mothership. HOWEVER, they do not come back out under your control. Instead it looks like you get RUs in exchange. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! The one major fun part of the original HW1 game was going out and capturing enemy ships before using them against your enemies. Now you changed it! What...the...Heck! Gah! If that isn't enough the damn Formations are wacked up. I tried to put my Fighters and Corvettes into a Sphere Formation to Guard a Salvage Corvette in Mission Two like I normally do when I am playing the original game. However the escortings craft don't even do a sphere around the darn Corvette like they are supposed too! I almost lost my Salvage Corvette because the damn escorts were too busy dogfighting enemy craft then protecting my poor Salvage Corvette. Then there is the Repair Corvette which in the original game you could have it guarding a couple ships where it can heal its charges in the thick of battle. However this can only be used on one ship. What in the world is going on here! Gah!! Thanks alot Gearbox!!			"

All in all if you played old time RTS like command and conquer (the first one) you should be fine with the interface and controls.Story and soundThe story has a good start a sluggish middle chapter and a fantastic resolution even thou the final battle itself is not that epic, i was enthralled at the start almost quit playing at mission 10 when a game breaking bug ocurred but pushed on to Mission 11 where stuff happens and it was one wild ride to the end. The voice acting is monotonous as it was on the first original game, i feel some of the ""feels"" were lost when no emotions are shown by the different voice actors with the exception of the mothership which is a ""machine"". Finally the soundtrack that really grabbed me in the entire game was the Homeworld version of Adagio for Strings that really enhances the scenes it is played on.Conclusion for Homeworld 1 RemasteredBear with the mechanics, enjoy the story, bask in the glow of ion cannons! Also someone needs to slow down those support frigates....Homeworld 2 RemasteredThe gameIf you played the first then the second uses the exact same mechanics but balances out some of the problems of the first game, small crafts comes in squadrons and fighters and bombers remain viable to the end game (mostly fighters). Ion cannon frigates are now for the most past useless-ish unless you can hide them properly behind destroyers and battleships. Formations are still broken, you need to macro manage your ship classes to prevent your corvettes or frigates form making contact with the enemy before your bigger ships which would result in the complete anhilation of your smaller craft. 3D movement is still wonky and the AI can be..how can i put this?...dense, for example in one of the missions you are tasked with destroying a ship, in the map theres another ship reinforcing or producing more units but these units stayed put until i destroyed the objetive and won the mission, so i felt no pressue. I did enjoy the tactical aspect more as i had to carefully position my ships to pull and counter the attacks during several missions. Small cradt counters work better now and capital ships can take move hits unlike Homeworld 1 were a few ion cannon frigates would melt a heavy cruiser or destroyer in seconds. In the end the balanced reamained in the capital ships and fighters craft to defend them.Story and soundThe story is much better told and presented, the soundtrack introduced songs with different rhythms like the one during the ""boss"" fights. The voice acting remains monotonous but the cast is more diverse this time around, still some of the ""feels"" are lost due to the voices.Conclusion for Homeworld 2 RemasteredBear with the interface (again), enjoy the story, enjoy the music, enjoy using tactics to engage some enemies.

												I don't usually bother reviewing  games on steam but this one ugh the graphics are very good but the control system is completely ♥♥♥♥♥ed there is a bug in the outskirts of kharak if you send in a salvage collector before fleet command tells you then the mission doesn't complete and you have to do it all over again and in the diamond shoals your ships just fly straight into the asteroids and what happened to evasive maneuvers?  The rain of death from sphere and claw formation has gone and the ships don't seem to stay in formation properly either and sometimes if you change the formation of one group the other groups change formation as well.. weird.  All sorts of details just annoy. So totally annoyed but I should have listened to my own advice - don't buy rehashed franchises of games that have been played down to the wire if they do this to cataclysm that is what it will be.  ♥♥♥♥♥ with my keys man!

What I liked:  3D space RTS ( no other game does this well or at all)  Captures the theme of space to a nice degree ( think 2001 space odyssey if it was a game)  The balance of the game ( advanced rock paper scissors style)  The soundtrack has some great relaxing tribal instrumental music  Your fleet carries from beginning to end(no other game does this, why haven't they it's so cool)What You Need to Know:  Played this when I was a kid( but this review is not biased because of nostalgia)  Game is very slow paced and story isn't strong at all ( big maps don't help this either)  No branching tech tree, just simple upgrades to new tech  Flanking is real in this game, 3D flanking bro  This game is so easy to understand, and isn't like a 4X stratergy game  All units have counters, it's not asymmetricMy Score:A+Paid: $14 HW 1 completed in:  11 hoursHW 2 completed in:  8 hoursGames similar:   Supreme Commander   Star Wars Empire at War Shallow Space Improvements and Changes in the sequel  Game speed is way faster as units move faster  Squadrons are now used for anything smaller than a frigate ( makes game easier to manage, and more epic)  You use boarding ships to capture and some units gain abilities that gets rid of some ships  You get a villian now, but the mission designs to me are just kill everything on map, ( less unknown suprises )  Research and upgrading is improved with small upgrades every ship, instead of just tech upgrades to unlock new shipsI know the first game is very slow, if you don't like it. Just skip it and go to the second one. You don't want to miss the best space RTS do you			"

												Homeworld.This is a game I enjoyed a lot playing the game for the first time, the brilliance of the attack plan which included jumping straight into the enemy (a friend who has never let me forget this) every single ship I owned. This was immediately followed by ""wait. Mayber that wasn't such a good idea"" then ""OOOPS"" as I watched the Mothership blow to pieces.This was my first experience at Homeworld Two, which despite my poor tactical skills at the time ended up setting me on a road of playing that game to the point of obsession. Until windows 7 and the game became incompatible with my computer and with a developer which no longer existed, pretty muched ended it there.So what does Homeworld Remastered Edition offer apart from a game that actually runs on a computer that isn't running windows XP? Better graphics for one and a crisper UI. As well as the oportunity to play multi-player over steam. In terms of selling the game, very little will make a difference if you haven't play Homeworld before. But if you haven't played it before, a ""meh"" before moving on isn't doing it justice.Would it have been possible for me to write this review without mentioning my experience playing it: No, it has simply shaped to much of my playing style in other games that to not mention this would be wrong.

												If you like tactics-based space RTS then you've come to the right game.While, for example, Sins Of A Solar Empire is rather static in its design, Homeworld is quite dynamic, with hits and misses of projectiles and lasers (weapons in general), and depth as to what to hit on a specific ship (engines, docks, etc).You notice Relic had its hands on this game; bear Company Of Heroes in mind.Recommended!

												I just spent the last six hours ( thought it was three ) playing this game.I say, they have recreated this game in probably the best way I think could ever be done.I played a lot of Homeworld, and none of it online.  I spent a lot of time in the campaign, and in botmatches.  I even tried playing with the modding for a bit.  It was amazing.And now we have this.Coming from only having played Homeworld Remastered, not 2, or the Classics, or the multiplayer, I can say it is... exactly how it was.It even played performance-wise the same way!  I have a 550 Ti, and this this thing managed to pull a reliable 30 fps through 80% of the game, but there was a bit of dip in combat, so it was just like old times on my crappy Celeron PC back in the ages.Now, the remastered version uses the Homeworld 2 engine, so if you only ever played Homeworld 1, you might be a little bit confused.  I think the changes to the engine are a nice touch.  I spent quite a lot of time admiring that all the ships look exactly the same, but just... better.  The small details are REALLY nice, and I haven't even begun to touch them yet.  I have to work tomorrow. ...maybe...For instance, when the Turanic Raiders are encountered, focus on one of corvettes' missiles. You'll see.Anyway, there's any number of tangents I can go on, but basically, this game lives up to the hype machine that was created for it.  I only got to mission 5, and I already don't reget buying this as a pre-order.  I wouldn't regret buying it again for a different computer at full price.  If you loved either Homeworld game, but especially both of them, buy this.It will not be a game you regret buying. I look forward to fragging some of you in multiplayer.  :)Cons:  Still no Cataclysm.			"

												Homeworld remastered is exactly that, the original homeworld with slightly improved wrapping. While this is generally a good thing and if you liked the originals (like I did, a lot) then buying this makes sense. You will get the same game with updated visuals and sounds.However there are some negatives, most of them are just missed opportunities, but they still count as negatives:- Models are extremely low poly for a 2015 game- objects (mostly ships) could be much more detailed - Textures look low res as well- effects look 5-6 year old at least (like engine glow as such)- voices are a bit more bland then the original, they seem more like script read than a person saying them.In general it is an improvement on the original for sure, but the original was revolutionary for its time, this is passable at best for 2015			"

												Even after 16 years Homeworld remains the king of the RTS genre. Tactically complex, beautifully imagined, and now lovingly restored for modern systems, it has lost none of its charm or fire. The new textures, sounds, and effects are stunning and the gameplay holds up as if it was new this year. If you're a fan of games like Starcraft, Dawn of War, or Supreme Commander you owe it to yourself to play Homeworld. If you're a fan of Homeworld than the only reason you should be reading this is because you're waiting for the download to finish.			"

												It is HOMEWORLD! it feels and keeps it's act together, i have been reinstaling for 3 occasions homeworld to remember how good the game was, and now that it has been remastered i can say it's Gorgeuse! the level in detail and the space backgrounds are just amazing! my only complaint for the first Homeworld is the UI, i never liked the HW2 UI, and it would have been great to see the original UI overhauled rather than Replaced with the HW2 UI, and the weird thing is that the formations are not being kept.

												Homewolrd was on of those games where you either loved it or hated it. From my personal experience with the game, I really love it, had to really drag myself away from it at 2am this morning to et some rest for work later today.The game being re-mastered has managed to keep is atmosphere and environment, the story really pulls you in. Multitasking and designating your squads to defend carriers as well sending other squads to deal with the enemy carriers while you continuously harvest more resources and research. There is so much going on.The ui is slightly different, personally I liked the old UI but this new UI all it takes is getting used to.The PVP part of the game is where I think it will really make or break the game for the future. Personally I like the hyperdrive element brings in so many strategies like a decoy attack to the front of an enemy base while your team mate hyperdrives behind the enemy base and nukes.This game is awesome, if your in to RTS even as a solo player I would defo recommended it, the skirmishes against the CPU can be quite fun as well if you don’t like PVP.

The save name cannot contain certain characters... that are part of the default save file name! Wow.Other exemple, the display goes FUBAR on triple monitor 5700/1080.So, yeah, I recommend this classic and it looks and feels gorgeous.But given all the bugs, i'd say its worth 20 bucks at best.

This is a remastering that actually adds considerable quality to the game.Add to that that the game's single player, originally, was fantastic, and that all the best parts of Homeworld 1 and 2 have remained since then, then this is an auto-buy if you ever played or liked the originals.It's not here, but I wish Homeworld: Cataclysm was in this collection- and that is my only regret- though I still purchased it knowing that.

												As someone who has never played any of the original Homeworld games, I can't comment on the changes made and if they are bad or good. That said, this game is amazing! Stunning models and graphics, great story and cut-scenes, and easy to learn controls are just the tip of the iceberg.  The skirmish mode lets you play with huge fleets in large scale wars which is a blast. The great mods being uploaded to the Steam Workshop only enhance that experience.While some people, probably most of the veteran players, dislike that both games in the collection (HW1 and HW2) are built in the HW2 engine, as a newcomer to Homeworld, I felt it made the whole experience more intuitive.  The transition between the two games was easy as it all felt the same. Two seperate engines might has disrupted the flow as players who just got accustomed to HW1's engine would now have to figure out the small changes made in HW2 and force a change in their mindset.All in all, an amazing, amazing game.

												Rose tinted glasses is a risk with the 'golden oldies'. Homeworld was a fantastic game back in the day, and to get that out of the way immediately: It still is. So, I recommend the game. But it is worth knowing ahead of buying that it is not a perfect game. It looks like a 2015 game. The game doesn't play like it, though. The campaign has a great story, but it has an unforgiving side and as your fleet stays with you throughout the game, it can be punishing or require loading. In that regard it's quite 'oldschool'. That is not necessarily bad - or good - but is something you should be aware of. As for the multiplayer, there's some region limiting that can be worked around, but you don't get more epic space battles than multiplayer Homeworld. Nothing even compares. I note that a lot mention bugs. I haven't run into any, for what it's worth.			"

												Homeworld.This is a game I enjoyed a lot playing the game for the first time, the brilliance of the attack plan which included jumping straight into the enemy (a friend who has never let me forget this) every single ship I owned. This was immediately followed by ""wait. Mayber that wasn't such a good idea"" then ""OOOPS"" as I watched the Mothership blow to pieces.This was my first experience at Homeworld Two, which despite my poor tactical skills at the time ended up setting me on a road of playing that game to the point of obsession. Until windows 7 and the game became incompatible with my computer and with a developer which no longer existed, pretty muched ended it there.So what does Homeworld Remastered Edition offer apart from a game that actually runs on a computer that isn't running windows XP? Better graphics for one and a crisper UI. As well as the oportunity to play multi-player over steam. In terms of selling the game, very little will make a difference if you haven't play Homeworld before. But if you haven't played it before, a ""meh"" before moving on isn't doing it justice.Would it have been possible for me to write this review without mentioning my experience playing it: No, it has simply shaped to much of my playing style in other games that to not mention this would be wrong.

												If you like tactics-based space RTS then you've come to the right game.While, for example, Sins Of A Solar Empire is rather static in its design, Homeworld is quite dynamic, with hits and misses of projectiles and lasers (weapons in general), and depth as to what to hit on a specific ship (engines, docks, etc).You notice Relic had its hands on this game; bear Company Of Heroes in mind.Recommended!

												Homeworld is burning. Been a long time since Relic first made this game back in the late 90s. With Gearbox doing the remastered collection it is a mixed feeling. First it's a bit better graphics on an old game, not too bad. That's about it, the voices in the remastered aren't really great, kind of lacking the emotion, the voice actors try but never really gets it quite right. Still has lots of the bugs of the old game, but it is playable. If you are an old homeworld fan you will be slightly disapproving, though the orignal copies of the game are included. With the modders out there is hope to at least transfer the old voices and cutscenes to the remastered version. 4/5 cats sleeping.			"

												Okay, there are some issues with bugs and random crashes for many, but not all. Let's get that out of the way. Does it make the game ""broken""? No, but there ARE issues to be addressed by Gearbox.I won't go into the graphics, story etc. as many reviews have covered this. Let me instead look at the game's 'difficulty' for the new RTS gamer.If you do not strategise and plan in 3D, which was revolutionary at the time (and still is, to my mind) you're going to have a hard time. When I played the original on release in my early thirties I DID find some of the mssions HARD, but then I wasn't used to this type of RTS. The delight was in solving the strategy for myself and finally 'getting it'! I hadn't come across this since ""X-Wing"", which really was a mix of simulator anbd puzzle solving (take out X bombers to pretect Hospital Ship - if you don't in a certain order you fail).So, it all comes down to planning and working out exactly what you need for each mission. ""Tank Rushing"" just will not work, and those with the biggest and baddest fleet, that takes sometimes far too much time and resources, will see you fail time and again (except in skirmish - which we didn't have back then).This game(s) requires thought, and aside from it's beauty (the original still looks marvellous), the strategy required is compelling.

												I pre-ordered this game when it first came out, and while I enjoyed it, I got stuck on certain technical issues and eventually lost interest.On the recommendation of a friend, I picked it up again recently due to a new patch being introduced which helped rebalance many of the game's issues with formations, among other issues. This time around, I'm shocked I was ever able to put it down. This game has incredible atmosphere, and no RTS comes close to having the gravitas that Homeworld accomplishes.Highly recommended for RTS fans, Sci-Fi fans, and fans of the incredible Battlestar Galactica reboot.

												To put it simply - Homeworld literally revolutionized the RTS genre when it was first released over 15 years ago. I bought the original game and throughout the years, it was always a deep regret that this great game was not available on Steam for everyone else to discover... until now! This remastered version is not just putting the original game on the Steam store - every part of the game has been improved and updated, surpassing all expectations for such a classic reborn. This digital collection is a great opportunity to experience what made Homeworld such an enduring game. The amazing fanbase which has kept this game alive all these years finally prompted the original developers to update and release it on Steam. If you are a fan of the Star Wars movies or gigantic space battles with epic scenery, this is definitely something that you should check out. Homeworld is quite different and special compared to other RTS games - it has an original outlook on space combat with a game engine capitalizing on the beauty of combat in space, which has never been as successfully captured in any other games. The game is so beautiful that you could make movies from the gameplay footage if you wanted - in fact, there are several fan-made movies out there with Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica mods, simulating the original look of the various ships in their respective franchise.The story and sound effects are very immersive, contributing to a chilling cinematic atmostphere where you can feel the loneliness of your civilization lost in space as you build your fleet while preparing for explorations and enemy encounters. The learning curve is easy compared to other strategy games so feel free to give it a try. It's worth it!			"

But the most important thing they kept from the original is the atmosphere, that feeling of exposure to the vastness of space. It's a grand game with awesome space opera moments.I'm looking forward to try the multiplayer some day, when I got the spaceballs for it that is...

Granted they took the old storyline but that storyline did not need any improvement, for a space rts it was perfect and it all clicked.I love that they only redone the graphics, I loved that they asked the origenal game creators to join them because if you play the game and have played the homeworld games way back you will notice, it has only helped this game be good.

												I never played the original versions of Homeworld 1 or Homeworld 2, or played Homeworld Cataclysm; but as a major fan of space rts games I wanted these games for a while. I had been thinking about getting them from amazon, and wishing they were on steam, when one day I saw this in the updates and was overjoyed at seeing it with all its remastered graphical glory!These 2 games are definitly two of the best space rts games I have ever played. With the graphics update that they have received in their remastering, they are the best looking space rts games I have played. These games make me wish I had a pc good enough to run it at high graphics, let alone the glory of max graphics at 4k resolution. as they are beautiful at the low settings I have to run them (blasted craptop). If you want a game that you could jack off to from the absolutly goregeous space battles, or a fantastic space rts game that has a great story and gameplay with fun multiplayer; then this game is for you!100/10 would recommend			"

												It is with both sadness and joy I think back on the bankruptcy of THQ. On the one hand it meant Metro passed from competent hands into the unknown abyss, but at the same time the Homeworld franchise got hit by the defib.  Relic and Sierra both pretty much went bust after Homeworld 2. The title was sold then sold again and that was it. Stuck in economical limbo by a company that did not want to touch it with a five foot stick and rightly so, because how to tackle such a game without creating another Colonial Marines?But it was revived, by Gearbox of all people, and again hope felt lost. Perhaps it is still lost, but this remastered edition of the original masterpieces shows competence from a company mainly associated with cellshaded gore. There's some funky voiceacting in some places, and you can tell sometimes which voicerecordings are old and which are new, but never has the Mothership looked better.I know there's a lot of people who complain about broken mechanics, such as formations, but I have had no such issues. 15 hours to move through the main campaign at my own speed and not a single gamebreaking issue has surfaced. No broken combat mechanics, no broken triggers, both HW 1 and 2 formations work for me. There are some graphical highjinxes though, such as commandeered taiidani ships randomly changing colours between missions, but nothing eyesore-noteworthy was had. Whatever issues people may have with random crashes it hasn't happened to me. Homeworld was a near flawless experience when it was released, one of the absolutely best strategy games ever made. What this remastered edition brings though is so much more than just a higher available resolution and support for inherent 64-bit systems. The graphics are now current generation level. Same with the sound and the classic cinematic sequences. To get that kind of update is like turning Quake into Crysis 3. The difference IS that big. Another great addition is the remade UI, the greatest improvement over the old HW 1 system. And of course let us not forget the updated multiplayer with quite a fair amount of new mechanics to spice things up. I would say it's not just a remastered edition of the original games, but this is exactly what should be expected from a remastered edition. This is what a remastered edition of any game should actually do. It's not just a relabel of the game; it's what would be expected of an RTS title released today. But then again, this is Homeworld. It was already a real-time strategy diamond and credit to Gearbox for all the hard work that went into this. They know what they're doing. They WANT this to be every bit as good as it can be, and it shows.			"

												One of my favorite strategy games of ALL TIME!!This franchise and me go back a ways...i was a younger teen when Homeworld came out and I had to have it!  The game was the first of its kind. at least it was for me anyways...Unfortunately the consoles started to show their faces, and I was taken from pc to consoles.It would be years before I would buy a pc again and I bought a laptop. Good thing im a game horder, because I still had my copy of Homeworld. Got back into the game and relived soo many memories.....and soon I would stumble upon Homeworld 2....""What?"" I had no idea that there was a sequel....as I said it had been years....so I magicaly found a copy online and man was this a even BETTER experiance than the original!....Alas...It would be short lived as my laptop would die, and I found myself once more sucked into the next console generation.....As fate would have it...some more years would go by and this new next gen of consoles would be emerging...and I would not be suckered by this so called ""NEW NEXT GEN""...So I went and got myself a high end gaming pc....the bad news is that I would not be able to enjoy my Homeworld games any more....well not to the extent that they once did...as the game did not support higher res grapgics that are out now.But GearBox has done something special by REMASTERING a MASTERPIECE! and once again I can enjoy this amazing franchise once more!!Well done GearBox!...there was alot of bad hype that this company was recieving. But this was done right in soo many ways!Thank you,10/10!!!			"

												The game is awsome.  If you like to get your thills with real time strategy games, this is a must have.  If you enjoyed these two Space Operas when they came out 15 years ago, the updated graphics will have you thrilled.  The detail work is so good that it seems that I could actually climb into the Interceptor and fly it myself.I had some issues early on getting my desktop graphics card to work properly.  With a bit of helpful advice from the online forum folk,  I was able to navigate to the .exe file and click ONE BOX and PRESTO...the game worked.If you have never played this game and like strategy games: get it.If you played it before, but enjoy the quality of today's games on today's graphics cards: get it.

												It's a remastering of two old games, so there are limits to what you can expect. Saying that the old games in question are classics so the having access to them again on new hardware was worth the cost from my point of view.The update also comes with improved graphics so the 3d models now look great at 2560x1400 on a 27"" monitor, much in the same way that I remember how goood the originals looked at 1280x1024 on a 21"" monitor. If you have played the original games (and can still remember back that far) you are looking at around 30 hours of game play to complete the included missions. beyond that there are PvC skirmish modes and a PvP system in beta.

												Just finished the Remastered Homeworld and it was a great experience.However there is some things to be aware of:There is only the one dificulty level so when you have finished the campaign I don't see much reason to replay it.The fleet is preserved during the campaign this means that some of the later levels become too easy beacuse your fleet is too good or the level is impossible because your fleet is too small...I had to restart the campaign because I just barely  made one level to be totally crushed in the next. However after the restart I steamrolled the later leves.The space view sometimes turns black for unknown reasons and it's impossible to do anything, if this happens save and reload and the view is back.If MSI Afterburner is running there are lots of graphical glitches so don't.The game crashed once and lvl 6 didn't have any objectives once so it was impossible to finish the map (worked after restart of map) but other than that I think the game was pretty solid.Oh and the Junkyard dog stopped stealing my ships after a while I don't know if this was a glitch or by design.

												This is a cautious recommendation.The game is playable with some minor bugs in the remastered versions. Three of the Four games included work as they should. As of today (3/1/15) the price for the game is $34.99.The problem with one of the games, Homeworld Remastered, is that formations with a couple of craft don't work as they did in the classics. It's not game breaking as players could work around the issues presented by the different engine. Even though this problem does exist, the original Homeworld is also bundled in the package, but I'm a little saddened that my experience of Homeworld 1 Remastered is going to be half baked.The rest of the games in my experience work as they should. I think Homeworld 2 Classic still has the emblems of the ships glowing a different shade from the rest of the ships on my GTX780, but Homeworld 2 Remastered has no such problem.For the price they're asking for, I think this purchase is just. They could have easily copped out a console asking price of $60 dollars, but they didn't.$10 for every working game, and $4.99 for Homeworld 1 Remastered			"

												When I first heard that Homeworld was being ""Remastered"" I feared the worst.  Thankfully those fears were unfounded and what has been produced by Gearbox is fully deserving of the title.  Thank you for treating a masterpiece of gaming with the respect that it deserves.			"

												I never played the original versions of Homeworld 1 or Homeworld 2, or played Homeworld Cataclysm; but as a major fan of space rts games I wanted these games for a while. I had been thinking about getting them from amazon, and wishing they were on steam, when one day I saw this in the updates and was overjoyed at seeing it with all its remastered graphical glory!These 2 games are definitly two of the best space rts games I have ever played. With the graphics update that they have received in their remastering, they are the best looking space rts games I have played. These games make me wish I had a pc good enough to run it at high graphics, let alone the glory of max graphics at 4k resolution. as they are beautiful at the low settings I have to run them (blasted craptop). If you want a game that you could jack off to from the absolutly goregeous space battles, or a fantastic space rts game that has a great story and gameplay with fun multiplayer; then this game is for you!100/10 would recommend			"

												I pre-ordered this game when it first came out, and while I enjoyed it, I got stuck on certain technical issues and eventually lost interest.On the recommendation of a friend, I picked it up again recently due to a new patch being introduced which helped rebalance many of the game's issues with formations, among other issues. This time around, I'm shocked I was ever able to put it down. This game has incredible atmosphere, and no RTS comes close to having the gravitas that Homeworld accomplishes.Highly recommended for RTS fans, Sci-Fi fans, and fans of the incredible Battlestar Galactica reboot.

												Updated:  Make sure to read the bottom edit.The countless hours I spent on this series as a youngster were some of my fondest memories of gaming. I completed the campaign for Homeworld at least 3 times, HW2 twice, and Cataclysm (somewhat non-canon, but still good) a few times as well. I've only reached the fifth mission in this HW1 Remastered campaign, but it appears Gearbox did the series proud. It's beautiful without compromising the original art, the updated interface is mostly an improvement (I'm not crazy about the different hotkeys) and the sound updates are amazing. There are nuances to the sounds that I never picked up in all the time I used to play the game.One change that had me absolutely giddy is that it's now (much more) possible for salvage frigates to capture Turanic Raider ships. I always wanted a fleet of Missile Corvettes, and now it's possible to nab them all!Overall, I'm blown away by this remaster. I'm overjoyed at how well it's done. If you never played the Homeworld games and you're an RTS or space fan, do yourself a favor and play this game, now.Edit: There are some serious issues with the game that I hope will be fixed soon. These are:1) Harvesting resources in HW1R is buggy, and requires babysitting and constantly reassigning the harvesters. They will stop harvesting, even when there are additional resources 30 seconds away.2) Strike Craft Formations and Tactics are useless and broken: Moving HW1 content to the HW2 engine clearly broke these, and they are critical to making strike craft useful. As they are right now, you will constantly lose all your strike craft due to the unit AI's inability to utilize tactics and formations. It forces you to just boat captured Assault Frigate swarms and other Frigate/Capital ships instead. This is a major and disappointing issue, and possibly the worst of the list.3) The projectile system was dropped in favor of the ""dice roll"" system of HW2. This was one of the coolest parts of HW1, and was amazing to watch in action. Projectiles were actually fired and could hit targets on the other side of the target by accident. This led to strike craft being much more useful, as they could dodge rounds coming towards them, allowing them to overwhelm large capital ships. Now, Heavy Cruisers, Destroyers and Assault Frigates wipe out dozens of fighters without breaking a sweat. The best anti-everything weapon is just a mass of capital ships, in all circumstances. Forget attack bombers and defenders. The only reason to builds scouts and interceptors is as a cheap meat shield or disposable scouting element.4) Time to Kill is INSANE. INSANE. Take two heavy cruisers or destroyers, and have them start shooting at each other. They die in like 30 seconds. It used to take twice that long, turning capital ship fights into epic slugging matches. Now, it's all just one giant, stupid deathball.5) Scaled difficulty is broken: Just collect a few dozen ships, and by mission 10, you'll see what I mean. If you're familiar with the original HW, you'll see that they have more than quadrupled the number of enemy ships guarding the ghost ship. It's hilarious and game breaking.I really hope they fix these issues, as HW is one of my favorite franchises, ever. It pains me to say this, but HW1R is not worth playing until most of the bugs get fixed. I haven't played HW2R enough to see, but I'm sure it's fine as it's in the same engine. If you want to play HW1, stick to the classic version. I pray it doesn't have the same issues.			"

												Probably one of the best, if not THE best HD remaster of a game to date. Sure, games have advanced a bit since, but this game is a classic, and is in all aspects a work of art. Both sight and sound. The remaster does several things.1 - It makes the game something you can get without a cdrom. 2 - It vastly improves the games models, textures, and effects (it was visually stunning in its day, and now its even more so). 3 - It resampled all the games audio to be much more high quality4 - Vastly improved (and scaleable) UI.5 - Both homeworld and homeworld 2 in one package6 - New multiplayer functionality.For me, it was worth it just to be able to play through the 2 games stories again, on a new high end system, and have the game look and perform amazingly. This game is an experience, one that hasnt really been duplicated since it was released. New game devs could learn a lot from it, but in the mean time, im glad to get to play this series again.			"

												Absolutely spectacular remake of the beloved HW franchise.  The graphics are amazing, and the changes they made to both HW1 and HW2 are much needed (for example, getting rid of the fuel requirement in HW1). These games are STILL the best RTS ever made, and they really shine here.  If you've never played Homeworld, you've never experienced the best the RTS genre has to offer.  Homeworld has been my all time favorite game since its release, so I am very critical of anything Gearbox is doing with this franchise.  I'm happy to say that the remastering was done with a TON of care and love, and the bugs I've seen are very few and far between-a relief in this day of publishers releasing so many unfinished games.  It can only get better from here.  Way to go Gearbox, you've successfully brought back Homeworld!  Now make Homeworld 3 so all my dreams can come true!			"

												This game is everything a Homeworld faithful could have hoped for! After a decade, it is so refreshing to play one of the greatest games ever made with a fresh coat of paint. The story is still as evocative as ever (better than any trash AAA game currently out there,) the strategy is as complex as you wish to make it, and the graphics...the originals still look good, but holy cow the remasters are gorgeous! The dialogue was wonderfully redone, staying true to the originals whilst adding some depth and emotion. The game isn't a breeze to beat, but it's not a 4X either. It's just enough challenge to make you claw back for more!The only potential things I would have done differently:Bring squadrons to the original, it's tough to micromanage so many ships with only 10 groupsAdd more ship types (such as from the complex mods) to give greater depth, especially in HW2Having the 4 races be playable is great, but it'd be nice to have a mode with playable Keepers and Progenitors tooThere is embedded mod support in the main menu so I imagine once modders get their eager hands on the code and start releasing stuff it'll be a lot easier to incorporate them into the game. This is great, since I was never able to make the Complex mods work on my Windows 8 machine.Looking forward to several more years of this game!			"

Gameplay, story, visuals, music - the Homeworld series had/has it all - nothing has even come close in the 15 years since their release.So far I haven't found anything to complain about - just about everything has been improved in the HD versions. Gearbox also didn't mess with the core gameplay - smart move on their part. If it aint broke, don't try to fix it.Can't recommend this collection enough - it's that good.			"

												A few things that I have observed about Homeworld 1 remastered so far (Just finished mission 4)-No fuel system, making strike craft more useful for prolonged missions without support-Repairs of strike craft and Capital Ships seem to be free (Vanilla they were not)-Research now costs RU (In vanilla they were not)-Large enough ships now leave debris when destroyed (Turanic Carrier), which can now be salvaged for RU by Harvesters and Salvage Corvettes.-You can still capture ships, expect an all star-cast of Turanic, Taidaan and Kadeshi Capitals fighting for your cause (Just not the two Assault frigates from Mission 3, nor the Turanic Carrier)-Ships have problems staying in formation.-No seperate screen for research and ship building, meaning you have better situational awareness than you did in the Vanilla Game-I was hoping for a patrol control, but you only have a waypoint mode that cannot be used to create a permanent patrolThere may be more changes that I haven't noticed yet but those are the highlights. Can't wait till someone creates the inevitable Battlestar, Star Citizen, Star Trek, Star War, Babylon 5 mods for this game.			"

												HOMEWORLD REMASTERED COLLECTION REVIEW (Reccomended-Strategist2_0)Player Base: First Time Homeworld Player. Hence, my reviews are based on initial first impression of the game (particularly Homeworld Remastered. Updated reviews will be added below)Homeworld Remastered (Updated-26/02/2015)<Impression> This game is straight out beautiful, with amazing choice of soundtracks that helps you fully immerse in the game and also has that rare ability to keep you investing more and more in the lore of the game. I particulally appreciate the developer's effort in adding a reworked, complete, and simple tutorial for such a challenging RTS game such as this. The cutscene dialogues does seems to be abit bland at times as the characters in the game apart from the mothership speaks in a rather unconvincing voice, with minimal expression though this does not significantly affect the gameplay nor the total enjoyability of this game. After playing the original Homeworld, I discovered that it seems to me that the dialogues are ported to the remastered edition and as such the game is not at fault here though I do wish that it could be reworked as well. So far, it works perfectly fine on my PC with no bugs encountered just yet as I am aware that certain people are having issues with the game. Issues thread below:http://steamcommunity.com/app/244160/discussions/0/617328967243529430/Pros: + BEAUTIFUL graphics+ Amazing soundtrack+ Addictive gameplay+ Great and epic story+ Purposeful level designCons:- The in-game dialogue could use an upgrade=============================================================================Homeworld Original (Updated-26/02/2015)<Impression> Playing the Original makes me appreciate the remastered edition as much as I have respect for the original. Though the graphics are not particularly amazing like the remastered edition, it is well ahead of its time then and was a marvel to watch. Gameplay is butter smooth and there is no bug encountered just yet. Since this is the original, it goes without saying that the resolution could only be maxed to 1024x640 (16 or 32 bit) and not beyond. For newcomers such as myself, I recommend that you finished the remastered edition first to develop interest before playing the original. I would also like to express my gratitude for having this game included together by the developer as it kept me invested in the game and its a blast to play with.Pros: + Epic Story and lore+ Great gameplay+ Has great valueCons:- None so far=============================================================================*MORE REVIEWS TO COME*			"

												Oh my god.  Homeworld's back.  I never thought I'd see this day.  I don't know how many hours I put into the originals.So far, not many bugs on release other than a couple crashes.  If you crash, lower the texture quality a notch.  Even at 2048 texture size, it's beautifulTo top it off, this is NOT one of those games that looks better through nostalgia glasses.  Between all the engine improvements, HD textures, etc, it's BETTER.I remember playing HW1 when I was a kid and getting destroyed.  15 years later, with an adult mind, it feels like a different game.  I know how to manage resources better, I know the strengths and weaknesses of ships better, and try to organize my fleet instead of throwing units against the enemy hoping to get a kill.EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE RTS, GIVE THIS GAME A TRY.  It looks like another overcomplicated space RTS, but it's really not.  It's complicated in its own ways, but very easy to learn the basic tactics and rock-paper-scissor mechanics between all the different ships.This isn't like other RTSs.  It's very easy to pick up and play, hard to master against real players, but the selling point is the beautiful campaigns of HW1 and 2.  Not to mention the massive battles, with fighters zipping everywhere with their glowing contrails, and massive capital ships hammering at each other with cannons and ion beems.Good lord, it's been a long time.  It's more beautiful than I remember; with the Remastered engine, it's more than just a polished up HW2 engine.  Check out any comparison videos.This game has gotten *BETTER* with time.  How many series/remakes can say that?			"

												Just to start i must stat that im a huge fan of the homeworld series (owning all 3 big box editions of the original games in all their glory) when i found out about this i preorderd the special edition.To start the game is beautiful with new stunning skins, great new sound effects, cleaned up audio for the voice acting and wonderful draw cutscenes, not to mention the easier to use UI of homeworld 2 that makes homeworld 1 singleplayer that much easier and fun to play. These games hold their own on gameplay alone (dont believe me?, try the classic editions bundled into the collection!) but the remaster really does make the places you play in that much more special. The multiplayer (against bots for the moment) is also fun, being able to use any of the 4 major races across both games is really intreasting and gives alot more replayability.Its not all good news tho as this games does have bugs, so far iv noticed certain ships clipping through each other, ships not dissappearing after hyperdrive, the overview map not working at times, and crashes to name a few. However i still recommend this game as it is, with gearbox supporting modding for this game and a huge modding community already around, as well as possibility of (decent!) DLC and bug fixes, its a bright intergalactic future for Homeworld.			"

												Awesome games with some graphics boosts.  Dont really like the new controls but still not too bad.  I would give the original Homeworld a 10/10.  The orginal Homeworld 2 a 8/10.  Didnt play the remasted Homeworld 2 yet but the remastered Homeworld is a 8/10.  Good polish but cant give it a 10/10 with the different controls and button layouts that are nowhere near the original but still a good remaster and a thumbs up over here.			"

A few bugs to start of with but withing an hour they had a new update out to take care of some of them.Homeworld RM is amazing, the high detail on the ships from rotating canons to the laser lights reflected across the ships and objects in space, to the remastered sound, which is amazing if you turn it all the way up.The 3D evironment in which you can move ships is so amazing and just like  I remember it. Overall the best game out. Well done Gearbox.To everyone complaining about the little bugs. It was know beforehand that there would be bugs. Gearbox wanted people to play and find all the bugs so that they could fix them. If you watch all the videos on the developers, you can see that they really are keen to keep this game going and fix all the bugs, so get off there backs and give them time to fix things. Rewriting code and troubleshooting is not easy most of the time. For the amount of time they\ve spent on this, which is surpising little. It's amazing!			"

Forgot to feed animals and children and wife woke up and decided to pick a fight (true story).Wife is now at the in-laws for a few days and I can play my beloved old game that made me the nerd I am today.In all honesty the remake is amazing. Graphics and overview changes have made this game incredibly better without changing the heart and soul of what Homeworld truly is. A masterpice of gaming history with a storyline without rival.Do yourself a once in a lifetime favour and purchase this game and watch your family, life and job disappear into endless space with a huge smile on your face.

												A classic game updated with care to feel almost completely modern. It looks great, sounds great, and continues to play great to this day even without gameplay changes. It's RTS-inspired, but doesn't require you to count APM or plan build queues. The campaigns are tough and can be unforgiving, but the story makes the struggle worthwhile. Highly recommended.			"

												Feeling nostalgia for this game since 1999. Remastered version brings back warm memories and enhance them. New Homeworld 1 models are superb, I didn't expect that Gearbox would make old, almost two decades old models, so detailed, fighters look amazing.Of course, there are few bugs, but mainly they're caused by port of Homeworld 1 content to Homeworld 2 engine. Campaign doesn't roll as it used to, autobalance ""feature"" ruins old tactics I used to beat HW1 campaign. But at the same time it makes old campaign look new. Game runs perfectly on highest settings with average strength high end rig.			"

There is also some issues in the garden with crashing randomly.However this was one of my favorite games all those years ago and I am glad to see it making a come back.

												I own all homeworld titles, I still play them including some of the mods every now and then.  I simply love the game.  Started playing this and it's the best game reborn.  This is not a 100% clone.  There are new elements in the game if my memory serves me right.  The missions and the storyline are more or less the same so far, cinematics are new.  The sountrack is the same, which is actually a very good thing.  The soundtrack alone deserves a medal.  Visuals are extremely updated.  Spoiler alert:  I don't remember some of the ships that Bentusi trades nor do I remember that Bentusi EVER gave me an option to buy tech in the originals.  I'm not far along with the ""Remastered"" and already see differences to the Classics.Homeworld title is one of the most aclaimed in the industry.  16 years later there are still thousands asking for the next installment.  There are multiple forums and blogs dedicated to HW still in full force and active.   If you are new to the Homeworld and love strategy, you simply have to play it!  If you have played it without enjoyment, this won't skew your view and may seem repetitive, but if you loved the Classics, you'll appreciate the ""Remastered"" in its full glory.			"

												Since this game is actually four games in one, or more accurately, two games and two remasters, I'll be reviewing each one individually. I will also play the remasters first before I go and play the classic editions. The classic edition reviews will be more of a compare and contrast to the remasters in things like HUD, tactical options, balance, etc. Since I don't stand a chance in hell in putting all four reviews on one review, I'll have four separate Pastebin links, of which I will be writing reviews for each game as I complete them.

												Classical Homeworld with a modern take on the graphics looks very impressive.However to point out, this is a very new title (at the time of the review), so it has some small issues.The biggest issue I have is the inability to PAUSE multiplayer matches, are times I have to go do something else, and I need to pause the game.Aside from that one fact, singleplayer games for what they have remastered look amazing, but still again at a cost.There are issues were the original game (Homeworld) could do more game mechanics wise.I suppose the fact that they're using a homeworld 2 engine has something to do with these issues so far.I would also like to see Cataclysm in this ""collection"" as its not much of a collection without it.Nearly forgot, the Remastered Collection for me atleast, runs better then the originals.Steam Workshop also provides a very nice way to install your favorite mods too.Overall I feel it was worth the time to get this particular title.

												PROS:One of the best spaceships strategy games ever created, this is the one that started all... Many child were born from this jewel like EVE Online, Haegemonia, Sins of a Solar Empire, and many others.The gameplay is easy learned and now with new updated graphics the game experience is even greater.The story is amazing and would perfectly become a great novel and/or a cable series or even a blockbuster movie.CONS:The AI must be improved, as when your fleet grows, sometimes the big ships block the mother-ship exit for new smaller corvettes and frigates, even the science modules got stuck on the mother-ship at the beginning of some levels.The pack contains ""Homeworld"" and ""Homeworld 2"" versions but it misses the ""Homeworld Cataclysm"" expansion (besides this expansion became complete new game instead)			"

												A faithful remaster of my favorite space strategy game of all time.  Possibly my favorite game.  The graphics updates are stunning, and Gearbox has been faithful to patch to improve balancing and fix bugs.  The voice acting is so much better than most strategy games, which is a pet peeve of mine.  There are a few good mods out there too.   If you want a fair challenge, love space strategy or beautiful spaceship design, love the original, or like to watch ships blow up and go boom, then this is the game for you.			"

												When i saw this series for the first time, it caught my eye. why? it was the sheer beauty of it. and im not even talking about the remastered version, or the graphics of the games, remastered or not. it was the concept, the story, and the level of pure thought that goes into every moment of gameplay. The story is a classic tale of an odyssey across the stars to find your one true home, and along the way you meet friends, and monsters. You find those who have simply strayed from their paths, and those who want nothing more to see you burn. you must use your 3 dimensional battlefield to your advantage, and plot every move, for one slip up can cost you your fleet. The game is very well put together overall, and the originals are well preserved, the remastered ones however are not entirely true to the classic versions. In some instances you face more enemies than in the original, or Certain events do not occur at the right time or in the right spot. these are minor changes at best, but a sound strategy that worked in the classics, may not work in the remastered ones. Older fans will not be dissapointed, and new fans will hardly notice the difference. Despite these gripes i have to say it is still one of the best strategy games i have ever played, and certainly my favorite.			"

												It is with both sadness and joy I think back on the bankruptcy of THQ. On the one hand it meant Metro passed from competent hands into the unknown abyss, but at the same time the Homeworld franchise got hit by the defib.  Relic and Sierra both pretty much went bust after Homeworld 2. The title was sold then sold again and that was it. Stuck in economical limbo by a company that did not want to touch it with a five foot stick and rightly so, because how to tackle such a game without creating another Colonial Marines?But it was revived, by Gearbox of all people, and again hope felt lost. Perhaps it is still lost, but this remastered edition of the original masterpieces shows competence from a company mainly associated with cellshaded gore. There's some funky voiceacting in some places, and you can tell sometimes which voicerecordings are old and which are new, but never has the Mothership looked better.I know there's a lot of people who complain about broken mechanics, such as formations, but I have had no such issues. 15 hours to move through the main campaign at my own speed and not a single gamebreaking issue has surfaced. No broken combat mechanics, no broken triggers, both HW 1 and 2 formations work for me. There are some graphical highjinxes though, such as commandeered taiidani ships randomly changing colours between missions, but nothing eyesore-noteworthy was had. Whatever issues people may have with random crashes it hasn't happened to me. Homeworld was a near flawless experience when it was released, one of the absolutely best strategy games ever made. What this remastered edition brings though is so much more than just a higher available resolution and support for inherent 64-bit systems. The graphics are now current generation level. Same with the sound and the classic cinematic sequences. To get that kind of update is like turning Quake into Crysis 3. The difference IS that big. Another great addition is the remade UI, the greatest improvement over the old HW 1 system. And of course let us not forget the updated multiplayer with quite a fair amount of new mechanics to spice things up. I would say it's not just a remastered edition of the original games, but this is exactly what should be expected from a remastered edition. This is what a remastered edition of any game should actually do. It's not just a relabel of the game; it's what would be expected of an RTS title released today. But then again, this is Homeworld. It was already a real-time strategy diamond and credit to Gearbox for all the hard work that went into this. They know what they're doing. They WANT this to be every bit as good as it can be, and it shows.			"

												To put it simply - Homeworld literally revolutionized the RTS genre when it was first released over 15 years ago. I bought the original game and throughout the years, it was always a deep regret that this great game was not available on Steam for everyone else to discover... until now! This remastered version is not just putting the original game on the Steam store - every part of the game has been improved and updated, surpassing all expectations for such a classic reborn. This digital collection is a great opportunity to experience what made Homeworld such an enduring game. The amazing fanbase which has kept this game alive all these years finally prompted the original developers to update and release it on Steam. If you are a fan of the Star Wars movies or gigantic space battles with epic scenery, this is definitely something that you should check out. Homeworld is quite different and special compared to other RTS games - it has an original outlook on space combat with a game engine capitalizing on the beauty of combat in space, which has never been as successfully captured in any other games. The game is so beautiful that you could make movies from the gameplay footage if you wanted - in fact, there are several fan-made movies out there with Star Wars or Battlestar Galactica mods, simulating the original look of the various ships in their respective franchise.The story and sound effects are very immersive, contributing to a chilling cinematic atmostphere where you can feel the loneliness of your civilization lost in space as you build your fleet while preparing for explorations and enemy encounters. The learning curve is easy compared to other strategy games so feel free to give it a try. It's worth it!			"

But the most important thing they kept from the original is the atmosphere, that feeling of exposure to the vastness of space. It's a grand game with awesome space opera moments.I'm looking forward to try the multiplayer some day, when I got the spaceballs for it that is...

												This is definitely a must-play game. Even though the first half is pretty straight forward, with collecting RU, spending it, collecting more, doing some some research, spending it again. And etc. It's a game where you can start off your ""strategy game"" experience, because its not too hard or easy, and you could easily catch up with what's going on. I have to admit, I have gotten bored a couple of times, but it always lures me back in, maybe it's the my fantasy of space and galactic exploration. The remastered version makes everything look waaayyy better and smoother. And that's pretty much it.PEACE.			"

												I didn't like this as much as I thought I would.  I never played the original version, so I'm just now experiencing Homeworld in the Remastered Collection.It does seem to be a good 3D RTS engine and watching the ships in combat is amazing.  The storyline and plot is also interesting, at least as far as I played.  Is probably a game worth looking into or trying at least once, if its on sale.  But I think in today's RTS world, its a bit behind, even with the updated graphics.  I stopped playing at about the 6th mission for several reasons:1.  Even playing normal difficulty, the AI is brutal throwing in larger ships like Frigates and even Destroyers very soon in the game, I think about the 4th or 5th mission.  Before you have even had a chance to build more than a few of them.  So unless you have researched and crank out some serious frigates, you will be toast.  I think its the I've read some walkthroughs and you can ""cheese"" your way through these missions by capturing with salvage frigates, but that seems cheesy and more like an exploit, then winning with combat. 2.  Resources are limited and always seem to be on the same place in the map,  A group of asteroids or a cloud of interstellar gas - always in about the same places.   it makes it kind of boring and also makes the game a bit unforgiving, if you mess up and lose to many ships or make a mistake, the campaign mission is pretty much over, or the next campaign mission will be impossible because you don't have enough resources to build new ships or do research.3.  I got bored with the space theme.  It looks beautiful flying around for a while and watching ship combat, but then after a bit its boring to me, compared to land based RTS games.  In the land based ones, you can use the terrain to your advantage in attacking and setting up bases, and building defenses.  But in Homeworld, you are pretty much thrown into a system with your unmovable base ship stuck in one place.  With tons of empty space around you.  I just found that the combat got kind of boring because its mostly scrambling around to send groups of ships to certain places, without much strategy or base defense building involved.			"

The graphics overhaul is spectacular and these two games have been brought up to date with modern RTS games. The music remains gorgeous and the sound effects appear to have received a remastering as well. They were both excellent to begin with but this remaster makes them polished so they can shine brilliantly among the great RTS games of our time.			"

												The first thing I want to say is the Homeworld series is by far my favorite set of games ever.I completely recommend this purchase for anyone who likes SciFi in general, the space genre, and strategy fans.Update*  Original version contained bugs.  As of version 1.2 all bugs are gone as far as I can tell.  Game experience is exactly as it was all those years ago.			"

												One of my favorite strategy games of ALL TIME!!This franchise and me go back a ways...i was a younger teen when Homeworld came out and I had to have it!  The game was the first of its kind. at least it was for me anyways...Unfortunately the consoles started to show their faces, and I was taken from pc to consoles.It would be years before I would buy a pc again and I bought a laptop. Good thing im a game horder, because I still had my copy of Homeworld. Got back into the game and relived soo many memories.....and soon I would stumble upon Homeworld 2....""What?"" I had no idea that there was a sequel....as I said it had been years....so I magicaly found a copy online and man was this a even BETTER experiance than the original!....Alas...It would be short lived as my laptop would die, and I found myself once more sucked into the next console generation.....As fate would have it...some more years would go by and this new next gen of consoles would be emerging...and I would not be suckered by this so called ""NEW NEXT GEN""...So I went and got myself a high end gaming pc....the bad news is that I would not be able to enjoy my Homeworld games any more....well not to the extent that they once did...as the game did not support higher res grapgics that are out now.But GearBox has done something special by REMASTERING a MASTERPIECE! and once again I can enjoy this amazing franchise once more!!Well done GearBox!...there was alot of bad hype that this company was recieving. But this was done right in soo many ways!Thank you,10/10!!!			"

												A faithful remaster of my favorite space strategy game of all time.  Possibly my favorite game.  The graphics updates are stunning, and Gearbox has been faithful to patch to improve balancing and fix bugs.  The voice acting is so much better than most strategy games, which is a pet peeve of mine.  There are a few good mods out there too.   If you want a fair challenge, love space strategy or beautiful spaceship design, love the original, or like to watch ships blow up and go boom, then this is the game for you.			"

												PROS:One of the best spaceships strategy games ever created, this is the one that started all... Many child were born from this jewel like EVE Online, Haegemonia, Sins of a Solar Empire, and many others.The gameplay is easy learned and now with new updated graphics the game experience is even greater.The story is amazing and would perfectly become a great novel and/or a cable series or even a blockbuster movie.CONS:The AI must be improved, as when your fleet grows, sometimes the big ships block the mother-ship exit for new smaller corvettes and frigates, even the science modules got stuck on the mother-ship at the beginning of some levels.The pack contains ""Homeworld"" and ""Homeworld 2"" versions but it misses the ""Homeworld Cataclysm"" expansion (besides this expansion became complete new game instead)			"

												Still one of, if not, the best space RTS games ever made. What I don't understand is why no one borrowed or evolved the space battle model pioneered by this game, instead developers over the years went the easy/lazy route setting the battlespace on a 2D plane. While remastered was litterally everything I expected it to be, and this is me being greedy, I would have loved to see a HW 2.5 type set up where maybe things the fans liked from HW1 and HW2 were blended to make a rebalanced best of both worlds type thing to add another refreshing dimension to this (still) one of a kind space RTS. Infinitely replayable, ship design, sound, and lighting is top notch. Should be in anyone's library if you're a fan of RTS games. Very highly recommended.			"

												So, this is it: The good old days are coming back.A new Master of Orion has been anounced, Fallout 4 knocks on the door and Gearbox released a remastered version of Homeworld 1 and 2 combined including a multiplayer mode combining both AND including the old versions, and that is what Iwant to write about here.This IS almost exactly the old Homeworld just with ditched up GFX.The changesGearbox made are mostly positive- like getting rid of the fuel limitation of strikecraft in HW1.One might saythe carrier is almost useless now, and I agree, but refuling the fighters was mostly just annoying.The bad things have mostly returned as well, like the horrible difficulty spikes of HW2. I am a very experienced player and I just don't get past the third mission where I am to protect the shipyard... Maybe there's a trick that Ijust fail to spot.The Multiplayer is still in Beta, but honestly, Idon't see any problems with it after three long skirmishes, it worked perfectly well. I had more Issues with HW1rm where the sound went on the fritz horribly in the last mission.It is really sad, that cataclysm is not includet - it's because the game files have been lost during the transition from barking dog to gearbox or something alike. I really hope they turn up soon and cataclysm will be includet here, because it was rad!So what to say? You loved Homeworld 1 and/or Homeworld 2? Go get this! It's great!			"

												Since this game is actually four games in one, or more accurately, two games and two remasters, I'll be reviewing each one individually. I will also play the remasters first before I go and play the classic editions. The classic edition reviews will be more of a compare and contrast to the remasters in things like HUD, tactical options, balance, etc. Since I don't stand a chance in hell in putting all four reviews on one review, I'll have four separate Pastebin links, of which I will be writing reviews for each game as I complete them.

												A solid remake of 2 of the PC gaming world's first blockbusters. Half a million copies in 1999 was HUGE. This game is a masterpiece. And Gearbox improved on it (with a lot of the team from the original game hired on to do the remake) with a better UI, more balanced units for a better PVE experience. They expanded on the cinematics, voices, artwork. When I was a boy this game was magical. As an adult this remaster so far has been just as magical. I can hope for cataclysm as a future DLC.			"

I didn't like waiting all ships get docked after a mission finished.And little bit hard. After my resource collectors destroyed all in the radiation field in a certain mission, I found the game is not pleasant.But Homeworld2 was exciting. Guiding unit's role in the first mission was very useful, it helped me to understand how I should operate my ships. And the Dreadnought! It was awesome. It is described as a powerful but unstable ship at the first battle scene. This makes me exciting.Recommended.			"

I still have the original disc from it, and I can't recommend anything as high as I recommend this game. This is really a different experience to every rts, every space game, every strategy you've ever played. If any of the above interest you, please pick it up, it's the best thing I've ever played. This game came out in the 90s, and the remastering brings a new beautiful face to a game that has more depth and detail to the strategy, control, and environment than anything I've ever seen since. Highest recommendation, try it out			"

												For all of those who care for a weighted review or whatever, I'd like to point it out: this is basically a love-letter, from a fan-boy (who's not a boy for a long time now).This is the game that brought all the beauty of the space before my eyes, when I was younger. This is the game I waited for oh so long to be either continued or be remastered. And when the news came in, I was happy that I could once again meet the Hiigarans and listen to that incredible soundtrack and command fleets and... oh so much more. Even though so many years have passed it still gives me that incredible sense of... adventure, that I somehow miss in modern games. And even though I know all the story from A to Z, it is still incredibly fun and exciting to go through it. The gameplay is not at all weaker, and the enhanced graphics only make it more immersive.There are some people who give the game 'thumbs down' either because they think it's wrong to use the name of the older version (or its score on the Metacritics). There are some, who think little bugs are... well, it seems they think those are kind of sin.But I disagree. This is one of the best remastered games I have ever played, And I know for a fact that I will enjoy playing it. Again... and, then, again =)Now, the policy requires to me give pros and cons:Pros:- Excellent graphics- Incredible OST (I wonder why do they not sell it separately?)- Involving story- God, it's Homeworld, how can it not be a pro? )Cons:- Little bugs- Some balancing problemsBut after all, who cares? ) It is only up to you to decide whether you want it or not. But I would strongly recommend to play it, because, who knows, we may have a HW3 someday... perhaps even sooner than HL3 =)			"

												I just love this game and am glad i bought it,  Great graphics and voiceacting and always fun to play to replay it. The fun never stops... I easily recommend this game to be bought as it isa classic, oh yeah the music stutters, which is annoying would like to see that patched otherwise -- music off. This game will always stay a gemm! And as yor able to play up to five versions of the game incl. skirmish and excluding online this is a good buy guys.			"

												10/10 for updated sound and graphics, 1/10 for trying to remake Homeworld missions on the Homeworld 2 engine (which was used for this remaster). The second game had severely different mechanics and because of that, the original missions are full of bugs, balancing issues and AI problems.Also, where is the god damned song which used to play over the ending credits? You know, the one specifically written for this game. The one that brought a tear to my eye everytime I managed to beat the final mission, with pieces of plastic piercing the skin around my knuckles from repeatedly punching the keyboard in fury. Those were the times, man.As for the HW2 campaing, it plays out just fine, so eat that sh!t up because it's still awesome and on top of that, it looks like a million bucks.			"

												Remastered version is still broken after the patch fixes. =/ sometimes I wish the remastered version can try to stick to the classic version gameplay and just give me my eye candy high quality textured ships. The fomations and behavior settings from aggresive, defensive, passive are just broken as my ships doesnt attack on aggresive mode when in formation like a sitting duck where ony one ship attacks. It feels like the conditions for the formation is so rigid. I am set in agressive mode, i am agressively trying to stay in formation and I forgot to move and shoot nearby enemies.I love classic, the remastered version just ruined the hope of playing it like how it worked before with better graphics.

												Probably one of the prettiest and performance friendly remakes out there. It stays true to the original while delivering some pretty awesome graphics that run great, even on lower end cards. I've managed to get 60FPS on high graphics with a GTX 750ti, so I think most people on steam will be able to run this at high frames and enjoy some pretty close up action.			"

												I was 17 when this game first came out. And that amaze balls feeling you get when you first play this game is still there. The story is great it is a bit of Battlestar galatica feel to it. The game plays so seemlessly it is fairly brutal in its learning curve tho you got to manage your fleet well keeping your fighters busy getting rid of bombers and corvettes while keeping your capital ships alive, and frigates moving to get the rear and top of other capital ships. It is quite chaotic once the battle commence and you got to be aware of the whole situation zooming in and out of the tactical map and strategic map as well. Focus too much on the big fight and you might face a small yet destructive unit that hits your harvesters on the far end of your map. I rate it highly to anyone whom like RTS games "

												Day 1 review:This is a very good remastered version, I'm only 5 missions into the remastered HW1 and thus far it's pretty much as advertised, a remastered version of the original, though it's definately not the same mechanics.  The UI has been redone, and redone very well.  The original musical scores so far have remained and most of the voice actors are also the same, though the updated dialog seems a bit rushed on delivery and a ""small"" amount of that original emotion has been lost, but overall still very good, and if you've never played before you'll probably never notice but is something to enjoy in the classic version if you opt to play that.The graphics are fantastic and the new animations are quite impressive, love the new booms and kapows!  There are a few issues in the remastered version, formations aren't quite working right, support ships aren't supporting correctly, and you're not able to select your desired race in the campaign mode anymore.  So the old tactics need to altered to compensate for the new mechanics a bit, hopefully we'll see updates to correct these issues.Overall a very respectful and appreciated update to an old classic I actually still played from time to time.

												I am really impressed at the hardwork that has gone into this game to breath new life into it.  Yes, there has been some changes done between HW1 -> Remastered but for those doubtful, please realize that HW1 and HW2 were two completely different games that just shared the same story and some units that looked alike.  SO making it possible to play all races in the new game, some sacrifices had to be made to bring balance to the game...it is a step in the right direction, that is why multiplayer is still BETA.  Other than that you can still play the campaigns, make sure you have the DLC checked for them though otherwise they will not show in the game.  Graphics are absolutely oustanding, brings back so many memories.Phantex Enthoo ProCPU:AMD 8350RAM: 32GBVID: Sapphira R9 290X w/4gb memory.			"

												Like so many other reviews, this is not my first time with the Homeworld series. Ive been playing these games for the better part of 10 years. Theyve been my rock. The standard from which Ive judged other RTS and space strategy games. No game has surpassed these games in terms of space battle epicness. Not in the 15 years since the release of HW:1. Gearbox has done a great job. Whatever your feelings about them, they delivered on their promise with this. With the success of HW: Remastered I hope to see more Homeworld games, or at least more space RTS games. If your new to the series, give it a try. If you have any intrest in space combat, RTS, games with good stories and deep lore, or any combination of the above, you will love it.			"

I played the original unmastered and the dust was visible and the game was a challenge, but playable.  You made it unplayable and a fu** torture.  Thanks alot for taking my 35 bucks for screwing up a great game.  MORONS.Played both homeworl 1 and 2, and came to the conclusion that this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  It is a strategy game that does not require strategy.  None of the tactical features has an impact on gameplay.  The real trick is to figure exploits in the programming to avoid triggering preset AI action.  Otherwise a freaken mindless grind with pretty stars in the background.I so want my money back.			"

The real proof of this game's cutting edge nature, however, is that even now it can still stand proud with games a decade newer. The story, animation, and music were mind-blowing then... and are still beautiful. This is a game with nail-biting pacing, haunting story-telling, and truly three-dimensional tactical options.

Other than that you can still play the campaigns, make sure you have the DLC checked for them though otherwise they will not show in the game.  Graphics are absolutely oustanding, brings back so many memories.Phantex Enthoo ProCPU:AMD 8350RAM: 32GBVID: Sapphira R9 290X w/4gb memory.			"

												Tu planeta de origen yace en llamas y destrucción, y tu comandas a los sobrevivientes de tu raza en una cruzada para encontrar un nuevo comienzo tras encontrar un mapa galactico. Tu viaje te llevara por lugares peligrosos y quienes destruyeron tu mundo quieren terminar el trabajo.Este juego te llevara a explorar los confines de la galaxia comandando una flota entera, desde navez caza hasta y covertas, hasta los pesos pesados como los destructores y  cruceros de batalla. Las batallas serán epicas y tu las experimentaras en toda su gloria y horror. La interfaz de comando es muy facil de usar y facilita mucho el hecho de que estas comandando una flota de cientos. La historia del juego es muy buena y lo mejor es que tienes los dos juegos remasterizados con graficas actuales, una pieza maestra.			"

Good work Gearbox! One note, it has locked up a few times on menu screens and crashed once. Otherwise it's stable though.			"

												I've always loved RTS games with a serious passion since I first started playing video games and I must say that this one is the most fun I've had in years  playing a game.Cons-Because there are so few id rather start with these:One issue many people harp on in the review section is that when you form up an attack formation that the ships end up running into eachother, getting in each other's ways and leaving eachother behind which is kind of a problem when you start getting the late game slow-but-powerful ships mixxed in with your Multi-gun corvets and bombers leaving the powerful capital ships behind. The tutorial says that when ships are in a formation that they willconform to the slowwest ship's speed which makes me think that this will soon be resolved but for now(7/3/15) it is still a problem for me.Pros-Pretty much everything else that the game involves. the combat is well scaled and balanced for the size and scale of the map. Different kinds of ship classes and research trees throughout a game make it very fun and gave me a good three hours of gameplay when I first sat down which is a very good thing with someone as busy as I. The gameplay is slow paced which makes me believe tat we wont be seeing a competitive league for Homeworld but thats not a problem. Final Verdict-The game is very fun and will provide you with hours and hours of entertainment for the lovers of RTS games. The learning curve is kind of steep but at the same time very refreshing compared to games that hold your hand the whole way through. There are some small problems with squadron attack formation but otherwise a very polished and and smooth game that people of all ages can enjoy.			"

												A solid remake of 2 of the PC gaming world's first blockbusters. Half a million copies in 1999 was HUGE. This game is a masterpiece. And Gearbox improved on it (with a lot of the team from the original game hired on to do the remake) with a better UI, more balanced units for a better PVE experience. They expanded on the cinematics, voices, artwork. When I was a boy this game was magical. As an adult this remaster so far has been just as magical. I can hope for cataclysm as a future DLC.			"

												Buy it on sale only. Why? I love homeworld, i did the first time around. But this is not that game. Homeworld 1 RM is rebuilt in the old homeworld 2 engine, polished up. Anyone who recalls the gutting homwqorld 2 took will recall the complete change in gameplay. Home world 1`s campaign in the 2 engine is horrible and has to be modded to be more like it should be to make several missions make sense. But but but ... ignore the fan boys at this point, as look at missions 3 and 11. If you do really well in mission 1 and 2 and start mission 3 with anything resembling a fleet... you loose the mission due to homeworld 1s scaling enemys fleets in the first 30 seconds. By mission 9s end you should have a decent fleet. Mission 10 willl punish this until you figure it out. Either way youll start mission 11 with a decent or full+ fleet. Only to be met with scaled enemies ending the mission in 30 seconds again. Both times the annihilate a mission objective before you can bring anything to the incidents. Home world 1 RM is gutted to play like homeworld 2 RM. As above the scaling fleets.. original HW had scaling yes but not as horrific as HW2. Also HW 1 (original) you could opt for a strategy that met the storyline of survival and rebuilding by cappturing almost every enemy ship with your own secialised ships. Now theyve been limited to 14 and that strategy is out the window. As its a chore to do it and if you do it well and get your huge fleet, the scaling enemy will annihilate you. HW2 RM .. gutted the already original capped ships even more. Most vets didnt like the changes to game play. The ♥♥♥♥♥ily re implimented movers we never noticed reskinned from HW1 ... the 4 marine ships which were and are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... No cataclism cos they cant find the original code ... Stupid lazy fks could have ripped the game code from any disk and rebuilt it on the 2 engine, but no. Even though they have the rights and license no.. They need the source code. (yeah that thing hundreds of people across the world got given thats still out there..) Is the game fun. Yes. IS it enjoyable with thte issues of remastering, yeah, if you mod and buy it cheap, its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Dont listen to anyone saying it adds chalenge, they dont understand whats been lost in translation from 1 and 2 onto 2s remastered engine. Buy it, but cheap. Its great fun. Mod it to old style game specs and its the best game youll ever play in its genre. Bonus it comes, usually, with original 2 games to compare to. So anyone buying it is getting 4 games. IF you can get it under a tenner on a bundle or dale, its a no brainer. Games brill, devs need a kick up the bum. But least they brought it back into the light of day. Even if they did sodomise it a bit on the way.			"

If you've played this back a decade ago, you must surely know how awesome it feels, the music, the atmosphere, the memories coming back and suddenly you realise the fleet is in your hands again, they look AWESOME ( graphics can't be better), and it just makes me feel pumped but forces me to keep my head cool because its a strategy game again.

												Honestly I can't say anything about the campains of thomeworld remastered I have just been doing multiplayer or skirms vs AI.  I have read some of the negative reviews and they are not true.  I put my fighters in formations, and can choose what stance they use.  Mixing homeworld 1 and 2 races is an awesome idea.  Both sides have their ups and downs.  I have played a HWI race the taiidan in multiplayer and whomped some serious♥♥♥♥♥  I also played the vaygr.  I stay away from the goodie two-show hiigarans and kushan.  That being said the multiplayer is quite unstable.  People drop for no reason.  I can only assume the server is jacked up.  When the games do get off the ground it is really fun.  I played a ffa match with 6 players that almost lasted 2 hours.  This game kicks most modern-day games asses.  It was good 15 years ago and it is even better now.  Their is a bit of a learning curve though as each race is quite different.  So just practice them all against the computer, see whitch one or more is right for you.  then have a blast.			"

												Great game back in 1999 and 2004 and now looks even better! Tons of fun to be had with this game.Having that been said there are a few issues I think need to be said for those who played both games back when they originally came out. First off, the tactics that were replaced in HW1 kinda kill some of the gameplay. Fighters and ships dont hold formation when attacking as they did in the original game. As soon as they engage on an enemy they all just seem to fly around all willy nilly, fighters especially. Second, the game glitched and gave me way too many resources on the third mission in and made the rest of the game too easy after that. I didn't have to plan attacks or harvest wrecks to scrape up precious resouces. Nope, just build wrecklessly and send constant waves at the enemy. The biggest let down, in my opinion, is once I beat the game I was not rewarded with that sweet jam by YES. Seriously, that made me sad not to hear that. Honestly, nothing could take us far enough, emotion, far enough... You get the picture. But despite all of that, It's still a great game that everyone that loves RTS and space operas should enjoy. It's still fun to play to this day.			"

												Fairly good space rts for the price, nice visuals overall and a 3 dimensional combat system. The only downside is i usually find i have too limited of resources to go all out at times. But that does make it an actual challenge for those of you who know what tham means in a strategy game. spam = fail. Overthought out maticulously executed plans = win, maybe. NOTE for those who have not played before capturing during campaign is extremely helpfull.			"

Posted: March 12, 2015
												I see a few reviews about this game being buggy, and apparently I lucked out. The only bug I encountered was one that caused graphocs to appear transparent if I had something that could overlay my game screen running alongside - in my case it was Trillian, my chat client.I guess I got lucky and didn't encounter any bugs other than that, save two random crashes during HW1 campaign, and they were both within moments of a save, so I wasn't even that mad.As to an actual review, well, let's get started.Graphics: Okay, so it's a remaster. The original game was pretty, and this is essentially the HD remake of it. Of course it's pretty. It's VERY pretty.  Not only is it very pretty, it's also not that system-heavy. My box is comfortably mid-range with a decent GPU, and I can run things pretty much full tilt with no frame drops or hiccups of any kind on an intel/NVIDIA setup. Space is beautiful, and I don't mind sometimes losing a couple of ships for idly spinning the camera around and admiring the view. Ship detail is excellent, and the combat scarring is a nice touch, though I'm rarely zoomed in enough to truly admire it. Sound: Faithfully reproduced sounds and bringing back the original voice actress for Karan S'Jet from HW1 to reprise her role for the HW2 campaign both made me happy in special places. The sound of ion cannons blaring away at a target, my collectors telling me to expect delays, the pilots calling out a little too calmly/matter-of-factly that there's a breach in the starboard fusion chamber, or just that awesome warble of entering/exiting hyperspace... Ah, the memories that came rushing back. Sound is excellent, crisp, and nothing is too repetitive unless you're like me and reload saves a bunch of times if things go a little too far south/you secretly suck at video games like I do.UI: Yes, the UI is getting it's own section here. Wonderfully redesigned based on HW2, however my biggest grips with the game is also here. Considering it's a startegy game, you will spend a considerable amount of time interacting with menus. These menus are all tucked nicely to one side of the screen, and stay until dismissed. Which means for me, they pretty much just stay there. And that's fine, because they aren't obtrusive in any way. Except that the selected ship list is too small at scale 1. Yes, you can scale the UI in game. A very nice touch. Except that, even at 1080p (since my monitor goes no higher) anything above 1 makes other parts of the UI waaay too big. I really don't need the menu button in the top left of my screen to take up a THIRD of my real estate. And that's at scale 3! Fortunately, there's a mod on the workshop right now that remedies this issue, but having to pause the sampaign to change my UI scale so I could properly select a ship just to pause again to scale back down so I can see things got annoying. If you're running at 1080, I suggest you download the UI resize mod.Gameplay: Ah, the meat of the review. The gameplay is solid. Super solid. Like, really effing good. So you know how most RTS games give you units and you move them around on the ground? And you know how even in most space RTS games, you're still given a 2D plane? As if you were still dealing with the ground? Well not here. You have a full 360 degrees to move your ships through. That's three axes. That's forward/back, left/right, UP/DOWN. There's really little practical use for it in a tactical sense, since your sensors also cover 360 dgerees, and the direction of an attack won't matter so much as everything has the same freedom of movement, but it does allow for some very good strategic moves. For example, I played a friend who had never played homeworld before. His first game ever was versus me. I took it easy on a seasoned RTS veteran. I was only half surprised, then, when he showed up at my mothership with the fleet I SHOULD have had at that moment. I then grinned as my hyperspace module finished construction. I jumped to a nowhere bottom corner of the map and survived on mobile refineries and a carrier while building my fleet in secret, jumping to another random corner any time his scouts got near. By the time he managed to find me with probes, I had amassed enough of a fleet to jump eveything I had, including my mothership, directly in the engines of his mothership. His fault for not building a gravity well generator. His fleet, which had moved to engage mine where it was being staged, didn't return in time to save him. The gameplay isn't all awesome, though. As others have pointed out, there are issues that are irritating to old fans like myself. Ship stances - aggressive, defensive, and passive tactics - used to divert power to weapons, engines, or keep it balanced, respectively. This made ships behave very differently. With aggressive tactics, nobody really flew around much back in the day. They just parked at optimal firing range and unloaded. This was a great way to take out isolated capital ships. Sphere up on a target and go aggressive. Reinforcements arrive? Fighter screen and defensive, watch your fleet suddenly scatter, cap ships line up and start orbiting, and fighters swarm incessantly. No longer. Now it is simply a visual difference in how the HW2 squads fly in their individual formations - which used to be a visual clue for what tactics fighters/corvettes were using. Also, group/fleet formations, as mentioned by others also fall apart in combat. The moment anybody is in weapons range, the formation is over. Every man for himself. Tactics don't change anything, and the only thing the formation changes is who gets to shoot first. After that, it just becomes a really pretty furball.Targeting subsystems used to be hugely important. I can't tell you how many ships I saved because I sent bombers after the missile batteries/ion cannons on BCs as soon as I could. Gave my cap ships a fighting chance, and made me feel like a badass commander. Now it's basically  ""1-A"" (Select your ball of death with 1, press A to attack) game for victory with a few exceptions - mostly the last couple of missions/moments where you need to do something specific for victory that isn't ""Kill everything that isn't yours.""Even with these issues, I would still pay $35 for this game. AAA games today don't grab me quite like Homeworld did. When the original launched, I put many hundreds of hours in to it. Ditto the sequel. I also know the modding community is very strong, and the developers are actually working WITH the mod community to make sure the game can do things THEY expect it to do. And considering there are mods like Complex, which makes things like weapon placement and individualk ship placement/positioning REALLY matter, not to mention adding so many new ships that it may as well be a different game... Yeah, this game is worth the price of admission. And it's technically 4 games, considering you're getting the original HW1&2 as part of the deal, though playing those is pretty painful by comparison. There's a reason I mentioned the overhauled UI, and the original IS 15 years old. Pretty for 15, but still definitely outdated.Nutshell: If you want the hands down best 3D space RTS you will play this year and likely ever, look no further. Story, graphics, gameplay are all excellent, a lively and talented modding scene, and just a damn good experience. If you want my advice, buy the game, smoke some pot, dim the lights, turn up the volume, and go on a journey across the Galaxy like nothing you've experienced yet.			"

												Well 16 hours through and campaign complete.Admittedly without formations things were a little more difficult, but not so much that it's unpassable (I just passed it!)  I played the original when it came out, and pre-ordered here. I can't say that without these features that this game isn't HomeWorld.  The story, the voice acting, the music, the gameplay, it's still all top notch.   This is what really made Homeworld.  So I have to naysay the naysayers.   You still get the originals if you need to be that purist.  Maybe they'll patch it, but the game was very releasable at the point it is today.  It's still a fun game that can invoke emotion in you.For folks who have never played...Homeworld was created during a time 3D on a computer was still in its infancy.  There was a lot of games made at the time that were duds, and a few greats like Homeworld.    The game did well enough to warrant 2 sequels and a port to Mac.  You play the part of a exiled race who discovers warp technology.  As soon as you fire up your engines, those that exiled you come and destroy the only home you had, the desert world they left you stranded on 4000 years earlier.   As the fleet, you are responsible for the last remaining survivors of your planet.  There is no turning back.As you progress through the game, you research new ships, each with unique abilities.  Levels are laid out in a way where you have to put every newly learned ability to use, almost like a Puzzle.If you've ever watched The Angry Video Game Nerd talk about how perfect Mega Man X is for teaching you how to play, through gameplay, Homeworlds puzzles are a bit like that.One peice of advice I can give... Save.. Save often.  It sucks to have spent an hour trying to get through a level, only to die right before the end. "

												As I write this review Ive at this point only played though HW1 remastered. As well as a skirmish or two versus the AI.So let's focus on what's good first.First off, it looks AMAZING. I can't possibly say that enough. They also did some minor tweaks to the campaign to make things interesting, I wont say what. No spoilers. Other than that, everything you loved about the original is either in place an still their to love, or improved and modernized. So you can expect a good experience if you pony up the bucks to re-live the game. There are however a few bugs...Which is what I'll get on to. I know, a release version game with bugs that need patched. Shocking. Well I say get over it. What can you expect with the publishers we have strangling the PC game industry? As far as the bugs, Capital movement and formation making needs a do-over. It's managable, but needs work. For instance, capitals at times in formation will go full retard and stop if a an obstruction is in their path like say, an asteroid. There's also some rendering issues in regards to dust clouds. This was escpecially bad on one mission, but there are workarounds and again, these things typically go to the top of the bug squashing list so i dont expect it to be there the next time I feel like giving the campaign a whirl.Other than that I noticed no other major bugs. The game plays great, if greater than the original. I'm glad to have spent the money on it.			"

												It feels strange to be putting this up as a good thing, but they've barely changed a thing on this remastering, which is perfect.What the have updated, primarily the textures and lighting, looks so good, it's hard to put into words.If you loved Homeworld, before, there's been no better time (or way) for a revisit. Get. on. this.			"

												There are some bad reviews of this game out there, but I feel as though they were written by the ultimate hardcore ""space simulator"" crowd. These games were indeed groundbreaking in their time, and as such, should be given some breathing room. Yes they changed the combat tactics, yes they merged the versions, but you should be happy that someone managed to bring back such an epic game series. I, for one, have enjoyed every minute!			"

												Its Homeworld. Nuff said really......but if you dont want more, its all been hauled up to date graphically and the soul of the games are there. Is it any good though? well I have 100%ed it, which is pretty rare in my steam library. Homeworld 1 is still better than Homeworld 2 mainly because the story goes a bit iffy in 2, not to mention the very elastic autobalance. Homeworld 1 is pretty buggy in this incarnation though;Fighter craft are a complete waste of space due to the fact its been done in the Homeworld 2 engine where they need squadrons to be effective and the biggest issue of all is that formations just dont work. Ships line up prettily until given any order than they start clumping up like a bunch of 5 year olds playing football)If you can get past those problems (and its certainly not hard to do so - just requires a little tactics adjustment)One last thing - dont spend forever capturing everything you can in Homeworld 1. Once you get bigger capital ships you soon realise that in this remake since all of the damage has been upped frigates are made of paper and die before they get into range of a battlecruiser, so really its just a waste of your time, no matter how appealing that massive ball of ion frigates looks on THAT one level. You know what I'm talking about homeworld players...			"

												Homeworld is my all time favorite game. I couldn't wait when I heard it had a new life. The remastered version is excellent and worthy of a purchase. It needs some polish, that the first patch has already gone a long way towards seeing out. The only major gripe I have is the complete lack of the formation feature from HW1. Strike craft do not operate as they should, and act like they do in HW2 which is the engine Remastered is built from. All other aspects are top notch. Mod support, amazing graphics, staying true to the tone, sound and look of the originals. I really hope this is a new start for the Homeworld universe.			"

												It's  difficult to recommend or not not recommend this game. I did play both Homeworld games, and i think that HW2 lost something of what made HW1 great : tactics, formations, and most importantly 3d manouering. If you played HW1 you probably noticed that in HW2 ships manouver only on a 2d plane first, and when moving vertically they stay aligned to the horizontal plane, while in HW1 they actually turn towards their destination (e.g. if they move up, they move nose up) and hw2 they only turn in one plane, and move up or down without changing their orientation (they stay parallel to a virtual ground). In other words, its not really 3D anymore.   Also, formations next to useless : they dont fight in formations. Annoyance is that ships has a tendency just do whatever they want - like you are capturing a ship they will quite happily shoot it into pieces despite giving them the stand down order.On the other hand, there is a lot of eye candy. If you preferred the simplified HW2 over HW1, this is a game for you.  I wanted to say I dont recommend, but this is still not a bad game to play and i can't say i did regret the purchase. I wish they would remastered HW1 instead of HW2 as the main game. But have the classics to play :)			"

												This...This I've been hungering for since it was announced that Gearbox bought the rights.  Homeworld 1, 2 and Cataclysm (sadly not available) are some of the RTS games that I loved the most.  Gearbox did not disappoint.  The originals are here along with the upgraded versions, which bring the graphics up to modern standards.  Remember how amazing the graphics were in '99?  You'll feel the same about the remastered versions now.  They are fantastic.  The level of detail can be increased enough to send many modern, if not top of the line, graphics adapters into a stutter.  The gameplay is fun and exciting.Granted that many RTS games now have multiple resource types and Homework only has one, but the focus is not on resource production.  The focus is on  building a fleet comprised of ships that will match the fleet that opposes you.  I have literally seen a fleet of destroyers picked apart by bombers and gunships.  I have thrown a handful of destroyers against a group of 15-ish frigates and handed their♥♥♥♥♥to them on a platter.  This game is all about knowing which ships to produce to come out on top.Not enough can be said of the thoughtfulness and caring that went into the restoration of the original games.  The audio briefings has been cleaned up a to a large degree and sounds much better than the originals.  The graphics in the mission briefings are also improved, showing more detail.If RTS is the genre you love and you haven't played Homeworld you need to give it a try.  If you have any nostalgic memories of it at all then you need to get it again.  And if possible, find yourself a USB powered mothership statue.  I did, and I love it.			"

If you've played this back a decade ago, you must surely know how awesome it feels, the music, the atmosphere, the memories coming back and suddenly you realise the fleet is in your hands again, they look AWESOME ( graphics can't be better), and it just makes me feel pumped but forces me to keep my head cool because its a strategy game again. Simply, LOVE THIS REMASTERED GAME. THANK YOU DEVELOPERS.10/10 will play again.			"

												A longtime Mac user, I've wanted to play the Homeworld series for years, but I also wanted to start with the original. With the release of Homeworld: Remastered on SteamPlay, I had an opportunity to experience the story from the beginning; an opportunity I seized upon. But even with updated graphics, the original has NOT aged well. I didn't encounter any of the bugs that others have complained about, but the game is sorely missing a modern feature of any major RTS: speed control. Jump in, analyze the objectives, formulate a response... and then wait 20 minutes while your ships move around the map. Messed up the strategy? Wait another 20 minutes while your next battle group traverses the map. Really messed up? Start the mission from scratch.While speed control was apparently added in Homeworld 2, playing the original without it is nothing less than a painful waste of time. What's more, the game sorely needs some light in-game training on how best to deploy new ships and technologies, things which instead are thrown at you with only minimal explanation as to their use. I wanted to enjoy Homeworld very badly, but the shortcomings of the original have made that impossible. The amount of time the game eats up also meant I was well-past the 2 hours of gameplay refund-cutoff by the time I realized I couldn't play it anymore.			"

												In the infinite majesty of space, cruelty and beauty can be found in equal measure. A race brought to the very brink of destruction through the violation of a treaty signed millenia ago, left marooned in space clinging to a technology salvaged from ancient ancestors and a single guiding star. Home.This sets the stage for one of the greatest space strategy games of all time, Homeworld. A game that has rarely been aspired to since, and a game filled with ideas that even to this day are rarely even touched upon. Only now a few daring indie developers dare brave the complexities that represent true three dimensional space combat and even then they have yet to come even close to what Homeworld achieved. It was lightning in a bottle, a cult classic synthesised from a pace that was stately enough to appreciate the sheer majesty that the game inspired with its' sweeping scale, a soundtrack that was borne of classical tones and distant melancholy, and a story that took you on a true campaign, where your units would carry over from mission to mission, along with your resource pool. These are all concepts that in most current campaigns are oft ignored, set aside for flashy Michael Bay style set pieces and much shallower, more simplistic stories. Homeworld told stories of shades of grey, of culture, of alien races with diverse backgrounds and lore, of imperialism, of a nebula home to a technologically advanced enclave that sought refuge and peace within the sanctity of drifting ghostlike threads.Homeworld Remastered is a restoration of that premise, Gearbox have carefully and considerately taken the Homeworld 2 interface (the better one) and the source assets, placed them in a more modern, more capable and more mod friendly engine, and then carefully brought the game up to current generation standards, with lighting, depth of field, better framerates, higher resolutions, better texturing, cleaned up the sound work, the whole lot. The result quite literally is Homeworld as viewed through the ""rose tinted glasses of memory"", it's how we always imagined it was in our heads, even if our then much less meaty PC's couldn't QUITE give us the experience that we wished for.The change is stark when placed side by side, it's hard to imagine when you fire up remastered thinking that the ships -didn't- look that impressive before, but when you play the original you then are reminded with a shock that yes, they were kinda blocky and yes, the textures were kinda flat back in the day. That's all gone now, the ships really -do- look like their concept art, they really do move with the kind of majesty and detail that we all imagined they did, the mothership is just crammed with detail, and everywhere you look, there's something that just looks *better* than it did before. The sound too, is crisper, with all the sound assets being cleaned up and provided at a higher fidelity, with the music being remastered at a higher bitrate, again, no changes that alter the fabric of the game, but a subtle re-weaving that change the feel into the game we always remembered it as.You do get a lot of game for your money too, for the asking cost you'll get both Homeworld 1 and 2 remastered, along with their original source games in case you feel like a trip down nostalgia lane and want to do some side by side comparisons (I suggest you do), you also get the multiplayer which brings all four factions into multiplayer together, which is sure to open up some interesting games once they get the code all sorted out and out of ""beta"" (for whatever that term means these days), and you'll get what is quite easily still the greatest space opera strategy ever to grace the PC.Gearbox did good. Everyone was holding their breath because I could imagine the kind of fury that would have been issued forth had they scuffed this, but no. They did good, this has made me a happy tiger, Homeworld is a game that deserved to be brought back, it deserved this remastering, and what you get is quite comfortably the ""definitive"" version of Homeworld. Prepare for a journey unlike any you'll find, this one truly is something special.			"

												Gearbox has (re)created a beautiful-looking space strategy game that will impress those new to the series but leave oldschool Homeworld fans bitterly dissapointed. If you're looking for some fun multiplayer action you'll love this game but if you want to revisit the classic Homeworld campaign I cannot recommend it unless there's a serious effort by the devs to address the many problems in the launch version. Read below for detailed comments.THE GOOD:- Absolutely gorgeous graphics. Everything looks very nice and with some minor tweaking plays smoothly even on my     not-so-good laptop.- The original artstyle in the cinematics has been faithfully recreated and, again, it all looks very nice.- Excellent, engaging story in HW1:R, same as the 1999 classic.- Good voice acting and music bring the experience to life.- Multiplayer is, despite some balance issues between the HW1 and HW2 races, simply a blast to play.THE BAD:- The game uses a modified HW2 engine which does not seem to work very well with the HW1 campaign/units. I'm not sure how many of the problems listed below are due to engine limitations and how many can be patched in, if someone more knowlegeable about HW modding can chip in on this I'll edit the review accordingly.- Strike craft formations/tactics simply do not work for the HW1 units. Strike craft will assume a formation when ordered to but after combat is joined they will attack seemingly random targets on their own flight paths regardless of tactics settings used, making concentrating fire to specific targets impossible and leading to a lot of losses.- The HW1 remastered campaign in general lacks polish. Missing/bugged mission triggers, wonky AI behaviour (resource collectors in particular will randomly stop harvesting after dropping off their loads), ship engine sound effects persisting after zooming in and then out on some units, sensor manager sometimes just deciding to stop working altogether, repair corvettes apparently not working at all and simply atrocious difficulty scaling.  Expect to reload a lot to get through some missions.- The dynamic difficulty scaling seems way out of whack for the campaign. The HW1 campaign now uses the (almost universally despised) dynamic difficulty scaling system originally introduced by HW2. In a nutshell, the enemies you'll face are generated depending on your fleet composition at the start of a mission. Some people like this idea, some don't. Regardless of how one feels about it, the system clearly has not been playtested enough as the seeming lack of hard caps on enemy numbers will lead to some unwinnable fights for players who like to build up their fleet. For example, capturing a good number of enemy corvettes in mission 2 will cause an overwhelming number of enemies to spawn in the following mission, leading to a game over before the introductory cutscenes are even finished.CONCLUSION: I'm really torn on this but I'll have to go with a no recommendation until the flawed port of the HW1 campaign and strike craft mechanics are addressed. If you're a returning HW1 veteran definately hold off on this until the game is (hopefully) patched and/or modded to make the experience closer to the original. On the other hand those new to the series will no doubt appreciate the engaging story of the campaign. The fun multiplayer can also help a lot so consider what you want of the game and take this review as it is. "

												I bought it to play the remastered version of homeworld 1. They managed to make formations completely useless as ships immediately break from them for any reason. The diamond shoals mission is the most frustrating and obnoxious mess. Half of the time frigates simply wont fire at the target and the other half they feel the need to move into point blank range and immediately get rammed by an astroid. I get that the graphics are pretty but what is the point if you remove features that set the game apart?			"

												THERE A LOT OF BUGS that where patched in the classic game back then  but not here...1)your own fleet kills every ship you try to capture!!!!.. once the capture ships dock the enemy weapons are down ..... but your whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fleet keeps firing on i till it enters the mothership... blowing up most of them just before the finish line...2)THE SPHERE FORMATION ISNT WORKING .....back in classic you had the sphere formation for shield units and for defense of big ships..but on mission 4 or 5 you get the defensive korvet/frigat?trying to set them around the battleships for defense against bombers and so on doesnt work...they bump up behind the ship they should defend in loose formationtryed with every ship ... vario korvets.. scouts interceptors and i can say THE FORMATION DOESNT WORK !!!3)caping the carrier in the mission where ya kill the fleet that bombed your planet..with enough micro manage to clear the way back of your own units so it doesnt get blown to bits on its way to the mothership.....it spawns enemy scout and fighters AFTER CAPTURE !!!!! they take formation in your fleet but have red icons and you cant command them...4)YOU CANT BUILD SHIPS ON THE CARRIER			"

												This a pending review, the remastered homeworld 1 is a mess, so many bugs, I am at a loss where to start!! 1. The dust clouds in the Supernova station mission are invisible. Good luck finding a path that will lead you to victory.2. Captured Taidan Carriers are unable to build anything making them pretty much mostly useless3. Some caputred ships change colour, some don't, it's a toss up4. Formations do nothing5. Game triggers do not trigger properly(supernova station mission again: I destroyed everything and it just failed to end the mission, I just have to stand there sizzling in the sunshine)6. They removed the fuel from fighters7. Some missions just spawn random stuff, in random numbers, (example: cathedral of Kadesh in the entire mission, only 4 multibeam frigates spawn, I tried reloading the mission but nope, the number actually went DOWN)8. Repair ships sometimes heal, sometimes don't. The AI for frigates is especially horrid...etc. etc.The list goes on and on. I will change my reccomendation to a yes if these bugs are fixed. But until then? Yeah...not worth your time or money.			"

												Well I enjoyed playing the original versions of this game *******************. To all who may be looking to purchase this Remastered collection be warned, if youre running an intel card anything less then the hd 4000 this game WILL NOT WORK, all they mentioned was to update because they used opengl 3.3. However they failed to mention that it is virtually impossible to run 3.3 on anything less then the intel hd 4000 graphics card. You can update and root and do anything you please but it will never work. Thank you for the lack of information Steam and Gearbox, can you say REFUND!Its unfortunate that i have a quad core i3 and 16gb of ram, but because of gl 3.3 i bascially have nothing			"

Was difficult to get it to work in the first place kept saying ""Stlll encryted"" as i had preordered it, and when i finally got that bit fixed i get really exciting and think YYYYAAAA but no. When i load either skirmish or campaign for the newly remastarered, what can i see? space, back round, nebulas eta but one main yet important fact. THE DAMN MOTHERSHIP or any other ship. i can select and see the engine trail but cant actually see what am clicking on.

												Well... As it stands right now they made HW2 okay but completely ruined HW1 in every way shape and form. Formations in the REAL Homeworld don't work properly, they don't stay in proper formation. Capital ships can't maneuver worth beans, Destroyers are no longer the ultimate utility ship of the fleet anymore. They were designed in HW1 to keep pace with and LEAD the frigate lines. Now they're slow, lumbering beasts that just♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Frigates are now made of wet paper bags and fighters are slow and unmaneuverable, meaning point defenses and even heavier weapons could destroy them. Corvettes are now pointless to build. Basically you just build fighters bombers and super-capitals only and they are all that is worth building.The GUI is NOTHING like the original Homeworld which let you have a very clean experience which didn't block anything out. If you didn't need to see the GUI at that moment, it wasn't there. One of the things that made Homeworld loveable was that it assumed you were intelligent.Singleplayer's adaptive difficulty from HW1 is now gone from what I can tell and it is pathetically easy for an experienced HW Vet. I had little trouble in the first few missions, which was dissappointing to say the least.Fuel consumption no longer exists for fighters which means that when I eventually reach the Garden of Kadesh I can expect to be utterly massacred by the Kadeshi. This makes the Support Frigate a useless item. Honestly, why have them anymore at all?! The whole ballance is gone by removing fuel consumption, barring the other things they've utterly mucked up.I'm happy that they thought it worth the effort to do a remastered edition but they sacrificed the original Homeworld ENTIRELY in order to satisfy the Homeworld 2 players. The thing is... There is a LOT more Homeworld 1 fans that stayed true and bought this than there were Homeworld 2 fans (at least if my group of friends is any indication).Gearbox... Hear us! Fix your rather glaring mistakes! Homeworld 1 should have been the priority... Especially since THAT is the one that won Game of the Year in 1999. And lets be honest... It had some pretty TALL competition back then for that title. It didn't just win Strategy Game of the Year, it won overall Game of the Year.... Frankly I want a refund because this wasn't true to the Homeworld legacy at all... As far as I am concerned the basic models for the ships are the same and then cut-scenes are the same. The rest is garbage. "

												As a big fan of the original Homeworld titles (HW, HW:C, HW2) I felt compelled to write my own review of the ""Remastered"" collection. If you're looking to spend money through Steam to buy these titles, I encourage you not to. The ""Remastered"" HW is a huge disappointment, plagued with a sense of ""Beta."" I have the original HW and HW2 disc software and Win 10 on my PC's, and they have no issues running in compatibility. The Remastered collections crashes, freezes, and is plagued with bugs (as of 1/10/2017). The Remastered collection, I will admit has smoother renderings and neat eye candy. Unfortunately, being built on a broken HW2 platform, which IMO was not an improvement over the original HW, is even worse since the RM version is a severely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized HW2 platform, hence broken. All in all, if you really want to play HW & HW2, I recommend picking up the original software disc's (amazon, ebay, ect.,) and don't waste your money as I have. I wish I could get a refund.			"

												Awesome game, Played the original to death back in the day. When I could finally get my hands on the remastered version I was happy as a kid in a candy store.My problem with the remastered version is how the fighter class unit have now become so weak! I remember flying in with an armada of fighters and dealing serious damage, now they are mere cannon fodder drawing fire away from my capital class ships. also I was a heavy user of the different formations for my fighters, now the formations just slow mt fighters down more and make them even more vulnerable. also missing military parade formation, but that was mostly for my OCD tendencies. lol			"

												Gearbox virtually screwed the game.It is not a good quality of Remaster. Differences in campaign, unit physics and mechanics makes it a much worse game that an ancient original.Original units had much more important parameters than current ones. Physics, formations, everything that was a pure goodnes and greateness of the original is gone. This have to be fixed before game would be ever suggested.Particle physics of bullets in HW1 is missing. Salvage Corvettes and Repair Corvettes are much weaker than in vanilla HW. Formations not working correctly - unit tactics also. It is much different than original one - not efficient.Probes do not spin. Research ship's are kinda bugged, bombers vs frigates does not work as intended. Graphics is good - but that game was awesome not because of graphics - but brilliant physics.HW1 Campaign is bugged like a hell and it should take next few months to fix it.HW1 Classic  Graphics introduced 30fps lock. I have to bring old CD to check this.HW2 part for me is uninteresting.			"

												I am hugely disappointed with this game. Gearbox DOES NOT ADVERTISE that they took HW1 and stuck it in the castly inferior HW2 engine. This results in a number of glitches and inferior results during play, including formations and tactics that are meaningless, resourcers that quit gathering while there's still resources on the map, and AI fleet numbers that are ferequently ridiculous. I quit on the 8th mission, since the HW2 enemy force calculator saw fit to add an insanely unbeatable number of AI ships to that mission, making it impossible to finish.If you're a huge fan of HW1 like I am, don't buy this. It's a massive disappointment.			"

 Gearbox speculated on the Originals fanbase to drive the Hypetrain...when they decided to actually charge  32€  for this.Someone in the forum once wrote: ""Ten years ago, this would have been called ""HD-mod"" and it would have been free. Today its called ""Remastered"" and costs 32 bucks"" Oh BTW, look at this gem:


YouTube™ Video: Problems with formations and tactics in Homeworld 1 Remastered 

			Views: 8,615		



According to veterans of the original games, this reduces combat efficience of your vessels drastically. Which is fun in general, but this game also got ""dynamic difficulty"" or as i call it ""Hurl so much s*hit at ya winning is almost impossible""-tactic.While its almost nonexistent in HW 1 RE (i was invincible after boarding my first battleship), HW 2 RE just loves to kick you in the groin.First you´ll learn that boarding changes from HW1 to HW2, instead of small salvage-corvettes you now have much bigger Marine-Frigates, which are weak as s*ht.As soon as they´re spotted, EVERYONE goes for them. Doesnt matter at all how many ships you use as decoys. So when you actually manage to cap a big enemy, youll be proud. ""Wow, i capped a big ship, now my fleet´s awesome! Man that feels good!""  you´ll say. And then you reach the next mission. And then the game goes  ""Whats that?! A big ship and YOU control it ?!?! PREPARE THE ARMADA!!! GET DAT MUDDAFOCKA!!!!!"" Then you´ll end up getting destroyed. You load the last mission, scrap your fleet down to the basics and thus artificially cheat the difficulty down. Conclusion:  32€, no. Just no. Not for 32 Euros!			"

												In terms of gameplay and a space rts, this game beats basically all in my opinion.  The combat system is very balanced, and the game is very enjoyable.  It does not get repetitive in terms of the campaign, and even if you beat the campagn and are bored with multiplayer and friends the steam mods are insane and fun.  However, the support page and forums are a joke in terms of helping to find/fix a bux.  My launcher stopped working for who knows why, and after looking for 3 months without an answer I sadly rate this game negatively.  The game won't launch and every time I go to look for an answer I get someone ranting about updating their video drives that are probably older then me rather then finding an answer.			"

												Great space opera RTS, graphics are pretty to look at and hold up to 2015 standards, Gearbox has done a great job overhauling the game. the story is compelling, the audio is top notch, has multiplayer for some PvP action tho i haven't played much as i'm more of a singleplayer person.Would definately recommend this to Homeworld fans and Space RTS fans in general.

												This game is fantastic! Taking me back to playing it day one back in 1999. However i will say this, the learning curve for HW1 remasterd is far less then what was required back in 1999 (the jump from mission to mission early on was much harder and faster hitting in the enemy) i feel it does lack alot of its depth with the removal of fuel. (had to actualy load up my old HW1 on my old system to see the differences) The game is still fantastic and looks great, UI is different which took some getting use to but easily jump back into and play. I will forever miss the how difficult this game was in 1999 for single player and how many hours it took to advance through the first 5 missions.*EDIT*so after playing hours in this game i have come to realise that Homeworld Remastered is a huge let down. The stratigy requirements of the first Homeworld where amazing and required so much more work and thought to use formations and flight tactics. Plus the physics engine/bullets are completely different now, it is using an RNG so shooting and moving is irrelavent. Very sad to see HW1 ported into HW2. HW2 was a step back, still enjoyable but nothing compared to its big brother.Yes the lack of fuel is a bumer but no game changer. I had orginally recommended this game, now i have changed my mind because its not Homeworld it use to be. Still a fun game but its no homeworld. Very disappointing to see Homeworld redone this way. I have not played homeworld 2 remastered yet,not really feeling it right now because of the changes with Homeworld and all the bugs in the game it a huge let down. So if you play this enjoy all the bugs to include huge game changer bugs (skipping cut scences and screwing up the spawn so you never have to fight any enemy or just a couple ships but not the endless onslaught it should have been) also the combat is totaly different and far easyer, however that being said always keep your salvage corvettes on hand! free ships! (oh whats with the AI not shooting salvage corvettes or harvesters? i remember the AI destroying them when they showed up now.) all in all, Homeworld is a fantastic game, Homeworld Remastered is a mediocre remake of one of the worlds best games.

												It's Homeworld 1 and 2 with allot of new paint (especially the former) so I will just state the good bits and bad (mostly linked to HW1). Good bits:Salvage vettes work just as well as they always have... possibly a bit too well(I nicked every single corvette the Turanic Raiders threw at me... if the Standard Corvettes could salvage, neither they nor the missile vettes can use their special abilities, I'd be set for life but as is I gotta keep a 12-16 strong wing of ""nice ship you have there...shame if someone were to.... enlighten you of it"".Even on medium settings the game looks magnificent, both cutscenes and regular play, and the gameplay of Homeworld 1 is fully intact.Not much else to say, it does everything right almost.Nitpicks: 1. My biggest problem with Remastered is that in Homeworld 1 you can no longer choose to play as either Kushan or Taiidani nor can you alter the paint scheme. The former can be excused, with ample applications of salvette, but the latter is a bit aggravating as a veteran of the original.2. The cutscenes, both between missions and in-game, in Homeworld 1 seem a bit faster than the original versions... it's nitpicky but it kind of feels off to me slightly.3. The streamlining of Homeworld 1 in terms of screens (no more separate build or research screeen from the normal one) though welcomed in certain regards also makes it a bit painful to macromanage everything. In the original the gameplay would pause when you were in the other two screens ergo it is a bit missed somewhat. "

												I never write reviews, but this game is basically the second coming for us homeworld crazies. You can read all about the flaws and highlights of this game in other reviews, but I have an odd reccomendation. Unlike most other games, I actually feel like people who are completely new to the series will like this better. To a homeworld fanatic like me, there are little differences that are really jarring, but as a whole, the game is satisfying and enjoyable even in it's current state. If the new devs take some feedback and make a couple of tweaks, this will go down as a worthy remaster of the best RTS of all time.			"

												Unfortunately this one simply does not live up to the hype. I am an old Homeworld player, and have invested hundreds of hours in all three original releases. So far this version has, in my opinion, taken multiple steps backwards from the originals. Even the classic releases don't play as well as the original versions. I find myself screaming myself hoarse at the frustration of stupid ships that do whatever they feel like, regardless of commands sent, enemy ships that arrive and destroy your fleets many times faster than you can possibly retaliate or build, and limitations that were not it the originals that make no sense at all. Why research a ship type if you can't build it? Why tell a harvester to  gather resources if it is going to park itself the moment it's finished it's first rock? Why leave hundreds of exhausted rocks littering the place? And why weigh the skew so heavily in favor the of the enemy in the single player games that frustration instead of enjoyment is the only possible result? And they lost Cataclysm. Bah!			"

												This one is a classic and well worth getting. A lot of reviews say that the game aged well and that Homeworld never really needed the remastering treatment it got. And yet. And yet the work Gearbox did in concert with the original development team, the original voice actors, the concept artists, and the original game's modders shows a loving respect for a series that should never have gone fallow since Homeworld 2 came out. The remastered version is gorgeous and the gameplay hasn't aged a bit. I still tear up hearing the choir singing Barber's Agnus Dei.This is a great game and a work of art well worth having in your collection. I look forward to seeing what Gearbox's enthusiasm will bring to the series in the future.			"

												This review is to♥♥♥♥♥♥off all the bad reviews.first of all the people who are giving the game bad reviews and calling it boring obviously are on crack this is homeworld if you didn't enjoy the game 10 years ago then why did u buy the remastered one?, ive played the campaign and everything seems in check the graphics are beautiful and the core game which is homeworld is still preserved and well intact. So why all the rage and hate? i understand if its due to the game not loading properly but have patience. And the beta complaining the game is not even early access maybe you should read that its ""multiplayer beta"" im sure features and additional stuff will be released in the future but the game isnt beta.anyways just my rant on angry people the game is flawlessly awsome gorgeous and you couldnt ask for more,defenatly recommended!

												It's Homeworld 1 + 2 in classic and remastered versions.  What else can I say?  I've fired up Homeworld 1 classic and it's pretty much exactly as my existing install.  I've fired up Homeworld 1 Remastered and it's... well it's glorious.  Fairly consistent 90-120FPS with the details turned up past defaults but not maxed, it controls the same, it plays the same, and it looks much better doing it.  This is really all I wanted.For those that don't know of this game, it's the classic 3D RTS developed by the same company that went on to make the Warhammer Dawn of War RTS games.  Homeworld bought a lot of new things to the RTS world upon release, some of which still haven't been bettered.  It's use of 3 dimensional space for positioning your units and attacking being one.  Alongside that the fleet you have created during one mission is the basis of your fleet for the next mission; meaning that careful planning from one stage to the next is essential for success.  Lack of planning and scarce resources can really bite you further into the game.It's worth noting that micromanaging your fleet whilst not essential is advantageous; but you have at least at your desposal settings for stance (aggressive, passive, guarding), formations and basic tools such as guarding units.  Formations are cool, not only do they look good but I they can influence the encounters those units may have and their chances of success.  Though this does seem to bit different (possibly bugged) in Remastered,  you have the Classic one to compare and contrast.In summary this is a good remastering, it polishes where needed, brings things up to date to remaing compatible with newer hardware and leaves the rest unchanged so not tarnishing the memories and reputation of the original games.

												EDIT: (Having played a bit through the HW1 Campaign on Remastered)By all means, Homeworld set the bar on what it really meant to have a space RTS. The original was ground-breaking, and the particularly leisurely pace of the missions as well the ability to keep your fleet between missions reinforced the desire to use tactics, and made each loss of a destroyer a tear-jerker. Needless to say, the game was memorable. Homeworld 2 was another great game, but I wasn't as much a fan of the strict Rock-Paper-Scissors, and completely transient nature of my fleets. I felt like I was rebuilding from scratch every mission, as if my ships were made out of paper. Some of the grander tactics were substituted with spamming the proper counter, making ground, rinse and repeat. I didn't feel as connected to it, but regardless, Some people prefer its interface and overall playablity. In the Remastered Edition, Homeworld 1 is basically Homeworld 2, with a story and ships from the first game. Now, on the surface (and for the first few missions), this works fine. The ability to use Evasive or Aggressive tactics (which increases evasion or accuracy respectively) are gone in favor of general 'behavior'. A few missions later, and I realized that even my strike craft were not staying in formation. If one has played the first game, one may understand the importance of this, as I'm sure many of the other reviews have noted. Now, I can take this loss in Homeworld 2; the game was different. But there is a problem in Homeworld 1. Homeworld 1 fleets and missions were not built with the intention of using the Homeworld 2 engine (duh). First of all, a lack of fuel (for both your units as well as the AI's) is okay... until you reach the Garden of Kadesh, and the main element of the Kadeshi forces is their constant need to refuel. Without fuel, this mission has completely changed in nature. A couple missions later, one is fighting the ghost ship... and the mission has completely changed (due in part to the changes to the ships), one is forced to use Corvettes and Fighters against Anti-fighter and Anti-corvette  frigates (an entire fleet mind you!) without squadron tactics or formations... see the dilemmia? Now, this may seem like I'm ragging on this game pretty hard, but I don't want to come off too hard. This is NOT a bad game, this is still a great game. But, this is not the same game that came out in 1999. It looks like it, (and damn is it beautiful), but it's not the same at the core... not ultimately. As for Homeworld 2, and multiplayer, I'm sure this is going to be a fantastic game. I haven't had a chance to play the multiplayer or 2 yet, but considering this is the Homeworld 2 engine, I'm not going to assume much as changed since. Consensus: If you're interested in the game, then play it. It's a great game. But if you're looking to play the Homeworld 1 campaign, stick with the original. It's just... better. If they update this game, and patch it, then I'm sure it will be even better. Gearbox, you've done well, but wearing the skin of my girlfriend and trying to give me a kiss just isn't as appetizing as the real thing.			"

												It's amazing that Gearbox has managed to update Homeworld in a way that makes it as amazing as it was back in 1999. Back then, it was beautiful. They've updated it so that it feels the same now, 15 years later. The graphic updates are beautiful, and the remastered sound is dramatic and nifty. This game stands the test of time, being not only as good as it was 15 years ago, but is also pertinent and competetive amongst contemporary games, as good as anything else being made. Beautiful. Fun. Buy it.			"

												This brings back memories. I absolutely love the remastered visuals and cleaned up audio. Some people are reporting bugs and glitches but I haven't really seen anything glaring out at me. One particular thing I could mention is when designating groups with multiple ship types the quantity numbering on the group selection to the lower left is difficult to read.I can see myself spending a huge amount of time with this collection. They did a lot of this out of passion and love for the original game. The developers were gamers themselves who want this to be a great rendition of a timeless classic, and you can tell they wanted this to have the soul of the original classics while being re-made for the modern system. The audio work alone merits a huge amount of praise but to see that they sensitively updated the visuals is also such a great bonus. You won't go wrong getting this. The most jaded and indifferent people will still be impressed by the quality of the arts presented by this collection. Great job Gearbox, this does a lot of goodwill towards bringing your reputation back into the good graces of gamers. I hope it sells like gangbusters.			"

												To start, if you have never played the original than you will probably like this game a lot more, this is the review of an old homeworld fanatic, and my complaints are mostly about infidelities to the originals. (Well the formation thing obviously needs fixing).I am very dissapointed with the remastered versions of these games. HW and HW2 handle formations and tactics very differently.  These mechanics could be reconciled, but aren't. Individual strikecraft built by kushan/taiidan do not stay in formation and tactics aren't as usefull (originally evasive ships were harder to hit and would spread on attacking, agressive ships would stay tight and fire as fast as possible). These features should be preserved, and the ui should simply adapt depending on what race you play, (taiidan/kushan get formations, hiigaran/vagyr strikegroups). If this was fixed I would be deeply satisfied. The graphics are wonderfully remastered and it has potentiall to be a brilliant rebirth of a personally treasured classic.I mostly just use this to play HW classic on my mac.PLEASE FIX THIS GAME			"

												DON'T DO IT!!!!When you send units to a location in any other RTS you know where your units are going exactly. In Homeworld you have no way of telling depth and will quickly find that your ships you thought were headed one direction are off going to a completely different location then the one you thought you were clicking on.It will take you 15min at the most you realize you've made a terrible mistake. Don't let that happen to you.			"

												The game still stands as one of the greatest space opera ever made and now with a new coat of paint. A truly wonderful story about a race threatened with extinction looking for their Homeworld accompanied with unique atmosphere and daunting orchestral score. There are drawbacks to this remaster however including missing gameplay mechanics from the original such as physics simulated ballistics and relies on Homeworld 2's system of random number generator for combat simulation and while it has the original fleet formation coupled with the new ones the older ones tend to be bugged, alongside some pathing issues and missing fuel system, but those issues are due to remaking the original Homeworld in the Homeworld 2 some are certain to be fixed with patches while others can be addressed with re balancing. f you're new to Homeworld none of this should bother you as the RNG mechanics of Homeworld 2 are just as playable, as for the purists who prefer the original gameplay over the newer one, the collection has the original HW1 untouched and fully compatible with modern operating systems with the trade off of having antiquated graphics. Recommend it to anyone interested in space RTS games or a fantastic space saga in general. Truly one of the greatest games ever made and I can't be more excited for having this gem brought back to life instead of having it locked away in obscurity and intellectual property limbo.			"

												Refering to Homeworld (I) Remastered:Infested with bugs (skipping music, wrong texts, units not hitting) and instabilities (crashing when exiting options, during cutscenes) this game takes out all the fun out of homeworld. Better stick to an old version, which functions properly.			"

												RE-TINKERED? Re-HASHED? In the music industry when a work is re-mastered, it generally means that technologies unnavailable at the time of the original recording are used to clear away the audio artifacts of an analog mastering process and hopefully present a truer version of the artist's work. In other words, it's ""cleaned up"" and will sound better than it ever has - especially on the new higher fidelity systems available.What Gearbox implies in their title is that they've done this with a game - whith higher resolution. Same work, by the same artists - just more enjoyable on modern systems.That's not what happened.What happened is more like a REMIX. The new artist can't help themselves and attempts to add to the original: to improve it or make it their own. And that's fine under two conditions:1. The new artist is honest about what's going on2. The new artist is talented enough to succeedNeither is the case here.What we have is a game that's somewhat better to look at, with a host of new bugs, newly broken mechanics, and at least one story breaking bug that stops progression several levels in and has you sitting there in deep space with nothing to do wishing it hand't cost you $34 dollars and many frustrating hours to get there. I wish I had avoided this one. But the allure of Relic's artistry was too great. If you are reading this and considering the purchase out of a nostalgic memory of what once was I'll say this: playing Gearbox's version of Homeworld is like going back to your home town after four years away at colledge. Many things are familiar, many are jarringly not, and the Home(world) you remember exists only in the past.It's too bad these hacks don't know their trade.RE-JECT this.			"

												Just Singleplayer Review (because I don't want to create another frickin' account) I bought this game for 12€ and if you never had the pleasure to play Homeworld 1 or 2 years ago it is perfectly fine game with a good campaign and a trivial but fun multiplayer and you should buy it. Yes you should. For all the people who already have Homeworld 1 and 2 played 15 years ago and still got the data: DON'T DO IT. Yes it is looking a little bit better. And yes: Some Features from both games got crossfeatured to each other which makes both games more interesting and intuitive to play. BUT: It's basically the same cheese and you really don't need to buy it for the better graphics - the graphics from years ago are still absolutely satisfying.			"

												this is my favorite RTS. and i can't recommend it.  It's been a while since I've been insulted by buying a game.  bought this game new for about $30, no big deal, except it said preorder and get the original game free, except you always get it free, misleading/lie.  then it instantly goes on sale for 66% off.  add insult to injury.  but it gets worse, the cpu multiplayer is STILL unplayable after multiple updates.  and the final insult: the new deserts of kharak looks amazing! but if you buy the game new you get homeworld for free. but if youre a fan of the series and already bought the game for $30 you get $10 off the new game.  I took elementary math once and $30 is more than $10.  so i should have never given my money for this game. because i could have saved money by not buying the game until the new one. and thats B.S.  way to punish the fans of the series.  like i said I'm insulted, and disgusted by this.  so I refuse to recommend this game.

I am at about 40 minutes of trying to launch the game with no success, though I now have an account with ""shift"" which I emphatically neither wanted nor anticipated. So far this is about as much fun as telecommuting on debian unstable, but without the educational side effect.

												For $35 one gets a game full of quirks and bugs. Unit behaviors and the balance of combat elements is changed substantially. It is confusing at first and then frustrating, as some of the most effective tactics (e.g. small units working in tight formation) can be ordered but don't actually happen. They would have done better to leave the game engine alone. The original Homeworld stands out as an all-time classic among 3D strategy/combat sims. I can only hope a few dollars got back to the original developers.			"

												Even though I've not played these games for long so far, I can tell this is exactly what I wanted and was buying. Gearbox didn't dissapoint this time with this flawless remastering of a classic. These game's mechanics still hold up to this day and with updated graphics it leaves all other current RTS of this kind. It's very hard to describe the feeling you get when you combine nostalgia with a great game and then polish it to this level of sheen. This should be an instant purchase for past lovers of these games. Newcomers should also try these if they are fans of RTS games. The controls are smooth and intuitive. They work well for 3d navigation in 3d space. The HUD is relatively easy to navigate as well. My only complaint about the HUD is the upgrading and building menus. Those I have always considered somewhat clunky. Large scale space combat in these games is fun and cinematic. These games also feature a great soundtrack fit for space exploration. The added workshop compatibility for mods just makes this package too sweet to ignore. Can't wait for someone to redo Cataclysm and put it on there. All in all, a solid buy even at full price. It should be noted that I even dislike RTS games for the better part, but would place this game solidly on a top 10 games of all time list.			"

												This is one of a kind game, forget all other strategy games for Homeworld touches both physical and spiritual world and proves that even something as RTS can be challenging not only on one but multiple levels. You don't play through this game, you live it through and the story this game has will leave a mark on you once you've finished it. For me HW was always something special and the musical score done by Paul Ruskay only underline the whole experience with its orient-like flavour. Now with the remastered graphics and tweaked functions and mechanics Homeworld is truly worth your time.P.S.: Oh my god, it's so bloody good to fly the Big Banana again :)			"

												I first played this back in '99 and I was sorely impressed, I used to take the 100+ page manual (I miss those days) to read all over the place. It was the first game to get an actual emotional response out of me (that wasn't frustration), and you really felt for the protagonists for the story putting yourself right into their shoes (or that of S'jets).This remaster of such a beloved classic is incredible, and should probably be a benchmark by which other remasters compare themselves too. The improved graphics are rich with detail, and the audio (songs and dialog) is oh so much crisper now. it's not 100% perfect, but bug patches will surely fix things - or modders will. The fleet formations for HW1 strike craft don't quite work how they're supposed to which is a bit disappointing, and the enemy scaling between missions seems a bit overly harsh at times. There are a couple others such as black screens but I have not seen them yet. They also got rid of fuel which made me a little sad, since it reduces the need for resupply ships.Pro-tip; Steal everything that isn't nailed down. If it is nailed down, bring more salvagers. Also, don't overbuild your fleet. If you smash the enemy it might be wise to retire some strike craft before the next mission - otherwise you might find yourself in quite the pickle.			"

												Having played this for dozens and dozens of hours when I was younger, experiencing the Remastered Collection is an absolute treat. Everything has been upgraded, textures have more depth and polish, the ability to experience the games at higher resolutions brings out the beauty that was created so long ago, and the remastered soundtrack (one of the best ever in my opinion) adds a sense of scale and intensity to everything happening on screen. No more modern military shooters or the same racing games done countless times before, the Age of Space is back! And having one of the finest space RTS games ever, remastered for a whole new generation to experience solidifies itself as an absolute must own.			"

												Now, I will make a note right now, I am a diehard Homeworld Fanboy. I played Homeworld 2 just a few months ago at the most recent. I also played Cataclysm fairly recently. However, Homeworld 1 eluded me after my childhood. You see, when I was 8, we got Homeworld 1 and I enjoyed it... that is, up until the asteroid mission where I could never get past it and never truely knew how the game evolved or even the ending.In fact, this, was the first time I have ever seen the ending of the original Homeworld.I loved it.It wasn't without its faults, but I couldn't really expect them to take a 15 year old game, ship it into a new engine, and fully remaster it without some issues being present. If you expected it to be perfect, you are a fool.They kept a lot of the basic gameplay elements that I remember while improving the bad things I forgot about. Here is a quick list of pros, cons, and bugs that I experienced.Bugs:Mission 3 broke for me on the first playthrough. I killed the frigates, but never got the objective to salvage the trays. Luckily it was a short mission and it was the only time I had to restart a mission. Might be worth checking out though.Pathing/AI seems to be extremely poor. The biggest issue I saw with this has an obvious answer too. Its the Homeworld 2 engine and that engine was not designed for single ships put into a chosen formation by the player. This causes OBVIOUS issues when you try to do it. Ships will immediatly drop out of their formations when combat starts and make no attempts to have any sembelence of sanity until the battle ends. Of course, this causes Homeworld 1 fighters to be damn near useless and you are way better off just running all frigates and capital class ships because they are useful past being cannon fodder... In most situations. On the Asteroid mission I got stuck on as a kid, I lost like 8 frigates to really terrible pathing which seemed to be caused by buggy asteroids. Pros:Homeworld is to this day considered the greatest designed space based RTS game ever created by a wide number of people. For good reason. This remastering brings the game into the current age of technology and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥did I just hear every other space based RTS♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves?Amazing Story that I finally got to enjoy fully for the first time in my life. I must say that the story telling in this game is a huge upturn to the current generation of games.Great gameplay mechanics for sure. The greatest being the persistent fleet between missions which can either make for an extremely fun situation or doomed to fail scenarios.Updated Graphics! This speaks for itself really.Updated Voice work!!!! This I was NOT expecting when I heard they would be remastering the game. They got the original voice actors and had them redo the lines with the higher quality recording technology and boy does it SHOW! If you watch the cutscenes from the original homeworld and compare it to these, you can not only see the difference in art, but you can HEAR the difference in voice acting too!Cons:Homeworld 2 Engine... I would have been WAY happier if they had used a different engine or maybe spent the time to make a new one. Perhaps one they could have used for Homeworld 3? ;) The Homeworld 2 engine is sloppy and actually causes the majority of the problems with the game as it sits. It was never that great, but I understand that it had to be done, it just makes me sad :(No difficulty setting - The best thing about Homeworld Cataclysm, was that at 8 years old you could set the difficulty to easy and blow through it and have fun with it. I had always wished a difficulty setting would have been in homeworld 1 so I could have beaten it as a kid and gotten way more enjoyment out of it. Now some other poor kid who might want to enjoy this game wont be able to either because it is too hard? Difficulty settings exsist so the player can choose their pace for the game and get the maximum enjoyment out of it. The point it was removed in Homeworld 2 and completely ignored still in this remastering simply reminds me of when I stopped bothering with homeworld 1 because I couldn't get past one mission. Then, by the time I was old enough to want to try again, it didn't work anymore on my computer. :'(			"

												Homeworld Remastered, is a good example of how a remaster should be.  This game consist of all the homeworld games to date (except for deserts of kharak).  If you're an RTS fan, this is a big must-have to any space fans and RTS fans out there.  Full 3D control, no constricted to the usual 2d plain that some space rts games have.  A long, challenging single player with lots of ways to finish them.  If you plan on playing the campaign, good luck, the difficulty in this game can go from easy to insane in a short time, mainly depends on how large your fleet is on later missions.Homeworld 1 Remake.  It has issues.  The biggest offended is the fact its just or feels more like a Homeworld 2 mod, but I guess its understandable, especially since they want all the races to be playable in skirmish or multiplayer, so they gotta keep them in the same engine.  The problem, a lot of HW1 features a missing.  So far they fixed some of them, mainly repair beams and I believe the harvesting.  All they need now is to brick back real time ballistics instead of an RNG chance system that homeworld 2 uses.  The other thing they need to fix is formations, luckily they're on the work for that, and the patch looks very promising.Homeworld 2 remake.  Since the remaster is using the HW2 engine, anyone who played the classic version already know how the gameplay is.  To the newcomers, homeworld 2 is the result when a developer is rushed to release a product, before release, the story was  to be much more larger (look up Homeworld 2: Dust Wars) however despite this, Homeworld 2 has one of the biggest or dedicated modding community out ther, check the workshop or the HW2 MODDB if you wanna see.  The things Homeworld 2 improved upon is the gameplay and obviously graphics (look at the classic HW1 and HW2, the difference in graphics is big) and the remaster just makes HW2 (and 1) a lot more beautiful.  Gameplay is good, its one of the best an RTS game offers, especially with its full 3D movement.  In a multiplayer match, you can send your units downwards (or upwards) towards the opposing fleet, and they'll never know whats coming to them (especially since we're so used to the usual 2D plain in RTS games)  The story is simple in the game yet emotional, especially since the Race you play as is almost extinct (spoilers)  Multiplayer is great too, even if you go against AI, its still a blast, because of the gameplay, you may find yourself too distracted looking at whatever your units are doing.tl;dr  Its a Must-have RTS game, buy it.+Great gameplay+Great soundtrack+Beautiful graphics+great sounds+good lengthy campaign +great modding community-HW1 features are missing-not a lot playing online (though it depends where you live and if you have good connection)-HW1 Remake feels more like a HW2 mod			"

												I played this as a kid and always liked it and the music. I was horrible and couldnt get passed the fourth mission in homeworld 1 and had no idea there was a homeworld 2. For fun all I did on homeworld 1 was skirmish a bot and sometimes lose but usually win using frigates and huge capital ships! Now I can play homeworld 2 no problem and attempt to re live homeworld 1 campaign and beat it this time!			"

												Having played this for dozens and dozens of hours when I was younger, experiencing the Remastered Collection is an absolute treat. Everything has been upgraded, textures have more depth and polish, the ability to experience the games at higher resolutions brings out the beauty that was created so long ago, and the remastered soundtrack (one of the best ever in my opinion) adds a sense of scale and intensity to everything happening on screen. No more modern military shooters or the same racing games done countless times before, the Age of Space is back! And having one of the finest space RTS games ever, remastered for a whole new generation to experience solidifies itself as an absolute must own.			"

												Now, I will make a note right now, I am a diehard Homeworld Fanboy. I played Homeworld 2 just a few months ago at the most recent. I also played Cataclysm fairly recently. However, Homeworld 1 eluded me after my childhood. You see, when I was 8, we got Homeworld 1 and I enjoyed it... that is, up until the asteroid mission where I could never get past it and never truely knew how the game evolved or even the ending.In fact, this, was the first time I have ever seen the ending of the original Homeworld.I loved it.It wasn't without its faults, but I couldn't really expect them to take a 15 year old game, ship it into a new engine, and fully remaster it without some issues being present. If you expected it to be perfect, you are a fool.They kept a lot of the basic gameplay elements that I remember while improving the bad things I forgot about. Here is a quick list of pros, cons, and bugs that I experienced.Bugs:Mission 3 broke for me on the first playthrough. I killed the frigates, but never got the objective to salvage the trays. Luckily it was a short mission and it was the only time I had to restart a mission. Might be worth checking out though.Pathing/AI seems to be extremely poor. The biggest issue I saw with this has an obvious answer too. Its the Homeworld 2 engine and that engine was not designed for single ships put into a chosen formation by the player. This causes OBVIOUS issues when you try to do it. Ships will immediatly drop out of their formations when combat starts and make no attempts to have any sembelence of sanity until the battle ends. Of course, this causes Homeworld 1 fighters to be damn near useless and you are way better off just running all frigates and capital class ships because they are useful past being cannon fodder... In most situations. On the Asteroid mission I got stuck on as a kid, I lost like 8 frigates to really terrible pathing which seemed to be caused by buggy asteroids. Pros:Homeworld is to this day considered the greatest designed space based RTS game ever created by a wide number of people. For good reason. This remastering brings the game into the current age of technology and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥did I just hear every other space based RTS♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves?Amazing Story that I finally got to enjoy fully for the first time in my life. I must say that the story telling in this game is a huge upturn to the current generation of games.Great gameplay mechanics for sure. The greatest being the persistent fleet between missions which can either make for an extremely fun situation or doomed to fail scenarios.Updated Graphics! This speaks for itself really.Updated Voice work!!!! This I was NOT expecting when I heard they would be remastering the game. They got the original voice actors and had them redo the lines with the higher quality recording technology and boy does it SHOW! If you watch the cutscenes from the original homeworld and compare it to these, you can not only see the difference in art, but you can HEAR the difference in voice acting too!Cons:Homeworld 2 Engine... I would have been WAY happier if they had used a different engine or maybe spent the time to make a new one. Perhaps one they could have used for Homeworld 3? ;) The Homeworld 2 engine is sloppy and actually causes the majority of the problems with the game as it sits. It was never that great, but I understand that it had to be done, it just makes me sad :(No difficulty setting - The best thing about Homeworld Cataclysm, was that at 8 years old you could set the difficulty to easy and blow through it and have fun with it. I had always wished a difficulty setting would have been in homeworld 1 so I could have beaten it as a kid and gotten way more enjoyment out of it. Now some other poor kid who might want to enjoy this game wont be able to either because it is too hard? Difficulty settings exsist so the player can choose their pace for the game and get the maximum enjoyment out of it. The point it was removed in Homeworld 2 and completely ignored still in this remastering simply reminds me of when I stopped bothering with homeworld 1 because I couldn't get past one mission. Then, by the time I was old enough to want to try again, it didn't work anymore on my computer. :'(			"

												I'm so happy! It's like my youth has been given back to me only better! Everything that was great about Homeworld and Homeworld 2 is still great, and now the visuals are appealing again too! The ships in this game sparked my imagination and forever influenced my perspective on science fiction engineering and now they look better than ever. The models are essentially the same but the textures are amazing and far more detailed than I ever would have expected. Properly normaled and bump-mapped, the Higaaran mothership finally looks like a giant industrial work. All of the fleet of both Higaaran and Vaygr ships are lovingly brought up to speed with modern machine capabilities. Even the HUD overlays are sharper and more clearly defined. The backdrops are gorgeous as ever and buffed to a fine polish with better lighting effects. In fact, all the graphical effects are much improved, from hyperspace windows to Kharaak burning from orbit, the game looks amazing now and the gameplay holds up after all this time.The cut-scenes are still impressively animated and mostly unchanged, although if my memory serves me the images are sharper and there are a few additional elements I don't remember, but the masterful voicework on both the narrated cuts as well as the idle radio chatter from your units still sucks me right back into the struggle to return the last of my people to my Homeworld.

												Best space RTS ever. Period.  People whining about AI issues or other trivial things need to keep in mind that the remastered version was in development for less than a year - for $32(CAD)? That's a steal, considering most games these days are over $60.Are there bugs? Sure. Can they be fixed? Most likely. As in most cases, YMMV. I for one haven't experienced any major bugs. I believe the main focus for this remastered version was to improve the visual fidelity of game, not it's core mechanics - which are more or less the same, along with any issues the previous versions had.The important thing is that gearbox brought the game back in to existence, and didn't butcher it in the process.  Homeworld 3 now seems less like a pipe dream and more of a possibilty.Cheers.			"

												A MASTERWORK of the RTS genre gets not only the best remaster available,  but is now preserved for newer generations of gamers to experience.  Not only does this game get the graphical overhaul that it deserves, but the sound assests have been remastered as well,  along with even the between mission cutscenes being brought into the new century.  Added steam workshop support will help the modding community continuously breathing new life into this title for quite some time.For those that never gotten to experience the Homeworld series or those that foundly remember this jewel of digital excellence I completely recommend this purchase.This game shows how unique and wonderful game design can stand up to the test of time.Thank you Gearbox for showing how a remaster/hd rerelease should be done, with obvious care and love for the material.I proudly award this title the Colder Seal of Approval!!

												I played this as a kid and always liked it and the music. I was horrible and couldnt get passed the fourth mission in homeworld 1 and had no idea there was a homeworld 2. For fun all I did on homeworld 1 was skirmish a bot and sometimes lose but usually win using frigates and huge capital ships! Now I can play homeworld 2 no problem and attempt to re live homeworld 1 campaign and beat it this time!			"

												One of my all time favourites. I played them all back in the days, from HW, HW:C to HW2 with and without mods, for ages. And now, the remastered version, and the same is coming, hours and hours of campaing and skirmishes, it's probably the best space RTS ever. Can't recommend it enough. It has a compelling story, good research, build system, very good battle and fight management down to a single unit. The remaster is mainly graphical, as it adds special effects, HD textures, and a bit upgraded UI. It doesn't take anything away. I bought the game now for the 3rd time. I think when something is done so well as HW series, it deserves support.Update: Currently the game is unplayable in the campaign mode, so if there are no patches in the next week, the thumb goes down.

												Beautiful and incredibly atmospheric real time strategy game in 3D space. Both the first and second part of the Homeworld series are included in this really well done remastered collection. Both games have been elevated to current graphics, audio and control standards.I almost forgot about how great these games were, especially because there has never been any game quite like Homeworld ever since.

												Best space RTS ever. Period.  People whining about AI issues or other trivial things need to keep in mind that the remastered version was in development for less than a year - for $32(CAD)? That's a steal, considering most games these days are over $60.Are there bugs? Sure. Can they be fixed? Most likely. As in most cases, YMMV. I for one haven't experienced any major bugs. I believe the main focus for this remastered version was to improve the visual fidelity of game, not it's core mechanics - which are more or less the same, along with any issues the previous versions had.The important thing is that gearbox brought the game back in to existence, and didn't butcher it in the process.  Homeworld 3 now seems less like a pipe dream and more of a possibilty.Cheers.			"

Period.What more needs to be said, really?It is Homeworld, but better than the original, somehow.And im running it maxed out (even 8k textures), on a horrible laptop with an Intel i3, 4gb ram and a weak nVidia 720m notebook gpu. And its running buttery smooth with Crysis-level of detail in the textures and normal maps. Astonishing.And the gameplay? Its Homeworld. Enough said. It is Homeworld.Stop reading, start playing.			"

												To be fair, the HW1 remaster is kind of awful, since there are a bunch of gameplay issues created by dropping HW1 assets into the HW2 engine. Corvettes don't behave as they did in the original, you have to micro some things that didn't have to be microed before, a particular critical limitation of strike craft is gone, etc. That said, the original game was included, so you can play that instead. It's far from unplayable, so I went through it anyway to see the graphics and reexperience the plot.The HW2 remaster is beautiful, though. I spent more of my time replaying HW2 than HW1, so personally I would have been satisfied paying full price for only the HW2 remaster and nothing else. Full mod support has been promised, and we have it from the head of the Complex mod that they've done a good job on that front. I liked 2's gameplay better; some people liked 1 better. Probably a lot of these issues will be addressed in the coming days - the problems with the HW1 remaster seem correctable, and the modding community should have a good time.			"

												For $35 one gets a game full of quirks and bugs. Unit behaviors and the balance of combat elements is changed substantially. It is confusing at first and then frustrating, as some of the most effective tactics (e.g. small units working in tight formation) can be ordered but don't actually happen. They would have done better to leave the game engine alone. The original Homeworld stands out as an all-time classic among 3D strategy/combat sims. I can only hope a few dollars got back to the original developers.			"

As far as the story goes. it's got my attention a little. wish it had CGI cutscenes instead of slideshow artwork but ok.Factions? Well theres 4 factions.. im too tired to finish this review right now.			"

												It's Homeworld, as you fondly remember it, comparatively looking as good as it did when it first came out. This is definitely a remaster with lots of love and polish put into it. And it's Homeworld - still king of its genre.			"

												First off, yes it is nicer to look at than the originals.Secondly, it plays just as well as the originals, unless you are a purist. Then just play the originals...they are supplied.Had not just a nostalgic blast but a bloody good time with this. The gameplay is awesome, the graphics are to die for and the challenge is as it was.Gearbox have done an almighty job on this, you can feel the love. Nearly makes up for A:CM..... ;)Double thumbs up.			"

												I have no clue were the screenshots are, but I've managed to do some traditional HW1 stuff like from the first encounter with the Tidan Empire in the revenge on their planet killer sector fleet I've captured 4 Destroyers and 1 Carrier :) It was epic caputreing its own resource callectors at the start with touranic raider corvetes and fighters for cover :) I love cheating. But it is hard - trust me. No clue were the time x4 is... game time is so slow.All in all - it desirves your money, it is playable and fun, a good platform for the future. A classic that we will one day see a movie after :)			"

												I remember playing the old school Homeworld...I was 15...damn I feel old.Anyway, I couldn't fully appreciate it back then. For me it was just 'pew pew...splosions!"" Granted, compared to most RTS games coming out today, it's punishingly difficult. It doesn't hold your hand, but growing up on Atari and Nintendo, without the joy of save files and regenerating health, I was used to it. It was and still is one of my favorite RTS games (perhaps my favorite). If grew up with this game, it'll feel like home. If you're like me, your jaw will probably drop when you see the facelift it's gotten. It's absolutely beautiful. The space battles are as intense as ever. And remastered, the laser heavy dog fights and resulting explosions is some of the most satisfying gaming you'll experience all year. Go watch the PAX demonstration if you need further proof. Let me just mention one more thing. Mission 3 of Homeworld 1...the music combined with the imagery...it's goosebump inducing. Don't go look it up and ruin it for yourself. It's something you need to experience free of spoilers. It'll be on your top ten list of best gaming moments, trust me. This is a no brainer, in my opinion. If you loved Homeworld 1 and 2 in their original forms then this will be like revisiting an old friend from high school that got really really hot and now wants to sleep with you. If you didn't play this game back in the day, but you love the RTS genre, it's a no brainer. This is one of the finest entries in the genre and it now looks as good as anything else on the market.For all of you with older machines, this is really well optimized. So if you've got a laptop or perhaps a couple year old gaming rig, don't worry too much, it should be fine.			"

Finished the HW1 campaign, starting on HW2.  Its much harder for me as I never played HW2 much.  Enjoying it very much!There are some bugs, but the game has never crashed on me, and the issues folks are screaming about the loudest aren't game breakers in my opinion.			"

												I've been a gamer for a very long time, and there are few games that get my whole-hearted recommendation. The Homeworld series is one of the best sets of games that I have ever played in my life. The story and lore is superb, and in this collection they've restored the graphical quality to what it seemed to us back those years ago--amazing. The gameplay is fluid, the controls are intuitive, and they have kept true to form with what veterans (and newcomers) wanted to see in this release.In a word: Superb.			"

												In my opinion the one of the best RTS remasters of all time. I remember buying the original games and enjoyed the living hell out of it from 1999 to 2005. But, when hardware became an issue. sadly i had to stop playing the games then for year I wanted a remaster of the game but if gearbox had not steped up we would not have such a wonderful game to play again.  Now for the Multiplayer... I have to say I'm very satified with the multiplayer espeacially since the interface is better than the original releases, because there is now a unified menu where you can select witch version version to play. Another thing i'm glad about this game is there is support for mods to play multiplayer too.Now for mod support... I've seen some good mods like Halo Homefront a mod based on the Halo Video Game Series and a personal classic favorite Complex 9.1 on launch. There all in the Steam Workshop avalable for download.Overall 9.9 out of 10 - would play it with friends any time			"

												I mean minus a few bugs (that I was kind of expecting), especially cutscene bugs, this is the definitive version to have. Just wow, just WOW! I beat the whole thing and nothing could have delivered the nostalgia better. The video sequences, the clear voices, the detail, the gorgous space backdrops, Campbell Lane (and his well-desevered tribute at the end), etc had me reliving my childhood. Thank you homeworld devs and thank you gearbox. Now... go find cataclysm and I'll pay just as much too ;)And tell the musical artists, 'Yes,' to just give in, hehe. Don't worry, I know, I know; it is probably because of the record label copyrights, not the band.			"

												First off, I was a huge HW fan back when I was a kid in High School so I'll be as fair as I can in the review thus far.  After a good amount of time into missions in both HW and HW2 I can say that it is not without bugs.  There is a few frustrating ones where even if you do too well in a objective you bug the game! lol  Besides the bugs that make you redo a mission it's not that big of a deal, save often and even if you don't the game auto saves for you.  The visuals are amazing and the sole reason I bought the game, I wanted to replay this wonderful game and see it in updated graphics and play with some friends from HS.  The multiplayer is still in beta as they just started writing the code on it and are having to work out the kinks.  Be patient as you can still get in games with friends and others but sometimes you get a out of sync error when you start or some other frustrating issue.  Overall I will say the game is great especially if you never played HW you should hands down if you like any sort of RTS or space strategy games.  The storyline is fun and is overall a great experience.  Thank you for redoing this masterpiece of a game and I hope you continue to work out the multiplayer bugs, but I'm going to say you should've fixed them before it was released.  Gamers can be patient but not when they get bugs in a game that was already a hit.			"

I've never even seen another strategy game that plays like this one with a 3D space environment. It takes some getting used to, but it's a total blast once you get the hang of it. Visuals and sound are stunning, and the story is surprisingly solid. Some of the missions can be frustrating, but the challenge never seems unfair. Highly recommended.			"

												It's really great to play this game again, especially because of the lack of good RTS games these days. At the price it is, it's really a steal as you get 4 games included (the original games and the remastered games). I still maintain that this is one of the greatest games ever made.However I do have a few of gripes.There are a few bugs and a few instabilities. The game crashes at the moment in multiplayer, which is seriously dodgy and shoddily made anyway. Sure it does say beta - but you'd expect glaring bugs like crashing when you connect to a game and not being able to connect to people's games, even through steam, who are in different regions than you, (unless you change your download location in Steam, but why should you have to?) to be fixed before release, or at the very least shortly after (been 3 days now without a single patch).Another thing is that this game has been ""remastered"". That's great and some things have been greatly improved. BUT it still looks really old. The skins and effects have been updated, aswell as some of the sounds, mostly for the better but sometimes for the worse. Example: interceptor/scout guns used to sound great in the original; kind of like machineguns, while in the remake they LITERALLY go ""pew pew pew"".Also when a game is remastered, you'd expect them to at least update the AI a bit. The battlecruisers in HW2 are STILL majorly bugged in that they simply cannot fly forward without a major headache, usually spinning around and around, very very slowly, reminding me of when I used to play homeworld 2 back in the day and never used BCs for this very reason. Ships also fly out of formation and kamikaze with harmful asteroids in a certain mission in the first game.My biggest gripe is that the Taiidan and colour options are missing from the Homeworld campaign. In the original, you could pick from two different fleet styles and colour them however you wanted. Now you are basically shoved into the game with none of those options, really proving some of us purists right when we were worried about gameplay being changed.In multiplayer they have merged the fleet styles from both the first and second game. I need to play some more but I can't help thinking that they are highly incompatible.Don't get me wrong this is a great game and still well worth your cash. I will summarise thusly:Homeworld Remastered is a great game but the remastered part is very misleading. Some key gameplay options have been changed, others removed completely. The skins and effects have been upgraded but the models themselves look old and blocky still. The AI has NOT been remastered at all, not even a little bit, and the whole thing just feels... lazy. Still an amazing deal but only because it's riding on the success of the original masterpiece from Relic. Definately worth it, but it could have been even better with a little more effort in the right places.Postscript: Please get rid of that horrible bloody hyperspace icon that obnoxiously pastes itself on the screen at the end of a mission.

												I would recomend with caution. the games cost is 40$ at the current time and there are some  BUGs i am getting black screens that i can still scroll but can't see nothing just hear the battle right after the cut screens after cut sceens if you try to skip them. (after playing some more i have figured out that the esc key can crash the game if you use it to close windows and cancel orders too much, i had the map view open and the mothership building menu opened and used esc to close and the back ground faded out to black all i had left was the overlay and sound and the game still working but i can't see nothing.) but you can save your game when this happens and reload it and it will have the picture back on the screen where you left off.Also if doesn't explain very much so if you have not played before and are use to being spoon fed with tutorials explaining every detail then you might get overwhelmed at times.   Here are a few things about homeworld 1 that don't fit.  The controls are odd the UI is well... seems unfinished.  The ESC key doesn't bring up the option menu which is in most games so it becomes comfusings at times. There is no mouse sensitivity for the zoom or side scroll  so you miss the battle.  The formations fall apart once in battle. After playing around  for many hours you can get the hang of it.That being said I am still having fun with this game and recommend it if you don't mind wating for some patches because i am sure they will fix the major issues.  This was a  rushed review to get it out there so don't use this to make up your mind on what could be a great exprience.My rating so far is 7/10 gaming breaking bugs. This is more like a Homeworld2 pre-qual instead of Homeworld.Not to be hard on the game but you don't need me to tell you about the pros you can read about those on other reviews			"

												At least I cannot recommend it yet based off my first encounter.Homeworld was one of the games people told me I should play. I never actually got round to it the first time so I was really looking forward to play this ""legend"". However I have played through the 1st few missions and I have the same issues I see others are  facing. Namely:1) Formations don't seem to do anything - the ships to go were ever they please.2) I came across some bugs with collsions detection (resource collect go stuck between Mother ship and a large ally vessel) as well as random black screens.3) It's quite hard / boring to grind the first couple of missions. I found it was a bit of a grind to kill off the early corvettes with the scouts and inteceptors. I eneded up sending a scavanger corvette to capture most of them!Having said all this, for an RTS it really sets a great mood and the story is quite well done. I hope if I come back to this in a few months it will be patched. A pity really.			"

												Seems like a hugely ambitious project, but aggravatingly counterintuitive interface ruins the entire experience for me. After couple of hours struggling against it I gave up. Perhaps if the game didn't rip away my already feenle as they are controls from me for the sake of showing me something obvious and holding me tied there for no apparent purpose or reason while my units are being cheerfully slaughtered in another spot of the map where I'll spend a full minute getting to once the game decides to release me... You get the picture. If you are used to controls of every other big RTS title out there and expect the interface to be half as intuitive and sensible as them - you are in for a struggle. If you feel like spending your time learning from scratch an entirely new arbitrarily keyed method of orienting yourself in space in real time for a few hours before you even get to the actual gaming - well, then you might actually write a better review. Good luck.			"

												Too many bugs, do not buy until they fix. Unless you're just after homeworld original on steam. Homeworld 2 sucked and still sucks, so I have no comments on that. My review is based on trying to play Homeworld remastered. Multiplayer is a cluster♥♥♥♥ also, but they labled it beta and the plan is to work on balance I guess?Pros:- New GraphicsCons:- Formations don't work properly, which ties in with aggresive and defensive maneuvers not working properly (these 4 top points are all related and contribute to fighters and corvettes being worthless, besides salvage and repair)- Fighers die too easy- Fights hardly do any damage- Fighters (and any unit for that matter) forget orders randomly and do what ever they feel like.- Mission triggers randomly break, you might not know that you're mission is bugged until you're ""finished but the next trigger won't trigger because you somehow broke it earlier, meaning you have to start the mission again...- Certain ships don't work like they used to making them worthless, like the support frigate was able to heal ships from a distance and now does nothing...- Adjusting missions according to your fleet, dosen't seem to be balanced right (but also has to do with a lot of other issues of stuff not working properly, which makes everything hard- The Garden of Kadesh used to be a hard mission, even though it's only fighters you fight. Now they seem to be broken and not working properly making it so easy you hardly do anythingIf you're looking to play Homeworld, wait until a sale to get it. If you're looking to play homeworld remastered, wait until it's patched and works. If you're looking to play homeworld 2, IDK ask someone else. It's probably functioning as normal though. And multiplayer is un-balanced as hell at the moment.			"

												Never played the original versions. Game appears to be one long escort mission, oh and you shoot at asteroids at one point because the Mothership is incapable of listing lazily to one side and avoiding them entirely. Further evidence that Gearbox cannot make a quality game outside of its Borderlands series.			"

												I really love the original game. This is a very nice move to remaster this game. However the game have so much critical bugs that make the gameplay not fun anymore. Formations do not work, the MOST important is the repair function! without repair function working properly, this game will be extremely hard. Ion arry frigates are so much less powerful now. I not sure why would the remastered game be design differently from the actual game. But if this is intentional, I will be extremely dissappointed and feel cheated. :( Misrepresentation of the game.

The inclusion of workshop support means that this remaster will only get greater with time. If you haven't played the original games you should definately check this out, it's an all time RTS favorite. "

												Brilliant remake of a classic game, a few small bugs, nothing that stop you playing, a few changes some good some not so good depending on your taste, for exsample the battlecruisers can no longer have extra missile or beam upgrade, 2 slots have been removed.The explosions have been completely re-done and look absolutely awesome now, and also leave alot of salvageable material too.The game has all of its original controls, which is excellent.There are a couple of new factions/enemies some new ships, all with the same style as the original homeworld 2 ships, very neatly done indeed.Mods lack a bit of support still, half of them work half of them dont.One mod COMPLEX 9 works great and allows for the unit cap, which is still around the same as HW2 original, to be lifted to extraordinary levels, example 90 odd capitol ships, much much fun if you have a beefy PC like I do.Definately worth the 34$ steam are charging for the re-mastered version, if you like HM2 original, you are going to love this very fresh and invigorating remake of a classic game.It would be great if there was a map editor like ''skunks map editor'' for HW2 re-mastered..., The ability to create your own maps is the one big thing they should have put into the game as a standard feature that they missed.   Maybe in a future patch perhaps.....Now I have fleets to cull ! Bye !			"

												““So, I bought this game during the winter sale and like many other mainly single player games I own, I assumed that I would play for a couple hours and then put the game down because I didn't want to grind my way through the story. Tomb Raider was different. This campaign is one of the most exciting campaigns I have played in years, and that puts this game on my all time favorites list with great games like Star Wars: Battlefront (2004), and Halo Reach. I could not put this game down. Around every corner there is something to fine. Unfortunately, I grinded the games story and managed to complete the story with an overall game completion of 68%, but there is no doubt in my mind that I will not play this game again soon. I played the game on the hardest dificulty, and although I died a couple times - seven times to be exact - The game was so much fun that I didn't care about me dying when I got rushed by 20 autoaiming enemies. Overall, I love this game. I found everything about it great: the story, the graphics, and gameplay. It isn't often that I find a game like this where I want to come back and keep playing day after day, and not put it down at all. This game is amazing.”” "

If you even remotely interested in RTS you simply have to have Homeworld in your collection.Recommend with all five. Can't go wrong if you buy this game I only wish that every game was made with such amount of love as this one.			"

												Many years ago I attempted top play this game and I didn't make it far before I emailed the developers with numerous words of curse about the bugs and non-standard camera controls. I stopped playing after I smashed my old desk into pieces because of the frustration, but now I've decided to try again.Here are the reasons why I will email the developers again telling them why they suck my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥:1. I think this versions camera controls are even worse. I tried remapping them, but when I press D my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s start docking again. I even remapped docking to some random key.. but no. 2. End of missions resource collection - I've discovered that after a mission is complete I have to let it run in the background for an hour for my chumps to get everything on the map. What makes this worse is that my salvage corvettes are the laziest lumps of♥♥♥♥♥in the universe and I have to individual click on every piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥for those ♥♥♥♥s to salvage. For some reason... this is not enjoyable at all.3. The Pause Key! - I've never used this key before in my life. Everytime I want to use it I have to search the keyboard for this damn thing. A button on the HUD would be common sense,instead you just need to use the pause key... a key which no game ever in the history of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games has ever used.I should not of bought this. Its the same crap as before but with added bugs. "

												When I picked up a dusty copy of Homeworld, some years after its release, and booted up this obscure 3D Space RTS, and its equally beautiful sequel, Homeworld 2, I could never have imagined that now, perhaps a Decade later,  they would once again return to my computer screen, reimagined in glorious HD.The story is powerful, at times desperate, but ultimately rewarding. The narrative is genuine, sorrowful, the voice of Fleet Command falters at the sight of the Genocide of Kharak, pilots mourn and seek revenge with rabid determination. This gives way in turn to triumpthant relief. Ships catch the light of exotic Nebulae, projectiles and lasers cast fiery arcs on their hulls. The graphical direction becomes another dimension to the story, everything is just Human enough for the gamer to be totally immersed in the struggle, the exiles clinging to hope in these ships almost becoming your own people.This re-release of Homeworld and Homeworld 2, is a fitting homage to the genius of this series. Many an hour will be lost, or invested, in joining these weary exiles on their slow, tortured, hazard filled journey to that place we all hope to find, home.10/10			"

												Personally, this is the first time I played Homeworld. I never played the classics when they first came out because I was too young to even know about games. The environment, the visuals, and the sounds are amazing. The battles are exactly what I envisioned a space battle to look like; epic fleets dueling it out until only one remains. Homeworld Remaster Collection is worth the money, especially if it is on sale. What makes it even better is that there is modding support so I spend most of my time playing modded version. The only downside to the game is the disk space this will take up.			"

												This is a biased review - let's get that out of the way early.Having played the three originals, and having kept an eye on the progress of the remasters, it's fair to say that I was a fan before release, and one of those 'old guys' who eagerly awaited this arrival with crossed fingers and a daily prayer to the gaming gods for Gearbox not to screw it up. Was it going to be a labour of love, a cash-in, a botch job? I was understandably concerned.Straight out of the gate, there's a clue. When the opening titles splash, and it's introduced as a remastering of a game by Relic first and foremost, you realise that these guys are paying due deference to the source. I knew this already, as Gearbox have gone out of their way to collect original voice actors, and even original design team members to give this the attention it needs. They spent time putting everything in place to reproduce a classic. More than that, what originally started out as a simple release with a HD upgrade turned into a full-on remaster with not just improved visuals, but high fidelity sound. Gearbox had the chance to make this a cash grab. They passed up that chance of merely cleaning the windows and elected to give it a full service, respray, a new set of tyres, and replaced the engine while they were there. Sadly for some, they did mess with the handling a little, but I'll get to that.Whenever I load up the originals, while they're still excellent in gameplay, the visuals are suffering. They don't look like how I remember them. There appears to be some gap between reality and my imagination. My imagination upgrades visuals as I go along, and I'm invariably disappointed  when I find that my memory is lying to me and the games have a lower resolution than my imagination does. Original HW2 still looked pretty good, but HW1 was showing its age badly. Apparently Gearbox thought the same. The remastered versions look like how I imagine the originals. They look better.They're beautiful.Nebulae are rich and vibrant, with that otherworldly quality that makes space look much more lovely than it is. Ships are detailed, explosions are impressive and Kharak and Hiigara have never looked so amazing. In one sweeping moment, all the graphical issues that come with decades old games - gone.So far so good. How's the gameplay though?Gearbox have modified HW1's gameplay to be more like HW2. This will be sacrilege for some, and for those who thought HW2 improved a lot of things, it will seem as simply sensible.Fighter formations are no longer entirely static. They hold formation until they engage the enemy, and then as one would expect, they break off into one almighty hairball with contrails zipping in and out of each other to the incongruous tune of vacuum explosions. This seems more realistic (minus the forgivable space sound), and yet it unarguably removes a facet of the original that some will find hard to bear.Some won't like it. I realise that, and I think Gearbox did too. They telegraphed it ahead of release to ease fans into the idea. Time will tell if Gearbox patch this feature back in. Also, the fuel mechanic is gone. Can't say I lament its passing. It was tedious.Other than that, Gearbox have kept a very light touch, and have changed very little. They clearly know not to mess with a proven title too much. There are good reasons for the changes they did make however. To allow a seamless transition from the first to the second game, one of them would have to change as there were some significant differences. You can literally play them back to back now, and they feel like you're playing the same game. Nothing jars. Also, the UI is standard across the two. It's now even more minimalist than it used to be, allowing you more screen real-estate to watch the carnage. It doesn't take long to navigate your way round, and in no time at all you'll find yourself hotkeying your way to victory.Other than that, Gearbox have left the gameplay largely untouched, which is interesting. They must have been tempted to 'do a Lucas', but they didn't. What's even more interesting is that the gameplay from two titles which are now 16 and 12 years old respectively, doesn't suffer by modern standards. They're perfectly fine. I'm not sure of any other genre that could make that boast, but then, there really hasn't been much like Homeworld since.People still compare it to its nearest contemporary, Sins of a Solar Empire, and that is telling. Sins is nothing like Homeworld. Both are set in space, and both are viewed from a god's eye view, and that's it. Of course, for those who simply cannot stand the few changes that have been made, Gearbox included the two originals as well, with some fixes to enable them to run on modern machines.There are some bugs. I've had a couple of crashes and there appears to be a persistent engine audio bug that is banished by opening the game menu. Others report more bugs than I've seen, so hopefully Gearbox will get on the case and tweak a little.All in all, for the price, you cannot go wrong. Two games, two versions of each. One for the more strident hard-like fans, and an updated version for everyone else that is simply a joy to play. All for the price of one game. I was starting to fear these games would be lost to the history bin, but thanks to Gearbox I've managed to walk with the Kushan once more on their cosmic caravan to regain their Homeworld, and also with the newly renamed Hiigarans, striving against overwhelming odds to preserve it. It was as much a pleasure this time round as the first.Hopefully, now that HW1 and 2 are accessible once more to the gaming public, Gearbox will move on from here to Homeworld 3, and Shipbreakers, the latter of which is already well into development. After playing through the beautiful Remastered games, I'll be waiting eagerly.For those who have never played these games, fair warning, they may seem harder than modern gamers are accustomed to, but they're as brilliant now as they were originally, and even though it's a much overused cliche, they deserve a place on any gamer's digital shelf.Now, back to killing those Taiidani and Vaygr scum ...

												One of the few games I truly missed when the computer out ran it.  When I heard that a remake was in the works, I was overjoyed.  This game is a must buy for any gamer.  The three dimensional combat, deep story rich campaign and now (be still my beating heart) online multiplayer.  If you want to see the pinnacle of RTS gaming get the Homeworld Remastered Collection, today.			"

												Just finished my first look at HWR after it just released.  You didn't disappoint Gearbox, I could feel the love in every ship I've drooled over so far.  Game is amazing and I'm feeling just like I felt the first time round.This is the first time in my life I've taken off a week of work just to play a game.  Well done, really looking forward to playing HW3 and Shipbreakers, I'm sure you have enough orders of HWR to justify it already :)			"

												Litterally didn't make it out of the first stage of the tutorial mission before a quest bug occured and I could not progress further in the tutorial mission.  Go out and reaserch and it appears the entire remastered collection is buggy, but especially homeworld 1.  Highly disapointed. If I didn't get this game in a humble bundle, I'd be demanding my money back.			"

												I played the original Homeworld for days on end and hoped by the infos released, it would be a remarkable bundle of glorious HD childhood remembrance. I was wrong.One of the main reasons I didn't really play and / or like Homeworld 2 was related to fleets. Yes, one of the main things elevating this game from other RTS was bothering me. Why? The AI didn't have a fixed fleet (size) like in HW1, but instead was composed of units perfectly cancelling out your whole fleet. You captured Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers only to get them destroyed by counter-units spawned exactly for this ship. In HW1 you had a unique fleet consisting of Kadeshi, Turanic and Taiidan ships mixed with your run-off-the-mill standard units. It was simply put beautiful. They kept their original paint job and most of them performed extraordinarily. You cared deeply for your units because you couldn't build new ones to replace them, because they were unique. If you built units, it was mostly supporters and / or special ships. Why? Because resources were scarce and had to be consolidated around the necessities. You used what you had carefully and many a time you had to reload a game because you lost one too many ship or one dear to you.Then, in HW2, you had this urge to capture cool Vaygr craft like missile frigates. Boy was I proud to finally have captured a few of those. Then I harvested resources the old fashioned way and prepared a fleet to be able to counter everything I thought could be thrown at me. In the next mission I was always surprised to find the enemy being able to kill every last one of my ships at will, because his fleet strength was measured exactly by mine. This made me realize that capturing and keeping special or even more useful ships than mine was futile. I had to scrap every single one of them just to not be overrun and lose them in the next mission. After one or two missions I came to the conclusion that I had to scrap all ships excluding ship production vessels if i didn't want a mass extinction to happen. My fleet at the end and start of each mission basically was a Chinese sweat shop.This moved me farther and farther away from caring just the tiniest bit for my fleet - because why would I? Everything was interchangeable or could be rebuilt. It was always the same. Scrap and rebuild. Scrap and rebuild. At some point I just produced ships to counter the enemy, not to have an effective fleet. The ones built faster were in higher numbers than the rest, because who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥ right? They will be scrapped either way. I realized that this was not the type of game I was expecting a HW game to be and abandoned HW2 for good. Now they made this gorgeous looking game and based it on the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI fleet mechanism that HW2 had. I feel betrayed because the previews don't talk about that and just blow sugar up its♥♥♥♥♥ They removed many functions like the support frigates' repair beam or group capture with salvettes. It's a nightmare of micro management wrapped in gorgeous HD graphics. I will NOT play the campaigns of either of them because it just pisses on my childhood memories of HW1. Too many things are wrong with the game and I will wait until they address it. The forums are aflame because of the same reasons.I even bought the CE because I was so sure it would live up to the original. At the moment it's nothing more than a HW1 mod for HW2 with better graphics. The formations are broken, the launch manager is a mess, research costs money, the ""z""-with-selection-rectangle functions are missing altogether, the AI fleets are dynamically generated based on your fleet.I liked the serenity of the old HW1. You had your objective, completed it and collected resources while getting your fleet ready for the next mission. You built ships, organized groups or just watched your harvesters do their work. The new games focus more on massive battles - which are literally pre-programmed - and watch all you built up explode and scatter just to win by  a hair.If you liked the ""Transformers"" movies, this one is for you. If you liked the original HW game, you should wait.			"

												The original is a great game and one I fondly remember. I was super excited to hear about the remastered and even more suprised when it went on sale yesterday. Unfortunately like so many other products on Steam this was is a beta product with the green light notice and it's not ready for show time. There are glitches with the gameplay, AI, and controls that make the game nearly un-playable. You will spend several times reloading a mission or rebooting the game so save often.  First review by the way and considering I've been using Steam since 2004 gives you some idea how I feel about what Gearbox has done.			"

												I played all the original games and they were great. The remastered version is very buggy, not challenging in any way. There is no even difficuly setting. I finished like 5 missions, which is 1/3 of Homeworld 1 game, like in 3 hours.After the lastest 5.2 gigabyte patch I can't even install subsequet updates or reinstall game.I can't recommend this game at this state. Originals were a way better. Did I mention that things like formations and tutorial is completely broken in remastered version? Good job Gearbox, good job... ::steamfacepalm::http://s33.postimg.org/pqoh8uuov/homeworld.pngAlso this game was completely abbandoned by developers for like a half of a year since they focused all they effors on new game they were making, Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak. I feal cheated by Gearbox, so they just could grab my money and abbandon this game. Fortunenly, I bought it on sale so that was not much. I think it's the last remastered version of the game that I ever bought.			"

												I do not recommend this game if you're running windows 10 and have an AMD graphics card. The supposedly fluid moding system crashes and bugs out every time you even think of trying to adjust the settings just so you can play the game or the content created by its fans. I'm having to reinstall the game in the hope that the settings will return to default.So if you're running the same OS and graphics card I am, I recommend you get a different space sim, as modding will be wholly unavailable to you, frequent crashes and transparent texture bugs will be your life.I can see there is a fantastic game buried underneath all the problems, but if the devs can't be bothered to optimize their game for the whole of the PC community then what is the point?

												Homeworld 1s gameplay was ditched in favor of Homeworld 2s. Units are still singular, but they behave and attack like the ones in the second game... that means even in defensive mode, my units were wandering far away from the mothership. The formations also don't work, putting units in the sphere mode and then setting them to guard something doesn't make them form the sphere around the thing they're guarding, nor split up when defending several individual units. The scout and interceptor weapon projectiles are not a hail of bullets, now its a steady but noticably slower stream of bolts. Fuel is totally gone. Salvage units can capture fighters now because it does a premade animation rather than fly at the target until its close enough, furthermore it lost the graphic on its capture nodes. These are only a few of the irritating changes, it's just not fun this way. I wouldn't recommend playing this legally.			"

												Homeworld is not a bad RTS it's just very overrated. Homeworld was a little before I got into RTS's so I had never played it. But everytime I ever asked my friends what they thought was the best RTS of all time, Homeworld always made someones top or atleast top 3. They would go on and on as to why it was such a great RTS and why todays RTS's will never be as good. So when Homeworld remastered came out I jumped at the chance to check out what all the excitment was about. After playing for a while I found my self very underwhelmed and disappointed. Maybe it was because my expectations were unrealistic but nothing was what I had expected. The game had some interesting RST elements but the combat was extremely slow and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the Civilizations and Total War games. The story the worst disappointment of all. I have no idea why so many people say the story was good, the game barely even had one.  All of that being said it's still not a bad RTS my pros and cons below with my personal rating at the end. Pros:Interested rst elementsGreat sound trackLots of strategy decent graphics decent UICons:Awful storyExtremely slow-pacedrobotic voice actinguninteresting combat 6.5 out of 10 While not bad, the game has extremely slow paced combat that few would enjoy.

												Wow, this game has not aged well at all. Do you remember what it was like to play an RTS back in 1999? It feels like this: very poor unit readability, a right-click that willfully misunderstands you, units that default to ""ignore enemies"", spellcasters with no auto-cast... this game is just full of weird awkward design. Sound fun? Here's what you'll be doing half the time: squinting at a screen of dots, frantically hovering over them to figure out which tiny dot is the dot that will do some small ineffectual ability, and then figuring out how to get that dot to target another dot out of 100 dots.This is a golden age of real-time strategy. They have unparalleled accessibility and visibility, more than any other time in history... and this is an RTS about HUGE 3D SPACES that doesn't let you use WASD to navigate it? Yikes yikes yikes.The Foss-inspired ship designs and Adagio for Strings are still there, and perfectly lovely.But if you're honest with yourself, this game is surprisingly unpleasant to play. ""Remastering"" implies they've looked at RTS design within the last 15 years, and incorporated modern accessibility into the interface. They're hoping you're so nostalgic that you overlook their laziness. Maybe that's OK, maybe Gearbox really needed some quick revenue and this was a fairly sure bet, fair enough.In doing so, they commit the worst crime in AAA -- they feel cheap.			"

												I played the old Homeworld 2 and instantly fell in love, this new iteration is no exception. Everything from the graphics to the controls are crisp and wonderful to behold. I have played all sorts of RTS games from Age of Empires to Civ 5 to Star Wars Empire at War. However, this game keeps your attention better than any of them I feel. That constant fear of an attack from above or below, as the 3D plane allows, keeps you on your toes. There are always more layers to this game so that you will never get bored, and if you somehow do, it allows mods! Hardcore RTS players will enjoy the depth of strategy and casual players, like myself will also find this to be quite enjoyable. 10/10			"

												By the gods, this is amazing on so many levels.Some time ago, when Homeworld was first launched, I remember people commenting about it being a Masterpiece. I doubted, so I bought the game. I remember the last time I played the campaing, it was the 14th time I did it. Then, Homeworld 2 came. I played it so many times or more, not to mention the mods. Then the games disappeared. I was hoping that someday they would pop on Steam, but I was almost giving up.Until now.I think that there is no game that I've waited more than HW Remastered. When I heard that it was Gearbox who was remastering it, I was unsure of the quality of the work. Now I can die peacefully: the masterpiece is back. Remastered.A quick tech overview:-The graphics are amazing, but incredibly faithful to the original. The new models are so close to the original ones that they can fulfill their purpose: be what our ""mind's eye"" saw when we first played it. New effects, revamped textures and lightning only add to the nearly divine aspect of the game.-The music... when I first heard the choir, I cried like a baby, Ultra high quality true to the modern-day standards. And the subtitles. If you like them, they are there with a charisma of their own.-The gameplay... I played the tutorial to see if I was rusty. I was. But the controls did not change much. The UI is clean, with a deep degree of fidelity to HW2's UI. Smart move, as some are saying.Veredict:Masterpiece.11/10, worth every cent.PS: If any of you are wondering, they did not include the original pdf files in the package. I managed to find the Historical Briefing, you can find it here: http://www.homeworldaccess.net/downloads/hw1docs/HistoricalandTechnicalBriefing.pdfUpdate - 10/27/2015They have fixed a lot of errors, and it seems they're still working on it. Formations will not work as they did in HW1, but that's because the games were created based on the HW2 engine (which do not have the same formations). It is true that they add a deeper layer of strategy to the game, but their absence is not catastrophic, but rather a matter of re-learning the game. Still recommended.			"

												10/10, no question about itGearbox really outdid themselves and remade this classic with love and care, and boy does it show. Everything from the textures and models to the audio and soundtrack has been recreated with special attention to detail. It looks absolutely unbelievable, literally jaw dropping. Not to mention, it's optimized beautifully. My computer is not a gaming laptop, only running a NVIDIA Geforce 750m. Yet even on the medium settings, this game runs at a very smooth framerate. And the medium and lower settings still look fantastic.I could go on, but if you're reading this, just go buy Homeworld Remastered Collection already. You're truly missing out if you don't.			"

												This re-release is stunningly beautiful. But it reminds me of why I never finsihed Homeworld 2 in the first place. The Unit AI is vastly inferior to that in the original Homeworld. Units can't be counted on to deal with threats that enter their sphere of influence like they did in the original. And no micro-mamagement will allow you to save units like you could in the original.A difficulty setting would be nice as well. "

												I bought this game for my Mac (running OSX 10.12) because i have played it years ago and intended to replay it. Downloaded/Installed the game, started up the launcher --> works like a charm.Well.... exited i tried to start Homeworld Remastered..... something started for a second maybe two and then.... nothing.Tried HW2 Remastered --> SameTried HW2 Classic --> SameTried HW Classic --> Sa.... ohhh wait a minute it says “Invalid or missing Homeworld CD. Please insert valid CD” .... seriously? PS: Inserting my original Homeworld CD (yes it has a few scratches) does not work…. well did it for fun anyways.Looked up the discussions on steam.... no help. Asked google..... no solution in sight.Well..... what can i say? I feel ripped off! F**k Y** Aspyr! Another game you obviously DO NOT MAINTAIN! Patch to death or whatsoever.In the past i've encountered several ports from this company and tried to play them on Linux or Mac OS .... it's like russian roulette. Some work and some don't. And most of the working titles have glitches or need manual fixing of some kind.If you want to buy this for your Mac: DONT!!! Save your money for something that works.PS: Now steam says i need to play at least 5 Minutes to write a review…. well i looks like we have to keep the launcher running for 5 minutes to post our frustration.

												I am baffled to say the least. The game(s), upon startup of a level/mission/game/etc... freezes and crashes after merely a few seconds, IF I can get into a game at all. See that 24 minutes I spent in this game? Only 2 of those were me actually doing something, the rest was me starting up the game, only to have it crash at the title screen, or not even make it there, but only to the Gearbox logo or somewhere between. This was an absoulute waste of 34.99$, and I'm happily going to point you away from this ""game,"" or more so, ""Crashing Simulator,""			"

												Was enjoying the Remastered HW1 (never played the original) until I made it to about mission 8 and the game broke. I didn't even do anything besides play the game. No objectives and the scripting just stopped on an empty map with no AI.Suffice to say, this shouldn't have happened in a 2016 remaster of an old game. If your going to update a game, atleast ♥♥♥♥ing bug fix it. I'm not going to do things in a super specific order in an RTS just so the game dousn't completely bug out. Thats pathetic. I wasted a stupid amount of time doing literally nothing before realizing the game was broken.Game devs whine about piracy but they consistently put broken and terrible games on the market at high price while putting little work into them.

												It's very unfortunate that the gameplay of Homeworld 1 was butchered like this. Pretty graphics do not make up for losing the immersion of being a tactical-commander & ordering wings to attack in formation  aggressively or evasively. Nor does it make up for the eye-candy of following the action with your camera and watching ballistically-realistic shots hit enemies and miss your ships. The many ways this faux remaster has screwed with the game leaves me bitter.Even so, it's hard not to recommend this game, especially for people who haven't played it & refuse to touch the original with its dated graphics. Yet I still do not recommend you advocate such soulless practices.Video games are unregulated for the most part. Player, it is your voice & actions that regulates what the industry should & shouldn't do. Think before you buy.			"

												I played the entire first game and a large chunk of the second one and I simply don't understand it. I consider myself a strategy game nerd, but my only major difficulty in playing these games was getting my spaceships to fly how I wanted them to. The enemy never put pressure on me, and I felt no need to keep them on the defensive or have any other strategic consideration whatsoever. My resources weren't scarce at all, and I selected the default difficulty. I cannot be bothered to replay these lessons in boredom on another difficulty level. The ships all functioned roughly the same, with the exception of the carrier. Amazing tedium compounded by a pace of storyline and action that can only be described as brooding.			"

												As it is now I HATE it.Sorry, but where is splendid fighter micro from oryginal series? Now formations are only for looks before combat, when fighting starts they're gone. Sphere formation - basics for defending is gone.Silly bugs that could be avoided if someone played a game. Example? You press B key for build menu. Easy eh? But you can't close it with B when you're done with it. Suprisingly it works with Research menu (R), and doesn't work again for Launch menu (L). And there is more.Another example. Mission (i think) 4, u can capture 3 destroyers. When you do, 1 gets to keep oryginal imperial paintjob, other 2 r recoloured as kushan. Not nuff testing, rushed game.Edit: It's mission 9 and now all 3 r painted Kushan :D It's like back in school, when you don't look someone will paint♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on your stuff :DDozens of these.Also game treats u like a moron, giving you unfair advantage against cpu, adjusting damage or armor according to some sort of learning curve? Dunno yet. Self healing is crazy.I had these 2 destroyers firing at each other for 10 minuts.I mean 10 bloody minutes!2 destroyers! And they can't die!Missiles suck too, before they ripped fighters apart. Now they r shiney.BolloxI mean there r improvements, but I also think that it's not HW anymore. And also - it's NOT FINISHED. Why didn't you offer an open beta? or closed beta? Why not hear from community?Well there is one obvious answer - community would not approve some of concepts Gearbox made, and I think they knew that.And if you think patches, opinions will make this game better. They will not - ofc silly bugs will be fixed, like the ones I mentioned above. But game concept was decided before programmers started coding, and things that made oryginal HW - HW are simply gone. Now it's... pimped HW2 pretending to be something it isn't.Oh, also sound sucks too. There are no more emotions there :(			"

												Love Homeworld, me not recommending the game is not a reflection of it, but on the state of its release.Gearbox, did you even test this before release? There are bugs that are there simply by playing normally, nothing that needs to be found by a variety of circumstances happening all at once that would be easily missed until in the hands of many. I know I'll probably be ignored or downvoted, whatever. You know I'm right, this game is bug ridden all to hell. Tutorial continues without hitting""OK"", ships getting stuck on objects, scripting failing to initiate, formations breaking up in HW1, sound glitches, UI problems.Dont' support this release, it's blatantly obvious Gearbox did not adequately playtest this, probably because they knew it'd sell bucketloads anyway. I'd say wait a month or two to see if Gearbox stands by their product that they proclaim so much to admire and patches this to what it should've been on release.Shame.			"

The game also has an annoying way of throwing curveballs that make you have to go back to earlier saves and start all over again (all fighter enemies, instant surpirse conversion of all of your capital ships, etc).

												i can't believe people are still talking about this. how did people ignore the fact that this is suppose to be a Battlestar Galactica game? granted it does retell nicely from the original BSG, but in the end, its a colossial dissapointment for me. first the positives, The Graphics are amazing (both the original and the remasted version), the ship designs are awesome (particularly the Taiidan, the Hiigarans and the Vaygr), the gameplay is addicting and the soundtrack fanfreakingtastic! the mods are wonderful for both classic HW2 and HWR, two of my faves are Cataclysm Remasted and Brickspace (though as of now, CR is still in dev and wished it would have been the official sequel to the first homeworld). but the voice acting's so bad they all sound like robots, intentional or not (with the exception of the late Cambell Lane as both the Bentusi and the Narrator), and the pacing is about as well as a snail on molasses. and what's worse is that its official sequel while technically better then the first one, its storywise worse, with lots of cliches, plot holes etc as far as i checked. and even more worse is that a prequel(/Sequel) will come out next month that takes place before and after HW2? What? NO!! don't make both a prequel and a sequel at once, it makes no sense!! at least with a remake/sequel it starts off like the same, but eventually follows up afterwards like in Evil dead II. here, this is just dumb! why did you let Gearbox by your IP, Blackbird?! i recommand it just for the gameplay, visuals, music and mods alone. otherwise i will never recommand it just for the story alone.

												Never played Homeworld, or even heard of it.I always was a fan of RTSes and tried this one out.Of course it is a remastered version so I'm probably critiquing old game mechanics that was simply enhanced graphics-wise. In any case, but I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone.Every mission is basically built around the concept of 1. Build fleet2. Lose majority of fleet3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.This is if you get everything right.Also, you'll need repeat the mission one or two+ times.The reason is that you have to build the right ships that counter the enemy ships WAY beforehand, because you have only one production building ship and you cannot build anymore of them. If the enemy fleet is coming and  you start building the CORRECT ships to beat them, they won't be out in time. It can only build 2 units at the same time and if it is the same unit, then this feature doesn't work. It has to be two different units.The story is intriguing to say the least. However, the gameplay insight is very lacking.			"

												Oh great, a new homeworld game with updated graphics! Gimme! This is seriously great. A remake with nothing changed except the graphics... well, some voice actors too but the original voices were easily restored by a mod. Just as i remembered it! Wait. What's that? A patch that changes the entire game balance and makes my strategies dating back 12 years no longer viable? STAPH... aaaaand its too late, this is no longer the game i paid for.			"

												Really enjoyed the remastered versions but it's clear the better in terms of gameplay is in Homeworld 2 Remastered. This is where it's at, this is where most of the fun and enjoyment from Remastered comes from: Homeworld 2 Remastered.The game looks really nice and on par with just about any RTS out there in terms of beautiful graphics plus the requirements are very low all considered. There are bugs but not any game breaking bugs. For some reason Homeworld 2 Classic won't run for me at all but everything else will... Still, should be fixed next patch it hopefully.Multiplayer is a lot of fun allowing you to host either Homeworld 1 Deathmatch rules, Homeworld 2 Deathmatch or Homeworld Remastered rules with a lot of match options in size of the map, resources, relic spawns, etc. It is in beta and extremely buggy with a lot of crashes when loading matches at the moment but this seems to be tied with mods available on STEAMWorkshop that effect multiplayer. This will hopefully be more stable when patched.Definitely worth the price. Game looks amazing, runs really well and you get the original games(You can't get them anywhere else at the moment) plus the two remastered versions and a unified multiplayer client. Well worth every single penny.			"

												Currently i have been unable to get the game to launch successfully on my gaming rig it cant load homeworlds 1 or 2 at all and when i load the remastered versions it makes it to the menu and then crashes when i try to load into a match of any kind. Mods are really want kept this game alive, its story was good for its time but the platform the game brought for modders was great. But most the mods that are ""finished"" are still only for the orginal versions, which unfortunatly for me will not load at all. So i cant even enjoy those, and i have tried everything i cant think of to get it to launch from forums and the like to game launch settings. This problem with it failing to load seems to be limited to my newest gaming computer and my laptop. Only computer in the house is a 12 your old machine that barely runs and grinds down to a crawl when it tries to play the game on the lowest settings. When they figure out a way to get the game to launch reliably, also not crash on a loading screen, patch it, and when some of the old mods have been brought up to the remastered version it will be well worth the purchase but not before. Buyer beware the game might not work on your newer rigs reliably.			"

												Playing Homeworld is a great way to switch off and indulge in an evening of forgettable relaxation. The colourful space vistas, twisting neon engine trails, and soft explosions all come together to create a dreamy feel – which is just as well given how soporific the gameplay is.Like other space RTS games, Homeworld removes the genre staple of terrain but provides nothing to replace it. Your activities will be managing bog standard rock/paper/scissors unit counters while gathering a single resource type. 3D movement is one of the USPs but it adds very little: in the vacuum it's just a slightly more fiddly movement direction, albeit one which grants your ships an arbitrary damage bonus to targets above or below their own plane.The most you'll need to think about 3D movement is when positioning capital ships, most of which can only fire in front of them and all of which turn slowly. Unfortunately you can't explicitly set ship facing, making planning ahead a challenge, and during combat capital ships can veer off-target if their pathfinding AI decides that it needs to steer around an obstacle. With capital ship battles often decided by the direction in which each ship is pointing, this easily becomes a pain point.Otherwise ships can either fire in all directions or turn quickly enough that their current facing doesn't matter. There is no apparent bonus for hitting ships from the rear unless you are specifically trying to disable their engines, a niche activity given how slowly ships large enough to have targetable sub-systems move. There really is vanishingly little else to discuss at a high level.The automatic difficulty scaling of the campaign, in which the number of enemy opponents changes depending on how many ships you carry over from the previous mission, was ahead of its time. Unfortunately the AI will simply clump all its ships of the same type together and order them about as one unit, which actually makes the campaign easier as it progresses due to the slower response times required by larger battles. You'll coast through the campaigns until their final missions, which both spike difficulty up to the same obscene level. They are disasters and I would suggest just watching the closing cut-scenes online instead of bothering with either.I paid £9 for the game when it was on sale and am not unhappy with that. But I cannot recommend it for £27 nearly two years after release.(I didn't play online, but I hear that it's dead.)			"

												Do not buy this game for HW1, you will be disappointed.While the graphics look great, I am very disappointed with the bugs and glitches the game has.  In the first several hours of gameplay I have encountered the following:1) Numerous crashes to desktop even after the day 1 patch and driver updates.2) On the first mission if you skip the cut scene things can glitch out.3) On the 2nd mission the enemy didn't appear to jump away, they just seemed to vanish (animation bug?)4) On the 3rd mission capturing the enemy frigates didn't give me any frigates - the first one is supposed to disappear, but not the rest...5) On the 5th mission I had fleet command tell me I should research 'defenders' but the research never showed up, and it didn't show up in the next mission either so I guess I just don't get this type of ship ever....6) On the 6th mission after I cleared the asteroid field the bentusi never showed up... the mission will not end.  Loading the autosave does not help as the damn game garbled its own save state.  I have been told online that I literally have to start over again from the previous mission.And the winner is - on the tutorial there is a 'press ok to continue' mechanic.... but the voice just keeps on going whether you press ok or not... It's only an annoyance but to me it's emblematic of the trashy quality of this port.Do not buy this for HW1, you will be disappointed by how buggy and glitchy it is.			"

												I have been a big fan of the Homeworld games for a long time. Sadly, both of the remastered games crash on start up. This seems to be a problem suffered by many and shows that Gearbox should have tested their product before release.Other negative reviews point out gameplay issues (namely that formations dont work anymore for HW1) but I cannot even get that far.I hope that Gearbox can patch this quickly to make the game what it should have been on release.

												I have allot of offline hours.I really wished i could recomend this 100%Sadly i can only recomend it for it giving out the original Homeworld2In the remastered versionUr ships are calculated in ""amount of ships"" not squadsSo you cant build 6 squads expecting 6 pop, no more like it counts each ship and ur pop is 70........So like... ok?The UI is odd.Changed everything around for... some reason? ok sure. me and others all agree it was better back in HW2you can change the size of the UI, cool, only if it worked correctly, you see, when i change the ""button UI"" it only changes the buttons on the right side, not the left, no, the left shall remain small with no way to make them bigger.So that sucks on my 2560 x 1440 rezgl trying to read that crap!Trying to find good, i zoom in on the ships, ok they look.. brighter... i guess, but the dark gloom on the ships in SPACE looked better than ships that just GLOW for some reason, where is the light coming from?All settings are on max yet shadows are not working? And not just for me, its for my 2 friends as well. So it's the game.So it turns out i bought this for the HW2.... no the original one, the one that still stands as the best Space strat game ive ever played.And sadly this ""remastered"" crap made it worse!PS: in settings you can change your mouse to the HW1 house, but not the 2nd HW mouse? lolk get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together.

												Crash review. . .Now i've done both HW 1&2 campaings long before this remaster came out... and i've done a few missions in HW1 remastered.. so let me warn you in advance:1) Salvage corvettes now need to be micro-managed... old game you can grab and bunch and do salvage-select and they do their thing. . . in this remastered.... NOPE! there is no salvage-selection box.. and now you have need to select the amount you need per ship.. and then select the ship you want... and this gets annoying when 7 Ion Array Frigates appear.2) Repair corvettes now wander around attacking.. sure they have a lil mini-gun but ffs stay still till told what to do!3) The cryo trays... ok... we went over the salvage corvette &*(*&-up... oh yeah! they CANNOT BE REPAIRED WITH REPAIR CORVETTE. k? Old HW, you can...4) Resaurce collectors... they beach themselves now and then on roids (ah what?)5) Docks!! OMFG! there's no stacking like xScouts or xSalvage.. no... imagine an inventory with every 'stackable' item are laid down in stacks of 1.. then populated as they dock... so you'll have Scout, inty, scout, repair, inty.. ect.  THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE, I cannot use 'Stay Docked' i cannot select the ships i need in-time since they appear so 'hickledy pickledy'!6) Last mision I just failed (just after coming back to Karak) the Raider carrier moved upwards.. and off the map... so ships couldn't get to it.. thus.. fail...

												First! Will update this after I'm done drooling all over it.All right, I've done a quick match and quickly destroyed my AI opponent. I'm a HW1/HW2 vet and I first played Homeworld in '99, so here's my input:Pros:-I like how the controls feel like Homeworld 2, most of the shortcuts are the same even though the UI is redesigned. The HW1 interface was terribad in comparison, I'm glad the devs went with the new version.-So many pretty things, and yet it runs quite smooth on my laptop. Kudos for good optimization.Cons:-Scuttling is too easy to do, there should be somekind of confirmation in case I press the wrong button.-I found the UI too small to be honest, the difference between size 1 and 2 is too big (size 1 being miniature and size 2 being gigantic for my 1600x900 resolution), it'd be quite essential to be able to tell what's going on. The selected unit icons are essential in managing strikecraft. -The asteroids are too hard to see on the tactical screen, they are an important strategy element and I'd like to see them better. -At first I was disappointed that I couldn't launch the multiplayer and the two campaigns from the same ingame menu, but then I realized it's probably that way to save loading times (perhaps, maybe the devs were just lazy). -The multiplayer obviously needs some improvement, but it's in beta which gives me hope the devs will actively work on it. Perhaps balance things as time goes on? That'd be sweet.-The chat. Come on, the messed up keyboard layout is a HW2 bug, at least try to fix it.All in all, worth every penny so far.			"

												Would not reccomend this game, The ""remastered"" Title is a lie from my experience of the game. I got in and the game looked like a game that was made like 20 years ago, the graphics are terrible, the gameplay could use a bit of tweaking and some of the sound designs are a bit off over all 6.5/10			"

												This game sucks!  The tutorial is entirely inadequate.  The help resources are non-existent.  The whole game is a study in frustration and boredom.  First objective is to destroy some drone, but they're nowhere to be found.  Resource collectors will collect resources but the seems to be no way to bring them back to the Mothership.  And worst of all - nothing happens in the game!  It's pathetic!  This was a complete waste of money.			"

												Please note: I am not some nub scrub who doesn't understand homeworld. I was playing and writing games in the 70s before most of those reading this reveiw were born, before some of their parents were born O.o. I have played all the homeworld games and I started on the RTS around 1992 with Dune 2. I can still beat 12 year olds a dark souls 2 pvp so please, no ageist BS. Can't really recommend this bundle at the moment as it doesn't seem finished. The problem is the ""remastered"" Homeworld 1. Some random observations:Problems arise first in the tutorial where it keeps asking you to press ""ok"" to continue, and then continues whether you do or don't. Key assignments don't seem to work: I reassigned keys for panning up/down and suddenly i couldn't pan backwards and forwards or up and down with keys and my mouse wouldn't go back/forwards, instead it went up/down.  It seems plagued by flickering textures and lighting issues.There seem to be some problems with selecting units and control at times. At the end of a mission I was harvesting but the harvesters all ignored the harvest controller  nearby and went to the mothership. Also has problems with streaming via steam and also if you have MSI afterburner running.  Not that either is hard to avoid but they're also not that hard to program around (given the number of games out there which manage it).HW1 also has the homeworld 2 control and manufacturing systems but they don't seem to work consistently, in the tutorial you manufacture a whole wing of ships, not so in the missions where they pop out one at a time.Homeworld 2 is much better and haven't really encountered any problems with it but what you're paying for here is a collection. If half a working package minus multiplayer is enough for you then sure, buy it, but if not, wait. Not sure how this is getting 9/10s other than the usual game industry BS. Hopefully things will improve with time but experience teaches not to expect it.			"

												I was a big fan of homeworld.Playing it brought back so many memories.Haven't found a RTS game like this one ever.Yes I bought it as soon as I saw it on steam. lots of high hopes for it.But just like me, this game is old.Sure it looks better then the old homeworld; but modders had already done a good job revamping HW.If you're like me and played Eve Online or Star Citizen, you will find this quite ugly.It's still slow and I don't really see that much difference between this version and the old one with mods.Before I get flammed by all the fanboys; Yes I loved Homeworld too. Yes it is a great game.I just don't think this version is worth buying; Not at that price.Wait for sales... we've waited 16 years for this, might has well wait a few months to get it cheaper.My review way change when the mod scene makes cool stuff with this version.Happy gaming ^_^			"

												In the current state i can only recommend against buying this game.It very much feels like a (very pretty) beta that has enough technical issues to feel nearly as bad as the original.If Gearbox manages to actually improve things i will amend this.As it is, have a small list of problems discovered in the first 10 minutes of gameplay: The mouse has lag (even at 160 fps), there's some form of mouse acceleration at work (most noticable when scrolling to zoom in, but not when zooming out) and there's not even a sensitivity slider, with the default being very low. (Fairly important for things like rotating the camera.) Panning to the left is nearly impossible on a multi-monitor setup since the mouse is not captured in the game window. The hud on a 1920x1200 screen is small, but can be increased in size by factors 2, 3, 4. However even a factor of 2 is already too much, since every element is literally doubled in height and width.Multiplayer is currently in beta, and makes the same mistake that killed multiplayer for the original: It forces usage of a centralized third-party service which may die at any time. There is an option for LAN multiplayer, but that is unlikely to work well on the internet.As a postscript: Since the original version is included, it's recommended to simply play that. It also has a tiny UI, but a very sharply-designed one, and the screen is locked to 4:3, but otherwise it does not exhibit the beta-like issues of the remaster.			"

												UPDATE: Tried to run Homeworld 2 Remastered, game won't launch. Score updated appropriately.I've only had a brief time with the game but here's my initial experiences/opinions from playing the Homeworld 1 Remastered campaign:First the bad;1) Controls not rebindable. Tried with several keys on one command, and half a dozen different commands after and even clearing the keys from commands before attempting to add new ones results in an error message blocking you from rebinding (""the key is already in use as ""command"""").2) First mission glitched, skipped initial objective rendering the mission impossible to finish. Restarted mission to try again, all going well until told to capture drone with salvage ship, whereupon my fighters (set on aggressive mode, as per the previous objective instructions) sped half way across the map to kill it before my salvage ship got there, resulting in another failed mission. Third time's the charm and I finally finish it.3) Second mission goes well. Apart from a brief issue getting my ship to behave, which I suggest was my fault, the mission went smoothly, enemy ships were fought,♥♥♥♥♥♥exploded, all went well.4) Third mission again bugged. Told to kill one assault frigate and capture the other with salvage ship. Salvage ship will approach the frigate but refuses to interact with it, no matter how much damage I deal first. Thought I might be missing a ship but the research menu shows no further research to be made.5) Sound for weapons firing keeps cutting out. Looks like a sound channels issue but even after bumping it from the default (apparently 0, but obviously not otherwise there'd have been no sound) to 100 the problem persists.6) Lighting issues, you can rotate the camera to blatantly see the sun in the background but the side of an object facing you is still brightly lit up, while it has shadows around the edge (as though your camera is a brighter light source than the sun. It's a little nitpick but it bugs the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me nontheless.Now the good;1) The remastered textures are pretty, even on moderate settings and zoomed in far the game looks amazing.2) The cutscenes are great too.3) Having Homeworld 2's UI in the Homeworld 1 campaign is a blessing, probably the best design decision they've made overall. I really can't stress how great this is.4) The new music is spectacular, that opening cutscene where the mothership undocks has some great music.5) Alt-F4 works.Finally, the ugly;1) There's no game speed option. I can't remember if the classic Homeworld had it or not but not having one in a more modern game is just plain silly. Resource collectors can take upwards of 2-3 minutes to grab a handful of resources (often only enough for one or two ships or a single research project) and can't be sped up. Any game that puts me in a situation where I'm actively flicking through a magazine while playing is not winning brownie points.2) There are 4 UI scale options (not on the options screen, but rather the pause (F10) screen. It's a nice feature to have but at size 2 the UI's group panel (where you assign tactics and formations) is too small to read and at size 3 it takes up about two-thirds of the screen space and leaves you a tiny rectangle in the middle to play with. This could be solved quite easily with more granular options like a slider instead of just 4 settings.All that said; it's Homeworld - they're great games and nothing will change that.Overall: I can't recommend it. It feels like an old game dragged kicking and screaming into the modern era, which is equal parts good and bad (mostly good, thankfully) but the bugs and glitches had me reaching for Alt-F4 after only two and a bit missions of the campaign. Typically the start of a game is more polished than the end (simply because it has more time with the playtesters) and if the quality of the first three missions is anything to go by the rest of the game must be an absolute trainwreck.Add in the fact that the multiplayer is still in beta, which is a broad definition these days anyway, while the game is billed as a full release and you've got something that stinks of being rushed out the door to take advantage of a rapidly depopulated release window.Sorry Gearbox but you've blown it pretty hard at release.Score: 1 ""It's dead Jim"" out of 10.

												So once again I was led to think a old game is great. Never played before. I love space RTS. Sins was by far the best ever made. Because of all the hype and people claiming HW is the best I just had to give it a try and was happy to see they were remastering it and selling here on Steam. Big mistake to listen to people once again. For all of you out there that are looking for a great RTS/4x space game, and expect the UI to be good then do not buy this game. Here's why. If you come from playing Sins of a Solar Empire you will know that the user interface is simply the best and easiest. Why any game out there does not do this to this day is beyoned me. SInce the Devs claimed they ""remastered"" this game I expected that they would truly put it up to par with what a great game should be today. They did not. I suspect the UI was no diferent when the game was first made to now with the remastered. So really all that was done was graphics update. Thats it. Made the game look pretty. Well this was great but why the hell could you not update the UI? I'm sorry but I just think once again I wasted my money on another space game that could have been great with very simple UI updates. How hard is it to do a ""stratigic Zoom"" such as in Sin's???? Why is this so hard to accomplish by game Devs? Why do I have to go though steps and press multiple keys in order to zoom in on a ship and pan around to get a good view of a battle? Why? Hopfully there will be a new game soon that can accomplish this very apparently hard task. For old players returning I'm asumimg you dont care and love the game just the way it is. Fine. If thats whom the Devs want to sell to okay then. To anyone new looking to buy the game and expect it to be easy and intuitive UI dont expect much. Pros: Im sorry but its not fun to have to deal with the UI and therefore has ruined the game completely. No pros. Poorly remade. Devs wanted a quick buck by remaking the graphics and changed nothing else to make it a fun and easy to use game.Cons: 1. Crashes on a pretty regular bases. Did not harp on this to much because I'm asuming is a simple bug that will get adressed soon? 2. Horrible old UI that is just completly a turn off. Waste of a potentially good game. 3. No multiplayer. Or at least did not see how to do it.  4. Horrible tutorial. Very buggy. Very basic. Crashes.5. In a good game when you hover the mouse over a subject in the game you get a good description in a paragraph or so describing what it is. This was very poorly done if at all on some items and areas of the game. Basically figure it all out your self guys. Verry didsapointed. Please someone make a good space game like Sin's again with a seamless and sratigic zoom. There is no reason I should have to push multiple keys to acomplish camerea and UI features. Should all be simple and done with the mouse.			"

												These games took quite a bit of messing around and looking up issues on the forums in order to get to work on my system.  Now that they are working, the remastered versions look amazing, however there are still quite a few bugs to workout.  Such as ship formations, tactics, mouse speeds, and general balancing.  Further some of the missions appear to be bugged as well..The classic versions of these games are unaltered, and are almost more playable than the remastered versions because of the ability to use formations and tactics.  However, the options to change the game resolutions are lacking... no widescreen options at all.  I guess you could go into the registry and edit this to force it to work at a higher resolution, but again, it takes a lot of work to get the program to run the way you want it.  Although they are unaltered, I do wish they built in a few more graphics options.  Further Homeworld Classic crashes on mission 4 in the campaign.  I have not found a workaround for this yet...I played the remastered versions for a few hours and although they are stunning to look at, the mechanics are very lacking still...... So for now, i'm playing the classic versions until the remastered versions are fixed.			"

												When this game first came out I was very happy with the visuals and all of the fluff, everything was well done and felt great.I'll precurse with this: If you have never played Homeworld 1 singleplayer, GET THIS GAME, I don't care if you play the original or the Remaster, get this ♥♥♥♥ing game and PLAY THE SINGLEPLAYER, don't spoil any of the story, go in as blind as possible, DO IT.Other than, the glaring flaws, the butchering of formations, the removal of projectiles, the implementation of Homeworld 1 mechanics had failed when attempting to use an upgraded version of Homeworld 2, a game that stripped many essential features out in exchange for making a smoother multiplayer experience.Back on release I wouldn't have reccomended the game, but times change, and as the ancient guidestone and legends fortold, we WOULD return to Higarra.With the updates since, projectiles have been reintroduced, the terrible Homeworld 2 mechanics have been stripped from HW1 and there's even been steps made to make Homeworld 2 backwards compatible with some central mechanics from the first game, such as formations and real simulated projectiles. Homeworld 1 Remastered operates roughly as how I remember it now, the old experience has been recreated dutifully and the mechanics being changed to match turns this from an old reference to a true recreation of the experience.Homeworld 1 Remastered is fantastic and essentially can now replace the original for me (however it still will hold a place in my heart)Homeworld: Cataclysm Remastered would be a dream come true but I'm not sure that's going to happen.And Homeworld 2 Remastered is, well, it's alright. Boring story, less interesting gameplay and story overall, less connection to your fleet, but hey! The multiplayer is pretty cool.Entirely reccomend if you haven't played homeworld before.			"

												As someone who never played the original games I have to say I liked this game a lot. The story is fantastic in HW1 and you really feel like you’re a part of this fight for survival to reach the home world. HW2 has better units and game mechanics although the story doesn't quite compare with the first one. Overall this game is fantastic and worth getting for any RTS fan, it also includes the original games for those who wish to experience the unaltered versions of the game.			"

												Would not reccomend because they remastered more than just the graphics, they changed the entire feel of the original HW. Instead of using the vector-based physics from the original, they've replaced it with the HW2 system which was completely different. HW1 now feels like a re-skinned version of HW2. The missions are the thankfully the same, so are the cutscenes, but the feel of the first game has been removed.			"

												I love this game. And its not just because I am a nostalgic fan. If you want an amazing story that has a great execution coupled with beatifully stylized and appropriate cutscenes, all with updated graphics. Then this is your game. Unless you hate space. But if you love all these things and love space then this is great. There are so few plot holes which you would only see if you obssess over this game (much like me). If you're on the fence about it due to price, then wait, for story, don't be its legendary, for content, you can get a solid 20 hours out of just the story if you play smart, for graphics, they're lovely. So buy it. DO IT!			"

												Having played both games when they came out as a kid, I do have a bit of a nostalgia factor here. That being said I do like stratagy games even though I am not very good at them. Homeworld is one of those games I spent a lot of time playing and still really enjoy. I actully installed and played homeworld 2 not all that long ago.I'd say a lot of the nostalgia bait these days is terrible but homeworld was a pretty good and balanced game back in the day that this doesn't feel all that bad. Homeworld 1 looks pretty dated by todays standards and even homeworld 2 has it's moments so the improvements are nice.I did notice a few things not working like they did back in the day. I was excited to see Sphere formation back but when I tried to use it on a group of ships to guard a resource contoller it did not work. Outside of a few things like that it's great and you not only get the 2 remasters you get the orginal games as well so if you want to really see how they where back then you could. I'd say well worth the price!			"

I would imagine it will take longer as the resources are a bit more balanced so when you auto collect it when you go to the next mission, it actually makes you think what you spend it on instead of like in homeworld 1, in one mission you get 100,000 resource units some time before the great nebula.

												Homeworld Remastered is amazing. I'm not too much of an RTS player (Halo Wars and Homeworld are the only ones I've really played).  I played Homeworld in it's original format and for being a 12 year old at the time it was amazing.  The music is celestial and the entire environment really kind of lends a sense of isolation as you journey home.  The Remastered is worth every penny.  It's beautiful to look at and a joy to play (thought the learning curve for me was a bit high).  That being said, I'd recommend it to anyone looking to try something new.			"

												I have been following the journey of the HomeWorld series for a long time now. From when me and my brother played it together originally all those years ago to the confusing bio ships of cataclysm that everyone tried to forget and on to the amazing HW2 (oh and lets not forget the Complex mod!! amazing work).So when i heard HW was getting a dust off and a new coat of paint i honestly couldnt wait. It doesnt disappoint, the game is gorgeous and the whole presentation of the package is ...acceptable. I say ""acceptable"" because the way it is packaged feels like it has lost some of its ..strength of character. The game is still there, the music (which is amazing!!) and the gameplay are as remembered but now it has a feeling of being squashed together and in someway lost some of its uniqueness. I focus mainly here on the multiplayer game, there are some strongly unbalanced aspects of joining all four races together such as the core stats of some of the original ships, this in my humble opinion should be looked at a lor more closely to give a better cohesion between races and better gameplay for the buyer.Saying that, i enjoyed the new ""raiders"" content and i appreciate all the work the devs are doing and hopefully will be doing to further stream line the experience.In short, buy it. the game is iconic and a still havnt found another like it.

I didn't get to play it nearly enough as time wore on before changes in OS made it impossible, which always irked and kind of made me sad. When I heard there was a project out to make a limited number of remastered games I was pleased, but didn't think I'd be able to set aside the money in time.Then my brother told me he had seen something about it on Steam, and boy was I happy when I looked and it turned out he was right.I bought it at full price, and once again, worth every last penny.

												What new can I possibly write about Homeworld and its sequel? Unique in time of their original releases, both games still hold up well, after all those years, and prove that design is everything when it comes to creating memorable gaming experiences. Despite somewhat dated appearance both are still very much playable, though I personally have much trouble getting both old versions to run properly on my modern hardware. Thus comes the Remastered Collection, allowing me to again experience both games.You see, I never played Homeworld games specifically for their mechanics, but rather – for one-of-a-kind atmosphere, fantastically designed universe and somewhat mystical approach to space travel. For me, those two games were just wonderful, interactive stories, and strategic gameplay was only a package in which they were delivered. This is probably what makes me oblivious to all the mechanical alterations, and maybe even flaws, that Gearbox has introduced in this remaster. As for the stories themselves I will not say a word – they are to be experienced personally.Mechanically, Homeworld is an RTS in 3D space, to put it bluntly. You collect resources, build units, attack enemies and win missions either by destruction, timer, capture or any combination of those. Sounds pretty standard, right? Well, it is, sort of. Third dimension adds a new element to unit positioning, and in this game it really matters which units attack which targets, in which order and how they are set up in space. You need to apply formations effective in each situation, change unit tactics and generally move around the battlefield a lot more than in a standard RTS. More often than not games also ask for quite a degree of multitasking – luckily in singleplayer active pause comes in handy, allowing to place orders and think out the situation before acting.As I mentioned, not everything works as it should in Homeworld Remastered. Especially in the first campaign it is evident that a lot of things broke when transplanted onto the new game engine. Omission of refuelling mechanic drastically changes the way strike craft operates and renders some ships almost useless. It is worth mentioning though that in the instance of Kadeshi fighters the fuel did seem to run out for them, so it is rather inconsistent. Conversely, in Homeworld 2 Remastered formations seem largely broken. There are more things behaving differently from original, so purists and hardcore game fans will be put off, but I – for reasons I mentioned above – enjoyed both campaigns to the fullest. Sure, sometimes I had to put more clickwork to make things fly around as intended, however none of the issues would break the game for me.I have not tested the multiplayer component yet, though I am not much of an online gamer so I might never do that actually. Keep in mind that my review is from single player standpoint only. Also I’d like to point out that the lack of Cataclysm in the remaster is a bit disappointing, but maybe, just maybe, some day they will be able to release that too.From a visual standpoint, the game is the definition of what a “remaster” should be. Every model in the game has been reworked from ground up and even the smallest fighters are now more detailed than largest capital ships in the original Homeworld. Great texturework is accompanied by a set of subtle effects like volumetric lighting, multiple-source dynamic shadows and lighting, depth of field and of course high resolution support. Animatics between missions have been re-drawn in high definition and compressed with quality in mind. Homeworld Remastered Collection is simply gorgeous. Stunning visuals are accompanied by great voiceover and absolutely stunning soundtrack, which is as far as I’m concerned absolutely unique in games world, combining ethnic and symphonic themes into one. The game simply feels majestic at times. Audio has been, of course, cleaned up since the original.Overall, there is really no reason one should not get Homeworld Remastered Collection. It is a great re-release of two great real time strategy games, providing many hours of gameplay even in single player mode, though I'll state this again - for me most important here are the epic story and atmosphere. There is already extensive mod support too, meaning that fans of altering the game will be able to find something for themselves, and purists should be able to ‘fix’ the game soon enough. In terms of presentation it’s flawless. If it was flawless mechanically, we’d have an absolute remaster benchmark on our hands. As it is, it’s just great.			"

												Even though I recommended this game, I don't particularly enjoy it all that much. Yes it's much like the original but I wish there would have been improvements to it. It's just tiny things such as ""esc"" bringing up a menu to exit the game or other features to make everything feel more smooth. This is why remastered games annoy me now and then. The camera and navigating the battlefield is as clunky as it was before. When the videos are loading I get black stripes across the screen which is something I've never had an issue with before even though some settings fix this when turned on. I've played hours on this game with the original version years ago but the remastered definitely looks nicer, just they haven't really fixed any previous problems. I'd much rather see them make a new homeworld where they make the game run smoother and the UI not so clunky.			"

From when me and my brother played it together originally all those years ago to the confusing bio ships of cataclysm that everyone tried to forget and on to the amazing HW2 (oh and lets not forget the Complex mod!! amazing work).So when i heard HW was getting a dust off and a new coat of paint i honestly couldnt wait. It doesnt disappoint, the game is gorgeous and the whole presentation of the package is ...acceptable. I say ""acceptable"" because the way it is packaged feels like it has lost some of its ..strength of character. The game is still there, the music (which is amazing!!) and the gameplay are as remembered but now it has a feeling of being squashed together and in someway lost some of its uniqueness. I focus mainly here on the multiplayer game, there are some strongly unbalanced aspects of joining all four races together such as the core stats of some of the original ships, this in my humble opinion should be looked at a lor more closely to give a better cohesion between races and better gameplay for the buyer.Saying that, i enjoyed the new ""raiders"" content and i appreciate all the work the devs are doing and hopefully will be doing to further stream line the experience.In short, buy it. the game is iconic and a still havnt found another like it.

												Fantastic redo of a legendary game of old.  I know it is not a perfect remastery as much of Homeworld 1 is now controlled in the same scheme as Homeworld 2, but I was not expecting a perfect port. (In fact losing the refueling of Homeworld 1 is not going to cause me to shed tears.)  This simply allows us old die hards to enjoy a stupendously good and classic PC game from our youth and encourage newcomers to get out there and try a game that would not have been created in the present.  Here's hoping this inspires a Homeworld 3!!!			"

												The Homeworld franchise was one of the few series of games I completed and, more astonishingly, kept going back to and finishing again and again. Few games hit the sweet spot between atmosphere, empathy and sheer joy. These were among them.So how does the remastering match up? In all honesty, it has a few problems. They are minor, very minor and to be fair to the developers - anything less than perfection was going to be unjustly highlighted. None of the problems are show stoppers; sure - you have to micromanage your fleets a little more, sure - sometimes they get a little carried away and don't do precisely what you tell them to do, but hey! This is Homeworld! Remastered!I can forgive a lot more than the minor infractions this game has because the developers took the time and effort to raise a classic from our past and give it new life. Without that dedication, we wouldn't be here talking about these fine games. So thank you.Found the source code for Cataclysm yet? ;)			"

												I have been looking for a game like this since I was about 10 years old. Now I can say that i have found it:A space RTS with huge scale.(I'm currently playing Homeworld Remastered)Campaign: You play as the Kushdan trying to escape the vice of the Taiidan Empire,each mission tells the story of the Kushdan mothership and other smaller ships, and their journey to the edge of the galaxy, and away from the danger of the Taiidan. Some mission offer variety, such as shooting asteroids to shield the mothership from damage or fighting off swarms of small pod ships that hail from a alien race in a nebula. I'm stuck on a difficult mission right now but hope to finish soon.Player v Computer:Basically the same thing as Skirmish in other RTS games. Choose a race. Choose an enemy. Destroy the enemy capital ships and Mothership. Collect resources. Have fun.Extra missions: Unlocked as you progress through the Campaign. One mission included has you destroy an enemy convoy.Soundtrack: Made by (god knows who, I don't care really), and reminds me of EVE Online and FTL music put together. Music changes depending on the combat situation of either the mission or your units in the battle zone.I give Homeworld Remastered a 9/10 (and I'm sorry I didn't review Homeworld Two Homeworld one has swallowed enough of my time :) )			"

												I wanted an actual, proper remastering of Homeworld 1, not a HW1 overhaul mod for the inferior HW2 engine, which not only breaks so many behaviors and basic functions, but also nerfed the enemy AI to the point where the campaign is a joke. If you prefer HW2, then hey, this is right up your alley, but as it stands, the only way to get a true HW1 experience is to play the archive copy included.			"

												I came across a let's play of Homeworld 2 years ago, and instantly fell in love. The graphics, the combat mechanics, the truly three-dimensional movement! It was like watching poetry in motion, blowing up lesser poetry in the process. I think that metaphor got away from me.When I heard about the Remastered Collection, I knew I had to have it. No matter what it would cost, I had to have a game as beautifully redone as this one was. So, I got the game when it became available, and eagerly awaited for the release date to play. Heck, I even had my brother build me a new computer to be able to handle the game!Then the game arrived, I opened up the launcher, started the first mission.... and lost three times. That's when I remembered that I'm kind of terrible at playing RTSes.In short, this game is so good looking I forgot how terrible I am at playing it. If you like Real Time Strategy games and science fiction, why haven't you bought this game yet?!			"

This would be par for course in modern gaming if they had patched the problems... BUT THEY DIDNT. It appears to be a dead project, Gearbox done ripped us off.			"

												The overall ""Homeworld"" experience is really fantastic. The games got all the mechanical and artistic elements right, from the way the gameplay and GUI interact, to the music, to the story, to the artwork - the series is legenday for good reason.There is a pretty big ""YMMV"" point when you play it again, though.See, when you play the games the first time, you're awed by the experience as a whole. The artistry of it all just kind of overwhelms you. However, when you come back to the games (especially ""Homeworld 2"") after a good long while, a bit of disappointment does creep in. You're no longer gaping in amazement at the setting, and so the macro-structure of the gameplay becomes more noticeable.The ""Homeworld"" series - at least to me - takes the unfortunate route of melding a single-solution puzzle with the RTS genre. You can't really find your own groove. Instead, you end up having to figure out ""the one magic trick"" that gets you through the mission. To me, that's an unwelcome subversion of the strategy element. The player's choices seem frustratingly constrained at times, whether it's from a lack of available resources or from the scenario requiring a very specific fleet structure.The achievement that is the ""Homeworld"" saga is, in the end, dimmed only slightly by this problem. I still see the series as THE Gold Standard for this kind of game. This remaster is 100% worth picking up; I just think it's also worth mentioning that certain choices regarding the gameplay might not be everybody's cup of tea.			"

Highly recommended for any RTS fan and, for those who miss the paticularities of the classic 1999 version, Homeworld Classic and Homeworld 2 Classic are also included!  My only desire for the remastered collection is that they find a way to make Homeworld Cataclysm happen.  I know there is no chance (different studio created it and is rumored to have lost the source code), but you can alwys dream =D			"

												EDIT/Update:  Looks like the most recent patch has fixed 95% of my initial issues with the game... almost done HW1 remastered with none of the complaints that I had originally.I would NOW recommend this game... if any other issues crop up, I am sure that will be fixed in the next patches... For those who played the original (way back when) some of the interface (and some mechanics) has changed but was so long ago that I am sure won't matter.  Just the occational... ""Hmmm, I don't remember it being that way""   :)Original post: I would NOT have purchased if I knew how poorly the ""Remastering"" was.  On a 1080 screen... looks gorgeous!  Playability is NOT on par with original game, AI seem broken, and missions will not always complete even tho you have done the mission... so you have to start over again and hope it lets you complete.This is currently a POOR version of Homeworld... is broken at this time.   The original was a major treat to play when came out and this game has the CHANCE of winning our hearts back (and find new ones to love this game) but at the current implimentation of ""Remastered"" -- it is just a disappointment and exercise in frustration (not at all playable like the original)			"

												Although not perfect, this remastered edition is great fun with few bugs. Some people have said that they have trouble playing online, but I have been playing with my two friends who own the game without any issues whatsoever. The campaigns are very difficult and a little slow especially at the beginning, and also at the end of each level when you simply have to build up your fleet to max so you don't die later. The music and graphics are amazing. I play on a laptop with Intel HD 4400 Graphics and this is probably the best looking game that I can get decent framerates out of. It really is not very demanding, while it looks astonishing. Frame rate sometimes drops in the teens during massive explosions, but usually holds around 30 for me with vsync engaged. This is a huge deal for me because my laptop limits the games I can buy and enjoy at the moment.			"

												Love the original and the new graphics in the remastered are amazing. However, there are more bugs in the remastered game than the original. Especially when it comes to objectives in story mode. It is very easy to trip a future event such as locating a ship etc... If you do this then it becomes imposible to continue with the level. You must go back and restart the level again. I have run into this problem on nearly every level so far. On the plus side, if you capture a ship with the salvage corvetts, your other units no longer destroy it before it reaches a carrier or the mothership.			"

												I am a new fan to the Homeworld series, having still been playing with Legos when the original games came out. As such, my review is unbiased. That is not to say that I haven't played the originals at all, as they are both available along with the Remastered versions free of charge.Pros: The game's graphics have been modernized in the best ways possible. That is not to say it'll kill your pc, as I run this game fairly well on my stock laptop at max graphics. The interactions between objects looks great (resource collectors docking with flagships, units being launched from carriers, etc.)The game has a great modding community that works hard to bring a new experience once you've decided you want to see more in the same game.Cons: Many old fans will tell you this, and I am inclined to agree: Formations are broken. In the classics, units in formations would hold formation at all times, but the Remastered formations simply affect what your forces do before they meet an enemy unit. They break formation and act as if they never had one in the first place until they get a new move order. However, Gearbox is working on fixing that issue, and in the Remasters there are more formations, allowing for a more diverse screenshot at the moment. Hopefully we can see that fixed soon.The multiplayer is still a beta, as it mixes both game's factions into the same game and thus has balance issues. Again, this is being worked on.			"

												My introduction to the whole Homeworld saga began with Cataclysm, a game I tried to play when I was thereabouts 6, and so frustrated with its difficulty, gave it up for years. Years later, I picked it up and learned it thoroughly, and enjoyed it, and marvelled at the rich history of this game I thought had been a standalone.Delightfully surprised, years later, to find and buyHomeworld 2, my re-introduction to the series has been completely backwards, in unravelling. This remastered collection is a fantastic culimination of the first two Homeworld games, graphically superb in nearly every way, the first of which I've only just finished playing after writing this review.The Remastered collection is as I expected, graphically improved. Many hardcore fans, however, point out changes to the game's original mechanics (the original titles, however, are also included in this should you wish to play those). What you get is essentially four games, two that look better than the others, both with the occasional hiccup I can forgive because it's such a solid experience, no other RTS had (or has, really) a 3-dimensional map, both up and down in space; not to mention the wonderful take on the whole Moses in the desert, trying to find Zion.If you've still got your old Homeworld disks, and are thinking about buying this game, then all you'd probably get out of it is a slicker ride; those newcomers who have yet to experience the game and want it al dressed up, just want to see what all the fuss is about, or want a trip down memory lane in style, then this is the game for you.10/10 would find Israel again.

												I want to like this game, but it seems like lately most of the time I just get frustrated and angry when playing it. I've now encountered multiple game breaking bugs that make the experience unenjoyable. So far I've only played Homeworld 1 Remastered, but there are two missions in particular that come to mind. One has events that failed to fire, causing many a frustrated restarts and browsing of the discussion boards for a solution, only to find many others had the same prblem.And another was one in which after finally getting the first 20+ minutes of the mission done correctly, my mothership was killed by an enemy spawn wave, forcing me to restart yet again. Not to worry, I had just saved! But alas, the save was corrupted, and I really did have to restart.I know that it might be a bit unfair to rate what is on the whole a excellent game based on a handful of bugs, but they really are coloring the whole experience for me, and they should have been addressed by now. And honestly, when missions are mostly just sitting around waiting for ships to navigate an enormous map, restarting just feels painful. I'll come back and give it another try in a bit, but at the moment, I can't recommend it.			"

												It's Homeworld and looks nice..... 10/10However... The formations are pretty garbage 4/10The main problem with this game is that they will probobly never patch the formation issue, they have been nice enough to patch a lot of the problems but they don't seem to care about the formations... And that is a big issue... It is the only problem that I really have with the game other than that it is great and I highly recommend it. Both the first and second game are great and the multiplayer is quite fun as well.If you want to have a fun single player experience and you like strategy games this is a game for you!And if you have a friend that will play this game multiplayer with you that is a huge bonus and you can have lots of fun.I loved the original game in 1998 and I love this one. It's not without a few problems but I can look past them and just have a good time.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love this game, but I am disappointed with whatever Gearbox has done with the Remastered Collection. It operated perfectly fine until whatever happened. I have no idea if it was a patch, recent unposted update, but I can't even start this game anymore. It doesn't start when i press play, but only when I enter the game files, seek out the launcher, and start it from there, and then it doesn't load the mods I have. I don't know what happened, but it seems that Gearbox has given up on the Remastered Collection of the greatest RTS ever made, and has moved on to it's half wit little brother Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak (great game, has everything that makes Homeworld what it is, but it feels like it's missing something that Homeworld has had all along.).If they ever release an effective patch or update that fixes these listed issues, this review will be changed in the blink of an eye, but until then, I can't let my sorrows stay bottled up in the cellar, they must be listed to warn potential buyers.

												I played the original Homeworld back in the day, and it was one of the most epic games I ever played back then. The Remastered the just makes it like 10x better. The visuals are amazing and the game is so smooth. Homeworld is probably the best RTS I've played, and I've played a lot of RTS. Pretty much everything about this game is awesome.			"

												As someone who has indeed played the original (albeit never beat it since I was still quite young, stuck on the supernova research station level hahaha), I have to say that this collection is a MUST have and a MUST play for any and all fans of RTS games and great stories, not to mention it having an amazing middle-eastern influenced soundtrack, and really cool space ship designs. Yes, the HW1 remaster does have issues with it's strike craft AI being really stupid at times because of issues with remaking HW1 with the HW2 engine but that won't hurt your overall enjoyment of the game; it was still quite the enjoyable experience (the HW2 remaster works just fine). And in addition, if you're a veteran and are stubborn to accept crappy HW1 strike craft AI, they've even bundled the original HW1 and 2 with this deal! It CAN be quite challenging to newcomers but you can easily learn from initial mistakes and adapt.A few tips for new players:general:-remember that resources and your fleet are persistent, meaning they carry through each level in both HW 1 and 2's campaigns; try not to loose too many ships or waste too many resources or else you could be setting yourself up to being forced to restart from the very beginning-in the remaster, any resources you have not yet harvested in a level by the end of the level will automatically be added to your resource unit count once you hyperspace to the next level, so no need waiting for your collectors, if you've developed that habit as veteran HW player.HW1:-USE SALVAGE CORVETTES; I cannot stress how important capturing ships is. Capture as often as possible and in this priority order: Heavy cruisers>destroyers(any type)>ion cannon frigates>assault or support frigates. Heck, capture a few turanic raider corvettes in the earlier levels. Early in the game when you're really strapped for resources, capturing is the best way to acquire a powerful fleet.-stop using fighters all together other than bombers when you're at late/end game in the campaign: as I have stated, fighter AI in HW 1 remastered is quite dumb, and I've literally had an entire wing of 30-40 defenders wiped out in seconds. Bombers are still somewhat useful for adding additional damage when attacking capital ships however. For all strike craft vs. strike craft engagements in late/endgame, you should be using purely multigun corvettes. -take advantage of the time the game gives you when you've cleared the level and rebuild any lost ships before you hyperspace to the next level. Many levels in this game pits you against massive forces right from the start of the level and you will want to be very prepared for anything. You will not have this luxury for the most part in HW2, btw. HW2:-Flak frigates, marine frigates, defense field frigates, proximity sensor probes, and sensor distortion probes are completely useless; do NOT invest/use them. Capturing in HW2 is pretty much useless, since anything and everything can and will shoot down marine frigates in time while they are boarding an enemy ship, but unfortunately some levels require you to use one to fulfill mission objectives, in which you should build them for that and then retire immediately afterwards and use that space for an ion or torpedo frigate instead. Same goes for that defense field frigate which has a virtually useless shield ability that lasts like 5 seconds, but you will need 2 of them for this one mission objective in this one level, so likewise, retire them when you're done with them.-Use carriers more: HW2 does not have support frigates nor effective salvaging ships, so you'll have to approach this game a bit differently in general. I highly recommend sending out a carrier behind your main fleet to act as a repair station/support frigate to repair strike craft wings and to also keep building/supplying fresh new ships to your main fighting groups because unlike in HW1, you will be building most of your fleet on  your own instead of capturing. -delay mission objectives whenever possible to rebuild your fleet: having your fleet at full maxed out fighting power is important more than ever now with how much salvaging sucks in this compared to HW1. You do gain alot more resources alot more quickly so you should almost always have the full 14 fighter squadrons, 12 corvette squadrons, 21 frigates, and later on 5 destroyers and 2 battlecruisers cap, or at least keep it that way whenever possible (and before the final mission at least, have the cap of 4 carriers, trust me, you'll be thanking me in the final mission).-strike craft are actually VERY good this time, so DO NOT hesistate to use interceptors and bombers. Use the pulsar gunships in conjunction with bombers to attack frigates and capital ships but also against corvettes whenever needed.-always pick torpedo frigates over flak frigates, like, ALWAYS; flak frigates suck. anyways, tl;dr,  I LOVE homeworld and I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I really hope gearbox decides to do HW cataclysm in the future even if they lost source code and would have to rebuild the assets from scratch; the beast and kiith somtaw were badass.			"

The space combat is 3D and you can watch it from any angle. Taking out enemy ships is satisfying and they always go with a pop and boom. Remastered, it has all the sparkle of the first time around, and if this IS your first time around, buckle up!			"

												A fairly great remaster of an RTS classic. Some minor issues early on but hopefully they've been fixed by now.Homeworld in my book is a legendary game, and it's hard for a remaster to fault it in any way. It's one of the few early games to offer a 3rd dimension for an RTS. Storyline still holds its weight to this day as well.The remaster brings both games into an updated version of the HW2 engine. Complete with fully remastered music, sound effects and voiceovers. But they left out the ending credits featuring Yes? That was a letdown.If you're a fan of Homeworld, you won't be disappointed. If you've never played Homeworld then I'd suggest you pick this up.			"

												I have been looking for a game like this since I was about 10 years old. Now I can say that i have found it:A space RTS with huge scale.(I'm currently playing Homeworld Remastered)Campaign: You play as the Kushdan trying to escape the vice of the Taiidan Empire,each mission tells the story of the Kushdan mothership and other smaller ships, and their journey to the edge of the galaxy, and away from the danger of the Taiidan. Some mission offer variety, such as shooting asteroids to shield the mothership from damage or fighting off swarms of small pod ships that hail from a alien race in a nebula. I'm stuck on a difficult mission right now but hope to finish soon.Player v Computer:Basically the same thing as Skirmish in other RTS games. Choose a race. Choose an enemy. Destroy the enemy capital ships and Mothership. Collect resources. Have fun.Extra missions: Unlocked as you progress through the Campaign. One mission included has you destroy an enemy convoy.Soundtrack: Made by (god knows who, I don't care really), and reminds me of EVE Online and FTL music put together. Music changes depending on the combat situation of either the mission or your units in the battle zone.I give Homeworld Remastered a 9/10 (and I'm sorry I didn't review Homeworld Two Homeworld one has swallowed enough of my time :) )			"

												I decided to play through both H1 and 2 before writing a review, just to make sure I had an accurate idea of what has been changed. I'm not going to say much about the original Homeworld releases - I'm sure there's years of reviews already, suffice to say you will already know if you like this kind of thing.Without a doubt, this Remaster is one of the best examples of it's kind, applied to one of the best RTS games ever made. Graphically, it's sublime - the upgraded textures and effects make this look like some kind of blockbuster sci-fi movie, only you're playing it rather than watching it. The missions themselves have been tweaked slightly to make them a little less ridiculous - Gearbox are already posting fixes and further tweaks to the aspects of the missions that were less hard and more simply unfair (Radiation patches in missions being much easier to see, for example). The missions are still something of a challenge (including the fun Thaddis Sabah mission where the opposing Vaygr forces seemingly don't have a population cap) and both titles are still games of the early noughties.... i.e. you are expected to use your grey matter as much as your reflexes - but the core gameplay was so ahead of it's time that when attached to the new visuals, it looks like a brand new AAA title.I believe they've updated the voice actors in H2 to use the same ones they used in H1, and the new UI is common to both versions. The resulting effect is that the games feel like different chapters of the same story rather than seperate games, and I'll be honest, the package works better for it. There are a few negatives. The 'Collection' doesn't include the cleaned up, ultra-impressive remastered soundtracks, instead presented as DLCs. Personally I think they should have been given the 'all-inclusive' nature of the release, but meh. A minor nitpick that you can rectify in the next Steam sale.Formations are a bit broken. Ships still assume them when ordered but break when they do something else, some of the time. I do have to admit that this was an aspect of the original games that I never really bothered with that much, and given Gearbox's track record for supporting this game it wouldn't surprise me if it's patched by the time you read this review. The games's (particularly H2) annoying habit of dragging your attention away mid-battle for a cutscene is still here, and it doesn't include Homeworld Cataclysm, on account of it's source code apparently being lost. It apparently crashes in MP often, but I don't do much MP so can't say that with any certainty.It's not quite perfect.... but if you're into space games, RTS, or simply truly amazing gameplay, you will find this to be awfully near to it. The only people I wouldn't recommend this collection to are people who dislike sci-fi or fans of mediocrity.			"

												Homeworld 1 & 2 are considered two of my all time favourite titles, the visual upgrade and audio upgrade are insane. True to the nature of each title with the tender care and attention to every minor detail to revamp them to look better than alot of titles of today currently. The sheer depth of the game from the units, strategies and the 3D environment that you can move your ships around create so much diversity. If anything give the game a look, I cannot recommend this enough it is stellar and you would not be disappointed!

												This is my first steam game review and it's a pleasure to say something about this old new game.  The grraphics I give 8/10.  The game play is 9/10 becasue it's not hard right now with my 20 hours worth of game play.  One thing I always loved about Homeworld is the 3D enviornment.  You can attack from above or below and you also have to use certain combinations of attack craft to be successful.  It's also fun to go back and play the origial and see the contrast between the old graphics and the new graphics and also the game play is more like Homeworld 2 in this new version of Homeworld.  Which by the way Homeworld 2 is in my recollection as being a tougher game.  I would recommend this game being worth the full price, I got it on sale cause I'm cheap.  Enjoy!!!			"

												This is one of the most masterful games I've ever played in my entire life.  The campaigns are astonishing, and truly draw you into the world.  They make you want to protect your people, and lead your fleet in the best way possible.  The graphics, the gameplay, and especially the realism (minus sound in space, but I don't care about that) of the battles are unparalelled in other games.  It may be that it is simple by comparison with almost every space game ever (what with only having one resource that you can gather in finite amounts) and that is one part that detracts from this game's replayability.  The campaigns are so astonishing that it's worth the asking price, but I give this warning:If you are thinking about buying this game and you're not really interested in a good story, then this is not for you.  Yes, if you're interested in just haphazardly throwing fleets against one another then it will do so in a beautiful, fun, and incredibly tactically pleasing fashion, but we all know that that gets old eventually.  This game will rely on mods for continued replayability in skirmish mode, but if even a small part of you likes stories and getting emotionally invested in a game, or just want to play a space game where tactical genius actually matters, then this game is for you.

I never played Homeworld 2, so I look forward to that, my only question is, Where is Cataclysm?! I really enjoyed that spinoff, or standalone, or whatever you may call it. If it's a rights issue, I hope its resolved soon, I must have my ramming frigates!			"

												This game is even better than I remembered! I had to get a decent computer with a good graphics card and processor before I could play it very well. I'm kinda bad at strategy, but the game was just a difficult as I remembered. I feel bad not being able to play Cataclysm, though. However, I'm fairly pleased with what Gearbox has done with this game. I have to tell you, having my resources collected for me at the end of each mission in Homeworld 2 actually helped me complete the next mission with a pretty big fleet of ships! I wonder if that's considered cheating? Oh, well.			"

												Highly reccomend this game in the RTS genre, I think you should play the tutorial as the mechanics of 3D navigation aren't very intuitive.The campaigns are both really cool, this game is well worth the price in my opinion.			"

												Holy Moly what a time consumer! But in a really good way! I came away from playing this game feeling very satisfied indeed! Wonder how long my relationship with the girlfriends going to last now I have a new light in my life :) (Yes this game is that good! I have been gaming since a boy so for 2 decades, I can tell you this game ranks in my top 10 Games of all time in my mind, I am not good with the large vocab IGN style write ups so i will K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid!) in saying:BUY...........THIS........GAME!!!!! Definitely a developer worth supporting! (EA take a leaf out of this developers book!!)			"

												So, Having been a massive fan of the homeworld series this game was a must for me. Having just completed Homeworld : Remastered im not disapointed in the slightest, The graphics are nice, Gameplay is the same with everything from cutscenes to the astroid brought into the currenty graphical era.I've read some reviews with people complaining saying the UI isnt the greatest when in game but its exactly how i remember, Yes perhaps oversensitive but once you get the hang of its a breeze.A really nice touch is that the UI is exactly the same in Homeworld 2, So going from one to the other is seamless, Nice touch Gearbox.My only dissapointment is that Homeworld : Cataclysm isnt in this set, Without a doubt my favourite of the whole set and im probably one of the few people to still own it. i will be digging it out very soon for a nostagile session. Hopefully Gearbox find the source code and bring that back to the current Era. If they do i'll buy 2 copies! YA HEAR!So overall 9/10 an excellent game and a credit to Gearbox/Relic "

												Never played the orginals before (wasnt't even alive for the first one) and just from play this collection alone, its a great package with great story and a must buy for anyone looking to try a rts. It isn't too complicated and not too simple to where i find each missions easy. Towards the ends of both games it began become progessivly difficult to a point where im pulling my hair out. But i must say seeing your mothership blow up to a samll enemy fleet that slipped behind in the background is truly awesome and halirious.If your looking to play multiplayer there isn't more then 20 players on per day and finding a game is even rarer. But if you joins some steam groups it does makes it easir to find some players to play some games. I do sometimes hope on the multiplayer with some people, so if anyone is intrested in the multiplayer and looking for some people to play with you can message me.  "

												They truly stepped up the graphics and brought this amazing game into the modern age. I love that they combined H1 and H2 together in multiplayer and skirmish modes as well. (Maybe one day our modding community will bring us the two races from Catyclysm) I was skeptical when I heard gearbox was taking on this project because they aren't in the business of RTS games but they made this a true remake without taking away or adding anything that would take away from this game. This makes me excited for Shipbreakers.			"

												Decently re-made. HW1 is not exactly the same, its using the HW2 engine. But it does come with the original games also. Acually runs ok with most of the settings cranked down on my 2 in 1 windows tablet that has an Atom Baytrail processor but the cutscenes are a little choppy, gameplay is good so far which was a pleasent surprise. on the desktop everything runs smooth.

												Not a remastered edition but a rehashed one. If you've played the original, don't try this - keep your money, memories and old copy intact. If you haven't played Homeworld and can't handle anything but the latest graphics then this is the one for you.Alot of the other reviews sum it up perfectly, some particular points that require ephasis though:-Formations are broken and do not work.-Completely different unit balances compared to the original (especially frigates. They are now just lumps of RUs that specialise in sploding real good).-HW1 remastered hit system is all based on a system of probabilities of hitting a target (like HW2) instead of an actual hit is a hit. As HW1 was designed on an actual hit system, this mucks up the gameplay. Adding to this is HW2's specialisation system coming into play (eg assault frigates are good vs fighters, so if you tell them to attack corvettes, a slower and larger target, all their shots will still miss as they are not a unit ""good vs corvettes""). It is basically a port of HW1 into HW2 therefore if you want to play using the remastered graphics but the orginal gameplay style (of HW1), you can't (defeats the purpose of buying remastered)-Units behave differently than the original Homeworlds (eg corvettes circling an enemy now only use half their guns) - above explains part of this too.-Complete lie when they say you will get the original games - they've fondled all LAN and multiplayer options out of them which is so substantial a change that they can't be considered as original verisons. Therefore you can't play multiplayer with the classics - a key feature which THE CLASSICS HAD (and it wasn't a multiplayer beta strap on like this ""remastered"" edition has. That's right people, when the original Homeworld came out, multiplayer in the Homeworld universe was not in beta - it was already COMPLETE)Given this is a ""mastering"" of a classic, of which all they had to do was improve the graphics, its a very poor show and blatant cash grab leveraging on Homeworld's reputation established so long ago.Will have to consider greatly before buying anything from Gearbox Software			"

												Homeworld is a legendary PC game and I'd love to be able to recommend this Remastered Collection.  At first glance it's everything it was promised to be: a rebuilt version of Homeworld 1 & 2 (no HW:Cataclysm unfortunately) using an updated engine to make the games much prettier, fix many compatibility issues, and address various long-standing bugs.The reason I can't give that recommendation is that the new engine shared by Homeworld 1&2 in this remake is based on Homeworld 2's engine, and it's a fundamentally different game from Homeworld 1.  Many of the issues this causes are cosmetic but others make the game borderline unplayable.  The two most egregious flaws introduced are to do with the ""formation"" and ""tactics"" systems.Formations are theoretically still in the game but ships now break formation for almost any reason.  This frequently reduces the core of the game's combat system to little more than ""have more ships at the fight than your opponent"".  You used to be able to do things like attack from multiple directions while keeping your ships in effective groupings, put your ships into a wall formation to bring more firepower to bear at once, put them in a sphere formation to guard a weaker ship, and so on - none of this works anymore.  You can still take advantage of weaker armor in different areas of your enemy's ships, but it's a disorganized mess.The tactics system, which previously made the difference between your ships focusing on maneuverability or firepower, has been stripped out altogether.  This used to be a very valuable game mechanic, allowing you to press your advantage in one-sided battle to quickly end it before enemy reinforcements arrived, or use maneuverable mode to escape unfavorable situations.  The tactics system is now the same as Homeworld 2's, and basically every other RTS: aggressive (attack on sight), defensive (attack if attacked), and passive (ignore enemies).  This might not sound like a big deal if you've never played Homeworld before, but it was one of the most unique aspects of the game, and it functioned extremely well in combination with smart formation choices.Lesser but still important issues are to do with changes to the game's interface and how various ships function.The game's main user interface has been replaced with one inspired by Homeworld 2, which had much simpler ""rock-paper-scissors"" ship balancing and all that really mattered was ""this ship is good against this ship"".  Homeworld 1 was more complex than this though and its UI gave you appropriately more complex information, including things like fire arc coverage - a major differentiating factor between different ship types.  This is vital information, removed in service of making the game more accessible, but it has the opposite effect: new players won't know what the real advantages between different ships really are, and this is a game that severely punishes choosing the wrong fleet composition.As for the functional issues with various ships, unfortunately there's not much I can say.  I threw up my hands in disgust long before I had the opportunity to experience more than the first five or so missions and a bit of the multiplayer, so there's a lot of stuff I only know about based on what I've heard others say, like how repair ships are apparently broken in some way.  One thing I know about is that the concept of fuel has been removed, and this has huge gameplay implications.  I don't like this change, it's like if Valve added regenerating health and cover mechanics to Half-Life.  I recognize that it's a technical limitation and would require a lot of work to fix, and it's not nearly as big of an issue as formations and tactics being removed though, so it's something I can overlook.  Worrying about fuel did become a hassle at times.edit: One thing I forgot to mention is that Homeworld used a weapon system where projectiles/beams were fired and whether they hit or not depended on... well, whether they actually hit or not.  The bullets were physical objects which could be dodged.  Everything in Homeworld 2's combat is based on accuracy percentages, and this is how Homeworld's combat now works due to it being based on HW2's engine.  This isn't game-breaking but it does make the game feel less... I don't know how to describe it... less real?  Less dynamic?  The results of combat are predictable.  [X] always beats [Y] in [Z] scenario.  The real-world effect of this change is often only cosmetic but I think it does detract from the original game's gameplay feel.-----Gearbox has been vaguely promising a patch to solve at least the formation and tactics problem for almost a year now.  Maybe it'll come out eventually, who knows.  It's hard to forgive that they shipped the game in this state.  It's beginning to look like Homeworld Remastered Collection is just the latest in Gearbox's series of recent acquisitions followed by cynical cash-grabs, which began with Duke Nukem Forever and Aliens Colonial Marines.  With all three of these titles, Gearbox did a big song and dance about how they were huge fans of the franchise and ""wanted to do right by the fans"", then released a broken mess.  At least the had the decency to not add DLC or resource bonus microtransactions.Of the three titles, only Homeworld Remastered Collection was received favorably (mainly by critics and customers who'd never played the original), and it's the only one that's received a follow-up.  You know, it's funny, I don't remember Randy Pitchford sending out any cocky tweets about pre-order numbers for Deserts of Kharak like he did for Homeworld Remastered Collection.  I can't imagine why.			"

												A true classic, where do I begin...-Gameplay is incredible (especialy in 2) and is very engadging. With alot of variety and stratagy not to mention a very crafty AI that will keep you on your toes.-The story in 1 is one of the best in all of gaming and is a truely moving experience.-The backgrounds and textures are absolutely beautiful and shows just how a remaster should be done.The only thing I can say I did not like was that some of the story missions were occasionaly tedious, but VS CPU mode and a fantastic story more than make up for it. All in all this game is a masterpiece and is well worth $35.			"

												Homeworld is an RTS in true 3D with a fantastic art style. Visually it looks like a 1970s/1980s sci-fi, like old-school Battle Star Galactica and Star Wars. Check out the artist Chris Foss if you like the visuals in Homeworld - it's very reminiscent of Foss's work. The art stye is also reminiscent of those old Usborne Books of the Future I used to read as kid.Much like a classic book, Homeworld seems timeless. I cannot believe that I was playing this game 16(!) years ago and yet here I am playing it today with gameplay that's still just as good, just as fun as it was so many years ago.I'd gladly pay $40 each for both Homeworld and Homeworld 2, but here you're getting both, remastered for same price. In fact, I only paid $20 since the game was on sale for 50% off.  Great value! Both games have a decent single player campaign, skirmish modes and multiplayer. Even if you have just the smallest desire to play an RTS, check out Homeworld. An old favorite that still holds up.			"

												Homeworld is a classic. steam should have homeworld cataclysm but of course theres is a mod to add stuff from it (The Beast, Somtaaw) But the game is a good classic RTS. Very good mods on it. if i were to reccomend a mod on the workshop it would be complex 9.1. A large but extensive mod that can prolong this games already long lifetime. Not to mention homeworld 2 is harder than Homeworld 1 indefinetly. I would reccomend this game to anyone who loves RTS and strategy.			"
