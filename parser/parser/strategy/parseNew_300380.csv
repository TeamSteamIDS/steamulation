Early Access Review
								Buy this game if ya grew up playing Road Rash, ya will not be disappointed.The main reason for this review is not, in fact, to rave about this great game, but to rave about the amazing customer support from the developers. I've been dealing with a lot of ""big"" companies' customer support, and getting terrible customer support (including having my requests shut down with no communication - thanks, Sony). So when I emailed the developers of Road Redemption regarding issues around a 32 bit win7 4GB machine, not only was I highly surprised to see a responce within 4 hours (give or take 20 minues) but having an actually answer (in this case, I was informed that the issue had been noticed and the game would be patched in a few hours).  In one contact, the developers not only smashed my expections, I now use them as an example of a company doing it right. So, developers, please please please, keep up the great work.			"

								23 Hours, 100%My experience with Road Redemption:My game crashed plenty of times.My game crashed on the final turn of the final level.I repeatedly got my ♥♥♥ kicked.I got kicked off of bridges and into oncoming traffic.I didn't get to swing a chain I fell between buildings and off of rooftops multiple times.I got stuck on car bumpers.I emptied entire clips into the sky trying to aim.I got the Rainbow Road song stuck in my head at work.I couldn't adjust the difficulty settings.I was launched into the air by highway grenades over and over.I was challenged.I maxed out my character.I kicked just as much♥♥♥♥♥as was previously kicked upon me. And then some.... and I loved all 1380 minutes of it.Every crash report I sent, I received a response from the developer Ian with his phone number attached within the hour. Even at 5am.Anyone who says these guys don't care about their game, don't update the game or have abandoned the game couldn't be further from the truth.This game and this Dev team is a testament to how Early Access should be done. LONG LIVE THESE DEVS			"

								SMASHING!Ekhm... ok, so it's closest thing to Road Rash for now - but IT'S NOT ROAD RASH - keep that in mind. It's worth it, but i would wait for final release, you might be a little dissapointed right now. Pros:- It's closest thing to Road Rash avaible.- Lots od nice weapons. SMASHING!- Daily updates.- Nice Skill Tree.- Idea itself?Cons:- It doesn't feels like i'm driving motorcycle for some reason.- Sounds feels like i'm playing game from 90's.- Grindy.- Weird physics?- Lack of customization.- No multiplayer yet.- Only 5 motorcycles for now.So yeah... better just wait few months till it will be a little more polished and with multiplayer(i REALLY hope).

								""Road Rash"" is back and better than ever thanks to Road Redemption!Well I have to say that this game has been so much fun, I just completed the early access version of the game, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed.I like to keep things simple, so I will give you a list of things I liked and disliked from this title!Things I enjoyed from Road Redemption: Great controls! (Game handles pretty well, keeping that balance between realism and fun.) Action Packed (Game keeps players on their toes, with funny wipeouts in the mix of things.) Lots of Weapons (Tons of things to fight with, including guns, which Road Rash never had.) Upgrades and Perks (They work wonderfully and really help the player through the race.) Different Environments (They change as your progress.) A Secret Map (Are you guys kidding me... Freaking Rainbow Road from Mario Kart?!?!YES!) Things I feel need some work: Optimization (The maps can become very very laggy with frames dropping to around 5 FPS, I have a pretty beefy rig with a Radeon 7970 and it shouldn't have problems with a game like this.) Voice Overs ( I really wish there was some kind of voices for the police and riders, not really dialoge, more like ""Oofs"" or laughter and maybe a ""Pull over!"" from some cops now and then.) Character Customization (There really isn't any, but this is early access and I have a feeling this could change easily.)Overall this game is really fun and takes me back to the good 'ol PSX days sitting around my house, playing Co-op smacking my father with a chain in Road Rash Jailbreak.

								One caveat before I start.  This game is still unfinished.  There are really only three tracks, and half of a campaign to play through as of my last playthrough.With that out of the way, this is pretty much the absolutely insane Road Rash successor that I didn't know I wanted.The main campaign mode (the only thing implmented in the version I've played) is semi randomly generated (meaning that you'll get random victory conditions on the tracks), and has rogue like elements like permadeath and an ability to buy stats with the money you collected during a run.  The campaign, so far as I can tell, still follows a basic track structure.  It goes desert tracks for a few races, rooftop tracks (which is where most of the glitches seem to currently reside), winter track (which is basically a greyier version of the desert track), and quite literally Rainbow Road from Mario Kart.  What really makes these tracks dynamic is the random effects you can get.  Like all oncoming traffic, weather effects, or even raining and explosive cars.  Some of these effects are amazing, and really push the races from fun but basic to absolutely crazy.The actual bike handling is pretty forgiving, if a little stiff.  It's pretty easy to stay on the track, barring some occasional blind turns.  I do kinda wish there was more tactile feel to the handling, since it really doesn't feel like you are even on a bike.  But in the context of the game it isn't so bad.  Because it works well with the game's combat system.Which is the meat and potatoes of this game.  It is amazingly satisfying to club someone over the head with a pipe.  Most of my time in the campaign mode was chasing down and braining rival racers.  The more racers you take out, the more money and better weapons you are granted, thus continuing the cycle of violence.  The gun play seemed okay, but I honestly didnt try it much, since I really just wanted to beat more racers (and police, and random traffic) with melee objects.Of the games three basic tracks, the desert/winter ones are the best realized.  The rooftop tracks I had issues falling out of the level geometry and getting stuck.  And the Rainbow Road alike track makes for an interesting easter egg, but wasn't much fun to race on, with constant tight turns and narrow track width, and no traffic to interact with.  But these are things I'd assume would be smoothed out over time.Overall, thus far there's not a wealth of features in the game, but what is there is quite fun.  The combat is fun enough that I found myself slowing down just to hit more racers with blunt objects.  And doing so while cars are dropping from the sky and exploding is quite amazing.  I'd recommend it once it becomes a more complete product.  Even now it's pretty fun, but the glitches and lack of content mar it currently.  If a totally crazy and still very playable bike combat game sounds up your alley though, I'd go ahead and recommend it now.			"

								I don't know how many people already write Road Rash references in the review, but I'll write it anyway.Thanks to the developer who brings back the memories. If you love Road Rash you should buy the gamePros :- Loads of weapon from ordinary bat (with achievement called batman?).... to Uzi and C4 explosive.- Good graphic- Good challenge, you could get killed by car or other gang member, your choice- THE RAINBOW ROADPro/Con (?):- Freaking permanent death made you lose all your store payment, but you got XP to upgrade your skill which is niceCons :- System requirements- No bike selection- Music. Come on, the game is about illegal motorcycle racing. Why'd you got chiptune as music?8/10			"

								NOSTALGIA GLASSES ACTIVATED: ROAD RASH RESURRECTIONThat's what every review here will say and it's definitely similar. There are some sensibilities to keep in mind, however. Road Redemption is a lot more modern in its arcade style. Controls are more lenient, though racing does have some weight. In turn, physics are crazy over the top for extra excitement from jumps and debris flying across the road. Combat packs a punch with lots of different weapon choices, though firearms suffer from poor camera control right now. Leveling options are available with random missions, in a roguelike play-by-play setting with additional playthrough enhancement possibilities.

								This game is basically Road Rash , the game , not a rash while you got on a road.. nvm. I would rather say what this game has and what it needs since it is still in early access rather than Pros and Cons.Game Has -Complete nostalgia , made me feel like a 10yr version of me , when i used to play this game in summer vacations wearing nothing but shorts and eating chips.Good Driving and simple controls.A decent campign and good amount of quick raceYou can fire ak-47 while riding a bike and also c4Really Fun From The minute you will launch itThe Ability to bring a big Smile On Your Face.Game Needs -Better Soundtracks while racing rather than just an electric guitar being played , (Miss The Rusty Cage song and Mirror in your Eyes song)Better Sound effects , When ever you Kill a biker , the sound effect is like you collected a mushroom in Mario.Bring back The Voice dialogues or qoutes everytime someone kills.Bike Customization, some vinlys or colors perhaps ?A bigger size of campaign.( Thought havent completed mine , because once You Die you have to start all over again )Bigger races , races are really short ( Like the one Napa valley 29.9 miles ? )Definetly Multiplayer ( Game would be dead in 12hrs if it doesnt have multiplayer)Won't Be Fair To give this game a rating out of 10 since it is not completed still . But Devs You are on the right path , So goodluck :)    ( Eagerly waiting for this game to get completed )			"

Early Access Review
								Do you remember the 90's? There was this gem of a title called Road Rash that was just about the coolest thing anyone had seen at the time. Road Redemption takes the spirit of that old classic, slaps some more meat on the bones, and brings it into the modern gaming scene, with it's own original twists.Road Redemption is a straight arcade game. Don't go looking for a ""racing"" game here so much. The emphasis is much less about getting to the finish line first, and more about making sure nobody else does. And that's where it shines. Road Redemption doesn't try to be anything it's not. It knows it's a fun, quirky arcade racing rampage. That's all it wants to be.The graphics are not amazing, but not bad. The sound is a bit rought, but the music is good.Currently the game is not without it's faults, there's some performance issues, sound effects could REALLY use their own volume slider (they can get insanely loud at times), the camera control while shooting is a bit hard to use, and the menus and such are pretty minimalist.At it's core though, the game is just crazy fun. You'll find yourself playing it over and over, even after telling yourself ""Just one more time..."".The plans they have for adding multiplayer and stuff in the future only add even more to look forward.I do love seeing the collaborations with other indie devs too. (Shovel Knight starting with a shovel FTW!)All in all, for a fun, crazy good time that mimics the joy of old school fun times, Road Redemption is totally worth the asking price.			"

Early Access Review
								The following is based on 5 hours play of the Early Access version, which I hope will provide some useful non-partisan feedback to the developers.1) This is not a racing gameRacing games tend to have some things in common. They have tracks, they have timers, they have scores, they have course records, they have winners and losers, they challenge the player to improve, and they instil a sense of progression and achievement. Road Redemption has and does none of these things.Road Redemption neither rewards success nor frowns upon failure. You simply must not die, or else you’re back to square one. Take a “race” event, for example. To win any money you must finish in the top three. However the sorts of thing you can spend your money on post-race are health top-ups, nitro-replacements and other items that ameliorate the damage of the previous race. Given that the aim is simply not to die, it behoves the player not to actually take part in the race. I, for example, employ a half-throttle strategy, simply puttering around at half-throttle avoiding obstacles, combat and various other hazards in order to get to the end with as little damage as possible. More often than not this strategy leads to a top three finish, but it doesn’t matter anyway because you can still progress to the next event regardless of where you finish. I’ll say it again: there is no benefit to taking part in the race because the aim is not to die.What of the other events, such as Take Down, Jump Jets, and Police Attention? The same applies. Your priority is not to die and “failure” doesn’t hinder your progress. So should you a) participate and risk death for no benefit or, b) pull off to the side of the track and do something else for three minutes? If you answered “b” you’re beginning to see the problem with Road Redemption.        2) The tracks need a designerRoad Redemption’s ‘road’ courses are dull and boring. They largely consist of four and six lane highways, long, sweeping, shallow corners and some of the dullest designs I’ve ever seen. If you were hoping to experience the thrill of opening the throttle into a blind corner on to oncoming traffic, darting between cars and trucks as your heart starts beating that bit quicker, Road Redemption will leave you disappointed.The roof-top courses are simply dreadful and need to go. If I want to race in a city I want to do it at ground level. I want to blast down alleys, race through shopping malls, crash into curiously placed fruit stalls. What I don’t want is to race on roofs crashing into air-conditioning units. Nor do I want to fall off the side of a building and for the game to reposition me somewhere in mid-air leading to an inescapable death cycle, which seems to happen rather more often than it ought.Don’t get me started on Rainbow Road. This is out of place and even the game doesn’t seem to understand it. I’ve “fallen” off this track to have the game reposition me after the finish line - the bike indicator jumped from the progress meter to the right hand side of the screen and I could not finish the race. I’d also say this: if you want to do something a bit self-referential or add a knowing wink to a game, pick something from your own history like a 16-bit Road Rash level. Don’t pluck something out of a completely different series like Mario Kart.      3) Procedures are for bureaucratsHad I been careful enough to read that Road Redemption uses a lot of “procedural generation” beforehand I almost certainly would not have bought it. Why?a) Because infinitely generated dullness is infinitely dull and,b) Because developers never give you the option to replay the same procedurally generated level.There’s nothing wrong with adding a bit of randomness to a game - games like the Burnout series have been doing this successfully for years - but when everything is random and there’s no mechanism to replay a “procedurally” generated course then there is no sense of progression or achievement.Imagine that you’d actually bothered engaging with the game (which you won’t, see 1 above) and you’d come first in a race. Imagine further that you’d had so much fun, you thought you’d like to play the exact same level again. What if you then wanted to share that level with friends for a bit of friendly competition? What if you’d like to have a play with the parameters sent into the procedures to see what sort of madness you could generate - or better yet have the control to create and share your own courses? Well tough. You can’t. This strikes me as a massive oversight and one that should be easily fixable, but strangely never seems to occur to developers.      4) It’s not about the bikesCall me a traditionalist but I expect a bike game to have a good range of bikes, all with unique handling and performance characteristics. I want a bike shop so I can ogle over the Diablo 1000, I want an upgrade shop so I can fit nuclear-powered rocket-motors to my bike. I want to indulge my virtual-bike fantasies.Road Redemption doesn’t give you any of this. Instead you get a skill tree (of which more later) and jump jets.5) Moral hazard?You might think that bike-based combat would be an almost infinite source of fun, but in truth it gets old very quickly. I played through the original Road Rash recently and found the combat there to be far superior even though it was far more limited. Why?It’s all to do with focus. Road Rash is a racing game where limited violence can be deployed to your advantage (and often chagrin when it goes wrong). Road Redemption is a non-racing game where egregious violence is used all the time for no specific purpose other than you can. Road Rash also introduced consequences for being violent (albeit in a limited way - Natasha being rude to you wasn’t the end of the world), whereas Road Redemption’s violence is entirely consequence free.You can have all the guns, clubs, bombs and swords you want but if they only exist for the sake of existing what’s the point?PS Swinging from helicopters sounds like it should be fun, but isn’t. 6) Do you wanna be in my gang?Another thing the original Road Rash got right was its personality and connection to the game world. There are other characters who converse (yes, in a limited way) with you and draw you into the  world of illegal street racing.Road Redemption, on the other hand, is completely impersonal. You are apparently a member of some bike gang (of which the only evidence is the occasional appearance of a rider with a green arrow pointing to him), battling other gangs (who are they, why are we fighting?) in some strange dystopian world of which you - the player - have little knowledge of and probably care even less about.  7) Skill me up, Scotty!If there is a golden rule to racing games it’s that the player’s skill comes first and foremost. If the player enters a corner too fast and ends up embedded in a wall that is his or her problem; conversely if a player executes the perfect jump, squeezes between two oncoming vehicles and wins by the narrowest of narrow margins that is the player’s reward. It’s fine to add some variability - such as tires bursting, engines blowing etc. etc. - but it should, essentially, be all about the player.Road Redemption’s skill system flies in the face of this. The player’s actual skill is replaced by a tree of variables (or “skills”) that affect the outcome, turning the game into a grind rather than focusing on improving and rewarding the player’s real skill (or would do if the player engaged with the game: see 1, above).   8) Control, oh pitiful controlI found the game almost impossible with mouse and keyboard. Imagine piloting a brick at 100mph. That’s Road Redemption with a mouse and keyboard. A controller is infinitely better - as long as you don’t try using any of the ranged weapons.   "

								Have you ever played any other racing games and you feel like you want to kill your adversaries? ... Well, you can do it here !First of all i have to say that if you have seen Mad Max movies or played Road Rash before, you will feel like home.Road Redemption is an Indie / Racing game that is in Early Access that has simple objectives like other racing games, beat your opponents getting first place and cross the finish line. So what does it makes it different ?You can use much kinds of melee / fire weapons, since a crowbar up to a medieval axe or since a revolver up to an AK47.Get a awesome trip across USA on twisted high roads, gaining money and reputation to buy new upgrades.Although this game still on Early Access looks quite interesting, it has a lot of potential, resuming that, these are the main points of the game:Pros:- Insane but totally funny combat system.- Good amount of weapons.- Challenging levels (each time that you're completing missions the difficult will increase).- We have 3 different level modes:* Race: Beat your enemies and get 1st place to get all money and experience.* Hunt: The objective is kill the other racers (this is an easy mode).* Hallucinogen Chemical Zone: Same as normal race, the different thing here is that cars will rain from the sky (that makes this game mode quite hard).- A lot of different enemies, since a normal racers up to a big badass truck.- Increase of difficult (as this game doesn't has difficult, each time that you anvance a level the difficult will increase and makes this game more challenging).Cons:- At the moment this game doesn't has multiplayer (that will make it more interesting).- Some random frame drops.- Limited amount of characters and vehicles.- No vehicle customization.As i said before this game has a lot of potential, atm i'm in love with it.10 / 10If you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.

								Road Rash 3D?This game reminds me so much of the Road Rash series especially Road Rash 3D. I used to love playing those games back in the days. ^ ^Here you race against other motorcyclists, punching, kicking, grabbing, using melee weapons and firearms to attack or slow down their progress.Each race has a different requirement and mission. One might have you to simply get 1st place, another will have you cause enough chaos to get the attention of the cops or another mission may ask you to smash every motorcyclist and vehicle you see.Successfully pulling off completed missions will earn you a lot of money and XP, and the more motorcyclists, cops and vehicles you take out the more XP and money you earn.After each race you can use the money to buy different boosts and buffs. You keep them as long as you stay alive, but if you die they are all gone but after death you can use the XP you have earned for permanent upgrades like a better motorcycle, increased health, better weapons, increased weapon durability and a whole lot more.This is an early access game so you will see some bugs throughout, like being able to drive through bridge columns with no collision detection or sometimes the camera will rotate on its own in another direction which can lead to crashes because you are trying to fix the camera position and there is no camera reset button or key so you have to manually move the camera back behind the driiver and try to get it as centered as possible so your driving isn't off. But this is something that can easily be fixed in an update.So far Road Redemption looks really good and has a lot of promise and if you are a fan of the Road Rash series then you will really enjoy this game. :)			"

								There's no Road Rash to be had here.I got really excited by this game at first, had some fun with it at first, but then I saw that this wasn't going anywhere.Got this game like 2 years ago or around that time. Well, it's almost 2017. It sucks hard, and there's nothing ""Road Rash"" about it. Music, style, it just lacks everything that made Road Rash good.There's been many updates since then, but it really added nothing, and the entire game feels like a mobile game. Just lifeless in everything, the stages, the bikes (and bikers), even the menu theme is just some soft piano crap which doesn't fit the game at all. It's also missing the punk biker gang feel that the original had, which to me was pretty important in making Road Rash, well, Road Rash.The bikes feel like they are on rails, and not the uncontrollable screaming banshee like they were in the original Road Rash that made you fight for your life. Hitting other bikers feel really unsatisfying as well.Don't get me wrong, it doesn't need to be a complete copy of Road Rash. I can accept that just fine, but this game is utterly lifeless. It lacks soul.It just so happens to be a game where you can only ride bikes and can hit other bikers. The similarities literally end there. Look at every other review here, it's always ""not quite Road Rash just yet"", or ""it's getting there, just a bit more!"". Yeah, that's what I thought as well, and look at it now.If you want a game that didn't forget its own roots, get Carmageddon Max Damage. It's quite faithful to the original (they at least tried if you don't agree with me). At least that game got out of early access, and even if you don't like it, it's the better game by far.Review update #1:Apparently there's no longer any piano crap playing in the menus, just heavy metal. Is it a small step for... something?			"

								Road Redemption was a game that, when it came out, quickly became one of my favourites. The gameplay was exceptionally fun, mixing combat and racing decently well. The mechanics felt a bit clunky, but it was still playable. It was the only game on the market that allowed you to fly around with a jetpack on your bike while propelling yourself forward with a grappling hook, so I could live with a few glitches.I've only recently returned to this game, and I'm still having fun with the game. However, and there are a few things that have changed I'm curious about:Why is there limited jetpack fuel?Realistically, it makes sense that you only have a set-amount of jetpack usage. However, in a game where you can swing a battleaxe on a motorcycle, drive on Rainbow Road, and certain stages are labelled, ""Hallucinogenic Chemical Zone"" where cars fall from the sky, I wouldn't think realism was in DarkSea Games' list of things they wanted this game to be.Why don't I have infinite grappling hooks?Exact same point as above. I mean, my favourite part about old Road Redemption was that once you got the jetpack and grappling hook, the game became a psuedo flight-sim game, where you had to propel yourself back onto the road with the hooks. If you got the hang of it, you became a god among men. Still, despite my complaint, I can still recommend the game. It's still highly enjoyable, and if Road Redemption's Wikipedia page can be trusted, we'll see a full-length game release in September of this year.			"

								As a kid growing up I spent so many hours playing Road Rash on the Mega Drive. After hearing of this nostalgic remake I had to check it out.What I like about the game:+ Fast paced. No boring bits here folks.+ Action can get intense, especially when you are paying attention to the road hazards as well.+ Tons of weapons to weild.+ Riding physics are pleasant with a nice ""arcade"" feel.+ Plenty of ways of dispatching your foes into the asphalt, speeding cars, poles, concrete etc.+ Runs smooth on older hardware (circa 2005) and is rock stable.What I don't like:- Rooftop & Space levels are disjointed from the fast flow of the other levels.- Rooftop levels have minor bugs that cause your cycle to crash.- Seems to be an unnecessary mid-air slow down effect off ramps and jumps.- Some textures are low-res and are reminiscent of late '90's Direct3D games.- A few of the music tracks are out of place.What I'd like to see:= The textures pumped up to decent resolutions.= Music tracks that fit the grunge / metal theme of this game.= Speedometer.= Crashed bikes become obstacles. Just to create some jeopardy for firearms lovers.= More bikes + riders to select.= Upgradeable bike parts from tyres to turbos to keep the game interesting.= Less ""catch up"" handicap.These are small negatives on a massively fun game. I might sound a little harsh on a game that isn't finished, however I feel that the game and it's current content just need a minor nudge in the right direction before it gets polished so that it will be the killer game experience it deserves.

								This is the modern remake of Road Rash that everyone has been waiting for, it is still lacking  Single Player content, but seeing as it is still in  Early Access  it will be expanded upon soon enough.There is however still enough content here to make it worth buying now, there's already a campaign mode (albeit short) and campaign+ mode, and a big variety of weapons available (rocket launcher, c4, shotgun, samurai sword, to name but a few) , you can also upgrade your perks (for want of a better word) using the XP gained after each campaign playthrough (giving you that little bit of a better headstart the next time round). This is an extremely gratifying game to play as a bit of mindless racing fun, which will only become more so, once more content is added.Recommended			"

Early Access Review
								This game was hugely disappointing. Why is it so difficult for developers to replicate Road Rash? Every reboot, remake, reimagining, homage, always focuses on the fighting. Fighting in Road Rash was a novelty but not what made the game special. It was the racing. The twisting turns, the trecherous roadways; it was the rush when you threaded the needle at top speed on the 15th mile of Pacific highway. The key to success was racing clean or a kick to your opponent at an opportune time, because getting into a slugfest slowed you down and cost you the race. It was as much you against the level as it was you against your opponents. There was a vibe, an edge, and one hell of a soundtrack.Road Redemption has none of these things. It is bland and devoid of character. It focuses too much on weapons and damaging your opponents and not enough on racing or level design. The core gameplay mechanic, how you navigate through the game, is also flawed. Rather than a hub where you can select races or make a name for yourself on some underground circuit, you are forced to progress through a series of ""levels"". Each level has an objective, win the race, take out x number of oppontents, use this special move, etc. The kicker: when you die, you start back at the beginning. Not a unique concept, starting at the beginning when you die, but an odd one for a racing game. And for a game with such drab gameplay, repeating the opening levels numerous times is more punishment than consequence.All in all, if you're looking for a Road Rash equivalent, keep looking. This game offers no redemption.			"

								This is a game that really evokes strong nostalgia for the Road Rash series and other similar games, while throwing in interesting elements from other action/driving games. The combat is fairly satisfying, hectic, and has some great visual feedback. It's fun at first, but then you start to encounter some problems.For one thing, the physics are REALLY rough. I understand that this was (is-being, rather, as it is still in Early Access) made using Unity, and this is an ambitious project for the engine. Bouncing around canyons and buildings like a racketball while screaming at a hundred miles an hour is humorous at first, but I found myself quickly frustrated as I would tap a rock on the side of the road on accident and then be propelled into the sky a hundred feet up. Or better yet, scream down a road as fast as possible and run into a slightly-protruding drain pipe and suddenly come to a dead stop. For another thing, the skyscraper levels are interesting, but dumb. You get a grapple gun and jet boosters. The grapple gun is difficult to use, especially as there is no tutorial for it. The jet boosters are fun, but given the tight turns and deceptive nature of the tracks, you will likely plummet to your doom. Again. And again. And...again. Also, there are only a handful of different tracks, none of which are particularly inspired. Even the rainbow road one is little more than frustrating. The first few missions have you repeating the same track with different start points or a different time of day, but it can get tiresome once the gameplay begins to wear thin.And finally, the game is rather unstable. It's crashed on me three times so far and I've only played about 80 minutes of it. I understand that this is early access, but it is still very rough around the edges. I like the combat a lot, I like the light RPG advancement elements, I like the variety of weapons. This game shows a lot of potential, but has a long road ahead of it before I can give it a thumbs up. Once they iron out these issues, it will definitely be worth getting, but until then, ride on friend.			"

								This game nails the feel of Road Rash, particularly with its controls. The swerving is tight, the way your rider stiffens up to take a swing with his weapon, kicking other riders in midair, hitting the brakes to power through a turn horizontally, landing on riders to knock them off... it's all there.The destruction is fun and ludicrous. The original Road Rash had a more ""serious"" feel to it, while this spiritual remake turns it up to 11 for good measure.With its short levels (2-5 minutes of intense racing) and the cash/xp rewards model that doesn't really offer any poor choices, this is a great ""pass the controller"" game to play with others and it's easy to play ""just one more race"".Pros:-slick action arcade racing mechanics-large amount of vehicles on screen-great draw distance-good collision detection and sounds-wide tracks-highly replayable campaign-includes New Game+-multiplayer on the horizon-pretty good uptempo music-generated level geometry feels consistent, works well-guns feel substantial and are well balancedPros that used to be cons but were improved by development:-powersliding/skidding now feels weighty and fun-critical attacks now look special-more vehicle enemies which create traffic chaos on the roadsCons:-no interesting differences between enemy rider types other than durability-camera can be annoying and finnicky on rooftop levels, can't see where you're landing-engine sounds are kinda boring and inconsistent with your speed-audio cutting on gunfireBugs, Issues, SuggestionsAs an early access title, I don't count bugs as Cons as these issues will likely be fixed with development time-Experience point abilities could use some more interesting choices aside from increased health, damage, critical hits, etc-no gender selection (Player or AI... Road Rash did have the infamous Natasha, after all)-could use some more rolling road hazards. The logging trucks are a good idea, maybe throw in gas tankers that can be shot for explosions, tractor trailers that are carrying cars, and more trucks in general-no oil slicks or ways of losing traction like Road Rash-jumps make you lose speed, no purpose to ramps being in the middle of some of the levels, perhaps stunts will be added for experience/nitrous/health gain effects?-more racing types or ludicrous level effects would be great... perhaps modes such as Slalom, Guns-Only, Always-On Nitrous-no chain weapon (come on this was a key Road Rash weapon!)Conclusion: For an early access title this is so far a quality experience, and is nowhere near the realm of early access games that come out unplayable or with false hopes and undelivered promises. Humble Deal or Winter Sale makes it a no-brainer, and at the original price it's still a great value for anyone that likes Road Rash or action/arcade racing, and hopefully when the success comes and the sales roll in, the developers (who seem like great people) will continue to make meaningful updates and get the game to a solid 1.0 state.Thumbs Up!

								Well alright, this scratches an itch I've had for some years now. But it's not perfect. It's not finished either so that's to be expected. Pros: The controls are pretty good, although firing handguns is super hard. Graphics look nice, although a bit uninspired.Cons: Opponents are too good. They drive perfectly and never hit anything or run off the road like I do constantly, they do melee combat perfectly, they shoot handguns perfectly. This is not great for the players confidence.There is no story whatsoever. No avatar modification or creation.No upgrading the bikes.No countdown before the race starts.Music is not great. Not horrible but pretty damn boring if you compare it to Road Roash, which we do of course.Stages in the campaign mode are randomized. Wtf for?There's a meter that tells you how far along the track you are and how close you are to your opponents but it says nothing about the layout of the track.I'm sure some of my gripes will be adressed in future updates and playing it in it's current state is still fun. Just not as fun as it could be.			"

Mind you it's not a remake per se, since it has some very different aspects, especially the mission-based stages, but it succeeds in capturing the soul of the Road Rash series, which is basically the reason I bought it in the first place!The game has been constantly upgraded, and has improved a lot from the early versions, which is a very important aspect of an Early Access game.All in all a very good game which I strongly recommend!

8/10 EarlyAccess Rating!""RoadRash is finally back & better than ever!"" RoadRedemption is still in EarlyAccess but already very good, that's up front. RR is an arcade 3D 3rd person motorcycle beat/shoot/chain'em'up racer. It features everything from the original, plus a ton of new features I wouldn't even have thought of / wished for. For the one's who don't know the original - just play (at least) this one...Pros:+ superb implementation of the original + ... plus a lot new stuff =>weapons/cops/skilltree/campaign/riders/...+ great gameplay+ great soundtrack+ very good graphics+ good controls+ procedural maps (day&night)+ challenging+ fun² (local coop)Cons:- no online coop/multiplayer, yet=> coming soon...!Every RoadRash fan can grab his chains & start ridin'! The interested rest should do so as well. Latest UPDATE was great. Grab it at least on sale!!! "

								You can't get around the classic Road Rash series from the 90's when talking about Road Redemption. I was a huge fan of the RR series back in the day, so I was really excited when I heared of this new game. And now it's on Steam! Altough not entirely the same as Road Rash, it reminds me to it in many ways. If you ever played and liked Road Rash, you will definitely like Road Redemption too. Even though it's in EA at the moment, I already had lots of fun playing it; racing while beating the crap out of your rival gang members with various melee weapons and firearms. Get launched from you bike when you smash into something because you weren't paying attention. There are straight forward races for the top spot, races where you have to defeat a set number of rivals or races where you have to attract as many police officers as possible. You can earn money, wich you can spend on more health, nitro, damage you cause and much more. However, you loose all this, when you die. Besides money, you also earn XP, wich you can use to upgrade various aspects. These upgrades are permanent, even after you die. So you get stronger and better equipped, every time you start a new game. I also like the soundtrack; varied music tracks wich suit the game very well. Graphics and sound are descent, not great but they get the job done. Overall I'm quite pleased with the game in it's current state. Development is ongoing so it can only get better. It's difficult to say if it's already worth your money, looking at the amount of content. For example, MP is not yet available. It's just very subjective. Everyone has to decide that for themselves but for me, as a huge fan of the genre, it is. I just couldn't wait :)			"

For those of you who haven't played Road Rash:Road Rash was a game in the early 90s where you grabbed your Ratbike (because it leaves droppings everywhere...geddit?) and took to the open road, merciless punching, kicking, whipping, blunt-objecting, mother-insulting and racing anyone foolish enough to try and ride alongside you.Along the way, you earned cash, upgraded your bike and progressed through the game. It's a simple premise.It was, basically, the video game that your mother referenced everytime she had book club and the ladies started ranting about senseless violence. Hence, of course, it was arguably one of the best games of all time.Road Redemption is Road Rash re-done, with a couple of extras thrown in - there's a better upgrade system in terms of EXP which makes the game feel a little rogue-like - not a negative point at all, since it allows you to have a couple of races, crash and die, upgrade your stuff if you can, and not worry about being stuck on some difficult level without progressing.During breaks in levels you can use your cash to buy upgrades at the store - these upgrades only last as long as you do: once you die you lose these (but keep your EXP upgrades).There are also a lot more weapons, which is fantastic, and riders and bikes with stats that affect gameplay.If you have played Road Rash:It's Road Rash basically.What I would like to see:Voice-overs. In the style of Quake and Unreal Tournament, annoucing when I'm on a rampage or something.Additional bikes and weapons are a maybe, as well as a larger skill tree. New maps and locations would be fantastic as well!All in all though, this game is quite complete, and definitely a recommended buy!			"

								It looks like a lot of fun! The developers also care deeply about this game because they keep optimizing it! If you have a modern computer you will enjoy it.BUT OLDER COMPUTERS BE WARNED: It is semi-playable as of the September 27th, 2014 update. The miniumn requirements are a lower than they should be. You will have problems running it if not at the recommended settings.I own a Laptop with a dual core 2.1 ghz processor from 2009. It gets the job done when I want to play some older games (I can even run skyrim on low settings decently).  If you turn down the settings down to 'fastest' setting and change the resolution to the lowest you can get acceptable framerates that allow you to play the game without too much of problem. You still might suffer from random studdering and low framerate. At least now you can acutally able to control your character and even knock some other npcs off their bike. The first level for some reason is very resource intensive (maybe too many cars and objects loaded) but the later levels run pretty well. At this time I can play it but I still get frustrated when the controls don't respond as quickly as would like (but it is definitly better than it was before!). Still get a few random pauses in the game, and the framerate will drop when something happens.I think what I'm more impressed is how much the developer has optimized this game, even for older computers. At this rate it wouldn't suprise me if it could run on a ti-89 calculater with all thes updates. If your computer has better specs than my potato-top then you got yourself an awesome game.			"

								I can only write my first impressions of Road Redemption as this is an early access and I haven't finished the campaign yet. I loved the old Road Rash games, which were clearly an inspiration to this game.I should probably add; I randomly got this game for free from the devs; they asked nicely if I wanted to review their game. Which is the reason I wrote a review of it in the first place. I usually don't write reviews much... Of course, if I didn't like the game, I would still review it, just with a different verdict.Things this game are IMO missing a bit are the story line. I always liked having an excuse to kick Biff off his bike in Road Rash. hahaha. I was also a bit disappointed you can't seem to buy or improve on the bikes, instead it's just improved with some skill stat. And obviously a myrad of PC options are still missing at the current moment. But oh well, as this an early access, I'll just go over to what's actually there;So there's the mayhem on the road rashes, which are fun enough of course: Kicking the opponents off the road, and the random weapons used to literally beat the competition. The game's main focus seems to be more on the over-the-top action. You might start out with a simple club to swing around, but you can end up with 'jetpacks' and grenade launchers.The campaign mode is randomly generated, and in some events you need to do certain tasks in order to win, rather than just race to the finish line. Sometimes beating rival gangs, and other cases attracting alot of police attention or fighting the competition without using weapons. There's even rooftop races going on, which is pretty wild. And you have crazy stuff like jump jets to make sure you can reach that next rooftop. And there even was a racing level where it was raining cars. Yes, you read that correctly.After each event you can buy some upgrades, which will stay with you as long as you survive, and improve on skills permanently. Sometimes you also get offered a new weapon to play around with.Currently the game's already full of action. If you loved the mayhem in the old Road Rash games, and want more of that, you'll certainly like what this early access already has to offer. But don't expect a racing simulator out of it just yet, so far it's more an arcade action game.			"

								As a big fan of the original Road Rash back in ""the day"", this game does live up to the same feeling.  Still has some bugs to be ironed out before it's finished, but a completely enjoyable game.  I destroyed a semi using a lead pipe and planted C4 on another bike, and he blew up 3 others.  Whats not to love.			"

								I love this game, it takes me back to the 90's! This is Road Rash 64 in HD, or a very close approximation of it. The only thing missing is the abiliy to jam your weapon into the front wheel of other riders, that was always a blast for me, especially if I could jam their front wheel in mid air! I hope the devs add this feature in the next update.Hours of mindless violence and motorcycles, what could be better? If you are of the N64 generation, this game is deja vu. Highly recomended! I also have to give a thumbs up to the ""campain"" design, its unlike any other game I have played.			"

								I was under attack almost all the time during the races, I've seen motorbikes jumping on the rooftops and riders kicking each other down. I've seen cars being destroyed in a million little pieces, that was what you want to see and you will get from this game. But what I didn't expect were cars raining from the sky!8/10 great work so far,can't wait for the full game!5th October 2014

Early Access Review
A Good Feeling, Often ForgottenBefore I get into specifics about the game I want to highlight something very important about it, something that in contemporary games is often so drowned in an abyss of complexity and glamour that we forget to even reflect on it: Road Redemption is FUN.  Every single time, without fail, laugh-out-loud duck-and-flinch old school video game FUN.  I spend most of my game time in that aforementioned abyss, straining my intellect and grasping for immersion. Road Redemption has taken its place in my apothecary as a balm, a revitalizer for my spirit, after such sessions.This game flashed by on my front page for weeks before I really looked into it; I didn't look too closely because I figured it was some sort of glorified street-moto Trials clone.  What opened my eyes to it was a search by tag ""Permadeath.""  I'm a big fan of permadeath mechanics in general so I became ravenously curious and dove into a game forum spiral,Risk of Road RedemptionTurns out, at its core, Road Redemption is a fiercely indie, happily absurd, fresh, new, and ridiculously satisfying roguelite.  Let me clarify by discussing the major gameplay elements.  The loose premise is that you are a gang biker trekking across USA, west coast to east coast, for some reason that somehow involves a boss level at the end.  RR does not for a moment pretend to have a rich and nuanced plot.  The trek is divided into more than a dozen stages that take between five or ten minutes each to complete. Gameplay is traditional 3rd-person motorcycle race style with the control schemes to match (this will show my age, but it reminds me fondly of playing Road Rage in the arcade back in the day).  So how is it roguelite? First off, each playthrough is entirely procedurally generated- the road maps, terrain, and absurdity variables (sometimes you'll get a level with ""hallucinogenic chemical zones"" that are filled with bright colors and cars falling out of the sky, other times the whole course is made of skyscraper rooftops, etc, etc); the enemies, their names, attributes, and gang affiliations; the weapon and item drops; and the game type for the level (for example, one level may involve getting the police to really notice you, another will be about smashing a rival gang, another will be a simple race).  Second, Road Redemption uses the modern meta roguelite paradigm that more or less rules the genre at the moment.  You permadie again and again and again but you can earn xp during your playthrough that can then be spent on permanent meta-perks like more health per level or higher base melee damage.  It's more challenging than some of the examples out there, because if you don't earn enough xp to buy a perk, all that xp dissappears.  Nonetheless, bit by bit, I find myself (sometimes) stringing together more and more levels before the inevitable fatality (other times, I just die- but man is it a fun ride). ""What I take from writers I like is their economy...that's magical."" -Mos DefRR shows great economy of design. It's indie in the beautiful way only our age allows and it does not strut like it's AAA. There is no chaff, no filler. It doesn't pretend to be something great or profound. In fact, if anything, it is proudly and defiantly banal.  And therein lies the magic, that special something that makes a game fun with no pressure and no strings. Just FUN.And in our lives of overwork, overextension, and exhaustion= I have to say I really appreciate that.RR is in Early Access so I will hold off on a number rating, but I will say with great joy- If you just want something FUN to play, get this game. You will not be disappointed.No Drama, Just Reviews***Also, SHOVEL KNIGHT*** "

Early Access Review
								This game will give you nostalgia. I used to love Road rage games back in the day. This one lives up to that name for sure.It's a rouge-like type game but with races. You get different weapons and different mission which are randomized every single time you start a new game. Once you beat missions and start progressing you get power ups inbetween races/rounds. Along those you also level up your charachter and can unlock abilities which are permanent. This means you keep coming back for more and more action. There are 5 bike choices at the start and they vary in acceleration, grip, steering, top speed etc. You can also pick riders, it includes a flaming pumpkin as a rider so you can be Ghostrider too lol. Other noticible biker is a Shovel Knights character as a rider. There is a Psycho rider too which i think is the reference to the Borderlands Psychos but i am not too sure about this one as it looks a bit different.Gameplay is very similar to the old Road rage formula. You race and in the race you get to bash your opponents with a variety of weapons including guns, pipes, baseball bats, shovel etc.  This game is very arcade-ish and races can be very adrenaline fueled and exciting. Very very fun gameplay in my opinionGraphics are decent, not the best out there but not that bad either. For an arcade type game like this you don't need top of the line realistic graphics anyways. Some of the maps looks very good while others not so much so i guess graphics are average.Sound can really use an improvement in my opinion. The crash and hit sounds are not that good but then again the game is in Early Access so hopefully we'll be getting improved sounds in the future. Music is nice though.Conclusion : Very nice game. Pick it up if you like arcade racing and/or are a fan of the Road rage games.			"

Early Access Review
								I'd like to agree with most initial impressions of this game. In fact, I do - on *FIRST IMPRESSIONS* this game is awesome and full of potential.  But it remains that - potential. All too quickly the loose-and-lazy slap-dash approach of unprofessional early access devs becomes apparent. As a demo it's great and gets you excited. As a proper game? It's rough, unbalanced, repetitive, buggy, generally unpolished and has barely been seen any meaningful updates in months. I feel the design of this game has lost it's way - the dev blog hasn't been updated in over 12 months?!  How about sharing a roadmap to completion.Don't buy if you're hoping for a finished, polished game worth playing more than a couple hrs. I bought in hoping they'd follow through and now I regret it.==================update - I've been contacted by the devs asking to discuss my review, which is very decent of them. I appreciate that they take the time to engage with feedback on a 1 to 1 basis. The response was literally ""yes, we know, we are working on all those things"".I think regular news posts on what's to come might manage expectations a bit better?If you're interested, these are my issues:- Transparency.I am invested in this Early Access game because it shows potential. I don't know what your priorities are going forward toward v1.0.  Early Access is (usually) where devs take feedback and keep their supporters in the loop about future plans, yet most updates are minor polish/bugfixes with no mention of what's next on the list. Also, no posts on the dev blog since mid-2014... This leaves me wondering what the developers believe the game needs in order to be considered 'complete', because people investing during Early Access might want to know. Heck, in the very least I hope the developers consider *listening to their early access supporters* somewhere on the list of priorities, because why the heck do we buy-in to an unfinished game in the first place? Because we believe in you...Some aspects of the game could be awesome, and instead feel 'tacked on' / meaningless.- StoryNothing? any motivation behind playing the game? even Road Rash 1 had basic NPC dialog that meant something...Suggestion: invest in making me care about progressing thru the random content. Even just a bit of text explaining the backstory is better than nothing.- all the things, all the time.choose a bike, choose a rider, have lots of random weapons, figure out all the controls, all the tactics, do all the things - in your first race?!   Everything is there. Nothing feels especially useful. Suggestion: A carefully crafted progression whereby the game begins with just a couple of options, and as I progress, I learn about each new weapon / gear / perk / bike / rider etc as part of a well designed game... I am told there is a plan for this but ""it just isn't in the game yet.""   If there's plans for this stuff - *tease me* with it in a news update, and I will fall in love with this game all over again!! It's a no-brainer!- randomly generated missions.Why? Sure in theory it's 'less repetitive', but honestly they're all pretty similar in practice and you get no warning of what's coming next. Suggestion: Different missions require different tactics and/or equipment.  Foreshadow what's coming and let me choose my perks / gear before tackling the next leg of the journey. This system works well in countless other random-encounter games, and would work well for a 'pick a path' progression across the map of the USA - eg: route A is more direct but dangerous, route B takes detours but offers better rewards.Perks System -A lot of choices, a lot of them redundant in certain situations, or too cryptic.Suggestion:  Make these choices meaningful! eg: explain what criticals are / how they work before asking me to spend $ on improving them.- GUI it's terrible. I assume this is getting an overhaul at some stage...?- Online Multiplayer ...? it's totally ok if you can't do it - just say so already!			"

								Genre - Racing whilst FightingI never really got the Road Rash bug back in the day but played similar games like Chase HQ and Road Blasters. This game is actually really fun and the developers seem quite passionate about it. The levels are as varied as they can be with one taking place flying over rooftops with jet propulsion and harpoons (I was quite happy staying on the road to be honest). There are various weapons you can pick up and you can get upgrades between games. There are also permanent upgrades, definately a mechanic to follow, as seen in Rogue Legacy and Iron Fisticle. This means that if you are crap like me, if you play the game enough you will progress, not just keep falling at the same hurdle. There are other bikes and cards to contend with. Sometimes a straight race, othertimes a battle. You will crash if you ram into things not bouce off like in some games, which I like as it adds to the tension, but the game can still be forgiving re-setting you and taking some health. I would recommend giving this game a blast, I am not biased as I received a free copy of the game, honest. If anything I would more likely give them a bad review to show my neutrality!			"

Early Access Review
								When it first came out, people ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned that it wasn't like road rash. When it came out, they ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned (and some still do) about low frame rates. They ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned about the sound track, the gameplay, basically everything.Road redemption is a great example of an early access game that actually gets worked on over time, as it should be. Early access is a scourge on games. Especially because people seem to think two things. The first thing being that buying early access gives them a seat at the development table (it doesn't) and the second thing is that for some baffling reason, most people assume the early access means finished product. Road Redemption has come a long way since it's inception, going from a somewhat shoddy bike racing game with combat, to what a modern iteration of road rash should be.  The frame rate is smooth, much smoother than it was when I first got it. The controls are responsive and easy to learn, also an improvement from it's early days. The enemy bikers are ridiculous and fun. I encountered some guy wearing huge bullhorns on his head, I promptly shot him in the back but apparently he was a boss with a longer life bar than most so I had to beat him to death with a shovel. A sort of flaw that isn't really a flaw is the games rubber band AI. If Road Redemption were a regular racing game, it would be a flaw. Road Redeption is a combat game though, and so this habit of enemies to soft lock onto your position only serves to make fighting them easier. That's not to say you can't take a cheap shot as you sail by some chump with one of the games many weapons. Both guns and melee weapons to choose from. These weapons can be earned by killing enemies, or stolen from enemies by interupting one of their attacks with counter while unarmed. Some of the weapons are very difficult to get without stealing them from enemies. The sound track is great, perfectly complimenting the gameplay and the graphics are appealing.It's a deal at 20$.

								Extremely fun and addictive both playing solo or with a group of friends. Also brings back good memories from Road Rash times.  The only drawback is gamepad compatibility issue (as of October 2015 Early Access (EA) stage) for Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2 and another older generic gamepad. Sure, this issue can be fixed with Xbox360 controller emulator, but would be nice to be able to play without it straight out of the library. Looking forward to the seeing the final finished game version.  9/10.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: Game is fun and well done motorcycle combat with melee and guns. Early access means less content, not a broken mess of a game. Looks good, sounds good, and plays good. Solid 8/10.This right here is a game that gives one at least a little hope in early access. For those whose only concern is whether it's another DayZ ( minus most of the hype): NO. The devs are actively working on this game, adding content, and keeping their priorities straight.So how's the actual game? I never played the original Road Rash games, so no nostalgia goggles for me. It's good, simple fun. You choose your rider with various bonuses, your bike, and you race along generated stages with a mission. Controller support is on point, and playing with a keyboard (my preference) is just fine. The controls are great.The game looks pretty nice. It's made in Unity, so it should run great for most people.As far as the actual gameplay goes, combat and the sense of speed are superb. Melee combat works great, the guns feel nice and fluid. A lot of the game is generated as you go alone, including the stage layouts, weapon drops, and missions per stage. The game is designed for several playthroughs, and it works pretty well. I will say some stages will start feeling a bit too easy once you make sufficient progress in your skill tree. The soundtrack is damn fine as well.TL;DR: Game is fun and well done motorcycle combat with melee and guns. Early access means less content, not a broken mess of a game.

								**********Early Access Review Date: 24/04/2015**********DO YOU REMEMBER ROAD RASH? DO YOU WANT A MODERN REMAKE OF ROAD RASH? IF YES, BUY THE HELL OUT OF THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. IF YOU AREN'T SURE, ALLOW ME TO REGALE YOU WITH THE TALE OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH ROAD REDEMPTION.I watched the trailer for Road Redemption and immediately knew I needed it in my life. I bought and installed it, eagerly awaiting my early access experience, knowing that even if the game doesn't progress beyond its current state, the devs claim that there's already a solid 10-15 hours of gameplay implemented. I believe that this may not be entirely accurate. You can't call this gameplay - this is an experience.My first run, I didn't make it to the end of the first track. I wasn't entirely sure on the controls or mechanics, but it seemed fun enough. Did I mention this is a game with permadeath? If you get a game over, you spend your XP on some permanent upgrades, then it's back to the start. Any unspent XP is discarded. Killing enemies is the best way to tip the odds in your favor here - every kill nets you some boost meter, some health, some XP, and some cash. Cash, and the items you buy with it, are lost when you die. Depending on your playstyle, you may find that you prioritize certain items which complement your playstyle. I advise you to save this approach for later. Become comfortable with both the selection of melee weapons and ranged weapons. Learn how explosives work. Learn to use the grappling hook, once you get it. Did I mention there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed GRAPPLING HOOK? Learn to parry enemy attacks. Learn to kick other racers into oncoming traffic or environmental obstacles. Learn what shortcuts look like, and when to use them (or not to use them). Learn to use your jump jets, when playing on rooftop levels. Learn to disarm enemies. In short, learn the ins and outs of the game's many and varied mechanics, to ensure your success. Which is never guaranteed, since each run is randomized. Sometimes there are snow levels. Sometimes one of your fellow racers will be driving a car intead of a motorcycle. Sometimes it won't be a car, but a truck filled with logs, which spill out and cause everybody behind you to crash out, completely filling your boost meter. Sometimes there's hallucinogenic gas.There are still some rough areas of the game - parts of the UI need work, parts of the soundtrack, which is mostly great, is... less great. Sometimes the game will decide that I should be facing the opposite direction in the middle of a race, just for funsies. It also takes too long to get back into the action after crashing out, especially on the rooftop levels. I also kind of find myself yearning for actual graphics options. And unlockable bikes/riders. Those are just little niggles, though,  and the game IS in early access, after all.In short, if you like combat racing games or the original Road Rash, or just want to play as Shovel Knight riding a motorcycle swinging off of helicopters on a grappling hook and smacking racers with a medieval mace, buy this game. It's really good. Also, it has 4-player co-op, and online coming soon.			"

								If Road Rash and Carmageddon had a baby it would be called Road Redemption.The gameplay basically is a remake of the Road Rash series from the 90s, spiced up with some crazyness of Carmageddon.The result is... pretty cool!Despite it's early stage the game is quite a lot of fun,whacking rivals off their bikes with an arsenal of weapons just never gets old.Graphics are decent and the soundtrack rocks,there even is an upgrade system and a bunch of bikes and riders to chose from,however there is still a huge amount of potential for additional awesomeness.What I'd personally like to see in future releases are customizable names, colors, bikes and riders,as well as different climates / biomes.There is also not that much replay value, yet, so I'm excited to see what the devs come up with.Maybe a level editor and a stunt mode? Would be neat to have loopings and rampsthat shoot you into high heavens for points. But that's just my 2 cents...If you liked Road Rash back in the day you can't go wrong with this game. "

								Don't know why i didn't recommend this from the beginning, but that's being corrected now. This game is outright fun & ridiculous.Played this a lot before it was on Steam so just a heads up.Driving a motorcycle on on-going traffic, avoiding cars (and some 'want' to hit you), kicking/hitting other bikers to their death (they try to do the same to you), holding and shoving them to crash into a car, shooting them while maintaining and driving through traffic, placing C4 on them and getting the F away. Jumping from one rooftop to another, sometimes using hooks like spiderman to reach another rooftop.. this is just insanely fun!With a nice and challenging campain, with new campain+ , and local splitscreen (soon multiplayer) coop/pvp.Also, just to keep in mind this is still in early development, bugs, preformance issues and whatnot are present, so just a heads up.This is next-gen road rash. This is fun. This is ridiculous. This is awesome. ten out of ten, would spiderman C4 a guy again.			"

								I bought this game over a year ago hoping it would bring back some nostalgia from my road rash days. While it kept me ""entertained"" for a while, in the end it's not even close to a complete game. I feel like there has never been any clear direction for the project as it just seems like a bunch of redesigned road rash features mashed together with no purpose. The reason i loved road rash was it gave me an incentive to win each race (or at least finish on the podium). This would grant you cash so you could upgrade your bike. The progression was satisfying and you were excited to get that new bike.The opponents didn't seem generic. You might get knocked off your bike by Bill in one race only to get your revenge in the next race. Each race felt like an extension of the previous. Unfortunately in Road Redemption none of those Road Rash qualities come through. There is no real story, and no incentive to win races (I don't like the idea of character upgrades, it should have been bike upgrades). The controls are nice, the graphics are nice, and you do get a bit of enjoyment out of using weapons to disable your opponents but it gets old really fast without the fun ""grind"" you got from Road Rash.

Although I haven't played Road Rash since I was young, I sometimes find that that same excitement with my past favorites is no longer there, even though the game itself may still be fun.

Early Access Review
								Iv had this game for a while, wasnt very impressed when i first played it but after the recent update it has become a very addictive, very fun game. Combat is satisfying,blocking to parry enemy attacks gives an element of skill to combat. The bike handling is good,feels like a rollercoaster ride. The available perks between races are random so you need to choose what suits your situation,often takes you one or two minutes to choose what you need most. You have one life throughout the campaign so you need to manage your health well,because when you die you lose your perks and restart from the beginning, although you do get to buy permanant perks with each death. And when multiplayer is implimented its going to be an amazing game. Road Rash was a long time ago and its nice to have a worthy replacement. 7/10 with room for improvement.			"

								Grab a shovel and get on your bike.If you're old enough to remember Road Rash, this game is much like that, except more fun and brutality.You're a bike gang member, let's call the gang Leather Trousers.As a member of Leather Trousers your sole purpose is to destroy every other rider by utilising kicks, punches, and a variety of weapons.The more mayhem you cause and races you win the more money you get.You use the money to purchase upgrades like additional damage and increased health.You lose these when you die.When you die your accumulated XP is spent on permanent upgrades that you will utilise on subsequent playthroughs.The game has a few bugs/annoyances but nothing that kills your enjoyment.So put on your tight leather trousers, grab a shovel, and ride out.

								I really want to like this game. I'm a huge Road Rash fan. Unfortunatly, the gripping flaw is how the bike interacts with the road. It just doesn't feel real in this game. The physics were awesome in the original, but here, the bike doesn't feel that there is any suspension, the grip of the road isn't there, and gravity hardly matters. I also wish the upgrade system was different. In the original you worked hard to save up for expensive bikes and then tuned them up. Here you just stick with the same bike and upgrade your character through your deaths. After that, there isn't much replay.			"

								Road rash with better graphics!! Thanks to the developers who are working on this game, this brings back the memories.If you love road Rash you should buy this game. The game works great for early access. Waiting for multiplayers and other game modes! expecting some changes that will improve gameplay:	optimization-the frame drops are ridiculous	voice overs for riders and cops	character and bike customization	some hard rock music would be awesome while racingOverall this game is really fun and brings back the good old road rash memories-10/10I recommend that you get the game in early access but you need to have patience and understand that this is an early build.

								I don't have a ton of time in it so far, but what I've played of Road Redemption have been fun. It is very much the spiritual successor to Road Rash, which I greatly enjoyed on my PS1. Besides the basic combat, which this title mimics well as far as my memory serves, it also layers a progression system. You can purchase perks with the money you've won but they vanish after you die. You also earn experience, which can be used to upgrade other facets of your character than remain even through death. This adds almost an RPG/roguelike experience to the game. I only have a few quibbles. The rooftop levels are the least enjoyable for me. They seemed neat at first, but it's very easy to miss the same jump over and over again or become stuck on parts of the roof geometry. Still, it's nice to have something besides the same basic roads to race over repeatedly. I also have some periodic issues with getting knocked off my bike for no apparent reason. Minor issues aside, Road Redemption is an excellent way to get your Road Rash fix. I look forward to future updates to refine the polish on this already fun game.			"

In its current state it's really fun to play and has all of the heart of feeling of the original road rashes. The game has a long way to go and i hope the devs continue to make it better, but it is worth a buy if you are a fan of this type of game.			"

								I've played through the main Early Access campaign once, and I have to say that this is genuinely a fun game.It plays really well, with a combination of player and game generated cinematics that can get pretty crazy at times. An item/skill you gain use of on a certain level really adds too it, and makes gameplay a lot more fun. The permanent upgrade tree helps balance out the challenging aspect of the game by giving you something to work towards. I prefer to play with an Xbox360 controller on racing missions, and with mouse and keyboard on missions that require you to take down enemies. Thankfully you can easily switch between the two in the esc menu. I look forward to seeing what is added in the development process, playing through campaign+, and the upcoming online multiplayer.Also the Dev's are great as well in terms of communication and bug fixing/updates, that must be said.

								Loved road rash and whilst this lacks some of the comedy there's a lot of fun to be had. The recently added classic mode is much more Road Rash than the main game.Why lacking in comedy? Well for those who played Road Rash the bikers voices were always funny and here they are just somewhat lifeless.However split screen multiplayer is a blast and something hard to come by these days, especially on PC.Once we have online up and running and dependant on how well this work it works it's well worth a look. If they add some more amusing biker sound effects too then it's nearing on perfect. Even as it stands I've had a lot of fun with this game so give it a go if you liked Road Rash.			"

								Early Access Review: I think it's coming along really well. I'm having a TON of fun reliving my childhood with updated graphics and gameplay. The campaign, once you beat it 2-3 times, can be beat in like 30 minutes or so, but I'm on my 7th time beating it so it's got high replay value. There is a campaign+ mode, too, which makes things harder. It's got a LOT of potential to be something great and I firmly believe it'll become that. It's a great pick up and play game, especially with a controller, if you got some free time and don't want to commit to games that require hours of your attention at a time for the full effect. This is a very instant gratification game so far with high replay value. I'm about to go beat the campaign again because the core gameplay is just so rewarding. Highly recommended!			"

								Yeah, I'm going to have to recommend this. I have to say it takes me back to the days of the Genisis with Road Rash. This is much more fun though since you can do a little more customization and develope your play profile. The game can get a little crazy with turns and things falling out of the sky. The traffic almost becomes insane at later levels but even though it detracts from the reality of things a bit, it make sense that the game should get harder as you get further into it. It would be nice though if the environmental hazards (crazy turns and heavy traffic) were replaced with harder opponents or goals. If someone could make an openworld game with this kind of action, it would be awsome. This game, for the price has given me a good amount of fun. I did get it on sale though. It would be even better if there were Steam supported multiplayer. If you like racing, a lot of butt kicking and progressive profiles, this game is a good one. It still gets regular updates too.			"

Do you want something deep enough to feel like you are getting better and accomplishing something yet enjoyable and can be played casually?This game is just good motorcycle beat em' up fun. No its not Road Rash, but for me it scratched the itch for vehicle thrash action. Hey, you still there? Smart guy... Do you feel like grabbing some fool and smashing them into the back of a moving car? Kicking someone off a bridge? Taser them off a building? Yes you sick freak, you can do that and IT'S FUN.Do you remember those old racing games that had fighting? Skitchen, Road Rash? This is a different take on the old formula. Race or complete objective all the while avoiding danger or causing it. Oh, and did I mention you have levels where you hallucinate and you race with cars raining from the sky! SO. MUCH. FUN! Its not the deepest game in the world but for a fun, upgrading, surviving, vehicular thrastacular adventure... if that's what your into you won't regret this purchase a bit. This is one game I havent uninstalled because its always fun to go back too. Maybe it will be one of your regulars too.			"

								The game is simply awesome. I did the scummy thing and pirated the version that was out last November, but now when the June update went online I immediately tossed out 20 euros for the (still) early access game. I think it has improved tremendously, the gameplay runs very smooth now, the soundtrack is good, fighting enemies that shoot back at you is just pure enjoyment and mayhem. The driving is maybe nicer with a controller (I hooked up a Dualshock PS4), but shooting is of course easier with a mouse and keyboard. The game is fast paced and hard, as it should be when it builds on the legacy of Road Rash. I played them on Sega genesis and on PC in the 90's, and RR feels a worthy successor. For a challenging arcade style drive-and-fight, just get the game. I really hope the developer(s) manage to implement online multiplayer, because that  would make this a real hit I believe. As it stands, the gameplay feels pretty much ready for a full release.			"

Even in early access, Road Redemption is pretty solid. Motorcycle racing and combat together again, but this isn't just a re tread on an old game; Road Redemption brings the basic idea to the 21st century with multiple weapons and different objectives keeping things fresh. The control feels pretty good and I personally have not run into any bugs as of yet. Be aware the game is in early access and is unfinished. I'm eager to see what's new in future updates. I would love to see a larger variety of bikes and riders to choose from.  "

**Alpha Version 0.002 Review**ROAD REDEMPTION is the spiritual successor to Road Rash and is a thrilling jaunt through the open roads, rooftops and rainbow roads, fighting enemies and winning the races with fluid controls.Positives:+ Dynamic maps, weather effects and mutators (car rain)+ 60FPS Support+ Near-on full use of the SteamWorks API to deliver achievements, trading cards, cloud saving and more+ Large assembly of melee weapons, not always straight upgrades (different speed, damage, critical % and reach values)+ Car crash crinkles+ Different modes+ Good level of air control+ Local multi-playerImprovement Opportunities: - most of these are likely just a result of being alpha state- Maxed out graphics settings leave something to be desired in texture quality- When playing with a controller, you're still required to use the mouse to navigate through the menu- Enemies attack in a predictable manner- Current version does not take away the grappling harpoon and boosters on non-skyline maps (bug)- Poor draw distance for dropping assets (eg. cars are only generated very close to you, ~ a few hundred meter)- Current Campaign state takes ~40 minutes to beat- Bonuses for kill streaks would be a good addition- Unity launcher options made available in-gameAlpha Thoughts:Compared to other Early Access games, especially those in an alpha build, Road Redemption close to justifies it's current sales price (AU$15 at present) with even it's existing content.  I'm still finding myself playing through Campaign+.Definitely one to watch, Road Redemption is a promising racing / fighting game.  It plays more ""arcade-y"" than Blur and is a great couch game.Other NotesI received my Early Access key at no cost from a developer directly.  Post beating the game, I was given a prompt screen where I could ring a developer and talk about my experiences.  It's great to see, and testament to the indie model, that I could have such direct access to the team to discuss my feelings towards the game and voice my suggestions.Asking the developers what the terms are in relation to uploading game-play to YouTube - I was informed both over Steam and via phone call that I can upload any game-play material, music or other assets from the game with no restriction (this may not apply to you!).  I see some other players have already started uploading footage, so hopefully this'll have the intended effect of bring more players to the game.			"

The game is definitely not a simulator and it doesn’t let sense stop you from being able to do some outrageous things.-----Not that really it affects gameplay but the aesthetics could use some polish. This is to be expected from an early access title, especially on it’s initial release.----- If you miss a jump you will fall into a mysterious grey void which is the point where structures cease to exist. And here you will find random props suspended in the air and other motorcyclists who suffered the same fate.-----I like the v-twin sound of the your avatars bike. But I think riding a sportsbike that sounds like a racer would be cool too.-----In some areas I suffered from low framerate with the graphical settings set to ‘fantastic’. Lowering the settings to ‘good’ alleviated this. 11 But framerate was still an issue where large amounts of vehicles were present in close proximity.At the moment there is only the option of campaign mode, either single player or splitscreen coop. There is no online mode yet. I played solo.-----In campaign mode you play through a series of levels. Most levels take place on a highway populated by road vehicles.-----It is cool to ride your motorcycle at high speed through traffic while brawling with other motorcyclists. Trucks overturn and spill their cargo, blocking the road and you constantly have to avoid cars that have gone out of control. You will miss some obstacles by only centimetres.-----Some levels take place on roof tops. You and the other motorcyclists must all make jumps from rooftop to rooftop. For some reason automobile traffic will also occasionally join you on the rooftops. They aren’t very good at making jumps.-----Every stage has a different objective which appears to be randomly selected, such as racing other motorcyclists, attracting police attention or taking out a number of other motorcyclists without using weapons.-----Occasionally there are special hazards present. Theses include a motorcyclist who constantly throws timed explosives onto the road behind them and ‘car rain’. You might want to keep your distance just so that you can survive and make it to the next stage.-----All other motorcyclists and certain cars are hostile. They will swing weapons at you or try to drive you off the road. You will lose health when you take hits, fall off your bike or fall off a building. When you run out of health it’s game over.-----You have the choice of up to three weapons at a time. You can acquire different weapons by dispatching foes or completing stages. Most of them are melee weapons.-----Initially I used the gamepad because I figured that it’s probably better than keyboard and mouse for controlling a motorbike. It is probably is better for controlling your throttle. But then I realized that this game has guns and the game pad sucks for using firearms.-----I would recommend using the mouse and keyboard solely for this purpose. Being able to use your guns effectively and your ammunition efficiently means a lot in this game.-----Weapons aside, the coolest way to dispatch other motorcyclists is probably by grabbing them. You can take them by the neck and maneuver them into oncoming vehicles or obstacles.-----There is also a grenade launcher which you can fire from your motorcycle just like terminator II. I was very happy to see this.-----You have a limited nitrous boost which you can use to make your motorcycle go faster. You magically regain nitrous fuel as well as health and earn extra cash by taking out motorcyclists and other vehicles.-----In some stages you also have jets that allow you to jump and glide. It’s ridiculous but, I thought this was awesome because it was just like riding a motorcycle from one of my all time favourite games, Full Throttle. The problem with it is that there is no indication when it runs out of fuel needed to boost you over a void.-----After completing each stage you can spend your cash on items, most of which last until you die. Items effects range from recovering lost health, minor increases to your rewards for taking out other vehicles and completing races or extra lives albeit with the loss of most of your maximum health.-----When you lose all your health during a stage you finally die for real and it’s game over man. You will have earned experience based on the total amount of cash you earned in your run. Your experience can be used to purchase upgrades which will carry over to future attempts at the campaign.Currently there doesn’t seem to be any sign of the ‘truly epic quest’ story line. But it will cool to see it and online multiplayer in future updates. Personally I wish there was open world MMO game like this with minimal ‘RPG’ elements, I think that would be awesome.-----This game was challenging, I only made it halfway through the campaign after numerous attempts at it. Sometimes what you are rolled with can be really difficult even on the first level.-----But it’s fun. And I think the price is reasonable for amount of content as well as the potential replayability that the game offers. I definitely recommend thinking about getting this game.Since writing this I have completed the game in it's current state. It's actually not very long at the moment, although I did say the game had a good amount of content. But an update is scheduled soon. Presumably more content will be released with this update.Also I recommended using keyboard and mouse in my 'review'. However after using keyboard and mouse more I realized that the gamepad is actually a lot easy to maneuver your motorcycle with.﻿Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			"

								Brilliant, violent, teeth gritting fun.  Really reminds me of the halcyon days of Road Rash 2/3 on the Megadrive, and the 3DO version.  It is still thoroughly supported and updated regularly by the dev, so huge props there.  It was great at early release, if a little rough around the edges, but it's come on in leaps and bounds now.  Definitely worth the price.			"

Early Access Review
								When I was younger I was a big fan of Road Rage 64, saw this game and course had to try it. Can't complain to much about the game itself, it's a bit better than I had anticipated after reading the reviews. However my main issue here is the developers say they're close to bringing the game out of beta, but I have absolutely zero idea how they can figure that... The game has many bugs still and isn't quite refined yet. It's actually quite frustrating at times, here's a list of a few things I can recall that have really bugged me in my first 4 hours on this game;-NPC bikers set routes are a bit over powering - IE I'll try and take a short cut, but if an NPC biker is next to me, you better believe that if I'm in the way of his route, he'll turn into you and take you with him. The NPC bikers can really manipulate the direction of your bike, but you can't quite do it to them.-General physics - I love that it's pretty easy to jump into this game, the driving isn't too difficult, but some of the physics are horrendus. Getting stuck on a cars bumper, invisible walls above rocks and other objects (whats the point of having a jet pack if you can't fly over objects?), smashing into a wall and staying on your bike, but clipping an electrical post and going flying.-NPC damage and taking damage - they do little damage, which is kinda nice, but my major issue here is when you do successfully hit an NPC with a melee, they don't get dazed by it like my character does. Why is that? I'll be so close to accomplishing a new level, I'll hit and NPC while they're mid swing, do damage and somehow they're still able to get their attack off. That should exist for the player as well, or make the NPC's get dazed for a moment like the player does.-Lack of tutorials - As I mentioned earlier, it is fairly easy to understand how to play and what is going on, but there's no tutorials at all and there's very little or vague explanation as to what some of the items do/how they work.Overall, I am enjoying this game so far, but it does come with it's moments of frustration for sure.If you're interested in this game because of Road Rash - I'd say give it a try, if you don't like it within the first hour, return it, simple.My suggestion to the developers - Don't get ahead of yourself when it comes to progress. Keep doing what you do, be honest about your progress and people will continue to support you until you can get the game out of early access.			"

Early Access Review
								PROS:Road Redemption is really fun, even at this early stage. I'd compare the combat with the horse mounted battles of Mount and Blade, only on a hyper-speed motorcycle that can boost. It's extremely satisfying to line up a perfect critical hit with a battle axe against a cluster of rival bikers. The way the cars and characters are constantly flying across the screen in a physics-tornado of destruction is incredible. The gameplay loop of short racing/combat challenges, buying temporary upgrades, and then applying earned XP to persistent skills is smart and addicting. The game is frequently updated by its developers.  CONS:Performance inconsistency has been the one thing I have found frustrating, but it is to be expected at this early stage. The current build as of July 5th will fluctuate back and forth from over 100 FPS to 30-50 FPS in a matter of seconds and I'm running it on a GTX 970. Earlier builds ran really consistently, but as the has game progressed, the optimization has suffered. I expect later versions to run much better.  I also feel that, at the harder difficulties especially, there is too much pipe bomb spam from enemies. It seems like a cheap way to artificially increase difficulty. I imagine that the devs will continue to balance the game to correct this in the future. FINAL THOUGHTS:I've gotten more than my monies worth at this point from this game. I can't wait to see what the devs bring to it in the future! I'd love to see an ""endless"" or open world RPG mode, perhaps in a sequel.			"

								-+-EARLY ACCESS REVIEW-+-This game is still in the early stages, so buying a product this early in development will always be a risk. So far, I've had alot of fun playing this title.  Ton's of action, laugh out loud moments, and on a few occasions my jaw dropped.  I've played roughly 2 1/2 hours of the campaign so far, and haven't reached the final mission yet.  There's alot of challenges and various missions.  A lot of features are still missing in Road Redemption, and I'm hoping the $20 dollars I spent on this purchase will go a long way as development continues.  This feels like Road Rash, a title that hasn't been released in over a decade.  I can neither recommend or not recommend this game, as far as its too early to judge.  A twenty-dollar bill weights differently in people's pockets, but there is ALOT of promise, momentum, and potential in Road Redemption.  So purchase this game under your own risk with faith this game will be completed before the price spikes up.  Gameplay is there, the graphics are absolutely fine, I just feel like the empty content is holding Road Redemption back. 6/10(Once some more game modes are released like a quickplay(just choosing to race or do takedown missions with multiplayer options) are introduced, I'd give it an 8.75)			"

								I've got to say that I'm positively surprised with this early access title. Road Redemption is a next-gen son of Road Rash, a great old title which I enjoyed back in a day. It features a XP-based upgrade system along with store where you can buy items, crazy physics and many game modes. It's definitely a breath of fresh air on lately released games, not your usual racing game. It'll suck out hours of your life and you'll find yourself stuck to the screen.			"

Its still in early access so dont expect the game all done (im interested in the Competive). Only thing bad i can say about the game is that u can not save a playthrough, so you must end it in one go or leave -hope the add some saving point-.Give me more weapons to make my enemies fly and crash :)7/10 not bad for a game in progress.

								Nothing's more satisfying by grabbing your opponent and crash them into oncoming traffic. Or kick them off a bridge. Or taze them with a cattleprod. Or pump 'em up with lead, Terminator style. Or stick C4 on their bikes and watch them fly through the air. Or decapitate them with a machette. Or...Definitely a must buy for those old school Road Rash lovers. The whole setting and gameplay breathes nostalgia. Even some of the music reminds me of that. Installed this game again after a long time and there has been huge updates since. Haven't encountered anything game breaking bugs yet and the ones I did encounter were minor, which I'm sure will be ironed out by the devs. The game has  been amazing so far and once online multiplayer gets integrated, this game would be perfect.

								I bought this game upon its first release and was pleased initially but left with wanting a little more. After this current huge summer update I can say the game has certainly taken off in a great direction. The enemy variants and improvements to the AI have made this game an absolute blast to play on both the regular and higher difficulty levels. So much so that there is a bit of strategy involved into how and when to engage targets as well as timing blocks,grabs,and c4 plants at the perfect times. Overall I'd say this was definitely a solid and worthwhile purchase and it continues to be so as the devs are constantly working to add and improve the game. With online play looming in the distance, this game is destined to truly shine.			"

								It does seem similar to the famous ""Road Rash"". But this is not that game. It is not made with the intent to be that game. Stop comparing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed game to others for ♥♥♥♥s sake. Now, onto the review.This game is really fun. It is fast paced, reflex intensive, and honest good fun. Yes, this game is early access, and yes it doesn't seem to get ""massive"" content updates every week. However, it is not abandoned. It is still supported and actively being worked on. They actually want to make this game and complete it. The developer gives you a number to call, they are dedicated to their work.While the menus are a little clunky looking, you can tell that it's made with love. The graphics are relatively good, by no means bad. It looks very pretty, although I think the draw distance could due to have a little bit of an upgrade, but it's unity so it makes sense. If you're into racing, motorcycles, kicking people into oncoming traffic, whacking people upside the head with shovels and nailed bats, shooting your way into first place, and blowing up police cars, then you're gonna be into this game.

Early Access Review
								I kickstarted this game. It sounded like best racing concept ever. And it still does.But execution is jus f****ed up.Campaing gameplay consists of series of missions that you play until you die. There are two mission ""types"". Kill X people before timer runs out and race. I hate timed missions with passion, but amount of required murders is usually low, so unless something bad happen, first type it's doable.But if you were given ""race"" mission, you already lost. Winning means getting 3rd or better place. That may sound easy until you realize that opponent AI keeps other bikes slightly slower than your top speed is as long as they are in front of you and keeps them just behind you after you overtake. That means every time you slow down, everyone you ever overtook flashes in front of you and gets ~200m advantage. EVERY. Effing. Time.And you will slow down eventually. Either by hitting something, getting stuck in scenery, getting stuck in another vehicle or just by trying to get through curve. My favorite place is curved road just before finish line in 1st map. I can get there 1st with no problem, and then choose if I let everyone overtake me by slowing down, or just fly over the road and let everyone overtake me while I respawn. Aaargh...Rest of stuff as points:+ graphics looks good+ music is great- vehicle & character selection doesn't remember choice+ keyboard bindings are configurableand my personal favorite:- gamepad can't be configuredwhy, just why....

								What an amazing game. So much fun, and it's still in early access. I bought this early on in it's development, and it was a blast to play then. More if not all early access games should be this awesome. It keeps getting more updates, fine tuning, and somehow better with every patch.The racing is done well, the combat is done very well, and the sense of speed is fantastic. It's tremendously satisfying to kill opponents with the melee weapons, and the sense of ""GOTCHA!"" that you get lining up a head shot while speeding down a highway will leave you beaming until you crash head on into oncoming traffic. Which reminds me.... grabbing other racers and steering them into oncoming traffic might just be the most satisfying way to kill in this game. RPG elements extend the lifespan of the game greatly, giving you something to buy at the end of each game that will enhance your abilites in the next attempt.This game might not be something you sit down and play for hours and hours at a time. But for the past 2+ years, I find myself loading this game up time after time and having a blast with it every single time.VR users: this game works well for me with TriDef and Virtual Desktop. Play the game in 3D, it'll be worth any dowgrade in gfx settings :)			"

								This is not Road Rash; this is Road Rash if it did steroids for a little too long.I could never explaint he excitement this game creates; but since I'm obligated to try in a review: you get to ride a 100mph motorcycle shooting a shotgun while using jumpjets. Yes, yes, and more yes. If you haven't purchased this you should.Gamplay: 10/10Gratuitous Violence While Driving a Motorcycle: 10/10Road Rash Clone: 5/10: while a spiratual successor, no: Road Rash is garbage next to this.Did I mention jump jet motorcycling while shooting a shotgun?Seriously if you do one thing this year, buy this game!

								The closest we will ever get to a new RoadRash game until EA either get their head out of their a55 or sell the I.P.It's still a bit limited with features right now. With 1 old skool kind of mode where you do race after race to see how long you can last buying some temporary and some perminant upgrades between levels, and I question how balenced it is to add guns to the game but the potential for greatness is here.Not worth full price until it comes out of early access but still good, assumbing they do a good job once it comes out of early access that is...

								While it is not the most in-depth game (in its early access state, anyway), Road Redemption is a great pick up and play arcade-style game, a gem in its simplicity. To me, it strikes a nice balance between an arcade racer and a beat 'em up. Typically, I will only play for an hour or so at a time, but I find myself coming back time and time again to give it another go. I typically play simulation and 4X games, but this is a nice break from their more in-depth play.Pros:+Smooth game/graphics - plays well on high settings even with an older AMD Phenom II X6 1100T and GeForce GTX 770.+The fact that the missions and courses are procedurally generated means that progress actually makes me feel like I'm playing the game better, rather than just memorizing the courses.+Fun game to play local multiplayer with controllers.Cons:-No network multiplayer yet.-The missions on the main campaign feel a bit generic. Have to see what happens as the campaign is finalized.Overall, if you like games like Metal Slug, Gauntlet, or the older Cruis'n series games, you'll probably like this.P.S. - I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I do kinda like the occasional missions where the cars drop from the sky.

My Thoughts/About The GameThis is a very fun road dash game. Good game to kill time. I was interested in buying this game because of a youtuber I watched. If you like shooting or hitting people with shovels and you like racing games then this is definitely for you. The campaign is decently long, and the levels get tougher. Some of the levels include racing on rooftops with a grappling hook. However, I do have some problems with this game. The AI needs to be fixed up. Some of the maps need to be tweaked a bit. Finally, upgrading your racer is really weird. Why not remove this since it's so confusing. In Conclusion For an early access game it's a good start. However, I'm afraid that this game will lose its hype. The updates are rather slow. Many problems need to be fixed, and hopefully the community grows. I really want this game to become the greatest; if not, the best road dash ever. The concept is very interesting. The game is still in development, so that means that I will update this review in the future when the game is complete. Finally, I recommend this early access game.			"

								I actually love this game. Not becous it is easy or has a good story. But because it is so freaking hard that you will keep playing it for hours just to get a tiny bit further every round. The part that makes this game so hard is that you can turn the camera veiw around to attack enemies. But you also need to look out for obsticles, and other riders, while raceing your motorcycle. So every time you look away, you will have a hard time following the road. Sounds easy, and should be. But is really, really hard. So don't play it if you are a keyboard thrower, or have a bad temper.You get permanent upgrades after every run. so keep digging deeper to get that extra bit of XP. And there is a ton of weapons, perks and upgrades to earn. And a hand full of different motorcycles and costumes to choose from, to keep you busy.Note that a lot more content will typicly be added later. I will give this game 7,5/10.			"

The first incarnation of Road Redemption was a little weak, but each update has made it better and closer to the feel of the originals with the updated graphics and mechanics of more modern games.I still long for a simple circuit style campaign but I like what they are doing because it is unique.  I can't wait to play this game at its final release.			"

								Road Redemption is a simple, yet satisfying experiance. It is a lot of fun bashing your opponents with blunt, sharp, long, and explosive weapons. Shooting however needs refinement, and is janky as all get out. The level design starts off bland. but quickly becomes very intense as you jump highrise rooftops trying to bash other riders off into oblivion. Only 5 or so bikes available at the time of this review, although  the developer promised to be making more bikes in the future. Oh yeah, his actual phone number is displayed in game, and I called him. Much to my surprise he answered and we talked about how things were going. It was refreshing to be able to give input directly to the develpoer.$10/10$ DEV NUMBER IN GAME NOT SWAMP MONSTER ASKING FOR TREE FITTY			"

								I am not a big fan of racing games, nevertheless I have so much fun playing this game.It is in early access so there are a couple of bugs here and there but is doesn´t affect the gameplay at all. The content is perfectly enough for an early access game and I still haven´t finished the campaign because the levels are getting harder and harder.I got this game on sale for 10 bucks but I would say its also worth a buy for the full price of 20, just because it´s just a game where you can casually get on it, play it for a couple of hours and have a TON of fun, because it is so damn satisfying when you knock that biker of his bike or let him crash into a car, it is AMAZING. Probably one of the best purchases I made on steam. looking forward to multiplayer :)			"

								It was June of this year that I originally purchased Road Redemption and soon after got a refund because of the early, glitchy mess that I found. I recently was contacted by a Road Redemption Developer recently, asking me to give the game another try now that they have been working on it and asked me to tell me what he thought of it now. This review is a summary of what I have found.Road Redemption is, quite honestly, a fun game. Gone now are the vast sea of glitches I was initially met with and I have now been served up with much more responsive controls, better, tighter gameplay, a refreshed look about the whole thing, and an all round tidier experience.Road R has came leaps and bounds from the game I had originally canned. Dying now is no longer an annoying set back caused by falling through a floor or stopping dead for no reason and more becaause of the insane cluster ♥♥♥♥ of battling bikers that excites more than dissapoints.The rooftop levels needs just a tad more work to it, I noticed that for what ever reason, the A.I seems to get faster on roof tops, just barely staying out of your reach many times but this is a small flaw in what is now an other wise brillantly fun a manic game.Also, special mention to the player friendly attitude of their team. It's a rare thing for a developer to not only listen to their critics as much as their fans and respond in such a positive manner. Enough praise can not be give to this team or their game. Well done.			"

								Road Redemption is reminescent to the good ol Road Rash days; bash people in the head with various weapons and kick them into oncoming traffic at high speeds, hearing that satisfying ""crunch"" sound as they crash into a dead stop. This game is unique in its upgradable elements such as the bike, health, weapons, etc. You ride through different missions with a single life, but your experience remains the same after death. Here is the rundown.Good:+Like Road Rash+Car crashes+Upgrades+Decent graphics+Satisfying kills+Different mission types (kill rivals, race, no weapons, etc)+OSTBad:-Still undergoing lots of work with physics and graphics-Controls are a bit iffy on the keyboard-The sound effects are minimal*I would love to suggest improvements for the game; there seems to be a lot of boring ""dead space"" during gameplay for my ears. I think maybe having an announcer or more sound effects or at least some more atmosphere going on while playing. *I would love to see a rival system. Like if there were bike gangs/groups and if you killed a member then that group would be more inclined to attack you in other missions.*Would love to be able to buy different bikes or at least change their look/style.*Would love to see visible damage; if character is low on health, perhaps helmet is cracked and road gear has some scuffing and holes in it (or bike damage; fire, smoke, sparks etc)*The attacks are fine, but it would be great to be able to hold the attack and release when you are ready instead of the awkward timing (yes, road rash did this, haha)Other than that, the game is pretty cool despite it's slightly unplayable for some people (myself included), but is being corrected and improved. The devs are really great and really want this game to work. Please share with them your thoughts and comments!			"

								As much as I wanted to like this, however in it's current state I can't. If you are thinking of buying it, I suggest waiting to see if things such as control/physic improve.It has the potential to be a fun and engaging experience, saddly it fails to deliver a smooth and consistent experience. While it ""runs"" exceptionally well with next to no problems there are a number of design flaws that are more then apparent.Bike Handling seems to sit between an arcade style and driving a brick on an skating rink. At times the handling sensativity goes from very low and unresponsive to a twich style that overcompensates for what your aiming to do. This becomes very noticable while trying to corner only to slide off a rooftop (or bounce off one)Overall Physics/Hit Detection are terribly ballanced with riders able to effortlessly push and overpower you from side to side while vehicles are able to bounce you like a ball in a pinball machine. To your own bike hitting into other riders moving the slightest bit. As far as object/hit detection goes, often I found my self coliding dead on with various world objects only to be stopped dead in my tracks, having to utilize the ""reverse"" controll to fix my positioning so I could go to the center of the roadway again.Combat while fun also falls to some major design oversights. Melee combat is divided between two buttons for left and right attacks, taking up two keys that by all rights could be done by one with side detection being utilized from what direction your leaning. The developer ""claims"" to have tried this but found this was better, how I am unsure as using any typical controller this layout is non intuative and uncomfortable. Ranged Weapon combat is plauged by it's use of the camera to do the aiming. This then puts strain on not only the poor driving mechanics but having to manage the camera being locked inplace waiting for movement as opposed to following the bike while not in use! A terrible design oversight as you are forced to constanlty ""aim"" while your weapon is out or use the non intuitve means of selecting a different weapon. Lacking dedicated weapon ""slots"" also leaves something to be desired.My last issue comes to difficulty and penalties for failure. While in theory having a single life system sounds like a fun engaging way to reward progress. It is handicapped by an over the top health reduction of typically 50% of your max health for not completing your objective with in the rather narrow window provided to do so. Either from poor bike/combat controlls to a lack of overall HP to progress through each ""forced"" fight engagement. While in theory a great way to minimize combat issues it only adds more through being forced into fighting more then you may want or are able to.Bundle the above issues and you end up with something that comes across as a good concept only to find that it executes all of it very poorly.

								As a major fan of the Road Rash series from the Genesis days to the 3DO / Saturn days I had very high hopes and expectations for this game. I really would love for a spiritual successor of the series to continue off.However this game feel  short in many ways, and as a fan of the original for that reason I cannot recommended it.The first glaring problem is the visuals. The game is plastered with effects (heavy fog / post processing / bloom effects) that contrast with the aesthetics of the orgiinal series.The original road rash series had amazing visibility, bright vibrant colors, and very little in the way of visual clutter.Road Redemption however looks like it was ran through a series of Instagram filters that do nothing but ruin the game play (making it extremely hard to see where you are and where other bikers are).As an early access title I would assume the developers would be open feedback and potentially changing addressing these issues, however suggestions have fallen on deaf ears. The following attempts to bring light to the situation has yielded no results.http://steamcommunity.com/app/300380/discussions/0/613940109787258126/http://steamcommunity.com/app/300380/discussions/0/619573787361886299/I have given this game one year since initially trying it, sadly none of the updates have addressed these issues (has gotten worse with recent updates adding more visual clutter / fog/ HDR).If the dev team address these issues I would be open to changing my review, however at its current state I cannot recommend this game to any one who was a fan of the original series.

								To say this is like Road Rash is an understatement and the fact that you beat (and shoot) people to death whilst riding a motorcycle are the main similarities. For me this game is a lot better. With the RPG like skill tree you can permanently upgrade health, NOS, attack damage and many more upgrades every time you play using the XP earned on each play through.I found it was pretty hard to complete at first, however once I'd got the hang of it and upgraded some skills and weapons it's become more manageable but still a challenge.There's plenty of weapons to use which come in 7 categories: Swords, Heavy weapons (like hammers, wrenches), Long weapons (like shovels, broom stick, double sided axe),  standard weapons (bat pipe, mace), Pistols, Automatic weapons and explosives (C4, grenade launcher). All of which (apart from explosives I believe) can be upgraded in between levels.The attacking is very responsive you can duck (when holding a gun) or block attacks from enemies and also kick them out of the way or you can grab them and force them in to oncoming traffic. Shooting people from their bikes very satisfying especially if they're firing at youThe game is not just about winning races whilst killing as many people as you can. There are 3 different scenarios which are randomly selected for each level. These are: Race, Beat the clock to the finish, Target takedown (eliminating marked targets before they escape). Of course it does pay to take out anyone and everyone you come across (literally) For each rider you eliminate whether or not they are in the race or not will reward you with health, NOS, money and XP. The game is an arcade style in that once you're dead you have to start over and battle through the 17 levels to complete the campaign.There are a number of different bikes to unlock of different speeds and handling and also several different riders. I don't think there are any difference in the riders skill wise but I just normally use the first guy. Think he's called Jonny Sizzle :DFor people that have friends that visit your house as opposed to online I really liked the split screen feature where up to 4 people can play at the same time on one copy of the game.I've heard that online multiplayer will be coming to the game on its full release too. Rumoured to be October 2016In all this is a great game. Since the last update there are no bugs or glitches. Handling is really good and responsive.I've Still not fully maxed out the skill tree yet and there are more marked as coming soon. One thing I would like to see is a proper career mode and some sort of story with your gang. (Son's of Anarchy link would be awesome) 90/100  CurrentlyThis is the most fun I've had on a motorcycle since Road Rash 3D			"

								Trailer is really well done, but the game itself , at the moment, is not good. There are times when i know that the game is not finished and it can get better but this one is not the case. When i watched the trailer this game seemed really fun to me, and it is kinda fun, but the amount of flaws keeps it back from being a good game. God awful soundtrack (MAIN MENU MUSIC NEEDS TO BE CHANGED ASAP, it is so out of place i couldn't believe that), ridiculously bad animations when falling from a bike, beyond awful menu design , almost every race you will see no animations when crashing into things like big side pipes or when falling of the bridge, and the graphics overall are pretty poor looking. This game needs A TON of improvement in order to be enjoyable, i'm not saying that it can't be good, but i doubt that the developers could achieve that, and maybe a cornerstone in this will be their budget.I really hope that this will be a good, polished game one day, but in it's current state, i can't recommend it.EDIT: the developer updates this game really often, so at least it's not likely to be abandoned like some other Early Access games, and this is a good thing. Really hope that this game will be finished soon and i ,most definitely, will recommend this game any day .			"

								     I am really liking this game now. The developers have made some changes that make this game fun to play again. The huge road block at level 3 with the masters race has been taken out so now your progression in the game lasts beyond 10 minutes of gameplay. That was a big step forward to making this game enjoyable. They didn't remove the black semi truck which used to be extremely annoying, but it no longer matches your speed when you are in range of it, therefore it's annoyance factor isn't really an issue anymore. I am no longer getting hit for over 50 percent of my health from one melee attack and In the few games I have played since the latest patch I am no longer experiencing the rider that blocks every melee attack no matter how well you time your attacks. This is also a huge improvement.     I am still keeping my fingers crossed that there will be a game mode inserted later in development which brings back the series of racing for points and progression to higher racing leagues which the old Road Rash games had. But The changes with the recent patch have made this game fun to play again. I'm happy to see the development team making positive changes.			"

								I usually dont play racing games. This is a racing game , but you also get to beat, hack and shoot the other racers. So yeah this game was lots of fun. Choose a motorcycle and a rider and on with the Road Warrior tactics. An easy game to play, with a little skill of handling your bike and how to kill all others, this game is well done. The music is rock, metal and a touch of techno that goes great with the atmosphere of revving motors and dying rival gang members. There is just one mode, in witch after choosing your rider and bike. ( Shovel Knight ) you go through a series of missions that basically all end up of you riding your bike as fast as you can, to kill as many as you can. After each mission completion use the money earned to gain upgrades to weapons, your bike or health. ( Beef jerky, hot dogs and burgers heal you).  Travel accross the US causing death on the road. After you die in game, you gain experiance on how far you get in the US ( aka how many missions you did) Then you use the experiance points to ugrade a talant tree, that like the between mission shop, you can upgrade your weapons, health or bike. These points in this tree stay perminant and help you kill and ride the next time you play. A great game with inventive weapons  like bats, metal bats, bats with nails, clubs, mallets, axes, machetes, long axe, crowbar, woodplank, hammers, pipe...yeah and theres guns! SOON MY DOGS OF WAR, WE SHALL HAVE IT MY WAY !!!			"

								I previously had multiple performance related issues with this game that caused the game to be unplayable for me. I posted a negative review that has since been deleted as all my prior issues are now irrelevant.The developers have greatly improved the game with continuous updates and improvements. The game has come along quite nicely since I purchased it during the 2015 summer sale. They even removed the misleading ""Multi-Player"" tag and replaced with the appropriate ""Local Co-Op"" tag on the store page. I am still looking forward to the addition of online multiplayer. I appreciate the continued effort of the developers and their involvement with the steam community. They developers are listening and implementing our feedback. I am glad I supported the developers and look forward to future updates on this incredibly fun game.			"

								Road Redemption is a totally f&%$ing mad Road Rash update on the Unity engine. Still in Early Access at the time of writing, while the game looks a little rough around the edges it is still mightily playable. Cars, trucks and bikes zoom and whizz in every f&%$ing direction, ragdolls fly through the air with the slightest of ease and all manner of blunt instruments are swung at your head from every side. Bludgeoning motorcycle cops and rival gang bikers is tremendously satisfiying and the actual racing physics is entirely satisfactory. Great stuff.			"

								Oh Road Rash, how I've missed ye!   Not anymore!  This is fun, playing it on a keyboard and mouse currently and its tappa tappa in the turns, just like on the Genesis.  I imagine when I plug in the Xbox controller it will be easier to control, but this takes me back... Way back.   Can't wait for the full featured version.  Graphics upgrade from the Genesis are awesome, as well as the new weapons.  If you loved Road Rash, you will also love Road Redemption!			"

								EDIT 10/8/16 ONLINE MP ALPHA ADDEDThis is a race mode that has 8v8 or 16v16 racing a single track with two shortcuts. It's rough, but it's an alpha. Will update review in time. As for now it's decent, but we've been waiting for it for like ever so it's pretty great too lolWhen I was a lad my neighbor had Road Rash on the Sega Genesis and one glorious summer we spent all our waking hours playing it.  I played this today and was intensely overcome with a sense of righteous nostalgia and I spent nearly the entire time I was playing with a stupid grin plastered all over my face.  I can only speak for myself but here's some review elements:Music: I'll be honest I have it turned off, didn't even give it a chance. I heard it at the main menu and it sounded cool? I have my own music playing most of the time though so this is generally a non-issue for me I won't rate the music.Graphics: They're ok, they actually seem pretty good to me however i was more concentrated on the gameplay than the graphics? More importantly it's pretty optimized on super-ultra-mega settings.(those aren't real settings. my GPU is a gtx970)Gameplay: I used a wired 360 controller for it. Three bikes right from the start, sort of easy, med, hard-ish? It's what seems like a pretty awesome feeling arcade controlled-Mad-Max-biker setup on the controls. Compared to the last ""biking"" i did which was GTAV- This is amazing! You can pull some super tight turns depending on the bike you're riding and the breaks and nitro mechanic work pretty responsively.I didn't really look for a difficulty setting, i just hit career mode and went with whatever is default, but it starts out pretty easy and ends up being more challenging and strategic as you go along, with different enemy types that are weak against different blade/blunt combinations, of which there are different types of swords, bats, and wrenches, just to name a few on the melee side. On the controller there's a button for Left and a button for Right side melee, you also have a trusty kick move which is classic, and seems to auto zone in on whichever side is closest and is good for giving you some space in a mob. You start out running a series of races on a randomly generated map with some objectives and other stuff. The better you do the more experience and cash you get. Cash can be spent between rounds, but then there's an almost rogue-like element where when you finally die you can spend your experience on like an RPG-style passives skill tree.  It was actually sort of cool to see that, so when you die you actually die and have to start over(Career mode) but you get to boost your next playthrough with other stuff, and respend your cash as you get through the races.I'm not sure how online would work but they plan on having dedicated servers so that's a big bonus in my book, and they aren't super cash grabby regardless of what people are saying. The steam board isn't super active but the devs will answer there.			"

								""Road rash for today's world"", as prob. have been mentioned a million times...or at least in every review. :)So, you ask, what is it?It is ""Road Rash for...."" :PIt's simple, fun, graphics are more than good enough for the game, handling may be a bit too good as it may make you forget how ""arcady"" the game is.What I mean with the last bit is that you can't crash without running into something, even if you jump off a bridge you'll always land on your wheels, just like a cat....if cats had wheels....That's something I tend to forget and it sort of makes me lose focus on fighting and the environment - the real dangers - which means I will crash/get my head bashed in.Something else not really obvious is that it has a slight bit of rogue stuff to it, in that you can put constant upgrades to your bloke/equipment and such after you die at the end of a run, also that the health you end a track with sticks with you to the next track during the run. (but you can get burgers and such between the levels if you've earned enough cash)Anything negative?Only something I personally have a hard time with, the driving while also aiming with right thumbstick and firing with right button, like in GTA V, I'm not a huge fan of it due to having a hard enough time aiming with right thumb stick standing still. :) (as it seems I'm the only one in the universe being 100% crap at that thing the game will be flawless for everyone else ;))I don't regret buying it that's for sure and I even bought two extra copies that I'll give away on my Youtube channel, no, I won't let you know even its name....I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ am I not? :) (I can say that it'll happen very early August, so searching for ""Road Redemption giveaway"" might work - and I won't even ask for a sub. 'cause I'm a nice sort of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ :))			"

								This game is absolutely amazing. It is exactly as portrayed in the videos; The fighting is seamless (except maybe the gun fighting, if you use a controller), and feels like an action film throughout. I highly reccomend this to anyone who just wants to relax and make some fireworks! My one complaint is the innablility to display across multiple monitors for multiplayer. I have 2 screens, and would love to play this with my brother, except it's too hard to see when it splits the one screen in half. If they fix this, 10/10!			"

								Road Redemption is Road Rash Reborn and it does a damn good job at it too. It delivers insane high-speed racing mixed with brutal combat that has you smashing other bikers off the road to score first place. (or whatever the objective is) The enviroments are crazy with cars colliding into eachother causing havok to avoid crashing into and cops trying to sideswipe you. Its a fantastic game to play in short bursts when you want something fast and furious to pass the time.THE GOOD+ The racing and combat is incredibly satisfying+ Graphics are pretty good for early access+ Randomly generated enemies/hazards keep things interesting+ The rooftop levels are super addictiveTHE BAD- Menus are very bland and uninteresting- Many melee weapons feel identical- FPS takes a hit sometimes on highest graphics settings- Lack of modes (The game seriously needs more modes upon full release)- Lack of customization (You cant buy new bikes or gear)THE UGLYWhen you die, youre DEAD. Time to start over again. (But at least you get to permanently boost your stats)BOTTOM LINE:I think Road Redemption is a fantastic game that gives many fans of vehicular combat the action they've been craving for a long time. I very much look forward to the implementation of multiplayer in 2015. Recommended. 8/10PROTIP: Playing with a controller is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

								So I loved Twisted Metal, Downhill Derby, Destruction Derby, Jak X, Carmageddon, Vigilante, Cel Damage, Full Auto, Blur, Death Rally.  Dude the list goes on.  There are a great number of underrated Vehicular Combat games.  Even the terribly bad ones, were still really enjoyable and funny as hell with your buddies or solo 1 v 1 with AI.  The concept is so gritty and simple.  Destruction Derby is a total throwback to this forgotten genre.  I can say with confidence that this game isn't just a great VC game, but a great and fun game overall!  It's a near perfect game as is.  Just a few tweaks here and their to make it as best as can be.  If they were to release more updates and dlc and additional Content plus a multiplayer, I'd be willing to keep coming back to it.			"

								Road Rash 64 was one of my favorite N64 games. It was fun playing that game with all of the crashing, hiting, and multiplier powerups. It even had some enjoyable fitting music, despite that it was not much or a few in total. This Road Redemption has interesting objectives and for the most part, fun. Potentially more music, if possible from a few past games or maybe custom playlist option (well unless that is already happening in game and I have not searched enough). Unless done, potentially spawn thunder that may randomly strike on and off roads. Alvanches to from mountains.			"

								TL:DR Did you play Road Rash as a kid?Yes?Buy this.No?Need to blow off steam ever?Buy this.--After TL:DRThis game is a faithful reimagining of the old Sega Megadrive classic. You'll be cruising along on a motorbike while wielding all manner of weaponry, attempting to get ahead of rivals and police alike. (And by ""get ahead"" in this game, we frequently mean ""cause mortal injuries"".)This game is still in early access at the time of writing, and of course that means it might not be the most polished game you'll buy. And no, it's not – but it's by no means bad on any count. The graphics are okay, and the fact that it hails back to an old classic does, in my opinion, give it some leeway on graphics, because it can add to the nostalgia factor. The levelling and upgrade systems have recently had an overhaul, and I haven't had much time to play with the new versions but I think they're an upgrade over the old versions.Things I like:- The difficulty. It's not easy. A few levels in, I find there's a *lot* to watch out for, and the enemies are much tougher (possibly a little too tough, or maybe I'm just bad at the game!)- The ""hallucinagenics"" levels. That's creative, and makes for a slightly different level to most of the rest.- The weapons. Great range of weapons, and I see they've had some upgrades since I last played; you didn't decapitate people with the swords, last time I played Road Redemption. Now you do. - The actual bike driving. It feels gritty, fast-paced, and ... well, not realistic, but something along those lines.- Unlockables. This is, I think, a new addition. I like that there are bikes and riders to unlock now, and that the bikes have different stats. That adds something to the gameplay.Things I don't like:- The sound. This is pretty much my only big bug-bear; there's very little sound in the game at present. - The difficulty. I know I put it in the list above too. I just wish that there were some choies of difficulty setting.I have a few ideas for improvements, and I'll be running those ideas past the devs in the discussion boards.  Meanwhile, it's great to see early access devs who are actually working on their game, even months after release. "

								I bought this game ages ago, and had a ton of laughs -- the game at that time was fun, but unrefined and (perhaps unintentionally) hilarious.I just checked in again to see what's changed -- it is SO much more polished now, far more balanced. It's a tight racer/beat-'em-up, and is once again one of my favorite time-wasters.I definitely recommend -- it's surprisingly good, and now looks great, too. Not sure what improvements are planned for non-Early Access release, and it doesn't really matter. It is releasable as is -- any improvements down the road (which I expect, with the way this game has so consistently been updated/improved so far) are just icing on the cake. "

								I haven't played this game for long (40 minutes at the time of writing lol), but I already love it! Not everything in the game has the ""perfect"" feel to it. It definitely has its own little glitches so far, but none have been game breaking for me. I got stuck inside of a boulder and just backed out of it. That was the worst one, but it's an easily correctible one with a patch here or there. It in no way took away from my enjoyment of the game. It definitely has that Road Rash feeling. It's obvious they're trying to take it to the next level, and I like that. I can't wait to get some friends over to try this game out. (They don't ""PC""..... yet lol)			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWDefinitely doesn't feel like a finished game yet but it has a lot of potential.Cons: It can feel 'weird' at times, giving you strange driving physics or random bugs (like getting stuck in a log/block/other random obstacle) and you can say it lacks polish.Pros: It already has this ""just one more run"" addictive quality of roguelike games and it is quite enjoyable to land that critical hit on a rival gang member or crash someone into an oncoming truck.So I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price at this time if your motivation isn't supporting the developer but it's definitely a nice game with lots of potential and with a little more polish it can become a really good title. P.S. I didn't even play Road Rash so this review isn't biased by nostalgia ;)			"

								This is a modern and revamped remake of Road Rash. I must say OH WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE!!! So glad I bought this game and I cant wait for the final release to come about! That being said, what has been done here is exactly what Ive been looking for in a game. Motorcycles, violence, guns, and speed! There are however some drawbacks, one of my biggest gripes is the motorcycle sounds. the crotch rocket sounds exactly like a harley and the harley sounds like....a harley. Im not sure how much expansion on bikes and types will be made but I would really like to see ""classes"" similar to the original Road Rash. (rockets, touring bikes, choppers, rat rods, etc.) also online multiplayer would be fantastic. I could see this game doing exceptionally well in that area of endless playability. If you are like me and grew up playing Road Rash 3D on a playstation....GET THIS GAME! its awesome even in early access! Great job to the team and I hope you will read my feedback!			"

								Growing up with the Sega Genesis when I was around 10 I used to play a series called Road Rash, it was great. They then made a Road Rash 3d later for the original Playstation and it was great too..... then no one made any combat motorcycle games for years & years & years and it sucked, until someone made Road Redemption & gave me a flashback to the days of my youth, racing motorcycles & beating the crap out of other bikers! Great arcade game, I recommend for sure.			"

								A Road Rash Clone, but you get guns.  What I enjoy about the game is that it features the same antics in racing that one gets out of Rod Rash.  While it is important to get a higher position, in this game, it gives more focus on attacking other cyclists.  That being said, it has alternate modes that it goes into that wasn't in prior Road Rash games I had played (granted the last I played was Road Rash for Windows 95, which was the same version on the 3DO console).  There are some odd places you travel, one being a path that features cars raining from the sky, and the player must dodge them.  Also, I find it interesting that such a game was authored in Unity3D; it is really proving how the technology is progressing.  Unfortunately, the game has some quirks.  Granted it is a mere ""arcade"" feel game, it doesn't focus on how a motorcycle or a car would actually travel on the road.  This is a mere notice as many people buy into games such as Mario Kart where they do not implement natural turning of a vehicle, but rather the rear of the vehicle pivots.  (contras this to say Tux Kart which gives a better example of how turning occurs with vehicles).  Additionally, the game has bugs where it randomly crashes on the Linux platform, typically after permanent experience level ups are awarded after dying.  Also, I'm not sure if it is a bug, but I've seen ""cars"" identified as ""npc"" enemies that are holding position in the race, and I'm supposed to attack them.  Again, maybe this is on purpose?  But I haven't contacted the developer to see.  At any rate, I have to give serious marks down on stability on the Linux platform, but overall, the game has a fun factor.  I have to recommend it at this time, but as time progresses, if these issues are not addressed, I will change my rating to negative; not because I want to as its a great game, but if the game does not work, what does one really have?

								If you've ever played Road Rash back in the day, well, this takes those rose-tinted memories of a game that probably doesn't hold up today visually and brings it to modern standards. Not only that, it adds an in-depth upgrade system. Initially, I did not like the way you lose all your upgrades upon death. As you keep the same health, unless you heal, from wave to wave. Then I realized when you die, there's permanent upgrades you can acquire that last game after game and the in-game upgrades are the carrot at the end of the stick for trying to get to those further and further waves. Overall, it's a brilliant system and I'm really looking forward to what this games turns into upon final release. There's some minor niggles with the camera (it's all mouselook) so you have a hard time keeping upon with the action sometimes or other times you'll notice it just feel off and then correct it upon thinking about it. Which can bring you out of the game. However, it almost feels necessary for when you get a gun to have that free aim. So it might be something you just need to get used to.I highly recommend getting this game whether or not you played the Road Rash of yore. The procedural tracks are fun and feel solid. Not just cobbled together. The weapons are diverse and quite fun to use. Especially the sledgehammer and old Remington from Terminator. I'm sure they will be adding a lot more content as well such as more bikes and players but in some races there's even a giant truck to contend with! Check out this marvelous brutal racing action before it releases and gets  a full price.			"

								It's not perfect(and since it's still in early access, that's to be expected anyway), but it is a lot of fun, and the devs seem committed to getting updates done. If the idea of Road Rash meets rogue-like appeals to you, then you'll probably enjoy this game. The physics are appropriately arcade-y, and the combat feels satisfyingly brutal. It can be frustratingly difficult at times, especially if you're like me and don't have great twitch reflexes, but it's still great to play in short bursts. My only major complaint is with the mission variety. Nine times out of ten, I end up with a race. The races are fun, but I'd like a more even distribution with the more violence-oriented goals.			"

								Road Redemption isn't identical to Road Rash. Unlike what other reviews will have you think, this is certainly only Road Rash in the sense that you ride bikes and wallop cops with baseball bats. Also sometimes you have to race.While those things are a very large part of what Road Rash is, where this game is different is very obvious. It's got a much more arcade feel, with the one life is all you get policy. The melee battling is about countering enemy attacks so you can disarm them or critical hit them, rather than just zig zag punching them until they drop their 2x4.There's also guns. My personal favourite being the sawn off shotgun. Extremely satisfying to use and the reload animation is awesome. They aren't particularly difficult to use, being hitscan weapons. And since one shot is usually enough to put a rider out of commission you never seem to run out of ammo.The C4 is equally satisfying to use.The current race modes are a mixed bag. You can get anything from Jackie Chan's Kung Fu Kicking Competition to 10 tonne rain while trying to win a race. This isn't a bad thing by any means, the variety is good. But it's a far cry from Road Rash's rigid illegal street racing structure.And in the end it shows. The absence of a distinct race mode means the pace is set by the other modes where you try to kill as many cops or rival gang members as possible. And much of the time the race mode doesn't feel any different. The addition of punching bag bikers during a race slow down the pace considerably. I often found myself forgetting I had boost because I was having too much fun wailing on cops and these random dudes in the race and still ended up winning. Once again, this isn't a bad thing. But design wise I think it would be better to choose one or the other.On the few occasions a fellow gang member turned up, I found they would swing at me as they drove past. Their AI doesn't appear to be any different from the other bikers except that they prioritise the AI over you. In the full game I'm left wondering how establishing a biker gang and only having one life to do it all in will play off each other. I'd find it difficult to invest myself in a gang or my comrades if I knew the moment I died I would have to start all over.The Jump Jets attached to the bike during the rooftop level are a fun addition, but don't add much to overall gameplay on the non-rooftop levels. I often just ended up using them so I could shoot grenades at my feet. And cheat by jumping over crashes and huge logs. I never really found a use for the grappling hook, though it'd be fun if I could attach it to one of the helicopters seen flying over the tops of levels sometimes.Overall, I would recommend this game. But it is in a beta/alpha/whatever at the time of writing this review, so my impressions are obviously not going to be relevant when this game finally releases. Or at least I hope not because Road Redemption has a lot of potential.			"

								It's been a few months since I've played this, but it didn't even take an hour until I was in the zone (a blood soaked zen), having fun, and achieving something. I backed the Kickstarter for this. Even though it's not finished yet, Road Redemption, as it is today, is everything I hoped it would be.I loved gritty vehicular combat games growing up (not cute stuff like Mario cart). This presses all the right buttons. I even have an old PC with Road Rash installed (among other games), and Road Redemption is better in every way, even with my rose tinted notalgia glasses on. I like that there are biker gangs (and that you're in one), and the variety of enemies, weapons, game modes, and locations. The roof tops aren't as intimidating as they are at first.Now if I can only do everything AND pay attention to oncoming traffic... guess I just need to ""git gud"".			"

								Please take note this was uploaded when the game was in Early Access phase....Awesome! That's the game I wish I had before. Road Redemption is an adrenaline-fueled arcade racing game about motorcycle gangs beating crap out of each other on a highway. When you think: ""...and that's all?!"" -you haven't got a slightest idea how great this concept works. To be honest, I'm so excited about this game I couldn't really stop all these positive emotions exploding in my mind.Ok, let's try to be objective now. How about a quick draw of ""pros and cons""? Consider this:+ Gameplay mechanics. Fun, entertaining, randomly generated objectives.+ Controls.  You get to do a lot of things but it's allright at your fingertips.+ Music.  Each track plays out in the right moment,I don't even know if it's on purposeor it does operate randomly.+ Graphics. Nice and smooth. If you have a dated PC (like in my case),you could easily lower the graphicsto make the game run at the right speed,without exploring menus and options for decades.+ Overall simpleness. Don't get me wrong - it's a reallygood thing about this game, that it is notoverloaded with un-needed **** like other titles.+ Old school progression scheme. You get one chance to finish campaign,if you die - you start over.+ Character (Skills) leveling. While you can't save/load campaign or anythinglike this, you still get better and better when you get experience from each individual run.+ Co-op.   (coming soon). - (""Cons"")None seen. Maybe some improvementsfor the types, but that's about it.If you enjoyed games like Burnout Paradise, FlatOut or similar - don't even think, just GET THIS GAME NOW!!! Definitely will recommend it to all my friends.P.S.: Sorry for a tonn of text.			"

								Get out your old grunge mixtapes, plug in your controller, and get ready for a return to the insanity of the 90s. I got in on this at version 0.001, and it was clear they knew what they were doing and how much Road Rash they played before the series took a dump and died (they even pointed out what few realized about the originals not actually involving turning in a dev diary). The amount  of progress up to this version is really impressive, especially in such a short span. The core game is fantastic, now it's all bells and whistles. While the game is still in beta and you can tell it's unfinished (car animations are minimal, the camera doesn't keep up so well, there's only one attack animation, motorcycles don't have any real braking animation/sound), the actual game is tremndously fun. It's a smooth update of the Road Rash style that works well in the age of analog control (much easier to hit that other rider now!) and provides more than just straight races, although going fast and bashing heads is the essence of any track. There's some roguelike elements to the game, too. You get up front purchases of helpful items between rounds that last until you die, and permanent, XP based upgrades like bike quality, total HP, etc., and I hope to get to choose a bike later on instead of just upgrading the same one.My only complaints at the moment are that the guns would benefit from a bit of aim assist (if it was EASY to aim a gun from a motorcycle, it would be boring, but it's a little too unweildy right now) and that the tracks lack features. If they're being procedurally generated, the array is a bit thin. Judging by the desert, there's only two turns, sometimes you see a ramp or a divider, rarely a bridge. It's still a lot of fun, I'd just like more of it.Both of these problems are entirely reasonable for early access, and the latter problem is a sign if how good the game is - my problem is that I want more!Best motorcycle combat racing game this century that lives up to the Road Rash legacy with ease. If they manage to license a few songs (this is a natural fit for Soundgarden) or build in an mp3 player, they'll beat it.			"

								This. Is. Fantastic. While many other genre/franchise mainstays of the 16-bit era (platformers, JRPGs) have found a new home in the blossoming indie scene. One thing that had always fallen by the wayside was one of my favorite childhood games 'Road Rash' and its mixture of point to point arcade racers like Outrun, Hangon and Cruisin USA combined with a silly sense of violence that cant really be taken serious. Well this brings all that awesome, awesome, baseball bat with nails in it swinging, motorcycle riding, cop clobbering fun back. This is not a finished game by any means, but it is already fun. Yes, fun. Remember that? Well here it is in spades. Now get on yer bike and swing a shovel at someone. If that *thunk* of impact doesn't put a smile on your face, you might just not have a soul...

								Shovel to the FACE!!!!!!!!10/10 SHOOOOOOOVEL!(Seriously, though. This game is fantastic! It's got a few bugs, like any Early Access title, but don't let that distract you from the rest of the game. I've already made it to the end track several times now and have only experienced a handful of technical problems, none of which were game-breaking. I've had 0 CTD's or memory leaks while playing and after a few minutes playing around on Campaign, I found the controls to be excellently laid out for the Xbocks Controller. Don't believe the haters!)			"

								Good:- awesome gameplay- responsive controls- satisfying feeling when bashing enemies off their bikes- C4 fireworks- challenging without feeling cheap.- able to mute music and play a custom playlist through WMP.Bad:- Music is yawn- crash detection is questionable. (Any head on collision or telephone pole smack should result in a crash)- not too many tracks. Rooftop track is underused.Verdict: $20 is a little steep for an unpolished product, but grab it whenever its on sale. The little nitpicky things don't take much away from the overall experience. "

								To caveat on some other reviews, Yes it does get repetitive, There's not many weapon variances, you have several ""light"", ""heavy"", and guns.  You can kick people into oncoming traffic, off buildings, into signs and construction equipment, or you can just straight up shoot them/hit them with your weapons.  A lot of the levels are just replays like the rooftop levels, the only difference is how the AI reacts.  The worst thing for me in this game is how long it takes you to come back to life when you slam into a vehicle.  Watching counters it takes about 3-4 seconds to get back on the track, whats worse is when you try to use your nitrous to catch up to where you were and within ten feet of starting where you respawned you crash into another vehicle and have to wait to respawn again. The games fun for the most part.  Very Repetitive.  I have a friend who comes over and we play together which makes it a little more fun because you can take eachother on.  When playing co-op whoever finishes the best in a race is the score the entire group gets, when killing people all the kills are shared.One thing i hate is getting crazed drivers mode on the rooftops, it essentially does nothing.  If it actually had drivers on the rooftops it would be different.  Another thing that would be awesome to see is being able to play as a car once you beat the game as there are times when you're racing against cars.			"

								Well I initially thought i would be writing this review to recommend it avidly. However, still in early access, with little or no progress made, and limited function, i am not going to recommend this game, which showed such amazing potential. But here's the dealGoodModern, enjoyable, road rash esque game play.Fairly pretty (if you have the spec to deal with it. Mine ran fine at top spec then the flying cars came in and it slowed to a crawl.)Does not take its self too seriouslyEasy to learn, hard to master.Good initial selection of rider skins. Would benefit from a ""design your own look"" option for eventual full version.Story mode. Great ideaBadStory mode. Badly executed. When there is a story, call it story mode. Right now, its 20 randomly arranged missions over a sequence of tracks.Enemies with power armour. Where's ours eh?Bikes. Initially i thought it was a fair selection for early access. Then realised instead of 8 (i think) you only have 5 as some are repeated. No option to use the bikes that you see rolling around, big spiky fatboy choppers or dirtbikes.Afore mentioned slowdowns when more than 10 vehicles are on screen, probably be fine on a newer rig.Psychedelic drugs mode infuriating and inexplicable.Guns. Overly powerful. Enemies inexplicably accurate when firing at you at their 6 o'clock, but still managing to avoid oncoming traffic.As a biker it upsets me that people still think that you can use a weapon right handed and accelerate at the same time. The throttle is on the right. They should have some sort of automatic cruise controll when using a weapon, limiting speed, maintaining (little) realism.Most of the skill tree still says ""Coming Soon""Ugly.Lets face it, its games like this, and Wreckfest, which are going to kill off the greenlight system. People will stop buying games which fund developers, because they do not want the developer to take their money and never finish the game. This is not Duke Nukem Forever, it shouldnt take 14 years to finish. Lets hope they (collectively) get themselves together, finish the games and take a leaf out of ""War for the Over World""'s book and finish a decent game, then keep pouring good updates and decent content boosts to keep us interested.

								I was never a big fan of ""Road Rash"". I'd never had a 3DO, and although I was a huge PlayStation fan, I'd be lying if I said I ever played the series in any of its subsequent incarnations — hell, I never even played loosely-similar games like ""2 Xtreme"".That said, I've come to find in ""Road Redemption"" a game truly worth loving and one of the few early access titles which I deigned worthy of my hard-earned dollars — and that might be a reflection of the game industry at large more than anything else. Or, it might just be because the game's ♥♥♥♥ing fun. Just buy it and stop reading. In an age when $69.99 will buy you something like ""Dragon Age: Inquisition"", where you get hundreds of hours of single player content and a comprehensive multiplayer offering, ""Road Redemption"" is shockingly bare bones. You have a couple of different ""race types"", realized through different level types, and a simple campaign mode which is basically the classic ""arcade"" style, where you start from the beginning and try to get to the end.In spite of this old-school design, the game brings some newer persistent-reward mechanics to the classic arcade design. You earn XP as you play, and that XP can be spent on persistent upgrades which make subsequent runs easier. As was true of most games since COD4 with this concept, it's successful in rewarding ongoing effort.But what makes ""Road Redemption"" worth playing is none of its novel new features nor is it hurt by  its lack of substance.This♥♥♥♥♥♥is just pure fun to play. Smacking someone off his bike is so satisfying, and shooting a car to the point of destruction to get it out of your way mid-race is exhilirating. For all its anemicness and rough edges, the game is just fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥to play, each and every time you play it, for 10 minutes or 10 hours at a time. And once multiplayer is in the mix? This game is going to be one of the greatest of all time.Just ♥♥♥♥ing buy it.			"

As I've said before, for a game selling itself on the spiritual successor ticket, it fails to live up to or identify the aspects that made the original Road Rash games so enjoyable.RoadRedemptionDeveloper: yea well this next update is going to have a quick race mdoeRoadRedemptionDeveloper: that's more similar to the traditional road rash experienceRoadRedemptionDeveloper: and we're making the game's 3 gangs a lot more prominent in the world and in the story\Unmutual: Ultimately, it just feels like there wasn't enough soul searching. When you look at games like Carmageddon: Reincarnation (a game I never thought would be playable, but they proved me wrong) you see a perfect blend of old and new. Still remaining true to the original games while updating the core functionality and bringing the title to a modern audience.Unmutual: Sometimes I think you guys should have made the game with 2D sprites instead of 3D models, sure you probably would have popped up on EA's radar, but you could have done sooo much more.Unmutual: Oddworld Inhabitants was also able to pull this off with Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, bringing the classic PS1 2d sprite platformer to the modern era. Although maybe not as classic or eyegasmic as the hand crafted original, it still managed to find success.RoadRedemptionDeveloper: ok fine but that's a 2d gameRoadRedemptionDeveloper: the gameplay wouldnt' benefit from true 3dRoadRedemptionDeveloper: road redemption, on the other hand, would be severely handicapped with spritesRoadRedemptionDeveloper: and i'm not really sure what the benefit woudl be			"

								I Got in early on this game and have watched the slow transformation from glltichy crap that couldn't compete with Road Rash on any system to a nitro slinging bat swinging Mad Dash addrenaline rush single player Powerhouse of a game.  I reccomend this game to everyone! Especially considering the fact that if they do the multiplayer correctly it will be one of the most exciting multiplayer racing games on the market,Things still need to be fixed however like-Can we please not have wrecked cars falling from the sky ( I swear its like playing through Sharknado but instead of sharks it is cars) instead add wildlife that can wander out into the road. Flocks of Birds or Cattle herds or something.-Can we please have a bike & weapon & parts market to spend our cash in between races-More Bike options please,,,,,Tires intakes engines brakes ( Maybe upgades like fixing battering rams or spikes to them)- Rider Gear....Give your standard rider some personal touches to make them unique to youOverall This is a great game that has come a long way.  If they keep up the hard work they will most certianly have a game that will indeed Redeem the Road Rash Saga......Only trouble with that is in order to Redeem this series this game in its final state needs to be better than all other Road Rash games....A Tall Order Indeed however seeing how far they have come since the beginning Im sure they can and will give us Exatcly that.

								September 20 - I decided to go on a joy ride.September 21 - I reached a gasoline station and gassed my motorcycle. From the road there were guys in leather jacket shouting, and causing chaos while riding their motorcycle at full speed. Red flag but I continued my journey anyway.September 21 / Night - I decided to speed the night on the road so I built a camp fire near the river.September 22 - I met a trucker, nice guy who gave me some directions.September 22 / Night - I decided not to spend another night on the road and I was eager to reach the next town so I continued my journey. It was creepy and I was travelling on Route 23 when suddenly out of nowhere some dude knocked me with a baseball bat. I crashed and was rendered unconscious.September 23 - So I woke up and from the road there were a bunch of dudes on motorcycle whacking each other so I decided to take the 'off road'. I trekked through the mountains to reach my goal and I reached the next town.To be continued...I have played a similar game on the PSX a decade before. It's a racing game about polygon bashing each other before reaching the goal.Now fast track to 2015.Honestly there's not much of this type of game on Steam so it's a total bliss to see this game here. Instead of polygons, we now have a realistic dudes bashing each other while keeping your motorcycle stable and avoiding traffic.To be continued...			"

								I want this game to be good, but right now I can't recommend.  First the physics kinda suck.  The bikes have too much grip; theres usually not a reason to let up off the gas in a turn which is not how motorcycles work.  Flat out on the gas the whole race isnt racing at all and it degenterates this game into just another hussle for turbo, which then becomes the only reason to actually fight another racer.  You dont have to hold off your pole position like in Road Rash if you can turbo hop from one random spawned un-ranked racer to the next.  Which gets boring quick.  Also lame when a mob of un ranked, like not in any place 1st-15th, all hit you at once and the games over.  And all your stuffs gone.  No bike upgrades except for one skill that doesnt really feel like it does anything.  The Semi is a cool idea but its broken, goes way to fast and then consistently runs you over after you defeat it.  Also theres to many times where hiting a car or telephone pole head on just stops you or instantly makes you travel in reverse without falling off the bike.  All the bikes feel about the same, they just change the difficulty.  Which I don't like.  There shouldnt be a difficulty.  It should be about racing and fighting/positioning skills, getting money to get better weapons and bikes so you can win those harder races.  You cant steal weapons which was one of the best things about the original road rash games.  You just pick it up automatically after you kill the person that had it.  I WANT to have that crowbar that I stole from Jorg in the second race.  It has sentimental value.  Also the AI dont get vindictive like they would in Road Rash. The penalty for death is to high, I cant choose the level I go next, The bikes make no noise, theres NO PEDESTRIANS to run over or cross traffic. Just ... Just make it like Road Rash.  Take out the counters, weapon durability, how kicks make you completely stunned instead of forcing your to try to regain control, Fix the Physics so you actually have to race, maybe make traction loss a thing, and take out turbo except on maybe the last 3 bikes.  Also the weapon system is kinda lame. I die all the time trying to switch weapons, because to do so requires you to take your thumb off the steering.  Shootings is meh... Needs to be easier to switch weapons or shoot to the side.Oh another thing.  Study the actuall bike market right now, particularly the technology that exists, like traction control, electronic variable susspension, sproket changes, tire compound...Every bike enthusiast I know is a gear head and if you can't drool over that next upgrade theres no incentive.  I want to save up the 20k to buy that BMW S1000 HR or w/e if is with the traction and suspension control that basically handles everything about cornering except braking an leaning.  I don't like racing just for XP  points.I had high hopes for this, but as it stands, I really regret my purchase.			"

								If you are a fan of Road Rash, you will be... mildly intrigued by this game.It is indeed a violent motorcycle racing game, although campaign missions are divided into three types: a race where you need to come in 3rd or better, a timed run where you need to beat the clock to the finish line, or a catch-up to and destroy mission where you have a number of opponents to eliminate before they reach the escape point.This is a frenetic game, and that's somewhat the problem. There's too much to keep track of at any given moment. Are you looking down to check if you've got your sword equipped (gives you bonus decapitation points for a kill) or your club (better against enemies with helmets)? Oops, your enemy just got in two hits. Aiming your weapon to hit a target? Oops, you just rear-ended a slow-moving vehicle. Trying to swing your club to hit an enemy? Oops, you just went off the road. At any given moment, at least three different parts of the screen will be clamoring for your attention.There are other problems. For one thing, you may get a little health regeneration if you kill an enemy, but there's a noticeable delay in you receiving that boost. Meaning if you are near-death and were depending on that boost to get you through your next encounter, you may get clubbed to death before it's awarded to you. The progress indicator for how far along you are is next to useless. It once showed me basically neck-and-neck with an enemy at the halfway point, but I didn't finally see the enemy on the road until about the last quarter of the race. This is especially enfuriating on the catch-and-destroy missions, because enemies will usually start staggered, with the last necessary target usually having a near-half distance lead on you. If you haven't caught up by the last quarter of the race, they'll essentially have won.Enemies are one problem. They are amazing. They rarely make mistakes, the most common of which is to rear-end a slow-moving vehicle. But oncoming traffic is usually no problem for them, I've seen enemies on motorcycles smash through oncoming cars as though they were a sheet of paper. Meanwhile, I go flying if a car so much as looks at me the wrong way. Not surprising, since enemies behave like bricks; if they slam into you, they can push you in the direction they want, whereas they're impervious to your efforts to do the same. Kick an enemy off the track? I've seen them come flying back onto it as though they were Superman. Meanwhile, you'll do everything in your power to retain control and pray the game doesn't decide you've been crashed. Worst of all, they can speed up with no apparent cost, especially bad when using C4. Think you can just place it and speed away (assuming you get your nitro to fire correctly on the first try)? Think again, they'll be back behind you just before the timer ticks down, sending you flying. The ""best"" strategy I've found with C4 is to place it and drop back, but this costs you since you'll have had to slow down and thus lose ground on opponents further up the road.Crashing is also bad. The game is too long in deciding to crash you in hopeless situations and too quick to crash you in recoverable ones. I've floated over vast chasms with no hope of recovery waiting to be ragdolled as precious seconds are burned and my target gets away whereas I've been instantly ragdolled for going too far down a ridge I know I could skirt along to get back onto the road.This is also the only game where I've actively attempted to kill my allies because it's more helpful. Allies attempt to flank you protectively, but in practice, they often ram you into obstacles that you could otherwise have avoided (and you can't outpace them). They'll surround your enemies, meaning you'll have to pull your shots or hits if you want to preserve them (I've just taken to firing at whatever, and if an ally dies, thank god). I spent a good last quarter of a race just kicking them away from my bike whenever they got close.Also, money earned at the end of a race seems to have little correlation with the money the game records you earning throughout the race.There's some good stuff here with a persistent upgrade system, a frenetic pace, and a variety of weaponry to play with. But if you prefer your racing and fighting games to rely more on skill than luck, you're better off waiting for improvements.			"

								Really want to like this, as I loved Road Rash and the core gameplay here is fun. However, lack of online coop, some really ill-considered mission goal types, and overall HUGE performance issues make this unplayable. On an i7-4790K 4ghz / 32GB RAM / GTX970 system it stutters and hitches any time I come within close proximity to other riders, even with resolution set to the minimum available and all graphics options turned all the way down. Ridiculous. I tolerated this during the early prerelease period and played through it because I wanted to love this thing, but the fact that it hasn't been remedied so close to the release date seems to demonstrate the issues are unfixable and related to Unity or beyond the developer's ability to mend.

								If you're looking to satisfy a Road Rash craving, this will do the trick. If you don't know what Road Rash is, it's kind of like a racing game with beat em up elements. This game offers some rouge-like elements, the levels are a little random, and when you die, it's over, but you earn perks for your next run. The perks are very minor, Road Redemption is still a racing beat em up, not a grindy rpg.Unlike many other games in early access, I have seen this game continue to grow and update. The game lacks a few things, some new modes might be nice. More diverse AI would add a lot, they seem to all act pretty much the same way. While some randomization is great, as it adds replay value, there is just too much. Knocking a biker off feels like killing a random monster in a mmo, another will just spawn and take its place. There are no grudges, or personalities, and often riders who have nothing to do with your current race will try to attack you for no reason.Most importantly, despite its few flaws, it's a fun game. It runs well, the screen shots and videos accurately depict the graphics. I have not had the game crash, slow down, or had any noticeable bugs. I feel the game is worth it at full price, and I expect it to continue to get better.			"

Early Access Review
								I grew up playing the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Road Rash, and this game is looking very promising! The game is currently being developed and you should definitely keep that in mind if you consider purchasing. The game, so far, is not a finished game. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it in early access, it just means you should know what to expect. Right now the devs promise a 10-15 hour experience, and that is precisely what they deliver. 10-15 hours of sheer fun is to be had racing, slicing, bashing and shooting opponents with anything from pipewrenches to medieval axes, to handguns to grenade launchers. Nothing says ♥♥♥♥ you like Father Christmas bashing someone's head in with a giant candy cane. The game is not without its flaws, though. As is, the levels get rather stale after a while, there is hardly any diversity in bikes and riders, the music is not as iconic as the original Road Rash, the skill tree is very lineair, boring, and doesn't allow for experimentation, and the buyable in-campaign upgrades are 50% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t filler stuff.I'm sure a lot of that will be adressed by the devs before the game is released. I think the game is great so far, and does the original Road Rash justice. I've had a blast, and I know you will too. I'm eagerly awaiting how this game will turn out. In the mean time, just enjoy the ride!			"

Early Access Review
								At this point in time (2/18/16) the game is still in its Early Access phase, and I've tried to not review it until total completion, but I've had it in my library long enough and have played it enough times to be confident that my opinion of it will not change in any notable way for the worse. That being said, it's crazy-stupid-awesome how fun this game is. As it stands in its development, there is no story to speak of, which includes dialogue, cutscene's or character names (with the exception of a handful of extra-powered baddies). And as someone who usually finds story-telling and character-development a very important part of the games he plays, I couldn't care less. You drive down long highways on a motorcycle and kill rivals with an assortment of guns, swords, and blunt objects. Not to mention sticky packs of C4 charges. The continuous swarm of enemies that seem to be procedurally spawned (though I don't know for certain) make it unlikely you'll every run out of things to hit, or things to hit with. Though if you do, you can always kick at their wheels or grab them and steer them into oncoming traffic. But what makes the game endearing is the immensly satisfying instant gratification of the gameplay; you never hear people in the arcade playing House of the Dead complain about where all these monsters came from or who the main villain is because it doesn't make it any more fun to continuously blast zombies in the head.But what if you're no good? Like, not at ALL? It barely matters. The system of upgrades, which utilizes both ""use this til you die"" items as well as ""You're dead now? Tune up your bike and try again"" items ensures that even an embarrassingly awful defeat at the hands of a sub boss in the second level will still give you a slightly better chance next time.I've been playing this title since shortly after its release to the Steam community, and I have not once regretted the decision. The easy-to-pickup nature of the best arcade racing games, touch of self-aware humor of GTA3, and the immensely satisfying carnage of Twisted Metal 2 make Road Redemption a title you're sure to come back to over and over again. If you don't already have a game in your library for instant catharsis, Road Redemption is as good a suggestion as any.A billion stars (out of a billion and six).			"

								Got this game because I need more driving combat games in my life. I'm not dissapointed. Well, not very.The sound design leaves something to be desired. Most of the bikes sound somewhat flat, and not what you'd expect them to sound like. The music was another thing. It got so repetitive that after about 2 campaign attempts, I shut it off and turned on my own.Combat itself is nice and crunchy. Guns leave a bit to be desired, as it jerks around your entire screen whenever you aim. A dead zone where it moves just the crosshair and not the screen might be nice, but it's just an idea.The maps/tracks are pretty good, but ""hallucinogenic chemical zones"" are incredibly annoying, to the point where I often quit out of a playthrough if one shows up. It would be nice if there was an option to disable them - I didn't find one.I understand it's early access, and will probably be changing this as the game updates. Can't wait to see what's in store.Overall, pretty good game, solid 6.5 out of 10. If you like bikes and swinging blunt objects at mutant future bikers, pick this up. Just maybe on sale though.			"

								Ok, good things first, the campaign is challenging and the different events are giving you some variety, the gameplay is easy to learn and works great, the combat system is well made as well, furthermore it is nice to find a game these days that's supporting splitscreen multiplayer.Now for the parts I was slightly disappointed in, the allies that are found in some levels are often more of a hindrance than a help, next is that many people described this game as the new Road Rash, which it basically is, yet it is missing some things, that I adored about the old game, the amount of bikes is mediocre at best, 8 bikes are available while 2 each have the same stats and they are all about equally good so there is no progress to be made in that point, next is that I missed the dark humour from Road Rash as well as the caricatural pictures in the loading screens and menus, even though I can't really make the developers accountable for these expectations, I thought that I should mention this.All in all I'd give it a 9/10.

While it doesn't share all the same qualities, it's still enough to satisfy my nostalgia. It's crazy fun when you ignore the obvious learning curve. You need to definitely level up a bit to even stand a chance against the later levels in the campaign or just pure mastering of all you have at your disposal. There's also a Campaign+ Mode which gets even crazier with the difficulty and chaotic mayhem. I haven't had a chance to try the split screen yet, but from what I've seen from videos, It looks like a blast...Then there's also the elephant in the room. Yeah, I'm hoping Multiplayer Online will be added soon. Until then, at least we have offline co-op.Overall, from what I've experienced from the game. It's great. I hope it gets even better with new modes and all the kinks worked out in the future when it's finished. Keep it up, Devs!			"

Road Rash RecreatedThis game takes me back to my childhood. 6 years old 1999, playing on my Playstation inside on a rainy summer day. Playing road rash without a clue on what to do but race, always getting hit and purposly getting caught by cops just to watch the funny video clips.This games is on the same wavelength as Road Rash, fun fast races with comedy in mind. Every fancy racing across rooftops as santa with a katana? This is the game.The graphics are superb, you feel the curvature of every corner. Y'know what,  im just gonna stop this review. Why? Well basically:If you want a great racing game, if you want to murder people as Santa on a bike. Buy It NowYou will NOT be dissapointed11/10 - Would take another trip down memory lane			"

She won't stop nagging till you storm out of the house in a rage and jump on your trusty old crotch rocket.  Wait...no, that was Road Rash.The Year is 2014.  The OS is Windows 8.1.  You're bored to tears with all of the early access sandbox survival and zombie games.  Predicting the worst, you log into Steam and there it is, Road Redemption!Road Redemption is a third person, open road, high speed motorcycle riding game where brutality and destruction take their course at every turn.  In a world where everyone else poses a threat to your Sunday ride, you must use aggression, violence, and high octane pedal grinding to best the lot of them.The ultimate goal is to get to the finish line in first place, while racking up as money as possible by disabling your competitors with bats, axes, pipes, uzis, shotguns, and a number of other melee and range weapons.You start out with your choice of 5 different bikes and 7 different characters, all with their own stats and personalities.  There is a sort of circuit progression, that's strung together by an old arcade style interface.  There is also a sort of rudimentary skill tree.  If you just want to jump in and get started, the free ride mode can put you on a track with no hassle.On the downside, this game has a steep difficulty progression that becomes punishing after a few races into the campaign.  It also has controls that are difficult to master and seems optimized toward console controls, which is always a drawback for PC games.  The controls are finicky and not nearly as fluid as something like Sleeping Dogs, which perfects pretty much every last detail of the vehicle controls.On the upside, Road Redemption has fast pace arcade action that promises hours of entertainment if that's your thing.This game is no Midnight Club or Need for Speed, but I'm pretty sure that's not what Ian Fisch was going for when he created it.  Road Redemption fits into a small niche of arcade race combat games.  Within that small subgenre of racing it stacks up pretty well.  While no component of this game really stands out if removed from complimentary components, when added together they do come together into a cohesive mix that offers a good amount of entertainment.Is it simple?  Yes.  Is it crude?  Yes.  Is it indie?  Yes.  But is it fun?  My answer is, yes!  In all honesty, I wasn't really expecting to like this, especially after watching a scathing Worth A Buy critique of Ride to Hell Retribution that didn't give me much hope for the future of motorcycle games.  But in the end, it certainly offers a lot more than the original Road Rash did.  Because of that I would say to give it a chance, especially if you have a soft spot for indie arcade style games.  If you were a fan of the original Road Rash, which I definitely was, this is a must have.  Others might just be pleasantly surprised if they give it a fair try.  All said and done, I would probably give this game a score of 6.5/10.			"

								*I am going back to thumbs up on this game again. As I've recently discovered that they are planning and working towards many of the additions and improvments on many of the things I've addressed below.*It's gotta lotta potential. You can't go wrong with riding bikes and beating the living entrails out of law enforcement and other rivals on the road. There is no story to the game at all. (YET at least) No characters to identify with. The rival gangs have names but no identities. You can't pick and choose what kind of person or what kind of sex your person is. Other than skills, there is no customization options. Menus and interface are not terrible but need some work. Also don't like how you loose your skill points if you don't use them. There don't seem to be any checkpoints anywhere between races in the game... once you die its all they way back you go. VERY annoying. Visuals are decent but not top notch. HOWEVER I've noticed significant improvements recently in both graphics and performance. Gameplay and contoller support still leave a little to be desired. It's particularly difficult to aim firearms and keep control of the bike. I'd like to see them tweek that part of the mayhem a tad. But the punching, kicking, piping, batting, and shoveling (yes SHOVELING) are spot on and tons of fun.One thing the game ISN'T is boring! And that's all that really matters. So I'm looking forward to seeing how things evolve.			"

								I've only had the game for a little while, but it's pretty fun. I'm not really familiar with the Road Rash series, but upon learning about it's general concept, and seeing this game, I decided to try it out. It's a pretty fun, fast paced game, and it's pretty challenging too. For the most part, I have no complaints.However, I do have 2, and they are pretty much the only sources of dislike for this game. The first is the physics and hit-detection. For example, when careening down the highway, say you hit a car head-on. Most times, as expected, you'll go flying off your bike. However, sometimes, you'll instead be pushed by the car while still on your bike, and you won't be able to move until it knocks you off your bike. This same scenario can happen if a car or truck hits you from behind, or if you hit a random pipe or box in the road or on the side. You'll be stuck, and you can't move, unless you manage to shimmy out of the scenario. In a fast-paced game like this one, no matter how good you drive, one mistake can mean the difference between success and failure.The other has to do with damage (and enemy hit detection), which I find wildly inconsistent. For example, I can be going at it with a rival biker, and our weapons clash against each other. For some reason, I'll still take damage, even though a) the enemy doesn't, and b) the enemy weapon hit my weapon, not my body. Also, there have been plenty of times where I can be hit with a pipe and even with max health, instantly be killed, while I can be hit by c4 and only lose half of my life. It seems like no matter how much life you have, with the inconsistent damage, you can truly feel safe on the road.Regardless, even with those bugs, the game is still worth it. It's a very challenging game, but if you can overcome, you'll be handsomely rewarded. In it's current state, 7/10 for me.			"

								Right off the bat, this game is really fun, and I want to see it achieve the perfection that Road Rash had years ago. That being said, there are a few problems that prevent me from fully enjoying the game. Nothing against the devs though, it is early access afterall. So this is more of a ""Heres what I think should be fixed list"". If you are unsure if you will like the game, watch the trailer again.1. Hitting roadside objects and cars rarely knocks me off my bike. Instead I stop dead in my tracks and get stuck for several seconds like driving into a corner in Mario Kart 64.2. Some roadside objects have very bad hitboxes. In the desert level (first one in quick play), if you hit the large piles of rocks, you can stop dead in your tracks several feet away, drive up the rocks while hovering over them, and get stuck in mid-air.3. Without using the quick turn key, turning is far too slow. It almost rewards having the key constantly held down. Maybe have better handling normally and sharper turns to use the quick turn key?4. This one's completely subjective, but maybe you could have the option to have Road Rash style crashes. Then you would skid to a stop and tumble, just to get back up and walk to your bike. It always seemed like a more memorable gameplay feature to me.Anyway, I really look forward to playing this game more, and I hope that some of these issues are addressed in a future update. Honestly, I have wanted a game like this ever since RR on the Saturn, and this is a great attempt at such a game. Now if only we could get a new F-Zero game...			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly, if I could mark this review as neutral I would. This is a fun and challenging game but it's more than a bit clunky, though it doesn't irritate me enough that I would give this game a negative review. What it has to fall back on is the fact that it's early access, and for an early access game it's fairly solid, but it seems like the devs consider the game a finished product which is only missing multiplayer. In my opinion there's more refinement needed here than just adding multiplayer, especially if the price is set to go up once it's fully released.The game has two campaign modes, the standard campaign and the harder campaign+ which you unlock by completing the standard one. I enjoy the campaigns, but the way they work feels kind of flawed. Throughout both modes you accumulate XP for completing levels and killing enemies, and when you die or complete the campaign, you're presented with an upgrade tree where you can spend that XP. The reason I think this is a bit flawed is because the standard campaign is easy to beat without unlocking any of these skills, but if you want to spend your XP on unlocking new bikes to use in another playthrough or campaign+, you can't because you first have to increase your max health and unlock a bunch of other permanent buffs - by the time you get to unlocking new bikes, you'll have so many buffs that neither of the campaign modes will be even a slight challenge, and there's not much replay value in that. A couple of other issues I've found are:- The AI is strange, especially friendly AI. Friendly riders have a habit of hitting me, driving right next to me and preventing me from steering (because steering into them doesn't move them at all, and they move back towards you if you kick them away), and knocking me off course by flying into the back of me to catch up if they fall behind. They're far more annoying than they are helpful. Enemy AI is generally better, but the respawning enemies who spam explosives which are timed to go off the second you drive past them can be a bit excessive, especially on levels where it's also raining vehicles. - A few campaign+ missions (destroy the convoy or chase and kill the gang leader) are near enough impossible because the targets move so fast and escape long before you can catch up - the only way I've been able to complete these, without unlocking any permanent buffs, is by having a harpoon handy, which you won't always have.On a more positive note, it's a honest project and the devs are trying, which is good and refreshing, considering there are plenty of early access scams all over Steam. The game looks decent graphics wise and performance is stable - I don't think I've ever experienced a crash in about 14 hours of total gameplay (currently 12 and a couple in offline mode), but on the main screen there is an email address to send some details to if you do experience a crash, which is a nice touch by the devs.			"

								Road Rash was the only racing game I ever enjoyed as a kid, and this feels like an updated version of that. There are new additions to the concept but ultimately you still get to fight people on motorcycles, which is a unique experience in video games. Campaign mode feels like an arcade game in the sense that you can't save your progress, only beat the game or lose. However, you do get to purchase upgrades that help you in future playthroughs.			"

								They said ""go East"".  East is salvation, east is peace...east is your only hope.So east I went.  I managed to find a few other believers to tag along with me...we knew the open road was dangerous, but we had no idea what we were in for.Billy got it first.  Another gang crept up on us.  He didn't stand a chance.  The last thing I saw was Billy and this savage throwing kicks at each other.  I could see that the man was holding a tire iron.  Above the wind, dust, and scraping metal, I yelled to Billy to watch out...but it wasn't the tire iron that did him in.  An oncoming car took both of them out.  One second he was there, in front of me, desperately fighting to survive.  Then, he was gone...a fleshy tumbleweed leaving a puddle of blood every time he touched the ground.East wasn't salvation...east was death.  And I embraced it.  Guns, pipes, bats.  You name it, I've split a skull with it.  I don't know how much further I have to go, but I don't care.  I no longer live for a better world...I live for a perfectly executed kick to send my next mark off a suspension bridge.This is my life now.  The blood, the sweat, the smell of gasoline before it explodes.  I will have my revenge...and I will keep going.10/10			"

Ignore the member berry-eating♥♥♥♥♥♥♥complaining that the game isn't an exact duplicate of their beloved Road Rash.  The developers have introduced this game as its spiritual successor and like I said, it's fun. Kicking opponents off bridges/into oncoming traffic, using rocket packs, having a huge variety of weapons at your disposal is just great in single player - Multiplayer has the potential to be awesome.This is a game where it's possible to get good fairly quickly - I found the guns to be difficult to use initially but they're so easy now.Highly recommended.

								A really funny game to play with some friends in local coop, includes: speed, weapons, cool accidents and concentrated doses of anger ready to be used with your buddies.Mainly the game is about not crashing with everything and kick some butts with baseball bats and pipe tubes. Missions are about racing and fighting against bad dudes or eliminate some determinated number of bad guys.If you wanna play it alone, loses a big part of the fun. Still a nice game to expend some minutes here and there if you are not in mood to play some typical AAA title.In my opinion the worst thing right now is the performance at split screen, low fps at my i7 + GTX 780.*7/10          Could be a really cool multiplayer game if the developers continue with his nice job.

You soon learn to avoid slamming into things and using kicks to your advantage. The list of improvements I'd suggest> more levels (and perhaps a re-jig of current levels)> some more music (can we have more like ""Gangsters""?)> more character models wouldn't go amiss - there aren't any female character models> basic tutorial> make the bikes turn better at slow speed - surviving a crash is one thing, having to spend another half a mile to get back on the track is another.

								I purchased this game when it first entered early access. It was promising at the time but they have made some odd decisions. It fails to convey the feeling of speed necessary for a Road Rash type of feel. They also chose to focus on battle rather than racing. I've had this game a long time and I loved RR but I've put 3 and a half hours into this during that time. It's not very exciting and the enemies just keep showing up in the distance then you choose what to hit them with. The rooftop races are a good example of odd decisions. Motorcycles have no place there. You can't lean forward of back on the bikes to gain speed. There is no feedback when you go into turns or anything like you would want from a motorcycle. Progressing to new bikes isn't exciting for these reasons. If you like hitting other people on motorcycles with objects this is a pretty good game. That's pretty much what you are going to get. Whack a mole on motorcycles. The soundtrack is really bad it is one of the worst. If there was a Steam award for worst soundtrack I would have voted it instantly. I hate to write a negative review on this game. It just feels like what the customer desired and what is being delivered are completely different things. No hard feelings, but I really wanted a racing game with motorcycles more than just hitting one thing after another.			"

								I had purchased this game very close to when it first started out in EA. I have one thing to say to those that are always griping about something being in EA for ""too long"" according to their expert opinions:""♥♥♥♥♥♥off""There is a reason the release date is there. Yes, it has been three years, can you do better? Short answer is probably not. If you're looking for an arcade style game that is about FUN and less about reality, then you're looking in the right place. Yes, the game can get a bit repetitive in places, what game doesn't? Players of any card game will tell you the same thing. Players of any sports game will tell you the same thing. Players of almost ANY game will tell you the SAME. DAMN. THING. Stop bandying it as your reason for a thumbs down. Get creative.Moving along, there are many reasons I would like to see the devs finish this game and give all of the nay sayers that swift foot to the mouth of their own accord syndrome. From the outset, the game is fun, the controls can be a bit squirrely to get used to but, it's not out of your hands to improve. This game can have you brake at times. I know, I know, difficult to believe that you can decelerate to actually improve control and ultimately stay running with your opponents. Who would have thought it's not as simple as step on the gas for the whole of the ""race""? As for the cars raining from the sky? BRILLIANT! I see no reason as to why this game (or so many others) have to adhere to the ""it looks like something from the real world, so it has to apply to its rules or die"" mentality.Keep up the good work, devs. Some of us appreciate your hard work, rather than using it as a stepping point for a paltry attempt at attention. Others, they already know what they can do.			"

								Ok, i really wanted to love this game, being an old Road Rash player, but this game is NOTHING  like it. The controls are lousy the game engine is slow and over 2 years later its still EARLY ACCESS. Like most EA games i feel ripped off. This game will never be completd and never play like Road Rash - You have been warned !			"

								One of my favorite games growing up was Road Rash 64. Since then, I've longed for something similar to play. Needless to say, I was excited when I found out about Road Redemption.The main campaign has 12 levels. The object of each level varies. Some will be a normal race, others will be about eliminating others by knocking them off of their bikes. There's also different environments for these levels. Some take place in a desert, others in the snow and some on top of rooftops. There's an upgrade system in the game as well. As you beat levels in the campaign, you gain XP. You can use the XP to get upgrades which will make things easier for you. You'll likely obtain all of the upgrades in a short period of time, but it's still nice to have. One thing I don't like about it this game is the rubber banding. It seems to be a bit much, sometimes to the point of feeling unfair. Hopefully they fix that or at least improve it.Thus far, I've put in 20+ hours, beaten the game multiple times and unlocked every achievement. This is one of those games you can play for hours while watching a marathon of your favorite TV show. If you're a fan of Road Rash, I'd recommend checking this out.			"

								Well, lemme judge this game.PROS :-Good concept ( I hope it can be better )-Balanced-NostalgicCONS :-Buggy. Sometimes I cant use accelerate, and ALWAYS can't do nitro.-Bad sound FX and need better graphic.-If u new in this kind of game, u will feel bored with only 1 gameplay system (plus multiplayer).WHAT DEV NEED TO DO :-Debug. Too much bug for this 10$ dollars game-Do better graphic-Add HQ sound FXI played in early access game and feel dissapointed because much bugs and this game didnt like i expected. I bought this game because I need a game that can remind me to my childhood. But I see bright future in this game. Hope the developers can fulfil our 'lust of nostalgic'.PS:1.I reccomend for those who wants to play nostalgic game. But not newbie.2.Sorry for my bad english			"

Early Access Review
								I kickstarted this game a long time ago. I played very early versions and I'm happy to see the progress it's made since then. It's been an interesting example of how different a game can turn out from your expectations. What the game is becoming is starting to grow on me! I enjoy it, but I do wish some things were done differently.The over-the-top aspects, in my opinion, distract from the solid core gameplay. I could do without rooftop missions, jumpjets, crazy traffic modes, etc. If it focused purely on the combat and racing, it would be a better game. I do wish the over-the-top aspects were more game mutators rather than integral aspects of the gameplay, because they aren't as fun. It's almost like if you imagine N64 Goldeneye where you had to play one-shot mode, golden gun mode, big head mode, turbo mode, paintball mode, invisible mode etc. just to get through the campaign: It would ruin the campaign for so many people. That's what this feels like to me, game features that distract from the core gameplay but aren't optional.And I would very much like to see more of an actual campaign, rather than simply a collection of racing presets. I was really hoping for more of a feel like Road Rage, where you would need to buy new bikes and graduate through different circuits of progressively-harder enemies and tracks. These two elements are disappointments for me since the Kickstarter, but I'm trying hard to appreciate the game for what it is, not what I thought it would be. I've decided to recommend the game because I do enjoy play it as it is. The racing and combat feel very polished and the graphics and sound are adequate. And the shortcomings compared to my expectations that I listed above are, to me, the difference between playing an enjoyable game for 10/20 hours and an amazing game that I never want to stop playing. It's fun, and it feels polished. But it doesn't feel like a very focused game. It feels like Mario Kart if you could only play the Special Circuit and nothing else. But it is what it is, and it's worth the price for a fun but ultimately forgettable game.			"

								Like Road Rash 64, but bigger, better, and more surreal. Racing motorcycles, equipment, xp, hitting people with pipes, blowing up trucks with c4, etc. etc. The controls are still a little wobbly for keyboard, guns are kinda hard to aim on the steam controller, but it's got local multiplayer that brings the 1990s back. The single player is enjoyable too, but multiplayer is where the most value is.It's early access and the devs are committed to the game, easy to contact (as in, their phone number is in the game and they will actually pick up and talk to you), and the core gameplay is great.

								Spiritual Sucesser to Road Rash?  Heck yes!!  It stands up too.  I love raceing where you can utterly distry your competition.  Road Rash and Demolition derby were the greatest things, since then not much,  Then browsing steam I come across Road Redemption.  I hesitated for a bit then I got it awhile back and have no been dissapointed.It goes on a great trip across the Naion.  Isee alot of proceedualy generated games amd this one I really can't tell. its amazingly smooth.  Every trip across the United States is unique.  To add to that we get a ton of weapons to use and a bunch of great scenerios to go through.  Racing across crazy spots like city buildings.  Which gets really insane, but made amazingly as it isn't layed out (ever) in a fasion that makes it not fun. I forsure reccomend it.			"

								Most of Early Access is garbage. Either the designs are poor, the funding is clearly lacking and it will never be completed, or they're simply not fun to pay. There's usually a reason a developer can't find a publisher.Not so with Road Redemption. I'm stunned this hasn't been picked up by a publisher already. The visuals are solid, the gameplay is hilarious and bombastic, the weapons and tracks are diverse, interesting and feel excellent to use. Most of all, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing VIDEO GAME. It's such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game you don't even know - it's just a freaking blast to play, a huge amount of fun. The upcoming multiplayer component is extremely promising as well. The only thing lacking might be the music, which is somewhat generic, as well as some variability in the missions. However, the devs seem to have their heads screwed on right and this promises to be a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game.Give them your money, now.			"

Early Access Review
								Road Redemption, huh? Well, I finally got the chance to try it. So, let me tell you what I think about it.The game is absolutely amazing. It reminds me of my childhood, when I used to play the old Road Rash games.A couple of friends came over and we decided to try this game and we had a blast. The game is so fun to play, it captured what made the old ones great and applied to a new generation.I'm aware that this game is still in Early Access, but I must say that what truly bothered me it's that is poorly optimised. I have a decent PC and the game struggled to get to 30 FPS (Which I think I could only reach it once), most of the times, it was running between 24 and 15 FPS. So, that was a little annoying at times.Some tracks would need something that makes them unique. Most of them, look pretty much the same and feel like the same race. Furthermore, the campaign would need variation as well, but I admit that the fact that you get penalised when you lose a race makes it more interesting and difficult, so it's pretty cool.The graphics are OK, I think. But, with games as fun as this one, you don't pay attention, as long as it's enjoyable.The sounds are regular and would need some improvement. When you play splitscreen with friends, only one of the engines can be heard, for example.The soundtrack was regular as well. The songs are too random and different from each other.I really hope the developers keep adding stuff and support it, because this game is absolutely amazing. I'm really looking forward to what will come in the next updates.Considering everything, this game is a 7/10 for GAMEPLAY ONLY, because it's fun as hell to play. If you want nostalgia running through your veins and have a couple of spare bucks, buy this game and support the developers. They're showing great enthusiasm while working with this game.			"

								Generally okay, plays a lot like Road Rash. Couple of nits though. First, the rubberbanding is really strong, to the point where AI riders will blast up and by you at seemingly-supersonic speeds just to continue a battle the game thinks you should be having. Second, the firearms feel clumsy as hell (to use them you have to rotate the camera away from where you're going), but the AI is able to fire a full 360 degrees with no issues -- this feels kind of unfair, considering there are missions where all hostile riders are equipped with firearms. Still, minor issues, and single races are still enjoyable enough.			"

								Remember when games were about fun, not your K:D ratio or your item level? These guys do.Tase a cop into oncoming traffic,  then hit the guy beside him with a hammer so hard he flies off his bike, superman-style, head-first into a rock face. Use jump jets in a fun rooftop battle. Strap C4 to rival riders and get clear. This game is awesome.			"

								First review I am writing. Dev, you should be flattered XD; really enjoyable game that really sticks to its Road Rash roots. Really glad I purchased it. I really hope it gets out of early access soon. A few notes: 1) Lags a bit on the menus on MacBook Air 2014 (yes I game on a mac, F*** You);2) Handling is someething that takes getting used to;3) Still need to get into the campaign, which ended once I died,so that's a bit annoying.All in All, great game. Multiplayer should be cray. 9.5/10			"

								Road Redemption is memorable to me because it was the first game that was given to me by a developer to review, presumably because they had mistaken me for somebody important. I decided to go back and play it again recently because I remembered it being pretty fun, and then saw that I forgot to ever actually write anything about it, which is probably why the only other developer who ever gave me a game to review was the one who made that Hat Man game that I gave a bad review for. But on to Road Redemption. Road Redemption is a fun little game with equal emphasis on racing and combat, in which you try to survive your way through a trail of races and eliminations. You gain both cash and XP as you progress, but if you die then it's game over, and you restart from the beginning with only your XP upgrades carried over. The combat is pretty fun and fleshed out; you can grab other racers and steer them into oncoming traffic, kick them off bridges, shoot them, or just get in with a battle axe or a lead pipe and bash and counter your way to victory. Road Redemption is a game where ""1st place"" can either mean ""stay ahead of the other racers"" or ""be the only racer left"", and I appreciate that since I'm not much of a racer but I am much of a person who likes to hit other people with shovels. I first played the game over a year ago and it's still getting regular updates, adding lots of small features and changes that weren't in when I first played, but it is also still missing online multiplayer, which makes the $20 price tag a bit steep. It's apparently only going up in price after it leaves Early Access, though, and the current singleplayer content is still pretty fun, so if you're interested in the concept you may want to just take the gamble and buy it on sale now for the multiplayer later.

								I'm a little mixed on this. I recommend it because it's still in early access and has some work to do, but the game as a final product in it's current state feels absolutely generic. If within a year it hasn't progressed, I'll gave to give this a pass.The game is a ton of fun. It's Road Rash, motorcycle racing game mixed with a beat-em-up game. They changed some things up to make it a little more interesting. There's a skill tree. You can die, which requires you to start all the way over. You can shoot people and change out weapons during a race. There's also crazy drug races where cars are just flying all over the place.The biggest complaint I have is that the actually racing and feel to the bikes are way off. There's little regard to real physics not gravity in the game. The races use a rubber band method to attach each other side-by-side so you easy bust face with bat. And while that's fine, Road Rash was always a blast because you're have to maintain your speed to side-by-side. It never just locked you into that place to attack.My overall recommendation is to wait this one out until it's final, unless you see a cheap deal.			"

								I keep telling myself I won't invest in any more Early Access titles, yet here I am. I remember trading my SNES for my friend's Genesis a lot of weekends in Jr. High, and the Road Rash series was one of the biggest reasons. This game takes the timeless concept of armed crazies on motorcycles racing on public roads for fame and fortune to another level. Probably the biggest upgrade, online multiplayer, isn't implemented yet, but what is here now is already as fun as the original games. What's already been added to the original schematic is local multiplayer, rooftop levels, ""hallucinatory"" levels with cars falling from the sky and crashing into each other at every turn, awesome avatars with flaming jack-o-lantern heads, and a permanent experience based upgrade path on top of the cash upgrades that dissapear after each game ends.  I definitely don't regret this purchase.			"

								This game sucks! Hold on, WAIT! In a good way... Please allow me to explain oh great master race... You, are a biker. Back in your day there was talk of a competition on the long and winding roads of America. Your grandfather who was one of the few who had done it years back when the roads were digitalized and coded for what seemed to be a Nintendo game. It was BRUTAL back in his day. Seeing him now you know he had taken a few pipes to the face, chain scars on his legs and a still healing ribcage from all the kicks he had to indure.But now its your turn. Your turn make him proud. He was knocked off, and lost all he got in that ROAD RASH of old. Now its your turn to get redemption, ROAD REDEMPTION!(Crowd Cheers)(TL:DR)No, but this IS a fun game. I had a N64 and played Roadrash a lot. Feels like that! I am waiting for the multiplayer and release to really tell people about this game only because to me it is unfinished, but still has all the hard hitting and s*** tun of blunt force trauma with different weapons. Guns also were thrown in for a bit of OP fun. Don't buy it if you are unsure though, just watch a video or two online before your final verdict.Thanks for reading! Now go the hell away!			"

								It’s very satisfying to systematically murder every other racer. There is a special kind of rush when your enemies stay down. Road Redemption remembers everything road rash did right and brings it back with smoother gameplay. However it seems to be stuck in perpetual open beta like so many others. Unlike many of the others however, it feels for the most part a complete game and is often receiving small updates.			"

								That game is great! I found out about this game a couple days ago, when I was looking up ""Road Rash"" on Steam, so I decided to try it out and I was really satisfied. The controls are good and it's so satisfying to beat the opponents off of their bikes. The game provides the feeling of speed/vertigo you would expect from a game like that as well as other feelings, like ""fiero"" and the joy of brutally overcoming adversity. On the other hand, I think the soundtrack needs some improvement and I wish PS4 controller support was already implemented. I would recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good vehicular combat game or any Road Rash enthusiast. Big thumbs up![EDIT:] The PS4 controller is supported if you're using Steam Link, but the game sees it as a Xbox controller.			"

								At the start it's kind of agravating sure. But as things go on things get easier, as one may expect. Though, enemy health gets kind of rediculaus. Doesn't mean you can't handle them, either by blocking of ♥♥♥♥ing kicking them into a car or off a cliff. Really fun to do.But for me, the real prize comes at the end of the early access. The last level as it stands at the time of this review, is mother ♥♥♥♥ing rainbow road. Complete with happy music and floating in the middle of a void. 10/10 would race to my death again.			"

								If you loved the 90's game Road Rash which came out on the Sega Megadrive then you will find this game quite enjoyable. It is no where near the acheivement that Road Rash was but with this being early access I am hoping it can get closer to it. Currently it is not worth the price tag. There is no where near enough content to keep you going longer than a few hours. The races are short which can be irritating if you fall off near the as you will not have enough time to catch up, they are quite often extremely hectic and it is primarily luck that ensures you get through it. There can be bombs exploding, cars flying everywhere, cars swerving all over the road and occasionally cars that fall from the sky in the aptly titled halucineagenic zone.  There are two lots of upgrades, temporary ones which last for as long as you are alive and are bought with cash won from races and ones you buy once dead with the XP you have earned whilst alive. This is quite fun but again not a patch on Road Rash. I would like to see shops in which to purchase new bikes and parts to upgrade the one you have and new outfits to buy and things like armour. The races need to be longer as you are just getting into them when they come to an end, an end which allows you to carry on riding until the gane loads. I would like to see something of a story too, not anything dramatic like Grandma needs a new hip but doesn't have insurance so I race to pay for it kinda crap but just yes we race it's what we do. In Road Rash there was characters I didn't want to fight with as they always said nice things to me and there were jerks you didn't mind repeatedly bashing. Something like that is always fun. And dear god please lose the Mariocart level, currently the last level, riding on a rainbow in space? Come on, you lost me there.In summary this is a fun game and a good way to waste some spare minutes but so far the content is lacking and the races are too short. But otherwise an enjoyable experience, unfotunately not worth the current price tag.			"

								Okay so this game is kind of re-birth of Road Rash series which is made on unity, the game itself plays good and even betr than classic, but for now it lacks moar content (mostly cuz its one-run kind of game, so its okay).The devs are trying to make the game as good as possible, and i've deleted my prev. negative review claiming that achivs are broken and devs ignore this... now i know they don't so this game will be 100%able soon, for now - just ~56%.Graphics: Everything looks good, stuff explodes, and graphics don't eat too much resources. (10/10)Gameplay: It's fun even if you play it few more times, you can use either firearms or cold weapons, both are useful. You have a choice of bikes and stuff. (10/10)Setting: Gangs, bikes and stuff in different parts of USA, gud nuff. (9/10)Controls: everything is fine as well, but deflection doesn't work for now. (7/10)Story: <Do you need any here?>Replayability: Kinda high cuz its the main thing about this game, you get skills that carry over to next playthroughs so it can be easier. I immediately played this game again and then Campaign +, was kinda disapointed not getting an achievement tho :c (to be fixed) (10/10)Overall rating: 9.2/10 (S)The game is worth buying, but beware of that its not so long one, you might want to go for all achivs (once they are fixed), otherwise you will overpay cuz of low time spent.

								Road Redemption is a spiritual successor of the Road Rash Series. I have played only one Road Rash game before, which was on my Playstation. When I played Road Redemption for the first time, I really got that feeling that this is really a worthy follow up after the series, with modern graphics, physics, etc.In this early access version, you're gonna be playing the campaign mode which lasts 12 levels, not unlike a rogue like setup. You go from level to level with various objectives, got some temporary upgrades in between which will be gone when you die, and then get to buy some permanent upgrades like health, damage, etc. With my poor skills, it took me 4 hours to finally finish this early access portion.As for what you do in the game itself, there are race-type levels, take down, weird platforming level with a just-cause-y grappling hook, and a few other variations (like racing with cars raining from the sky). I have to say they really nail that feel when you hit enemies in the face. It's just so damn satisfying ! Kicking your enemy to make him crash a truck is even more fun, although a bit more difficult. There are also a few types of guns which makes your job of killing people very, very easy compared to hitting people directly in which you can take some damage. Maybe it'll be better if they nerf it a little. Nothing game breaking though.My two cents is that even though this is a very early access, I get the feeling that the final product is going to be epic. The developers are great and they patch the game almost everyday, sometimes twice a day, and are also active in the forum. I fully recommend this game for those of you who likes hitting people in the face (who doesn't ?).			"

								Racing down the road on a crotch rocket, and bashing opponents skulls in with an assortment of melee weapons is what is in store for you with this game.   Also, why not pull out a variety of guns and blast them off their ride as well.  This is a great racing/fighing game that can provide you with that particular road rash we are most familiar with.  Runs great with new content and fixes added all of the time.   Recommended, if you like the premise of this game then you will not be disappointed.			"

								Mostly fun, with controller in hand ready to go this game plays well out of the box. We all know what game this reminds us older players of. Here we are in a different time to do it all again, better and brutal online. Im really looking forward to the coming year of updates to gauge the level invested by this Louisiana company.Features I find lacking or just bugs.- Poor leaning on the bike- No cat walks or stoppies- Double health skill carries to ng+ but starting level 3 & $1500 does not- Starting a race is always set up at paces from other bikes and based on distance, its possible to not start a race until you want there is no time limit just a bar telling you when you finish- Maybe add street races where you all have a starting line and the option to have a delay to use weapons- Buying from the store the double dmg for the next race is bs garbage, its a gamble. make it a xp skill- There is no proper way to quit after you finish a race and spend exp if youre not dead. - No proper brake, just forward and reverse. never puts leg down.- The check points between levels to buy stuff show have more random one type of item(e.g cb radio, +mass/kg but can hear chatter maybe learn a thing, chains as weapons, screwdrivers, mail boxes, a whip, road beers,♥♥♥♥♥♥jugs, etc)- More chatter between all motorists, gestures too. - Mission to get 4of 4 stars you have to drive slow before reaching the end. its a problem of too short of a distance. - Cash into exp store item should display the ratio of $:exp.- Disarming a rider does nothing but killing a guy nets you a weapon...kick a guy off a roof top much.- Hands not attached to the handle bars- The magnum hand gun is large compare to our players hand, compare it to the harpoon gun in size.- Why is it with a handgun equipped that three different buttons are used to fire a gun?- More race modes: Defeating mob bosses on bikes with gang in tow, Tsunami run where you stay ahead of the death hunting you down, Hallucinegenic Zone you have an ability to slow time(e.g Max Payne 3 online) allowing the rider to  duck and weave. - Intersections, over passes, on ramps off ramps. get those alt routes- Not enough variations, the style going is very spaced out 0_0- Steamworks or GTFOOverall 7, because there is only 7 levels and it plays very well. Its not even half way across to what appears the end. At this time the game is .827 in Early Access. I like the randomness and hope to see a roguelike story making choices. Im sure to spend many hours playing once multiplayer rolls upjuly 4 2015 - Alot has changed ng+ is tough and need to set yourself up to be able to compete so you dont die. basically if you barely beat a level and used all your boost you wont beat the next lvl. the new build look is nice, but it really shows how detailed it looks like a arcade cabinet game. There is still no multiplayer or bikes. Alot of fleshed out snags, power up attacks and more.			"

								If you enjoyed the Road Rash series or just guns and bikes in gereral, then you'll love this game!  Played for several hours at start and was hooked on the upgrade system.  Enemies were fun to grab and kick off cliffs.  Couldn't be happier playing as santa swinging around a cane.  I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite games on steam!!!			"

								Awesome game ! A lot of fun, not much frustration for an early access game.I lacks polish, it lacks some rythm sometimes, like when you get back on the road, when you get off track without falling... Sure, a lot of content is missing I think, and I hope devs wil do some work on content, sounds, and a little bit of gameplay to allow more drivability.And remove guns, AI with gun is overpowered, and if you don't play with a mouse, precise weapons are unusable, unless for AI.

								Road Redemption is an action packed game full of winding roads, oncoming traffic, ramps, and angry bikers with a plethora of weapons. The game's mechanics work nicely and very intuitively. The scenery and graphics are well done. The unlockable skills adds replay value. There is also something for those who enjoy achievements or collecting cards.			"

								Such a good nostalgic feeling along with some new amp'd up craziness. Campaign + adds some difficulty with insane explosions all the time, cars spawning from the sky and bursting into pieces on impact, crazed jet jumping across skyscrapers, and an endless amount of police cars and motorcyclists and rival gang members to bash you to hell along the way. Some glitches but it doesn't matter sometimes the game is more fun that way. With that said I would wait for this game to go on sale. It is definitely a lot of fun in both single player and multiplayer.

								I've put a fair amount of time into this game over the last three years. It was touted in their kickstarter as a spiritual successor to Road Rash. It is not. Road Rash was a great racing game with a good combat mechanic. This is a mediocre fighting game with an absurd ""racing"" mechanic. Racing being a loose term meaning an event involving moving vehicles that may be a race, or a deathmatch, or a ""see how angry you can make the cops"" game. Which may include the added ""fun"" of cars raining from the sky constantly. It's gone through a number of itterations, and the racing portion has been improved (IE: They made the raining cars bs a rare thing) but ultimately, the devs just don't seem to know what direction they were aiming for here. Either that or they were aiming for pure chaos.			"

								If you played and enjoyed Road Rash on the N64, you're gonna love this one.Shoot/grab/ram/whack enemies and avoid traffic. Pretty darn fun. The ragdoll physics makes for some hilarious accidents. There's still a lot I need to learn about the game regarding equipment purchases and what not but I'm enjoying the game. The maps are huge. One game I accidently trailed off the road and ended up just riding the mountains. I wasn't glitched out of the map or anything, I was just ridin all around. Kinda like an open world, just with me being so far away there weren't any other enemies/cars, etc.And while I've had fun with the gameplay, the music is great as well. Really feels like you're playing a ""classic"". The sounds and music give it a nice arcade feel. If you're bored with the games you have and just want to have goofy fun, I highly recommend this.			"

								So First off I really love roadrash, the idea of a more battle focused roadrash is awesome, but I feel the game developer is taking this game in the wrong direction. For example, 3 levels in your bike gets unlimited jet booster pack that propels your bike way high in the air, most of the maps take place on rooftops and are poorly designed and involve jump after jump and its just awful. maps where the entire road is laced with c4 bombs that are all timed to go off quite randomly or maps where cars are always falling from the sky, its neat and all but its in there way too much,out of the maps selection theres only about 2 that are any fun and you dont get to select the maps theyre all generated by the computer. The ones that are fun are super fun, I do love this game alot but honestly i find myself quitting campaigns over and over due to having to race on rooftops all the damn time. I'd like to see it stick to the road rash roots more, and less goofy crap, this game has the feel at time of a modern day road warrior at times and has potential to be amazingly fun.I know this game is early access and there will be alot of improvements i just hope they pour their resources into making more decent maps and less wacky over the top game killer but they seem dedicated to their stupid bike jet packI'd like this game alot better without the bike jet packs, without the rooftop platform jump levels, without the explosive road levels, without the cars falling from the sky levels, without the cartoonish rainbow level.

								Each time they patch this game, it feels like it's going in a solid direction. But small minor things just bug me about this title. It doesn't feel like it's a free race, a challenge of rider VS rider. It's more like a streets of rage, you move forward to the next contestant, beat them up, move on beat up the next rider, and repeat this throughout most challenges. I'm not sure what is the magnet effect they've added, but it's rather boring to see. What I mean is, I'm 15th place, I catch up to 14th place. Now rider #14 is locked in line with me, no matter what I do, he'll always be locked side by side, unless I use Nitro to pass him, or knock him off his bike. It'll be the same with rider #13, 12, and so on. They've add some mini boss riders now, which is alright, but they are everywhere. They don't become unique if almost every rider is the same. Also, they have the dreaded rider in red. I need to look into the best way to take them off. But no matter what you do with melee attacking them, they will counter every single blow. Even if they are already mid attack with another NPC. This is cheap game design in my opinion.Progression is left to be desired. You race, you gain cash, you buy boring upgrades, you die, game over. Spend some experienced points you got based on how well you did. Use it on a talent tree system, and restart. Start from race #1 and progress as far as you can get.I backed this title from Kickstarter, because I wanted a promised Road Rash feel game. This is far from it, It's something to enjoy, but it's not what I first thought it would be. I'm curious to see what the finished project is. But out of 10, I'd rate this a 6.			"

								It's hard to write about a game in Early Access, but I'll give it a shot:Let me first start out by saying that I would highly recommend this game for those who love racing, but with a bit of violence. These games might incluede: Twisted Metal, Road Rash, Burnout series, and possibly Flatout.At it's core, the racing mechanics are there, but the aren't heavily influenced by anything other than get from point A to point B. It's more about the journey, not about the destination, and boy is this journey a hell of a lot of fun.Each mach has different demands: race, destroy, or sometimes you'll find just surviving is a demand in itself. There's just enough nuance in the game to really warrant a purchase. I actually just got off the phone with the developer (he seems like a really nice guy, and his phone number is actually in the game), and he's stated that they have a lot planned. Hopefully the racing portion become more of its own beast, but time will tell.I mentioned the journey, getting from point A to point B, and that's where the game shines with all sorts of carnage, explosions, and parrying. There's nothing quite as satisfying as the combat in this game. At it's core it's more a combat racer than it is one or the other, but it does have a heavier emphasis on combat. It's a blast, and co-op will be riot.That all being said, the game is difficult, like, extremely so; however, it's never to the point of irritation, but more to the point of, ""Let's play again.""TL;DRThe game's a blast, and is a fun combat racing game, though there is definitely more emphasis on the combat.

								I'm only near 2 hours into the game and I'm already hooked on it! The blue knight dude is my best man of choice. It's a lot of fun whacking the police in the face, getting the rival gang to smash into a car's rear end. Not many weapon choices or bikes as of yet. Would be even more fun if you get to choose a car to drive in. Or make a playlist of your own. This game reminds me of GTA but with just motorcycles.			"

								This game is absolutely maddening fun, hop on the couch with some friends and some brewskis and you'll be screaming like Mario kart all over again. If you liked Road Rash, you'll absolutely LOVE this. I will admit that due to it being in early access (or at least it seems) there's some issues with lag spikes, which is admittedly aggravating, but in no way makes it unplayable.			"

								♥♥♥♥in' Rainbow Road! Hahahahaha! Oh man, I was on Skype with my buddy and I just lost it when I hit Rainbow Road. Anyway, great game, totally enough bikes, weapons and characters for a Early Access game. I hope they do plan on expanding the skill tree by a lot and somehow adding in a online multiplayer and not just LAN multiplayer. This game would be a riot with friends, though I can understand, with the fast-paced style of the game, why anything but LAN might be a bad idea, it could still be implemented with a disclaimer.			"

								As is this is a wonderfully fun game. Very much like road rash. I gave put about 6 hours into it and have finished the standard playthrough with the option to due new game+. I have completed my skill tree and I believe I've seen every weapon there is, so far.Pros:Great Road Rash like game with replayability.Good artwork. (not that you can tell because of speed and stuff going on)Diverse weapon selectionDecent rider selection with different abilitiesIn-betweens:A lot going on in a race. Might have to block while turning while dodging that car, oh watch out for that semi behind you that slams into you.Rooftop levels.... Cons:The physics sometimes don't do what you would expect. Like a head-on with a car might get you stuck against the hood rolling backwards instead of throwing you to the pavement.Currently the cars' drivers have a standin model that is just a crash test dummyThe grappling gun sometimes would attach to something behind or to the side rather than the target I'm aiming at.Overall:Great game, fun and fast. You will probably end up stopping in the middle because of something stupid that happens, but you will come back.There is multiplayer but I haven't had a chance to play it yet.$20 might be a little high for the 6 or so hours you will put in, I'd recommend getting it during a sale.11/10 "

								This game is quite amazing(Road Rash nostalgia) but it feels more like brawl than a race.

The devs should optimize the game further not because I am a low-budget gamer but for online.Edit: After the update, game feels balanced but still needs more optimization.			"

The only thing I didn't really like was the levels where a biker keeps dropping mines to what seems to be a bit too much...once you get hit with one or crash behind the guy you're nearly trapped lol. Perhaps a reduction in how frequently they drop or explosion size. Other than that, I love it. Excited for multiplayer.			"

								As a little kid, the Road Rash games made we want to travel...and maybe bash people with chains a bit, but I loved the sense of freedom and power. Road Redemption does a million things better than those games from two decades ago, but also has yet to unlock that sense of agency and independence.What has me writing my review today is that the project has been receiving a lot of attention from its developer over the past several weeks with a constant stream of updates that add content and improve gameplay. The developer is clearly putting a lot of heart into making this a classic, and I want to add my voice in getting it the attention it deserves.The Good:Bonkers races that just don't appear in other racing gamesModern graphicsAttacks include kicks, grabs, firearms, timebombs, and a slew of melee weapons from makeshift to medievalRPG character unlocks & between-race buff shopBathooksGamepad supportThe Bad:Almost no control over races or progressionYou pick your bike at the start of a game and you ride it until you dieAutos' behavior is almost always erratic and sometimes inexplicable (driving off bridges, into cliffs, etc.)Crazy races, an array of weapons, gamepad support and constantly improving gameplay make this a title I keep coming back to play rather than just wait for it to all be finished.

								Think about any medieval fighting game, then put yourself into a motorbike. That's what Road Redemption is. No plot, no getting serious, just pure violenece on the road focused on shoving people off the road. Get uprades, permanent skills, various weapons and face rivals which quite quickly get too easy... Anyway it's fun to get rid of your opponets instead of trying to outrace them.My recommendation: Get it, although don't expect some serious story.			"

								As of the date I write this comment, I do like this game. I have however noticed a strange momentum bug where if you go over ramps sometimes you suddenly stop or drastically slowdown and if the devs are reading our posts please fix this when you get the time. Other than that it's a great game and a nice reminder of Road Rash 64.The road bombs in campaign+ are a tad harsh for my liking and they're somewhat unpredictable so do think they should tone it down a bit. It seems being hit by them is more about bad luck than lack of skill. They put a burden on the CPU as well, with all the other physics going on, especially on the tornado levels.I am looking forward to more updates, more tracks, music, challenges, motorcycles (with different motor sound FX) and possibly more upgrades. I would also like to see a hardcore mode added where your 2x health upgrade is disabled and enemies do more damage. 2 hits and you're dead unless you manage to scrounge more health off the enemies you kill. For example.I recommend this to any Road Rash fan or anyone else who saw the trailer and wants to try this.			"

								I loved the old Road Rash; is this that same game? No, but it certainly scratches the same itch.Art / Graphics - The art style doesn't have the same whimsy as the original Road Rash, but it does the job. While it would be nice to see Character portraits, some customizability for a character (ie, pick colors, bike aesthetics, etc) it's not a deal breaker.Sound - The soundtrack is limited; It’d be great to get more variety in there, but it doesn’t distract, and provides a nice background ebb and flow. The SFX are straightforward and make appropriate sounds for appropriate attacks.Controls - The controls took a little getting used to, and I’m not sure that I have the full hang of them yet. It’s a little counter intuitive that left attack = X but right attack = Y instead of B. There’s a brief learning curve, but after a few minutes I found myself accepting some of their slight quirks without any real issue (I have not tried the game KBM yet).Gameplay - Gameplay feels a little shallow at this moment. The campaign mode has basically two mission types (“race for first place” or “race to take out targets”). Again, this isn’t a deal breaker, and even though there is persistent mechanics, it doesn’t give me any kind of satisfaction. It could be that you unlock more the further you get, but early game at least, if feels very much like an uphill slog. It also doesn’t seem to have any “Save Points” for the Campaign mode, so if you “die”, you die and have to start over.Stability - I didn’t not have any issues while playing. Game ran smoothly at a consistent 60 fps and was free from any kind of significant glitching / bugs (there were a few times where I clipped through the terrain, but it was minor and generally when I was off roading and about to die).Overall - I would recommend this game; It includes local co-op, it’s satisfying in bite sized chunks (I played for about three hours today before I decided to walk away). In it’s current state, I’d say it’s about a 7.5-8/10. It’s better than average, and since it’s currently in early release I wouldn’t be surprised if the UI and story was fleshed out a bit before release.			"

								THIS GAME ROCKS ! ! ! This is the true successor to Road Rash in every way. If Rockstar games could have fit this into the GTA series, it would have been doable. HOWEVER, the rogue-like quality of the game taps into the pick up and play appeal of this game. No convoluted story-line. No time consuming cut scenes. Just balls-to-the-wall rashin'. With, I may add, some great innovations over the Road Rash series. Firstly, the booster jets that allow the player to basically jump in a racing game; YET another reason why jumping in a video gam6o1 much more depth. Add to that the experience tree, array of weapons for play types, multiple attack options, and varied mission objectives. The game is wonderful and runs great on my crappy laptop to boot.How well does this game translate to modern times from its 16/32 bit roots?  I just played this game with my 10 - 13 year old cousins and they had a blast. Watching the near miss crashes, walloping enemies, and finally getting wasted when the health meter drops, brought me back to my childhood days of Road Rash on genesis and psx.This game is well worth the price.  AND, you get shovel knight! WTF????!?!!?! yes, shovel knight.			"

								Road Redemption is a good little motorbike racing game; nothing amazing, but a nice bit of fun.It is highly reminiscent of the game Road Rash, from the 1990s.You speed along America's highways, fighting off rival bikies and the occasional cop, bashing and slashing with iron pipes and swords; as well as which you sometimes also get pistols, rifles, and C4 explosives, all to cause a bit of mayhem.Sometimes you race, whilst at other times your objective is to eliminate your enemies.The background music is not a bad collection of musak; nothing to write home about, but not annoying like it can be in some other games (that's according to personal taste, of course).The only complaint I have about the game is a pedantic grammar problem, as the game's makers have left out some apostrophes. Developers, please make the appropriate changes.- Should be ""an enemy's helmet"", not ""an enemys helmet"".


Nooooo!!!!! Not ENEMYS, it should be ENEMY'S. Please use an apostrophe.

- Should be ""you're racing"", not ""your racing"".


Nooooo!!!!!  Not YOUR; it should be YOU'RE. Please use an apostrophe.

- Usually, it should be ""Phill's mountain"", but if it is a place name (""Phills Mountain"") then the standard practice seems to be to drop the apostrophe (not that I'm happy with that, but that's how it is); so, this one could be alright to keep in.


Apparently, this is the place for Phill.

Overall, it's an enjoyable game, especially if you have fond memories of playing Road Rash.Definitely a thumbs-up for this one!			"

								I've played it yesterday. The graphics are quite nice and the speed gives a good feeling to ride a bike. The controls are very good in this game. But it needs far more details, like plants, grasses,  trees and so on. I loved the Road Rash Series for the Genesis in the 90th, there you have some animals on the streets or nearby like cows or deers, maybe that would be nice in this game. Or some oil leaks, a damaged road, some more details maybe. But this game is very good in Early Access, can't wait for the final release, very good work!			"

Early Access Review
								So this is early access and in alpha.  It's pretty much Road Rash taken to 11.  You get guns, a samurai sword, c4, all kinds of weapons, a nitro boost, a jetpack maneuver, a really responsive drift, oceans of traffic, and various objectives.  It is also very much like a rogue-like.  You earn experience and cash by beating up other racers and completing objectives.  You start with one life and you buy yourself upgrades and/or lives with cash to continue beating random, escalating scenarios. You spend experience on permanent upgrades after you run out of lives and those upgrades will carry over to a fresh cycle (pun not intended).Graphics are very good, but lacking an artistic direction to really set it over the top to make it something unique and special.  The music covers many different genres, and it is basically all very good and upbeat.Also, there is ragdoll.I don't recommend buying at the price they're offering.  I would recommend it at five bucks.  It's one of the better arcade experiences I've played and it's only in alpha.			"

								Do you like bike racing games and violence? Then this is the perfect game for you! Sure there was a game just like this before but this is supposed to be a remake. To bring this amazing game concept back to life, but BETTER!I love how the races are randomly chosen by the game and how the game mechanics work. I can only give you a little warning. This game is a bit intensive specs wise so make sure you got a decent machine to play it. Game barely runs on mine since I got to yet upgrade it but that is not enough to not recomend it to anybody else.I also want to thank the devs of this game for personally adding me on Steam and letting me try the game for my honest opinion about it. They are really doing a great job so far.			"

								I played a lot of Road Rash 1, 2, and 3 on my Sega Genesis way back in the day.  When I saw that this team was trying to revive the spirit of Road Rash, I was very interested.  After seeing all the additional effort that has gone into the game recently, I figured I'd pick up a copy while it was on the Summer sale...Overall, it's not entirely Road Rash, and I think gameplay-wise, it has a way to go if it's trying to be the next Road Rash.  The graphics a decent and the concept is there and who doesn't love hitting someone upside the head with a pipe while riding a motorcycle?  I think the campaign is fun, but it gets a bit repetitive, especially when you have to start over.  I could definitely live without the guns, they're a pain to use and apparently the AI has infinite ammo and never misses, making it all that much more frustrating.Overall, fun game and worth the $11 for a little Road Rash throwback fun!

								This game is very fun, I feel an addiction coming on. The controls are very easy to get use to, the sounds and graphics are good and you can even play in a larger resolution (thank god). Only thing I wish I could fix at the moment is turning down specific in game sounds. I have never played Road Rash, so I can't really compare the two, but I can say that this game is worth it and it's only in early access. The developer is very nice and seems dedicated to this game. I can't wait to see this game develope further, epecially online co-op!			"

Early Access Review
								Review reposted from http://wskosc.blogspot.co.uk (Whiskey Reviews)Road Rash was a classic motorcycle combat game from the heated 16-bit era that sadly fizzled out with a mediocre Playstation game and slipped from the public eye to snuff it while huffing gasoline fumes in a gutter. But like any much loved series it eventually comes back around, Electronic Art's 'leaked' pre-alpha footage rekindled interest in the series but again ultimately died before coming to fruition.Thankfully we have a savior; Road Redemption is here to clobber your senses with a bit of pipe at a hundred miles an hour and it doesn't miss the mark.Being the spiritual successor to Road Rash is simultaneously a big thing to live up to and ridiculously simple. You need a road, turns are optional. You need bikes and riders and you need something for them to smack each other around the chops with. But you also have a small but starved community to satisfy and a legacy that roared out of the gate with the very first entry.Even in this early access build I can confirm that Road Redemption has roads, bikes, riders and various objects intended to meet the face of anyone in arms reach. The developers have also taken a bold step forward by mixing up the formula with two forms of progression through the campaign (whether these progression options will carry to other modes of play remains to be seen); there's an RPG-like skill tree that you spend XP on to unlock more health, faster bikes, more shop options, etc.There's also a shop between races where you use cash accumulated in the race to buy various buffs or modifiers that last until you die. Thanks to the randomly selected race types and objectives through the campaign each play is unique despite the strong urge to gravitate towards certain shop items such as extra lives and more health/XP.I'm not sure how much of the graphics and sounds are complete or placeholder at the moment so it's hard to comment with any accuracy on their final level of quality. The graphics aren't bad though, they're nicely detailed and the speed of the game helps to smooth over any rough edges though some more detail and effects would help to spice up the somewhat dull feeling crashes between bikes and cars right now.These issues could perhaps be helped with more dust and particle effects, or more detailed damage models on the cars - not asking for soft-body physics or anything here but when you hit a car head on and get catapulted over the bonnet while it just stops dead on the road without any visible damage it completely pulls you out of the experience and reminds you that this is an early access game.Sound effects are quite basic but not bad in quality either, you won't be reaching for the mute button but aren't going to be calling Rolling Stone to nominate the soundtrack for an award. Weapons making contact have various thunks and slashes that are satisfying enough especially when your opponent and bike separate from the impact.The addition of guns to the formula is another contentious point; with keyboard and mouse controls the guns are incredibly powerful thanks to the ability to aim and fire with the mouse but suffer when using a pad due to the split focus inherent with using the right analogue stick to look around.The guns also sound and feel a bit flat, often kills on cars or other bikers are announced with some floating numbers and a message on the side of the screen and so they can feel both useful and dull at the same time. Again this is a problem that may be solved as development progresses and could easily be countered by introducing reloads, some kind of lock on mechanic for pad users and a few better effects such as dropping the weapon when it's empty, or discarding empty magazines to clatter along the road upon reloading.Fingers crossed.Despite the slight hiccup in controls when aiming guns both the keyboard and gamepad controls are responsive and usable though the keyboard commands cannot be rebound at the moment (though that feature is apparently coming) which may cause some issues for players who can't get their head or fingers around the default controls.The gamepad on the other hand feels like the best way to play the game in terms of driving and attacking, the Xbox 360 pad was responsive and accurate with a comfortable control layout that mimics the standard style driving controls for most other games so Road Redemption is mostly pick up and play for any gamer with even passing experience with the driving genre.Race objectives vary from simple races to defeating a number of opponents with or without weapons with a bunch of variants between - antagonizing the cops, taking out opponents without using weapons, time trials and so forth. Through the 10+ mission campaign these objectives often repeat but the three different course types (desert, snow and rooftops) offer some variety which is augmented by various patterns of traffic, additional racers in cars and humvees instead of bikes and a stormcloud that rains various vehicles down on the track.Also included are two attachments that are supplied to you at certain points throughout the campaign; the first is a jetpack attached to the bike allowing you to perform a spectacular rocket assisted jump whenever you like which can get you out of a jam in even the direst of circumstances.The second attachment is a kind of harpoon gun that keeps a rope attached between your rider and whatever object you spear. This can be used to hook onto cars, riders, terrain or even more spectacularly helicopters for a Spiderman like swing through the air that you'd be hard pressed not to augment with the jet pack. This weapon also comes with about twelve-thousand rounds so you can fire it off to your heart's content.Sadly the usefulness of this weapon is limited due to the aforementioned aiming/driving issues with a gamepad.Overall Road Redemption is a satisfying and worthy Road Rash successor and has enough ideas of its own to not be a cheap cash in or clone. If the developers can apply the polish and get a larger variety of environments and perhaps even bikes or customization options implemented the game's appeal could skyrocket to include even those who don't fondly remember the mid-'90s highway punch-up.Another issue the developers will have to address is longevity - multiplayer features (also coming in a later build) will go a long way so long as the community embraces the game but an expanded single player campaign and progression tree would really go the extra mile instead of feeling like a moderately lengthy detour.Some other small touches such as rider and cop names, I took down Terry Pratchett at one point, and a spectacular final level in the campaign to reward persistent players lend the game a lot of incidental charm too.Score: 7 out of 10 bikers pretend carpet burn is road rash.

Early Access Review
								Just started playing this, but heres my opening thoughts.The menus are a bit bare bones, it looks a bit 'cheaply' made, not exactly super awesome textures on the menus and what not so far.The controls are nice, but using a controller (as I do for most racing games) its a bit hard to control the camera, the gas, and the shooting all at once. If you drop any of those out of it its doable, but its definitely hard to drive and fire guns at the same time.Now for the good things, or should I say Great things. When not using a gun the controls work wonderfully. Its easy enough to hit your targets, and the dodging in and out of cars is very fun. You don't feel like you're fighting the controls or anything, they're super tight for driving.It brings back extremely fond memories of Road Rash, and the dynamic missions were very fun. Every time I'd die, it would feel like a new experience. I didn't have any chains of missions that were similar.The Variety in challenges was actually very nice. I thought I had a normal race, and immediately hit nitro to get into an early lead. Imagine my surprise when CARS STARTED RAINING FROM THE SKY. My shock and inability to dodge cars that suddenly appeared before me made that run end very quickly.All in All, the game is super interesting. I'll definitely put more time into it, and I cannot wait to try out the multiplayer. For now I recommend picking it up if you liked Road Rash, we'll see how it turns out as it progresses out of Early Access and even more features are added.			"

								This game is pretty sweet. I know it's early access, but some improvements I could mention.Triple monitor support. Not really support it Just support the native desktop resolution currently in use. Zombie Driver does this as well as a few other indie games.Graphics needs improvement as well as the controls, overall feel of the game is a little glitchy.Can't do wheelies that I know of or lean forward or backwards.These are just nitpicks, really. but it would be nice to support my 5760x1080 resolution.Overall this game is really fun, jump in & just start racing & kicking♥♥♥♥♥..lol			"

								Okay, this is a very interesting game for me and for anybody that played RoadRash in the 90's...This game tries to reactivate the feeling of those fast paced and violent motocycle races. And it achieves this goal at some points. And does not at others.Pros: It is fun to play. It reminds you of RoadRash immediately. Kicking and punching, Weapons,... while riding endless highways with your motocycle is exactly what i would expect from it :) great.Cons: Still early access so this section might change. But there are some points i want to see improved: Mouse and keyboard does not work fine. You swing your weapon with a left click for left and a right click for right - and you move the camera with the mouse. so you will end up hitting but not seeing where you're driving and respectively.Also there could be some improvements with the collision modell or track limitations: sometimes you can run off the track quite well, other times you fall immediately.Conclusion: If you loved RoadRash you will find a bit of the feeling in this game... If there is some polish, this could end up being a great, fun game.			"

								ok.. i initially thought that this game was multiplayer. I didnt thoroughly look at all the little tags in the description. Anyway, It would have been absolutely epic if this was multiplayer. It would have boosted my opinion of this game a lot.. But either way, It is a great game. Very fun. Addicting. And i hope that it can only get better. Since its early access, my hope is that they will add ALOT of permenant upgrades to your character. And I hope they add A LOT more weapons. what I mean by a lot is.. at least 20-30 more chacter boosts, and 20-30 more weapons. The bikes are cool too, they could even add some more customization to bikes as well. maybe add some spikes that come out the tires.. or some kind of juggernaught vehicle only available if you do certain tasks or complete certain things. :P anyway, thanks for the awesome game.. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to blow off some steam and break something. :D :D :) :D			"

								I've been looking for a good Combat Racer and I think I've found the one I want. This game is wondeful, the combat feels great! (It feels like I've really just smacked that guy in the face with a sledgehammer and sent him flying off his bike!) The only thing is, I wish I could duck. There have been times where two cyclists are at either end of me and try to hit me at the same time. It'd be halarious to see them smack each other. The Motorcycles feel good, the sounds are okay. Need a tibbit of work, expecially the guns. They're not bad, though. The visuals are all pretty nice, too! There's an assortment of races and mission types generated each time you play, and few diffrent tracks. I also must say, the soundtrack is wonderful. I'd love to be able to pick it up!Also, if the developers come across this review..I've only run into one bug. On the Rooftop race..I fell off and I was spawned on the very edge of the roof, so I kept falling off. Though, pausing and clicking ""Place me back on the track"" fixed that.			"

								Good game if you are on a modern PC 10 year old toasters wont like it much (dual core amds intels idk but I'd bet it be rough even with intel dualcores The recs on CPU is a lie need more what it says From experience go with 4 core or better) I started on a 10 year old toaster(amd dualcore) after it finally died my new rig pwns it and I can pwn the bad guys on max setting @1080p This is a great game it's closest you'll ever get to road rash without a console emulator or ps1 or saturn. If you have been hesitate on getting this game cause of early access don't be it's good as is could it get better oh yeah it's still being updated so that is a good sign.  I doubt you will find a $20 game here yet grab it while it's on sale $10 or less you got a game worth the money @ current state of the game.			"

Worth the money?Yes, I think so!Production and gameplay are well executed. What you get for ~20 bucks is a fair trade.Is it a modern update or successor to original Road Rash ?I played GameGear and later PC Road Rash but cannot say that this is Road Rash.Like other people say: Bikes and weapons is where the equalition ends.It reminds me of ""Outlander""(NES, Mad Max) on bikes but without the ""off vehicle"" beat'em up stages.Ian Fisch wants to know whether I'm having fun...I tell you Ian my fun is limited because:- GamePad(Xbox) controll sux and cannot be changed. Driving & Aiming a gun via analogstick is a nightmare! Especially caused by the whole view is moved with the gun aim. Moving just the aim would probably work better without a fast input like a mouse.- GamePad controll sux even more because you weirdly managed to put 3 main actions to the right side of the pad while the left hand only steers. Please explain what your idea was to hold accelerate, aim with stick and release shot via RB with the same right hand while left hand only steers on analogstick but cannot shot on LB? -I didn't knew that a bike has an larger turn angle than my real life SUV but ... okay we keep on falling down bridges and roofs after crashing into one of your damn magnitic halu zone cars, np dude, rly.-Did I say halu zone magnetic cars ? Did you receive ""Worst feature in a game"" SteamAward for that ? No ? Maybe next year!Well I hope these points get fixed somewhere in the future. Apart from that I'm happy with my 20 bucks motobike beat'em up, thank you Mr. Fisch ;)			"

Early Access Review
								I first bought this game early in its release and wrote it off as a bad game. It felt more like a cheap flash game. However...  After reading about the ""HUGE UPDATE"" in the news section I came back to give it another try, and all I can say is - WOW, what a difference a year makes. It's almost an entirely different gameplay experience. The bikes control like they should, combat is fun, and there's a nice feeling of speed. Graphics and interface have been much improved as well. Most importantly, I was actually having FUN. Overall, I'm happy with the progress this game has made in the past year, and I'm actually looking forward to the release now. If the devs keep going I feel like this game will have loads of potential and a bright future. Defintiely looking forward to playing more of this game when I have more time tomorrow.			"

								So, it was somewhere around 2014 or 2015, and apparently, one of the devs of this game literally gave me a code to try it out. I don't know why me of all people, but I took the offer (think I might have had it on my wishlist or something.) Initially, seeing a man named Jerma985 play this game lead me to believe this game was a meme, ya know. But to be fair, it has pretty nice features all around. I'd recommend getting it.			"

								Just to leave a quick review of the game from my perspective until the last time I played.The game, even in at Early Access stage, already has plenty of content and fun, leaving me a good feeling of it having a very promising future if it keeps to be worked on.Some of those features, and good sides of this game, are:- With several modes that include: race against the clock, beat specific targets, etc.- Several weapons: bats, pipes, katanas, C4, shotguns, etc.- Maps that go vary from the desert to racing jumping through buildings roofs.- Turbos and jets to give some boosts on jumps.- Split-screen local coop! It's rare nowadays for many games to have this but a great thing when you want to play with family/friends on your side.On the cons side I would mention:- Ranged weapon handling is very hard using controllers at least.- Online mode will be a must for this game to have good success with most of the community (although playing locally is already very fun).- The difficulty degree of oponnents as you go through missions, increases drastically (or they simply become really sturdy) so some more tweaks to make it less steep would be good.- With online mode approaching, and probably a more competitive side to the game, more types of weapons like oil or spikes, would be a very good addition.Overall, the game is already fun and a very good approach to a genre that for years has been lacking (haven't seen one of this since Road Rash) but it still has lots of space to grow, improve and ultimately, I hope, surpass it's predecessors.

								Type of Game:Action Motorcycle RacingVersion Played:PC version through SteamSimilar Games:Road Rash and to a lesser degree Destruction DerbyThe Good:Fast and furious violent action using an assortment of weapons.Weapons include melee weapons (swords, axes, bats and so forth) and firearms (shotguns, pistols, machine guns and my personal favorite the grenade launcher).Levels will keep you on your toes with lots of different way to knock you off your bike such as cars, rival bikers and logs dropping of trucks and that’s just on the road.Shop in-between levels to boost ammo, health, nitro, durability of melee weapons, and much more. Be warned that these upgrades disappear after you lose all your health on the road.There is persistent experience generation (from killing rival bikers and destroying cars) that allows you to get points to spend upgrading your bike, max health, upgrading your starting weapons, and so forth. These bonuses always stay with you no matter how many times you restart a level.Split screen campaign (soon to be online). Works very well with shared bonuses from the shop and also a competitive mode is in the works too.At the time of writing there has been 6 updates to knock out bugs, increase performance and add new content and the game hasn’t been out a month yet, so yes dear reader this is a dev team that listens to its community and keeps an eye out for bugs.The Bad:There are no key-bindings just yet (there is a placeholder in the options) so just a head’s up if you don’t have a game-pad. You will struggle without one.Aiming your cross-hair to use firearms is very difficult and there isn’t a button to reset your camera. What ends up happening is after you try aiming and want to have your camera dead center you need to do it manually and fast before you go head first into a car. I have faith in the dev team that this is going to be sorted out sooner rather than later.The hit detection seems a bit off from the rival bikers as there able to hit you when they’re in mid air and you’re on the ground, although it seems to happen more on “the rooftop” levels then in the other levels.Nitpicking:Yes Road Redemption has bugs, a fair few to put mildly, but only just a few weeks old on Steam and they’ve already released several patches to address the big ones.Did I make time to complete it?Yes. 5 times so far in 11 hours.Redlight or Greenlight:This game is currently at a greenlight.Thanks to the dev team for handing out plenty of patches in a short amount of time (big company’s take note). I was a kickstarter backer paying $20, but it was money well spent and I’d gladly spend double if not more for this great title. I’m really, really glad its this team (Dark Seas Games) that has made RR and by the time this has released in its final form it’ll be an instant classic and definitely my game of the year. Can you tell I’m biased towards Road Rash style games?Reviewer:BeefyA Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buyhttp://www.gamersglance.com "

Early Access Review
								As of v0.816:Road Redemption is a kickstarted spiritual successor for 90-s Road Rash series.And, well, it's pretty damn good at re-making the gameplay and overall feel of the Road Rash series.Bikes, tons of weapons, fighting on the road, kicking opponents into the abyss - all of this is there.But Road Redemption is a very silly game (in a good way). Not even once it considers itself serious.Expect tornados throwing cars all around the level, bomb that appear out of nowhere to blow you and your opponents up as well as crazy rides on the rooftops (with your regular traffic around as well, yep).Most of the things in game are randomly generated. While this means you can literally play it endlessly and get a new experience every time, this also brings in some issues.For example, sometimes roads are generated in a very strange way so that you cannot really see what's coming next.The fog from explosions seems to be just a texture (or maybe it's just the particles are not transparent at all?) and you cannot really see what's behind it.Some of those random things makes you feel cheated when you lose because of them.They are definitely fixable, though. And every patch makes them a bit better.In general it's a very pleasantly and crazy experience for those of you who want to scratch that Road Rash itch, as well as just for people looking to have some motorcycle combat fun.More detailed look in the video:

								This game is in early access, so you already know what that means: it's not complete and it's a little rough in some spots. That said, I unexpectedly played this game for about 4 hours straight because I was having a lot of fun. Here's a section of gameplay with cars raining from the sky:


YouTube™ Video: Road Redemption Gameplay: Car Rain 

			Views: 202		

			In Road Redemption, sometimes cars fall from the sky. I'm not even sure if it is a bug. If it is: it is so hilarious that I kind of hope it makes it in to the final game in some fashion.		

Some of you may be too young to have ever played Road Rash, but this game is on track to being better than one of the classics from my childhood. Players get a bike and have various objectives while racing around deserts, icy mountains and even city skylines. Much like Road Rash, the player is armed and able to kick and attack other bikers with weapons. Unlike Road Rash, however, Road Redemption has a huge arsenal of melee weapons and guns to lay waste to others on the road. Pasting C4 on bikers and blasting a cop car with a gernade launcher is exteremly fun.So far, only some single player content is in, but multiplayer is on the way. Road Redemption has a few different mission types that vary from ""get the attention of the police"" to ""kill all these guys without weapons"" and they mix up the gameplay quite a bit. Presently: when a mission is completed, you're on to the next level. Completing these challenges and killing enemy bikers and cars gives you cash for buying upgrades for the next level. When you die, it's over, and you lose all your cash and upgrades. However, there's also a skill system, where you use experience points earned from killing bikers and cops to buy upgrades for things like health, better starting weapons and more nitro boosts. It's a little rough at the moment (the tree itself could use some visual tweaks), but the idea is awesome for a game of this style.So far, the only negatives I can even think of are some bugs and preformance issues. The game chugs a bit (probably due to physics stuff since changing quality and antialiasing doesn't change it much), but it's still surprisingly playable during this. There's a few infinite loading bugs that I can't seem to reproduce, and once I got stuck in the skyline when I fell inbetween some buildings, but otherwise nothing that some polish won't fix.			"

								Road Rash was one of the first game that i played in my life So when i saw Road Redemption.. i felt something ""the inner child"" in me wanted some of this so bought it .. and IS IT WORTH IT? HELL YEAHPros1- Rooftops Racing is awesome! and the Jetpacks are amazing idea to keep the game funny, it can get a little buggy, but a wild experience on the rooftops 2- RainBow road .. which i think i don't have to say it again .. RAIN BOW !3- 12 action-packed levels so far.. and believe me it doesn't get reptitive .. for me i think.. it always amazing to repeat the game 4- the Skill tree (Both Pro/Con)5-SPLITSCREEEN!! it's awesome with bros or friends .. 6- Awesome Variety of guns Cons1- Skill Tree Can make the game super easy with 600 Health you can complete the game in under 25 minutes and never buy something to refill your health2- music is kinda cheesy.. wish they add MP3 player in it3- Aiming is easy .. like i can shoot with a shotgun with 500meter apart or something and boom headshot and he diesit's fun like i said,, but will be abused in mutliplayerMy Thoughts?

								This game is rough around the edges. If you're careful about it you can even fly through entire races using your grappling hook like some sort of Hell's Angel/Spiderman hybrid. Its riddled with bugs and the mechanics behind races means its nearly impossible to catch up to rival racers in several modes. Despite the unpolished bits the combat has an incredibly satisfying sense of crunch. Since everyone is flying along at hundreds of miles per hour any hit that connects sends enemies flying like you just hit a home run. Hopefully as development goes on we'll see the rest of gameplay get tightened up a bit, right now it probably isn't worth a buy, but there is definitely enough here to have a real gem of a game in the future.

								It's like Dark Souls on motorcycles.Actually, being a huge fan of Road Rash back in the day, this game scratches that bike combat itch really nicely. It's still not nearly perfect but it's still amazing in it's current state. That bone crunching sound and puff cloud of blood followed by your enemy getting flung off their bike is what you live for in this game and it's oh so satisfying.The splitscreen multiplayer is also super hecticly fun and hilarious.Definitely a huge recommendation from me.EDIT: The game has had some updates here and there really adding nothing to the game besides fixing some minor bugs that I never ran into. I haven't seen an update in over a month. And calm the ♥♥♥♥ down people, the Dark Souls thing was an obvious joke.Cons-The UI still looks terrible and the handling can still be weird at times. -AI has been updated to be more agressive, but all that has done is make the AI gang up on you or fly past you and hit you perfectly with a weapon without even stopping. It's honestly made the AI a lot more annoying and not more difficult and they ""can"" stick to you like glue no matter if you're going over a jump or slapping that nitro, in the air, they will literally lose all air momentum and stick to you in the air, hit you and then take off in mid air. They can be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at times.The game isn't bad, I still have a lot of fun with it, but the devs really need to step up their game.			"

								I was wary when I first saw this game being touted as ""The spiritual successor to Road Rash."" I loved Road Rash so much. But after playing this for 10 minutes, I found myself grinning like a lunatic and bouncing up and down with nostalgic delight! What I was hoping for was a remake of my old favourite that would take advantage of the new technology without getting lost in it. The classic old gameplay in a shiny new shell. What I got was exactly that. It really has the feel of Road Rash down beautifully and, as I had hoped, there are some cool new twists which I'll let you discover for yourselves. If you're looking for a HD Version of a 64Bit Classic done right, this is how it's done.			"

								Hey, you!  Buy this game!  It's every bit as fun as it looks.  The bikes are satisfying to ride.  The physics are more arcadey than realistic, meaning they're fun and forgiving.  Even with a mouse & keyboard it controls fine.  The weapons are hilarious, from knocking a rider's block off with a long shovel to slapping a C4 time bomb on his back.  When that fails, you can grab a rider and steer him into traffic, or just kick him right off a bridge.There are different mission types, and while there is permadeath, your upgraded skills carry over into subsequent playthroughs.  Also, the soundtrack is fantastic.  The developer has been very active, releasing updates as often as every day since I picked this up during the last summer sale.The downsides I've noticed include the interface, which is kind of ugly and poorly structured.  The rooftop levels aren't as solid as the open road levels, but they're getting there.  If multiplayer is of paramount importance, you'd better wait.  For everyone else, this game is already plenty of fun in its current state.  To put it differently, I don't see buying this now as a gamble, unlike other Early Access games.			"

Early Access Review
								Players Beware, This isn't a typical road rash clone. The level progression can be a little like Road Rash Jailbreak if any one still remembers that. You get so far into the game, and once you get a game over, You have to start all the way back to square one. This game is a little more lenient because you can gain XP to level up your skill tree. One Notch on the tree is to start from level 3 instead of level 1. A solid Check point system would be way better than having to buy them by failing Countless amounts of times. The AI can be really aggressive in some areas and really hard to complete the objective. Once you run out of super Melees, It's almost impossible to Knock the AI's Off their bikes In the Eliminate X amount of Opponents. In Road rash and other games, if you countered at the right time you got to take their weapons from them and stun them for a second making the progression doable. In Road Redemption you just dodge, and hope a gang of 10 other Bikers and Cops Don't Knock you out instantly sending you all the way back to either level one or the last purchased check point. The item system, though Unique makes the game interesting. There is a choice of Guns or melee weapons, like shovels, axes, bats ect. The bad thing is aiming while steering the bike. The environments can be so chaotic it makes the guns hard to use. So i don't. The weapons have health, so when they are depleted, you can't fight back or counter once you exhaust your last weapon. The weapons also Auto cycle when you knock out another biker. So if you like a particular weapon be prepared to get the next thing that comes your way. I like the health system concept this game has going for it and the screen affects when you have low health. You can Gain a little bit of health by knocking out other AI's. The bad, is in the Game mode where you have to take out X number of opponents. They tend to Clump together and gang up on you. Even The AI's that don't have cursors over their heads, and some of the other Cars.       The controls need more polishing, Needs a better turning radius. There is no way to make sharp turns, you have slowing down. There are some areas where you have to slow way down, or you will crash into a mountain or drive over it and fly out into the rest of the unpopulated map.       This game reminds me very much of Road rash. I loved that game. This Game has made a lot of good updates since it had released. Being able to do wheelys over objects and cars would be nice instead of face planting into them. Also whats up with car's and other vehicles being competition? I thought this was a bike only game.  It's fun, but a little confusing, hard and Chaotic at times. Still hadnt beaten it, but i do have a logn way to go with the way the game is. Keep up the good work developers, I hope my review helped.			"

								Road Redemption is one of the most fun games ever with buddies and controllers, unless your buddies are babies, then one of them might cry and call it Road Resentment when you beat them all bad over and over again.Anyways, singleplayer is super fun when you need a change of gaming pace, and want some pure adrenaline violence like an hour or two before bed, without needing to save or continue anything.Totally legit spiritual successor to Road Rash, just outstandingly fun and clearly a personal passion for the devs.			"

								Once upon a time I was given a Sega Genesis and the game road rash. I played that game day and night as a kid. Somehow nothing quite like it has ever been made again.... until now. I saw this on sale in steam and was immediately hopeful that it would be like the Road Rash I once knew and loved. However, this game is even better. If you liked Road Rash you will love Road Redemption.			"

Early Access Review
								- Early Access Review -This game is a love-letter to the Road Rash series. Even in its current state, if you have any fond nostalgia for those games, you owe it to your inner-child to pick this title up.Currently, the game is limited to a campaign mode of progressive areas and difficulty. There is racing against the timer, racing against a specific rival gang, night driving, icy tracks, cars raining down from the sky, police chases, exploding vehicles, rooftop racing... and I enjoyed every satisfying slash and crash that forcibly de-seated my fellow racers as I burned past them. Every time you die, all of your XP earned through that play-through can be spent on permanent player upgrades, adding to your health, damage, weapon durability, ammuntion, etc... so on each successive run, you'll have even more of an edge on your side.The game plays fast and feels fast with little stuttering (running on an i3 processor with a GTX 640 Nvidia card), though there are instances of SUDDENLY-CARS, because the draw distance seems a little close to your bike. The way the bikes handle feels instinctive (using an x360 controller), and the button layout is workable... though not perfect. The ability to remap the keys isn't currently implemented, but it is one of the features on the list to be added. Based on the level of polish the game already has, this is definitely not a project with sloppy devs... I would highly believe that patches, new game modes, and features are en route.For downsides, though... with only one current play-mode, the game will grow repetitive after a while. The AI routines of the opponent riders is somewhat predictable, and once you learn the timing of the weapon swings, they frequently fall for a basic swerve-n-strike pattern. There are plenty of weapons to experiment with, including the grappling hook which is a blast to use, but its still an issue of slowly becoming familiar and then boring. There is no automatic lock-on for any firing weapon... that takes a while to get used to, as your ability to aim is also your camera control... perfect for the shotgun, but very tricky for the uzi. The roads themselves are far more lethal than the other riders, and while this is an excellent thing, currently specific conditions like the raining cars can make those races VERY difficult, and can completely shut down a run.Its an awesome thing to see, mind you... driving through a downpour of debris, but that feature needs to be scaled back enough to be able to actually navigate through the falling wrecks.Multiplayer is a listed feature of the game. That would seriously increase this game's replayability factor, and it would be AWESOME to be able to race against other players with this engine, but currently that feature isn't available.All that said, I still HIGHLY recommend this game in its current state. Its very playable, low on the glitches, a TON of fun, and I have full confidence that upcoming features and fixes will just make this even more enjoyable of an experience.			"

								The update is really brilliant and takes it up to a whole new level than before, though it is really annoying to have to restart the campaign when ever I come off. I wish it could just be so if you died you have to restart as apposed when ever you come off because, if your like me, and barely have 2 hours solid to finish the game, it becomes incredibly irritating.

Early Access Review
								I hope this review gets the devlopers attention while it is early access and has time to be fixed. I seriously want to love this game, but there are a lot of design flaws beyond bug fixes that simply do not make the game enjoyable.    A great example of this is the skill tree, which should be scrapped entirely for a new unlock system that changes your starting weapons and unlocks new motorcycles. Increasing your health, xp gains, and cast earned isn't healthy game play fun - its grindy and does not feel rewarding to the player.    Instead, picture that you only start the game off with a single character and bike, no weapons, and have to earn your way up the ranks. As you spend your xp after each match you unlock new characters (that start with a single weapon) or bikes with real differences. You shouldnt start each game with 3 weapons immediately, already on stage 3, and nearly irrelevant bike choices just because you played through a few times. I know it's early access - but this is the kind of thing that is getting old quickly.    The game also completely lacks personality from the other racers, and to make it worse it is littered with a bunch of randomly spawned NPC's to up the action. Instead keep my 10 or so competitors and make them challenging, make them try to grab me and block my shots, or boost when I try to shoot at them. Give them names and pictures, dialouge, they need personality.    Lastly, since right now your current objectives are all random - it makes for some frustrating game play. I don't mind the tornado, explosions in the middle of the road constantly levels, or roof top timed challenge modes existing.... if there was a choice to it. If i could choose to want to play that or not it would really help. I want a core gameply driven experience when I hit campaign, and I want a challenge type scenario placed elsewhere. My campaign should be an experience of improvement and difficulty to be the best racer out there, not dodging randomly generated falling cars.    The game is still fun, but I am not recommending it until I see some real direction put into the game instead of a bunch of randomly placed together content and skill trees.			"

								Hurr hurr more like road trash.Seriously though.  Can't help but feel totally misled about what this was going to be.  ""Modern road rash"" sounded pretty great.  Initially thought the current design of the game was just all placeholder early access stuff.  Uh, it doesn't seem to be?  Essentially there isn't much here - there is about as much gameplay depth and design to this as, I dunno, a wacky trainer for grand theft auto, and it has the look and physics feel of someone's first project in unity.  I can't see myself ever loading this again, and $20 for a few hours is pretty damn steep.			"

								This gameright now is full of bugs and glitches. The A.I. is terrible but has gotten *slightly* better.While I used to LIKE, not love, Road Rash back in the day, this game is the hardest piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I've come across due to the A.I. always catching up to me, matching my speed and then meleeing the ♥♥♥♥ out of me until we all:1. fall off a cliff2. fall off a building3. get hit by other vehicles4. get hit by hallucinatory raining cars5. glitch through each other and ragdoll out6. block all my attacks and break all my weapons then hit me with shovels7. random unavoidable explosionIt's ok, needs A LOT of work until it will be considered done. The soundtrack is pretty terrible in my opinion. It's the same few songs that sound so bland and generic that I just mute it and listen to something else. And both control schemes are very wonky, keyboard and controller.Overall, I'd say wait until it has a full release, read some reviews after that, and then maybe try to find a way to play it, maybe from a friend that has it or something, then if you like it, buy it. I am currently regretting this purchase.			"

								There are too many problems for me to recommend. I never feel good when I actually win a race. When it rains, I get at max 25 fps, no matter what the graphics are set to. I wish you could purchase new weapons and bikes. I feel like they have a good thing going with the passive skills, but I'd rather just soup up my bike... I'll keep playing and adjust this review as it comes closer to the finished product.Edit.I got this game on sale, and was really excited as I'm a huge fan of Road Rash. This game is kind of similar, but the randomized maps, added nitro, and lack of bike customization make it difficult for me to compare the two. With that being said, I don't think it needs to be Road Rash. I think it's a pretty solid game. The graphics are great, it's getting smoother and smoother with every new update, and the local co-op is an absolute blast. I still haven't gotten through the campaign+ mode but I feel like this game has great replayability. I seriously can't wait for the multiplayer and I'll hopefully update this when it comes out.			"

Early Access Review
								Original review 16/42:Not now.This has potential, yes. Currently, it's not worth your money.Currently, there are loads of lockups which make the game practically unplayable, even on the lowest settings (This is coming from a guy who can max out Arma 3 and Battlefield 4, so no ""it's your computer"" comments please).I accepted this, thinking that maybe for whatever reason my i7 4770k processor wasn't powerful enough to procedurally generate the landscape quickly enough to drive on.I was wrong - This game boasts on the store page: ""Lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in this procedurally-generated driving combat adventure.""Uh, no. One of the reasons I was interested in this is because of the procedural generation. There is NO procedural generation in this at all. After dying four times and being forced to restart the game (This isn't as annoying as it sounds, fortunately), I realised I was racing on the EXACT same stretch of road each time.Give it a while until this is in a playable state, I'll update this when a major patch comes in.UPDATE 12/10/2014: The devs have spoken to me twice about their progress and patches with the game, which I always appreciate. The latest patches seem to have introduced prcedural generation of landscapes, which is definitely a good thing.The FPS lag remains for me, though it's definitely improved and apparently being addressed currently.At the moment, the game still isn't exactly ""playable"" for me, though if you're willing to take the risk on serious performance issues, I would definitely go ahead and suggest it.UPDATE 18/05/2015 - With the game nearing what should be full release (It was meant to be Q1 2015, doesn't look like that's happened), I figured I should update this again.The dynamic content still isn't great, the first level always looks pretty much the same, the only difference seems to be day/night.As for FPS drops, the game in itself is much smoother but I still get lockups every time I kill an enemy.You can also take damage for a while after passing the finish line.Currently this is a ""Meh"" rather than a ""Yes"" or a ""No"", but I personally have some regrets still.UPDATE 15/06/2015: I'm changing this review to a positive one. I've spoken a number of times with the Road Redemption team who are obviously dedicated to making a good game and want to take the time to perfect it (Hence why it's still in EA, I assume).The lockups upon killing an enemy are apparently a design decision, which I understand - The developer said that it's an idea suggested by Vlambeer to have an impact pause and camera shake when hitting an enemy. It's not something I'm a fan of personally, but as the developers it's their prerogative to do what they like with their game. They've shortened these recently, I assume to interrupt the gameplay less, but I still feel like they might be unnecessary.Performance wise, the game runs at a solid 60fps on the highest settings now, which I find impressive considering the plethora of issues I had on launch.As for the dynamic content, I still feel like it leaves a fair bit to be desired - The map feels very similar, if not the same on every playthrough - Obviously level 1 is different from level 2, but level 1 feels the same on every run.The game itself plays really well, combat feels solid and there are plenty of different ways to take out your enemies and I love the idea of it being a semi-roguelike whereby you have permadeath but you can also upgrade your abilities for your next run.Overall, a really solid title now, runs well and the gameplay is great. My only gripes are the pauses when you hit an enemy and the lack of dynamic maps, but other than that I'm not sure I can fault it. Would recommend even at full price (At the time of writing it's on sale in the summer sale so you've got no reason to not buy it), there's enough content to tide you by for your money's worth.			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATE:After the developer's constant patching of the game to improve performance, iron out bugs and adding features, I can now finally recommend Road Redemption. It's far from perfect yet, but it's more than playable, and offers hours of play with a decent variation in the level design, weaponry, challenges and so on. The mere fact that the devs have been working SO hard on improving the game is honestly reason alone to support the team and the game. While most devs hold off on updating their Early Access games for weeks or even months at a time, Road Redemption seems to be getting a near daily treatment of fixes, improvements and additions. If you have a problem with the game, you are pretty much guaranteed to see it fixed in a patch released before you know it.About the actual game; it's not quite identical to Road Rash, it takes its liberties and brings the craziness up to 11, sometimes potentially a little too much for some players. But most people should be able to enjoy what it offers, the spirit of Road Rash is definitely there. And as soon as we can get proper online multiplayer, I'm sure this will be one kickass game with tons of laughs to be had.-----------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL:Not quite yet!I backed the Kickstarter project and I'm REALLY looking forward to the final product...... But the current build (like every build before it) is virtually unplayable, the performance is simply laughable. Now, there's a lot happening on the screen, but with how ugly the game looks, the performance isn't even remotely justified.I'm sure the game will turn out to be an amazing piece of work at launch (and even during development once the performance is fixed). Hell, I've even had a lot of fun with it the few times when it didn't run at a single frame per second. But right now, you'd be better off saving your money. Because all you'd be doing is pay for a game you can't really play yet. Bugs and the likes, that's what Early Access is all about. Getting players to help out to some extent, during the development. But when it's only marginally playable at all, then it just becomes a little pointless. So keep your eyes on the game, it's bound to be awesome. But it's not quite there yet.			"

As an aging gamer, my hand-eye is far from what it used to be so I really stink at this game. I can't even get to 3rd place and die more than I survive but I keep going back for more.

								AAA studios could learn from this game, it is insanely fun for early access. I noticed some people had some complaints of the physics but honestly they are hilarious and random so it totally adds to the games dumb fun. Also this is not an easy game at first, it takes time to get Exp and Money to help advance further. Thankfully nothing feels tedious but the new game plus is REALLY hard right now but a worthy challenge. Maybe with a campaign mode and a strong multiplayer this game could really go far, it is great as is and EA is a bunch of morons sitting on the Road Rash Licence and not taking advantage of a true gem in gaming history. I could say a ton more but overall this game is great and worth the buy.			"

								Did you like Road Rash?  Then pick this up!  It is a ton of mindless fun.  The dev seems quite active and the game is miles above what it was when I first picked it up almost a year ago.The only negative I have to say is that the kick seems a bit overpowered in the later levels.  With all the things to crash into it is fairly easy to kick your way to victory.  It also gives a x2 bonus for rewards.  Personally I would give .5 rewards instead.Other than that it is a fantastic game!			"

								Original review 16/42:Not now.This has potential, yes. Currently, it's not worth your money.Currently, there are loads of lockups which make the game practically unplayable, even on the lowest settings (This is coming from a guy who can max out Arma 3 and Battlefield 4, so no ""it's your computer"" comments please).I accepted this, thinking that maybe for whatever reason my i7 4770k processor wasn't powerful enough to procedurally generate the landscape quickly enough to drive on.I was wrong - This game boasts on the store page: ""Lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in this procedurally-generated driving combat adventure.""Uh, no. One of the reasons I was interested in this is because of the procedural generation. There is NO procedural generation in this at all. After dying four times and being forced to restart the game (This isn't as annoying as it sounds, fortunately), I realised I was racing on the EXACT same stretch of road each time.Give it a while until this is in a playable state, I'll update this when a major patch comes in.UPDATE 12/10/2014: The devs have spoken to me twice about their progress and patches with the game, which I always appreciate. The latest patches seem to have introduced prcedural generation of landscapes, which is definitely a good thing.The FPS lag remains for me, though it's definitely improved and apparently being addressed currently.At the moment, the game still isn't exactly ""playable"" for me, though if you're willing to take the risk on serious performance issues, I would definitely go ahead and suggest it.UPDATE 18/05/2015 - With the game nearing what should be full release (It was meant to be Q1 2015, doesn't look like that's happened), I figured I should update this again.The dynamic content still isn't great, the first level always looks pretty much the same, the only difference seems to be day/night.As for FPS drops, the game in itself is much smoother but I still get lockups every time I kill an enemy.You can also take damage for a while after passing the finish line.Currently this is a ""Meh"" rather than a ""Yes"" or a ""No"", but I personally have some regrets still.UPDATE 15/06/2015: I'm changing this review to a positive one. I've spoken a number of times with the Road Redemption team who are obviously dedicated to making a good game and want to take the time to perfect it (Hence why it's still in EA, I assume).The lockups upon killing an enemy are apparently a design decision, which I understand - The developer said that it's an idea suggested by Vlambeer to have an impact pause and camera shake when hitting an enemy. It's not something I'm a fan of personally, but as the developers it's their prerogative to do what they like with their game. They've shortened these recently, I assume to interrupt the gameplay less, but I still feel like they might be unnecessary.Performance wise, the game runs at a solid 60fps on the highest settings now, which I find impressive considering the plethora of issues I had on launch.As for the dynamic content, I still feel like it leaves a fair bit to be desired - The map feels very similar, if not the same on every playthrough - Obviously level 1 is different from level 2, but level 1 feels the same on every run.The game itself plays really well, combat feels solid and there are plenty of different ways to take out your enemies and I love the idea of it being a semi-roguelike whereby you have permadeath but you can also upgrade your abilities for your next run.Overall, a really solid title now, runs well and the gameplay is great. My only gripes are the pauses when you hit an enemy and the lack of dynamic maps, but other than that I'm not sure I can fault it. Would recommend even at full price (At the time of writing it's on sale in the summer sale so you've got no reason to not buy it), there's enough content to tide you by for your money's worth.			"

								UPDATE:After the developer's constant patching of the game to improve performance, iron out bugs and adding features, I can now finally recommend Road Redemption. It's far from perfect yet, but it's more than playable, and offers hours of play with a decent variation in the level design, weaponry, challenges and so on. The mere fact that the devs have been working SO hard on improving the game is honestly reason alone to support the team and the game. While most devs hold off on updating their Early Access games for weeks or even months at a time, Road Redemption seems to be getting a near daily treatment of fixes, improvements and additions. If you have a problem with the game, you are pretty much guaranteed to see it fixed in a patch released before you know it.About the actual game; it's not quite identical to Road Rash, it takes its liberties and brings the craziness up to 11, sometimes potentially a little too much for some players. But most people should be able to enjoy what it offers, the spirit of Road Rash is definitely there. And as soon as we can get proper online multiplayer, I'm sure this will be one kickass game with tons of laughs to be had.-----------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL:Not quite yet!I backed the Kickstarter project and I'm REALLY looking forward to the final product...... But the current build (like every build before it) is virtually unplayable, the performance is simply laughable. Now, there's a lot happening on the screen, but with how ugly the game looks, the performance isn't even remotely justified.I'm sure the game will turn out to be an amazing piece of work at launch (and even during development once the performance is fixed). Hell, I've even had a lot of fun with it the few times when it didn't run at a single frame per second. But right now, you'd be better off saving your money. Because all you'd be doing is pay for a game you can't really play yet. Bugs and the likes, that's what Early Access is all about. Getting players to help out to some extent, during the development. But when it's only marginally playable at all, then it just becomes a little pointless. So keep your eyes on the game, it's bound to be awesome. But it's not quite there yet.			"

								There are too many problems for me to recommend. I never feel good when I actually win a race. When it rains, I get at max 25 fps, no matter what the graphics are set to. I wish you could purchase new weapons and bikes. I feel like they have a good thing going with the passive skills, but I'd rather just soup up my bike... I'll keep playing and adjust this review as it comes closer to the finished product.Edit.I got this game on sale, and was really excited as I'm a huge fan of Road Rash. This game is kind of similar, but the randomized maps, added nitro, and lack of bike customization make it difficult for me to compare the two. With that being said, I don't think it needs to be Road Rash. I think it's a pretty solid game. The graphics are great, it's getting smoother and smoother with every new update, and the local co-op is an absolute blast. I still haven't gotten through the campaign+ mode but I feel like this game has great replayability. I seriously can't wait for the multiplayer and I'll hopefully update this when it comes out.			"

								ENG:The game is familiar to the old or the like of the game developed game that includes elements familiar with a lot of nice again planned or customized elements. Very arcade-like style un real idealistic and physics but, in spite of it all makes this game fun to play. The game is quite a bit of content to otherwise and does not contain very much to remake the gameplay. The game may continue to suffer from continued instability, or may contain uncorrected bugs. The user interface is mediocre but functional. I recommend the game, however. :3FIN:Peli on vanhasta tutusta tai vastaavasta pelistä kehitetty peli, joka sisältää tuttuja elementtejä, jossa on paljon kivoja uudelleen suuniteltuja tai räätälöityjä elementtejä. Hyvin arcade mainen tyyli epä reallistinen sekä fysiikka mutta, kaikista huolimatta se tekee tästä pelistä hauskan pelata.Peli on varsin vähän sisältöinen muuten ja eikä sisällä kovinkaan paljoa uudellen pelattavuutta. Peli saattaa edelleen kärsiä välillä edelleen epävakaudesta tai saattaa sisältää korjaamattomia bugeja. Käyttöliittymä on keskinkertainen mutta toimiva. Suosittelen peliä kuitenkin. :3			"

								If I had to rate it out of 10 - I would rate it a 4. It's a coherent game; it has options and split screen multiplayer. There are bikes that race and you can knock each other off. That's about where the good stuff ends.Every bike feels floaty and weird; as in the physics just feel wrong. I often felt like I was flying or something - and in one level on roof tops that is literally the case. The combat which could have been really simply is needlessly convoluted, with randomized pickups; randomized starting weapons ranged weapons that are either over powered or utilize clunky aiming controls.... I hate the music. Just. Ugh - as someone who probably played a thousand hours of Road Rash on my crappy Sega I wanted to love this one really bad but everything about it feels like a let-down. I can't tell if its the nostalgia that ruined this one for me; or the game itself - but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There are better standard racers; and as long as Blur still exists there are better combat racers. It could get better because early access; but I'm not hopeful. I may come back to it in a couple years and see if its any better. Until then I'd give this one a wide berth.			"

								I got this game based on reviews and straight nostalgia, YES this is Road Rash the game you rented or bought in the 90's, just read the reviews IT IS THE REINNCARNATION OF ROAD RASH no story just you and the open road. Ride a bike and ♥♥♥♥ people up. I'm curious to see what the finished product will be on multiplayer cause unless you got a mic you ain't got no time for flame wars.. maybe  a gang or tribe deal... game's fun as hell, it has the potential to stick out in multiplayer. ♥♥♥♥ flash games and fruit ninja, gimme Road Rash... err I mean Road Redemption..(Kinda like Jurassic world vs. Jurassic Park...)

								If one would mixed Road Rash*, Mad Max, Waco, Crazed Punks on Dope, a plethora of guns, knives, axes: modern to medieval... and mixed it with ""that shocking high school video of what prom night accidents REALLY look like"", then one would have Road Redemption. I have been pleased with the progression of the game, as I have noticed welcome improvements in the graphics and gameplay: both more fluid. The controls seem to be better. either that or I'm getting used to my Xbox game controller. If you are a veteran of the ""Original Road Rash"" and had a blast with it, well I've had a blast with friends and playing/ watching Road Redemption and hearing the sickening ""CRACK"" of a sledgehammer hitting some guy's buck teeth and knocking them into powder is a real gasser! This is a game that the devs put a bit of thought into and some surprises made me stare, mouth agape, at the aftermath of a 100mph pile up. I'm loathe to give anything away because I enjoy this game quite a bit and I discover new things that I like every week. I would buy it If I were on the fence, because I did. Wasn't too sure at the start, but recent developments made me a believer and it is, to me, very playable and I love beating down punks who think they are better than me! I'm looking forward to the next update, as I've beaten the game on both campaigns about 10-15 times. Says a lot. I couldn't even make it to level four prior to the dev's welcome updates, although RR has always been enjoyable to me. It really reminds me of Mad Max on LSD! I read it on these forums! Whoever said that, he was right! Crazy, crazy game that had me clenching my teeth and ducking and weaving in my chair, haha! Highly recommended.10/10 Would pump 12 ga buckshot into a biker's rear tire @ 120mph again!*On the Amiga A500w/AdSpeed@14.28MHz 1MB RAM			"

								While I do recommend Road Redemption for fans of old school Road Rash games, there is some good and bad to be aware of:The GoodThe levels look good and have a nice mix of terrain features.Decent variety of weapons and opponents.Interesting random events such as logging trucks spilling their payload all over the road in front of you, traffic wrecks and other encounters.Upgrade and shop system is somewhat fun.The Not-so-GoodGame looks like it was made from 3rd party free/cheap content libraries, not much cohesion in the art department. Combat feels somewhat unsatisfying.Music is good but again, not stylistically cohesive, ranges from sportsy thrash metal to moody synth and no unifying theme or sound to the music, seems to be random tracks from a royalty-free content library.Physics are cheap, everything is made of cardboard.The GUI and menus are crusty as hell.The BadCertain mission types are impossible on certain tracks. After a few levels, you will get to a race across rooftops where you can use your ""Jump Jets"" to boost over gaps between buildings. The problem is, if you happen to get the ""Eliminate X# of Rival Racers"" mission, this particular race is next to impossible due to the amount of time everyone spends in the air and the number of hairpin turns that prevent you from lining up attacks. This mission combo presents a ridiculously sudden spike in difficulty and effectively guarantees a Mission Fail. This is the aspect of the game that kills the fun in an otherwise good run.Since the game is in Early Access, there is still a lot of room for improvement and hope for some of these issues to be addressed, but for the moment, I would only recommend this game to fans of Road Rash, and only on sale for $15 or less.

								There are a lot of problems with this game.  The physics doesn't feel right, there are a fair few glitches and the levels get repetitive fast.That being said there is something about the gameplay that keeps drawing me back for more.  Every time I smash an opponent off their bick or kick them into oncoming traffic I break out in the same little grin I got from Road Rash all those years go.Replace those horrible roof top races with a dirt bike track and give me a chain and you would have a cracking good game.  In the mean time it's a fun little time waster and I give it a thumbs up.			"

								Wild. crazy and slapstick funny, Road Redemption is an indie revisiting of the old Road Rash franchise.There are some unpredictable and wacky elements in this game that make it a joy to pick up and play. The only thing lacking is the need to streamline and polish up the campaign and visuals to make it more appealing. Road Rash had some great artwork with the different 'characters' you were racing against; this was a fun element that should be considered.6/10			"

								I enjoyed this game a lot actually. I didn't care for the cars dropping from the sky levels. I like the arcade progression challenging feel the game offers. made a ""combat"" playlist on spotify with most tracks from road rash 64 and had a good time with it. The addition of guns to this gametype is fun. Cycling through the various weapons and finding the ones that suite your playstyle is entertaining. The upgrade tree is also a good idea, helps you gain something from playthroughs and helps progression. The game could use more leves, bikes, weapons, upgrades7/10 (scratched my road rash blood lusting itch)			"

								When I first fired up this game I didn't know what to think, it certainly isn't the prettiest game out there and it could use a bit of polish, but give it 10 minutes and you'll be hooked. If any of you have played Road Rash for the N64, Road Redemption is like that but on bath salts and with guns. A few issues I have with the game are when there's a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥onscreen like when a logging truck spills logs all over the road or if there's a ""car storm"" the FPS drops to the single digits. The city rooftop tracks are also pretty shafty especially when you're forced to use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grappling hook to swing from crane to helicopter. Bugs aside this game looks really promising and hopefully once coop is added and the campaign mode is fleshed out it will get better.			"

								Road Redemption is refreshed old Road Rash on Mega Drive and Play Station. It has all what we loved in these games: tons of adrenaline and madness, hi-speed fights and destruction (hoping of some wild life in the future of RR). But there is some new stuff: - firearms (AK47 and M79 Blooper are taste so good!),- races across rooftops (use jump jets and grapple helicopters with a harpoon),- and finally - ride a rainbow!So, if someone hasn't decided yet - remove all doubts and buy!PS And try to imagine yourself ride the bike while shooting with a lever action shotgun (just like in Terminator 2 movie) in truck carrying logs (Final Destination 2) to release them right on your opponents... That's awesome!			"

								This game is still in Early Access, so be aware that it contains several bugs and it is constantly changing until it'll reach it's final form. However, the devs are releasing updates quite frequently (every 2-3 days) and they're taking seriously the customers' responses and actively participating in the forum too.This game is a motorcycle-action game, similar to the old Road Rash games, but in a modern form and improved with several great ideas. The graphics is beautiful and meets all modern requirements a game needs today. The controls are very responsive, and easy to get used to it, however you'll need both your hands, because the action buttons are on the mouse (if you play it with keyboard and mouse of course). There are several ""game modes"" (inside campaign and campaign+ and competitive is coming too) and those are varying map by map, for example takedowns, attract police, ""simple"" race, race on rooftops, takedowns without weapons, etc... There are at least a dozen weapon from tire iron, through battle axe, to the AK47 and the devs are promised there will be more. Right now this version of the game contains 4 types of maps, which are desert, snow, rooftops and the Rainbow Road.I have 17 hours in this game when I'm writing this review and I never bored a single second or was frustrated by anything. The 20€ may seems a little bit too much for this Early Access game, but I need to tell you, it is worth the price and it contains more fun than a lot of the AAA++++++, trillion budget, overhyped games.

								I would recommend this game as it feels really nice , the combat is and racing is pretty fun and it's nice and chaotic.Negatives would be limited ammount of sound assets , no motor costumisation (i'm pretty sure these will come later).And the REALLY negative would be the car-dropping levels are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid , remove these , please.The rooftop races took some getting used to but i can understand them adding something to the game.Also the police in this game is a joke , in the old games it was something to be feared , and here they are just another random guy on a bike with a different costume.I also miss the old ""rivalry's"" you would have between the racers as they all had their own unique AI , and in the current version of the game it's just ""another dude on a bike"".Overall for an early access game , i've had WAY worse , but it definitely needs A LOT of work.

								Once upon a time in the nineties, relaxation after a hard day at school was emitting a sigh of relief, booting the PlayStation to hear the dulcet tones of Road Rash 3D (and by dulcet tones, I mean real metal songs like 'Rusty Cage'. That might not seem much now, but before the GTA series this was something of a rariety in a game).Apparently, according to wikipedia Road Rash 3D wasn't well received at the time. Well it was by me having by that point probably wasted months in the Road Rash games on the megadrive. As such, this modern day rip off homage has an awful lot to live up to.Things are still rough and ready, but the core of the game is there. On the bad hand; the split screen multiplayer is workable but has bugs, the network play is still completely missing and the bikes feel like they are cruising far too smoothly and quickly over the road surface - it's not just the final ""rainbow road"" style track that makes you think you could be playing a karting game.This should be unforgiveable, but...it's somehow not.It's a testament to the Road Rash legacy for those who grew up with it that Road Redemption still makes me grin every time I fire it up after an update, whether it's surviving a pile up, loosing a lorry load of logs off a passing trailer on a trecherous bend with a well placed sword swipe or kicking an opposing rider off a bridge.It also has something I don't remember in Road Rash, guns!Simply put, this game has massive potential. In my mind's eye I imagine netplay with clans of bikers riding a race or grudge match against one another. I can almost hear the grenade launcher calling out for it. I can hear the swearing and the laughter over the voice comm.For now, Road Redempton is worth supporting as no one else is doing a similar game. Buy it (or con someone else into doing so :D) give it a play through, then get a few ciders in and try the split screen with some buddies, preferably on the hallucinogenic chemical zone level, where cars fall from the sky. There are far worse ways to waste your day.			"

								As of this writing I've only put about an hour into the game and of course it's still in Early Access.  I also backed the game on Kickstarter.  First impressions: so far this game has done a remarkable job of making the ""road rash"" style game work.  I've only played the first few levels so I can't say anything about the later levels, but the opening levels seem rather short.   The least ""road rashy"" thing about this game so far is the use of guns and bombs, though that's not entirely a bad thing.  It's great fun to ride up next to someone, tag them with C4 and then ride away as they blow up.  It's also great fun to raise the cop level by going on a gun rampage.  So far though, these are extremely powerful and should be something you achieve by doing something awesome (like maybe causing a 5 bike pileup or booting the lead racer off a bridge).Kicking bikes and hitting them with pipes so far reminds me A LOT of the original Road Rash game.  That game made you work to achieve a weapon though (usually by grabbing it out of the hands of someone else) whereas this game gives you a weapon right at the start.  I think I preferred earning the weapon through gameplay.Some of the racing aspects of the game seem like it needs work.  Making turns doesn't feel as good as it should, and I'm not fond of the way the game lets me accidentally change the direction I'm looking (it should nearly always snap back to straight ahead).   Also there's a lot more bikes on the road than just racers so I'm not sure why that is exactly.  Road rash seemed like it was a racing game with some combat thrown in, not a combat game with some racing thrown in.All in all though, this game is off to a very good start.  I look forward to seeing it develop into a more refined version of what we have now.    Also for $20 you can hardly say no.  I seem to remember the original Road Rash costing $40 back in the late 80s (which would be about $70 now).  This game is dirt cheap by comparison, though there's no soundtrack by Soundgarden or whatever... I'll update this review as I get farther into the game and as more changes are made in future updates.			"

								I have been waiting for a game like this since Road Rash. There can be no better way to spend your free time than smashing your well-wishers over their doltish heads with a baseball bat from the back of a motorcycle. The beta has had me laughing already and I haven't even brained any real people yet. Top notch.			"

								Long time without playing a fun game like this one, running crazy, smashing head, and using jetpacks on your bikes, WTF? Buy that sh!t now.The game its composed by 2 (on Early Access) campaigns, composed by missions you got to complet without dying, until get to the rival gang final mission, it has a skill tree, a big one(for a crazy biker killing game), and that skills you unlock with XP that you gain completing the missions, or smashing other bikers if you like... also a inventory with a lot of random stuff to make you a badass, but if you die, you lose this items(not your skills, this ones is forever)So the graphics are nothing to care so much, it has great lightning but not very good textures, and there's a little problem with the optimization that should be fix soon, as you progress through the game you get some lags when ''Cars raining'' and exploding everywhere...And other thing, it has a nice soundtrack.Final: Great game, Good price, Good content and Very enjoyable "

								My first experience with Road Rash was on SEGA Genesis, I played the original as well as the next two sequels, me and my friends had a blast, we loved the game. I purchased Redemption pretty early and though functional it still had issues. The most recent update really improved things and now the game is really shaping up nicely. The Developers so far appear dedicated and I can't wait to enjoy the fully polished version. Fans of this game will find plenty to enjoy here, and if you enjoyed racing or motrbike games, then give it a shot. Nostalgia Paradise.			"

								The motorcycle/beat em up arcade game Road Redemption is absolutely amazing eventhough its still has some flaws its well worth the money. The game is in early acces as i write this review but its still works fine but could need a little polish and a bug fix here and there. but when that is said i havent laughed this much when playing a pc game since i played southpark stick of truth and even then i might actually have laughed even more at this one. the game can be played by up to 4 players at the same screen and eventhough i only have played the single player yet, then i can see the endless fun in that. To my understanding an online mode will be implemented at some point where players will be able to create gangs roaming in the game and fighting other online gangs. hopefully in the final version there will be more levels and options to choose them when wanted and hopefully steam cloud will be implemented aswell. besides of that i would personally like when the whole gang implementation/co-op is done that every gang can create a patch for theyr jackets of the gang.  So if you like speedy motorcycle games and sneaking up on strangers and give them a good whack to the head with your baseballbat then this game is deffently a game for you and if you absolutely want a super realistic driving experience then you propably should move on. so all in all this is a great game even in this early access state i'll give it an 8/10  but with a couple of improvements i dont see no reason why it wont be raised in the near future.  So go and support this game as it will improve as more join the game and if not then you can expect a whack to your head one of these days but that also applys if you join this great game :)			"

								Like Road Rash but with a rogue-like element to it; when you die you start over.  However there is a permanent skill tree so you get progressively further in the single-player and one skill lets you start from level 3.  Multiplayer is supposed to be coming soon.  It is very satisfying to hit another motorcyclist in the face with a sledge hammer...  I already like it, but this one should be good when its done.			"

								Was a huge fan of the original road rash and had hopes this would recapture that feeling. When it first released it was unplayable garbage that had no right being up for sale. I should have refunded it then but kept it with hopes for the future. Now it's prettier but still just doesn't feel very smooth, just doesn't capture the adrenaline. -Bike handling and the physics seem very off-the attack animations and hitboxes seem way off and -the 'progress' is so annoying. I fired it up again recently to play a bit and had to ctrl+alt+del it because it just throws you pointlessly into these really simple races with boring objectives one after the other and there is no way to just do a race or two and quit.-the advancement/money system feels very tacked on and pointless. I have no idea what I am actually progressing towards when I win a race or why I should care. For background, I don't usually play racing games but two of my favorite games of all time are Road Rash and Burnout. After so long in early access they can add better graphics but it does not seem like they can capture the fun factor of the original and they don't seem to understand that so I have lost faith this game will ever be the one I had hoped for.

								If I had to rate it out of 10 - I would rate it a 4. It's a coherent game; it has options and split screen multiplayer. There are bikes that race and you can knock each other off. That's about where the good stuff ends.Every bike feels floaty and weird; as in the physics just feel wrong. I often felt like I was flying or something - and in one level on roof tops that is literally the case. The combat which could have been really simply is needlessly convoluted, with randomized pickups; randomized starting weapons ranged weapons that are either over powered or utilize clunky aiming controls.... I hate the music. Just. Ugh - as someone who probably played a thousand hours of Road Rash on my crappy Sega I wanted to love this one really bad but everything about it feels like a let-down. I can't tell if its the nostalgia that ruined this one for me; or the game itself - but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There are better standard racers; and as long as Blur still exists there are better combat racers. It could get better because early access; but I'm not hopeful. I may come back to it in a couple years and see if its any better. Until then I'd give this one a wide berth.			"

								This game is really fun. Very addicting. Ive been playing it for quite a while even before it came to steam and i have seen a lot of improvements to it. Its still quite buggy and a lot of things dont make any sense to me but it sure is a blast. The crashes are kind of amazing. The graphics are nice. The music is sort of so so. Sometimes its elevator music and sometimes its hard rock. It plays sort of like a rouge like game. The missions are somewhat random and you have one life to get to the end of the game. At the end of each level you have some time to buy health and pther upgrades with the money you earned in the previous event. Once you die, you can spend some experience points on permanent upgrades that will help you in your next attempt. I have yet to beat it but im getting pretty far now. Its hard to stop playing once you have started. I cant wait to play this with friends. It really does bring back old road rash memories.I very much recommend this game. Even in its broken state of early access its still a very enjoyable game. Get it on a sale and have a blast.			"

Early Access Review
								WARNING: EARLY ACCESS GAME REVIEWSo as the game was released to early access yesterday and as such has plenty of bugs, lack of polish and the game isn't that long  and only consists of a single player campaign currently.Initially I had difficulties starting the game at all, with it crashing before even loading up. However that only existed for the evening, and the next morning I was able to start playing.Now I'm not a very good gamer, being honest, and this game offers a respectable challenge. But I've had so much fun already. I've only reached level 6 (not sure how many there are) and once you die,  you have to restart. However it's not as bad as it seems. After each successful level you get cash to spend on extra weapons, food and the like. Cash and purchased items only last until you die. When you die you get experience earned to spend on permanent upgrades. These include extra health, more weapon durablity/ammunition and extra lives etc. There's a decent sized tech tree to unlock. So each time you fail you're made a little stronger for the next attempt.If you've played Road Rash then you're familiar with the style of play; fast-action racing with lots of cars and other bikers, all kicking, punching and smacking each other over the road (and over cliffs as well) trying to win the race. There are also guns and explosions, cars flying everywhere, enemy police bikes/cars and other car racers fighting you, taxis on skyscraper rooves and I'm sure some of the ambient traffic tries to take you out too!The devs have named some of the enemy bikers after popular youtubers/streamers such as TotalBiscuit, Pewdiepie and Spoony, which I chuckled at.Now of course there are bugs (had one where I levitated at the side of a building after falling over the edge) and in general it lacks polish. The devs have promised a competitive multiplayer/pvp mode at launch, which should be fun... though I'll die instantly probably!All in all, you can replay the same few levels over n over and have a lot of fun. It's not a game you'll be able to play for thousands of hours unless you're really good at the pvp mode, but you'll certainly get your money's worth for just £14, and once completed, it'll be something I come back to every now and again for a quick blast of fun.

								Disclaimer: I got this for free from the devs as part of some random community sweepstakes or something I was unaware of. So if nothing else they seem like a nice bunch!It starts off Road Rash-y enough, but a few levels in you start getting more bizarre variants, car tornadoes, grappling hooks, grenade launchers, etc., and capping off with a rather unexpected final track. The difficulty is frequently askew, the ""turn cash into experience"" shop option that shows up occasionally is the only good way of earning EXP for permanent upgrades, keyboard controls are just a tad weird but workable, the physics are all over the place but in an entertaining way, and the moment to moment sensation of the game varies from the most cathartic and hilarious nonsense to the most frustrating BS ♥♥♥♥ups.I'm not sure I'd really call it the true successor to Road Rash although it does its own thing pretty well, and I'm not sure I'd be able to justify the full pricetag at this stage in development -- but it's very much worth experiencing.

								In it's current state, v0.813, the game is already an incredible amount of fun.If you like racing and/or melee combat you should really give this a try.Cause for a game that relies on motercycle races and swinging weapons it's a suprising lot of fun.Weapons ranging from sledgehammers to battle axes to C4 give enough variation to wanna try them all.The campaign mode currently exists out a number of missions to complete like a normal race, attract police, kill a number of enemies (sometimes without using weapons). These modes are mixed up with some crazy stuff like cars dropping from the sky, driving on rooftops or even using jumpjets. Gotta say the first time those cars came down I was like 'What up with that? AWESOME!!!' On the other hand it can also be slightly frustrating in the later levels, cause if you die you start from scratch. The game uses two types of 'powerups' one persisted and bought by XP the other only counting a lifetime and are bought with money earned for taking down enemies and winning races. These 'powerups' are mainly about, get more life, get stronger, get more ammo for weapons etc.The races itself are extremly frantic and fast paced, this will cause you to crash from your bike every now and then showing a ragdoll effects which reminds me much of fallout 2. And with all the sillyness in the game already who knows it might get a stunt mode as well? :DThis version does not have the competitive mode yet so i'm really looking forward to that, cause that could make or break a game like this.Now to sum up what I really like about the game- Awesome fast paced racing and combat- Funny diversions like raining cars and jumpjets.- A good set of weapons.- The temporary skills (don't like the permanent ones so much, it makes the game a lot easier).- It's easy to drop in for just a few races.So far i've run into a few issues:- Inifite loading bug, usually occurs around mission 11 for me, havent been able to play that mission yet.- Framerate can be a bit low in certain places (however i don't doubt this will be fixed).- Firing weapons with a gamepad can be a bit tricky, the default rb key to shoot doesn't feel right for me. I also kinda doubt that using a gamepad for competitive mode later on will be a real option since shooting with the mouse is way to accurate to be fair.All in all I can only say I think this game is on it's way to being awesome.For an early access title it's already very playable aside from the loading bug and the framerate issues.Considering it's an early access title I would rate this 8/10.Great job, DarkSeas Games.

								Combines the most amazing racing gaming experience, with great graphics and extraordinary physics. On top of that you add the maps you always wanted to play in racing games, like jumping buildings, roads with bridges and deserts with ramps! Plus super exciting modes, it's not just racing, it's also killing and shooting other people, police and racers on the road, rocket launchers, huges axes, katanas and C4s? Heck yeah. Very competitive, you will never get bored, both multiplayer and singleplayer. It gets addictive to complete more and more levels each time. It's also not an easy game, requires skills, focus on the road and various items at the same time. An instant favorite for sure.With a very responsive and friendly dev team.Totally worth it for everyone. 10/10			"

								7/10, good game.I was given this game by it's developers in return for writing an honest review about it. (referring to the game)I find the campaign pretty fun, even if there's no backstory and experience + money doesn't carry over. Acknowledging the fact that this is Pre-release, this game seems solid and has the potential to become very, very good.PROS:Hitting people on fast bikes with your weapon while racing your fast bike.Utilizing nitro, losing control and flying off the cliff.Trying to figure out how exactly to dodge about 100 different obstacles... while fighting a gang member.Failing badly at driving.Phasing through.. HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥DID I PHASE THROUGH THE TRUCK?!CONS:Kicks and grabs do not connect very well, even if you're right beside the target and your hand/foot touches them.Cop cars go faster than a bike. Using nitro. At top speed.Using a weapon from a bike going.. 180 MPH? And you're controlling it with one hand... "

								This game combines a motorcycle racing game with the unfettered love of violence that is Hotline Miami. Add to that the seemingly randomness of the courses and free for all wacky physics of many sandbox simulators and you get Road Redemption. This game is a guilty pleasure of mine whenever I need to unwind. Fire it up and just start attacking and destroying random drivers and motorcyclists.One of the great features is the ability to earn XP so even if you die often (as i do) you still get to progress through the game. I can't wait to see where they take this game.Full disclosure I got this game through their Kickstarter campaign, but I had almost forgot that by the time the game was actually available. Not sure how my opinion would change if I wasn't part of the campaign.			"

								A brutal racing game with a large arsenal of all kinds of weapons at your disposal. Still missing a lot of features like multiplayer, but the singleplayer campaign has a decent amount of variety to keep you hooked. You gain experience as you play, which can be used to unlock new abilities or bonuses. During the games you can also gain cash to use for temporary upgrades that you lose upon death.As it is still in early access, you have to expect a lot of bugs and glitches. Have only seen a game breaking glitch once so far that forced me to restart the game. Smaller ones like being able to fire a gun after you are knocked out, flying in the air, even while not even holding it.Pro:- Great soundtrack (though somewhat repetitive).- Lots of different weapons and tools to choose from.- Decent AI- Responsive & good controlsCon:- Lack of vehicle variety- Still in a glitchy state (expecting it to be a lot better in time)- Lack of online multiplater yet (This game would really benefit from a multiplayer mode soon)			"

								If I had to rate it out of 10 - I would rate it a 4. It's a coherent game; it has options and split screen multiplayer. There are bikes that race and you can knock each other off. That's about where the good stuff ends.Every bike feels floaty and weird; as in the physics just feel wrong. I often felt like I was flying or something - and in one level on roof tops that is literally the case. The combat which could have been really simply is needlessly convoluted, with randomized pickups; randomized starting weapons ranged weapons that are either over powered or utilize clunky aiming controls.... I hate the music. Just. Ugh - as someone who probably played a thousand hours of Road Rash on my crappy Sega I wanted to love this one really bad but everything about it feels like a let-down. I can't tell if its the nostalgia that ruined this one for me; or the game itself - but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There are better standard racers; and as long as Blur still exists there are better combat racers. It could get better because early access; but I'm not hopeful. I may come back to it in a couple years and see if its any better. Until then I'd give this one a wide berth.			"

								My first experience with Road Rash was on SEGA Genesis, I played the original as well as the next two sequels, me and my friends had a blast, we loved the game. I purchased Redemption pretty early and though functional it still had issues. The most recent update really improved things and now the game is really shaping up nicely. The Developers so far appear dedicated and I can't wait to enjoy the fully polished version. Fans of this game will find plenty to enjoy here, and if you enjoyed racing or motrbike games, then give it a shot. Nostalgia Paradise.			"

								Road Redemption fits squarely in the Road Rash successor category. A seat that has been collecting dust for far too long IMHO. It also reminds me of the craziness of the Burnout series and Radikal Bikers. I tend to prefer racing games that are more than just racing. Sometimes its more satisfying to just blow it all up. I find this game to be a great way to get all my commuter frustrations out. I'll happily sacrifice realism for entertainment value.Minor stuff:The gameplay is pretty solid for an Early Access. Haven't run into any sort of game ending glitches or crashes.The Punk Model: the skin on his shoulders stretches all kinds of funny when he swings a weapon.I'm reluctantly happy there isn't a restart race/round option, far too many times I've had awful starts that resulted in a win where I was just trying to finish.Ballerina Effect: Every once in a while a car or piece of wood will start to spin out and, I guess, lose it's horizontal drag making it spin faster and faster. I kinda like the effect, it definitely has a place in a crazy game like this. It's a mechanic that jives with an icy track or low gravity but not every environment.Low Speed Turning: I tend to hit the fence on the Star Road from time to time. It usually spins me 180 degrees. I find it easier to select 'put me back on track' instead of attempting to turn around. The turning radius is wider than the track forcing me to make a 3 or 4 point turn just to get reoriented.Pipe Bomb Bikers: So satisfying to take these guys out. There's a good chance I'm probably just complaining here but in Campaign+ I've run out of time on take-down missions because the Pipe Bomb Bikers take out the other bikers before I can catch them. It isn't a recurring issue, usually happens if I'm out of Nitro.Campaign+: I found some of the races where there's car rain, bomb guys and car/truck opponents (usually around 10+) were easier to finish because the obstacles end up taking out all the competition in the duration of the race.Star Road: I found that if I rocket boost right at the sart of the race, before the first drop, I will sometimes fall through the track instead of landing.Some terrible suggestions:1) Selectable 10-speed bike: C'mon its a little funny.2) Female Racer: While Shovel Knight was the addition that made me buy the game, your welcome. I wouldn't be opposed to some sort of female character model.3) Grab Breaks: Opponents don't seem to break a grab no matter how long I hold them.4) Intersections: Pretty self explanatory.Thanks for this gem of a game. Can't wait for the full release.			"

								What the game is about? kicking and smashing the competitors faces in while riding your bike and avoiding traffic. The game comes with dynamically generated raods, a few variations in mission objectives that all seem to lead towards a boss fight of sorts represented with a red skull.Im an avid fan of older games and road rash, it was one of those games that was amazing to play with friends, sure it took quite alot of effort to find the right keys being on the same keyboard and whatnot, but the fun was worth it. What has been changed compared to the good old game? The game has race and hitman modes, but the most interesting addition by far is the ""hallucinogen ride"" where they chuck falling cars on the road while you ride, here dodging traffic takes a whole new meaning. The game also introduces a wide variety of weaponry including guns that werent in the predecessor game, althou hard to aim, they can be a big help in several situations (they even have a rocket launcher!) Overall the opposition interaction isnt there yet (if it ever gets implemented since the current bikers are faceless goons who you tend to forget real easy) and the recing part lacks the ""racing part"" as the game focus is too much on combat. What do i mean? enemies you have left behind easily catch up to you and your forced to retaliate, its too easy to catch up once youv fallen or been smacked off your bike.For now i have tried only the single player mode of this game and am loving it quite alot. Sure the game has a few kinks to work out but its a real masterpeice of early releases. So if kicking and hitting your fellow bikers while doing a race is your kind of fun, then i whole heartedly reccomend this game, but the game is still missing a chunk of the heart that used to be road rash.

It is a gem of a game.Graphics 8/10 they look a little bit dated but it just adds to the feel/realistic style of the gameStory 5/10 I have seen worse but there really is no story here.Gameplay 9/10 The controls are excellent and responsive its as if I am actually on a motercycle (although if you are left handed like me the attack buttons will be backwards, left buttton attacks right, and right attakcs left. Sadly no way to fix this....Yet!!)Audio/Music 10/10 The sounds are so (for lack of a better word) awesome! when you bash someones face in with a sledge-hammer it sounds like the real thing (not that i would know :p). The music just adds to the funness and hilarity of the gameTL;DR-Buy this game it is well worth the money, and the devs are constantly updating it with more badassary!			"

								For better or worse, not what I wanted from the spiritual successor of Road Rash game. I'll admit I'm far too biased to say whether this is over-all a good game or not on its own merits, but I feel it has drifted too far from the Road Rash roots it came from for me to be able to enjoy it. If you happen to be considering this game because of those roots, I definitely recommend going on youtube and watching someone else play it rather than just relying on the trailer.The game feels a lot like Burnout Paradise to me, not necessarily in gameplay but in style. A lot of people do seem to like that style, but I prefer a bit more grit and subtlty.As I sad earlier. Not a bad game, just not for me. And my concern is that people wanting another Road Rash may be disappointed by the direction the changes have taken this game. Caveat Emptor, do your research and make sure this is what you're looking for before you buy it.			"

								If your looking through the reviews and seeing all the Thumbs Up, please take the time to look at the number of hours put into the game, then look at when the review was put in. This should be enough to tell you that you will not play much of the game.I didn't like it. Maybe I am just a little to young (20) to have played the games that were like this back in the day so I don't get the whole nastalgia feeling or anything, but if you want a throw back or enjoy the simple games where you just try to get further or try to get a higher score than last time... ok.Starting the game out, you get on your bike, you press forward and depending on situations... you never stop pressing W. Time your whacks right and you get a hit on a guy who then get some strange spead boost if he isn't dead in the first hit. Get a gun and shot your enemies... only takes one shot usually but the maps are just full of bends, there really arent any straight aways or anything, so you miss most of your shots.Graphics... not great. The models for the game were not made that well. They represent the object being displayed just fine but there should have been a lot more vertices for a game that is so simple. Map design... lots of cars on the road, and a few things on the side. That is all, nothing more than that, your done. Just stay on the road or suffer a large penalty to move speed off it.Respawns... I once ran into a car on accident and I respawned, only to be pancaked instantly (theres about 2/3 of my heal gone), respawned once more and got ran into from behind this time by a semi. Guess what? Game over, start over again with the same boring winding roads with the same weapons and maybe one more upgrade but probably not.So I guess since I come from a primarily FPS and MMO background, this kind of game was just never suited for me anyway. If your into games that are similar to this, then I'm sure you will enjoy it. But I don't like the boring grinds of the same thing over and over again. I enjoy challenges, but I like challenges that are different each time, this is just the same set of missions over and over until you get past the one you died at.			"

As it stands now, you're really repeating the same three or four events over and over, and I sense they're trying to compensate for the skimpy content by making it harder to play than it should be. (Try the rooftop level once, and you'll see what I mean.) Fingers crossed that this early access title lives up to its potential!			"

								Well this game is about bike races, collect bounties and speacially about fighting hard during face, so if you think someone can ride a bike with one hand and other hand busy with machete or weapon then its no joke, because if you drive worse you  die or lose but if you dont kill or use weapon you still die and lose so you have to do both.Graphics are not super doper awesome but its like mobile racing game now a days, if you want addiction or time pass this game is for you but price is high which i dont think its good idea for it.Thats it, i rate this game as 7/10.

								I have never cursed at a game as much as I have at this one, but it's also the most fun I've had with a game in quite some time. At times it's frustratingly difficult, but that just makes the times you make it through all the more special. I would name myself a jaded gamer, I struggle to find as much joy with games these days. However this little gem of a game has come along and helped me rediscover a bit of gaming joy.There's a definite feeling of speed, and both the combat and dodging of obstacles can give that on-edge feeling where your breath stops for just a moment as you wait those milliseconds to see if you edged it. There's rightly a lot of comparisons to Road Rash, but this game stands out on its own merit. It has a whackyness that surpasses the prior game, and the feeling of progression is different as well, at least in this early access edition. Road rash felt more gradual, whereas this game throws you right into things. Said progression is a bit strange in Road Redemption, but it has its own charm if you have the patience.The game still needs work, there are some strange occurances and the odd crash, but the patches have been coming thick and fast and I am confident it will only get better. It is already an extremely enjoyable game and I highly recommend it.			"

								Game tries to be a Road Rash successor, but for now it sucks massive dícks and Road Rash is way superior.Physics are total crap. All bikes are pieces of wet soap sliding on a glass lake.Texture collisions, invisible walls, static objects with zero mass, that are not actually static (try running into ventilation tubes on rooftop).Game design and interface is like from 10 years ago, and I'm not kidding.Some of the levels are seriously rеtarded. Rooftop jumping? Umm... okay. Rainbow... what? The whole final level is a giant nyan-cat reference? Seriously?If this is still in development, many issues can be excused. Except physics. Either it is set up more or less realistically from the start or nobody will invest time fixing it later.It would be a mediocre game in 2006.In 2016... I don't even know.Kinda painful to see a good modern engine like unity powering up such mostrosity.Music is good though.			"

YouTube™ Video: Road Redemption [Early Access Review] 

			Views: 101		

			My review of the build 0.814 of ""Road Redemption"" by Dark Seas Interactive, The Fisch Brothers, Pixel Dash Studios, Fish Factory Games.		

VERSION: 0.814Road Redemption is the spiritual successor to Road Rash, and it's developed by a lot of people.In Road Redemption, you play as a biker that's going from the East coast to the West coast in a post apocalyptic America. The game is a procedurally generated racing action game. There are multiple types of missions, including takedowns, cop attraction, race against bikers or race against time...In the game you get a huge arsenal of weapons: baseball bats, pipes, swords, machine guns, grenade launchers, axes...The driving is really arcady and the attack buttons have to be pressed moments before hitting the opponents, similarly to the whip in Castlevania. The AI works really well, and gets more and more challenging as you go on. In the four areas of the game (desert, rooftops, snowy mountain and a bonus one), there are multiple hazards (like traffic and buildings) or variables (like car rain).Another great aspect of the game is the soundtrack: it is really energetic and fits the game like a glove.There are, however, some problems related to the performance: in some tracks, especially the first one, the framerate drops at 6fps. The developer have assured that they are working on fixing these issues.Overall, this is one of the most action packed racing games I've ever played, it gets constantly updated by the developers and it will feature additional content such as competitive gameplay, character customization and more weapons. One of the best Early Access games to support.SCORE: 90/100			"

Early Access Review
								Road redemption is a game available on steam for Early access and while the game is not fully complete, I feel it is the closest thing you will get to a more modern Road Rash game.EA has a track record of killing off their companies like Westwood and Maxis.So as far as hopes of a decent Road Rash being put on any other platform besides the Genesis or Windows 98 is probably a lost hope.Thankfully Road Redemption seems to be one of the better attempts.While the game is a more pricey indie title, if you are interested in Motorcycle combat games, this is right down your alley.The game is developed by several individuals -Developer: Dark Seas Interactive , The Fisch Brothers , Pixel Dash Studios , Fish Factory GamesEarly access means this game is going to offer consistant updates until a finished product, but currently at this time the game supports achievements, controllers, and new game + modes which allow the continual playing of the game.Fun at it’s core, Road Redmption hardly can be considered a hard core story driven game.The game features a few different charecters including a Shovel Knight skin, but that is all they are just skins.The difficulty determines the speed of the game and damage values, but I found the default to be just fine.Playing through the beginning of the game is pretty simple, albeit a bit more difficult depending on the level, later on  the difficulty does crank up though.The player can invest in upgrades while going through the game, but only while playing, once it’s game over all the money used for perment upgrades and XP is lost.There are also standard upgrades for level to level use like extra life’s, damage, or healing damage.Weapons are a bigger part of this game than the actual bikes honestly, though most of them are identicle from the pipe to the sword, they really almost feel the same.Guns are available in the game and take a huge learning curve to learn, aiming and shooting is difficult to say the least, but the most effective way of dealing with enemies.Cops and other drivers make an appearance as well, and attempt to chance the player down at any given chance.Random crashes do occur frequently and can throw you off your game often, making it difficult to just race and have fun.Overall though, the game is fun and grants multiple levels to play through as of now.I am also told multiplayer will be coming soon as well.I would recommend this game to anyone familiar with Road Rash or racing games in general, but not to anyone who is un interested in violent games.I hope you guys enjoyed this review, and I am signing out.Good Gaming and God Bless!

								I was not exactly expecting much when offered to beta test a game by someone with the same name as the game.  After idling for cards one day, I forgot about the game entirely for a month or two.Then I felt guilty and decided to fire it up, figuring I would quit after 30 seconds and move on.I did not expect to get sucked in immediately.  Particularly as I have not liked a racing game since the early 1990s.This game is a great balance of absurdist action fun and enjoyable racing; even trying to do something as simple as watching for cars barrelling straight at you while you also try to maneuver into the perfect position to club a nearby racer to death proves excellently challenging.But what really seals the deal of this being a game worth playing is the reward system--receiving cash at the end of every race that you can use for temporary upgrades, and then experience upon death (based on your successes in the races) that can be used for permanent upgrades, is a pretty addictive system.  It certainly kept me playing longer than I expected, and I found myself planning out my next upgrades without even realizing it.So, overall, a racing game worth playing for people who hate racing games--probably even for people who love racing games!

								It is a nice arcade racing game with many goods but more than goods I have many wishes. If you wanna play a mediocre moto-fight arcade you can buy and have fun with this but if you desire realistic collisions, randomness, decent sound effects, nice jukebox full of rock and roll and nice role playing aspects like skill tree or moto-imrovement trees with a lot of motorcycle choices, this is not it. Also fun and comedy lacking.As a Road Rash Player, I was not happy enough. It does not worth more than 10 USD. My Score : 61 / 100 But because I expect more than that I downed my thumb.			"

								Guess I'd better write a more-accurate review!First-most, after I posted my first review, I got a friend request from ""ROADREDEMPTIONDEVELOPER"". If you're into that sort of thing, great - but bewarned.The actual review is quite simple;You're a dude with some sort of grievance with the world (but nobody is really quite certain what that is), and you must race motorbikes and kill other people, also riding motorbikes (or sometimes in the form of a truck, or Humvee). I'm not really sure why.You must ""take down the bosses"", like some rebellious 1980's youth without a reason to do so. You must ""Race other gang members to the finish"". You must avoid cars flying from the sky, and be sure to smash other (unaffiliated?) riders faces in with a range of weapons I thought unlikely to see again since Postal 2.Why am I not recommending this game? Two reasons - It runs like a donkey pretending to be a goat.annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd the story didn't grip me.(The story? yeah....You know the one I've just described above....yeah, that one.)Even the reason/s to keep playing are sparse, there's no real progression to speak of, and I kind of wish there was. You don't really have a story mode, and there's no real explanation to whatever is happening in this turbid, confusing world of drugs and violence.			"

								As a big fan of the Road Rash series (Road Rash 3 in particular), I really really want to like this game. My friend and I played this on splitscreen for about two and a half hours, but we never felt invested like in the old games. Nothing we did felt particularly meaningful, starting with the character select screen where we had to pick identical characters and bikes. The way the races end is incredibly jarring. As soon as one player crosses the finish line, the level just ends. The second player cannot finish the race, there's no fan-fare, no overview of the race, and no trash-talking bikers. Also, none of the levels feel very distinct from one another. No kangaroos jumping out at you or hitch hikers to run over. Just a generic weaving three-lane highway that seems to loop back on itself ad nauseum (on account of proceedural generated levels, the geography of this game is kinda messed up). The upgrade system feels meaningless as well. You can choose from a number of boxes with static bonuses, as opposed to RR3 where it was all about saving up for that sweet new bike, then decking out the tires and suspension. Jumps also don't do much. In RR3 you'd go off a jump and fly off the f-ing screen. In this there's barely any air or any other real reason to hit a jump. The weapon degradation system is similarly meaningless. You come across weapons so frequently and carry around such a large inventory that you'll never go wanting. In the old games, stealing a pair of nunchucks felt like a huge accomplishment. The police don't do much in this. They won't run you off the road and bust you. They're more there for lip service I guess. I also don't understand why there are so many armed motorcyclists, but only some of them are in the race. I suppose one of my biggest beefs is that the campaign never makes you feel like you're accomplishing anything. In RR3, getting through Japan on level 5 while riding a super bike was a huge feat.I know the game isn't finished, but I can't really recommend it in its current incarnation. I hope it touches up on some of the areas I've discussed. The combat system is fairly satisfying. Grabbing other riders and driving off cliffs is hilarious. I like the detours. Fighting semi trucks is ♥♥♥♥ed lol. I'd probably be way less critical if I wasn't a huge RR3 fan. Despite my numerous criticisms, I seriously admire what they're trying to do here.			"

								Road Redemption is still rough around the edges and somewhat short on content and gameplay modes, but the core concept is a lot of fun. Basically, you ride like crazy across all kinds of environments and knock the crap out of your opponents. It has all the replayable fun of Nintendo's Excitebike, except it's a modern 3D game with all the related perks. I'm not sure I would pay full price for it just yet though.

								Upon making this review I've only played (about) 3 hours. The Road Redemption team asked if I'd like a free copy to play to provide feedback so here's what I think so far.Again, like I said, I've only played about 3 hours and I've already had loads of fun. Road Redemption is a high octane arcade racing combat survival game (definitely a mouthful). There's no story or voice acting but the gameplay is all you need. Race across rooftops, take out rivals, taunt the cops and try your best to stay alive. That may sound simple but it's challenging. The AI isn't dumb. They've kicked me off of bridges and have blocked my attacks quite a lot. Cars ram into you and trucks drop lumber and destroy anything in their path. The devs made the braking system really soft so you can't easily dodge grenades or attacks being launched at you. Some missions will have raining cars and random ones that will drive completely horizontal to the highway making it even more challenging and random.Of course this game being in early access there are still kinks to work out. I've gotten stuck on terrain and sometimes the hit boxes can be a little off. At times I'll find that respawning on the track I can't move and am forced to quit and their secret racing map seems to end in the middle with no finish so I haven't been able to complete the campaign yet. Online mutliplayer hasn't been released yet but if you have a friend you can play local co-op.  To provide some ideas I would definitely add some voice acting and police sirens. It would also be really cool to have a story along with the campaign to make it more immersive and since it's already crazy...why not add a mission where you have to outrun a ridiculously giant truck along with having to deal with your usual rivals? I'm sure you guys must have lots of ideas and I can't wait to see them in action. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game and I can't wait for more content.			"

								I've played a lot of games in my life, but few can match the fun of putting the beatdown on a rider while weaving through head-on traffic and bumping others into road hazards.  It NEVER gets old.Like most others, I loved Road Rash, and was thrilled to see this game in development.  As it turns out, the game thus far is both a fun-as-hell Mad Max-esque racing game AND a wonderful trip down memory lane.  This game is spot on with the feel and spirit of Road Rash, so if that's why you're here, it's mission accomplished.I look forward to the future game modes, improvements and surprises that Road Redemption has in store for everyone.8.5/10 -- 8/10 for Early Access, plus 0.5 for raining cars.

								Got my copy from the dev team itself, and for this kind of indie game this is a good call to spread the world about their game by giving some copy here and there.This is a cool game to play with friends (haven't try the local multiplayer, we've just switch turn after each run)And so far it's really funny to see how crazy some race can go, specially when the raining cars event is on.You probably won't play it hours straight but when you have some time to kill, this can be your game. It's a little frustrating to start over and over (at some point you get a checkpoint to start at lvl 3) at the begining when you don't have a lot of health but just like Rogue Legacy, the more you play, and easier it gets. The ""skill"" tree and the market is well done, you can spend the XP point in it when you're dead to get more HP, or Nitro, Melee attack power, weaponery mastery ...As well for the in-game money, to recover some health, nitro, and some perks for the next race if you can afford it ^^In its state it's already a fun game but a little expensive on the steam store in my opinion and you might want to wait for a sale.Might see you next time on the multiplayer (futur feature)			"

								This is the type of game that makes me question steam's binary review system - you either give thumbs up or thumbs down, neither of which conveys my feelings about this game. Then again, it's still an improvement from steam's old system, which didn't even have a ""no"" option at all!So, on to Road Redemption. This game is a spiritual successor to EA's Road Rash series of games, so the main game play consists of beating the crap out of your fellow bikers and trying to be the first to the finish line. But this isn't just a re-skin of road rash with modern graphics. Combat is effectively required, as some missions flat out require you to eliminate enough enemies to advance. But all the missions (save the pure time trials) require plenty of fighting. Taking down another racer will knock them out of the race, and taking down almost anyone will restore some health and nitro, as well as reward some money and their weapon.It's no surprise then, that the developers took care to make the fighting the single best part of the game. There's a lot of depth to the combat, from kicks and grabs to baseball bats and pistols. Kicks and grabs are good for steering someone into an oncoming car or forcing them off a cliff. Melee weapons vary in speed, strength, and durability - for instance, shovels are strong but slow, while bats are weaker but faster. Swords break easily but are both fast and strong. Then you have the guns, ranging from pistols to Uzis and grenade launchers. They are great for shooting other bikers from a distance. Finally, you can deflect an attack from an enemy - if done right it blocks the attack and makes your next attack very powerful. There are various missions and various conditions to preform them under. Most of these are fun, such as eliminataing a certain number of enemies, or attracting police attention. However, the 'time trial' missions lack the fun factor present in the other mission types. They are the only missions with no one to fight, and it seems that there's no reason for these missions to be here, other than ""a racing game needs time trials""! Many also cannot stand the 'car rain' missions, where cars literally rain down from the sky and crash into the ground. They'd be pretty fun if it wasn't for the pure randomness of it - it's possible for a car to land right in your way (or otherwise bounce or slide in your wary) with no chance to react, causing an instant crash and a loss of some health. Losing health is a big deal, because unlike in the road rash games where zero health meant losing a few positions, in Road Redemption it's an instant game over! This is the most drastic departure from the classics, where the only way to lose was inability to pay for your wrecked bike or a ticket form the cops. Death means starting back from square one, except for the skills you purchase with XP, which you get to retain between playthroughs. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the skills are fairly neat. But it may tick of long-time rashers who just wanted to relive the classics.The game's actual problem lies in it's lack of content. I was able to complete everything this game has to offer within 3.1 hours, according to steam. At present, the campaign is comprised of 12 levels with randomly generated missions, and there is a harder campaign+ which is the same, just harder. There is no story to speak of, and the only multiplayer is local split-screen co-op. This is what made the game so hard to recommenced - 3.1 hours does not justify the game's $19.99 price tag - even if it were 75% off, that's well over a dollar an hour! So why then, is there blue, rather than red, at the top of this review?My final recommendation arises not from what this game currently is, but from what it can be in the future. This game's Greenlight page gives a description of a story featuring multiple outcomes depending on your actions, as well as facing betrayal from your gang, and leading your own gang at some point later in the plot. This story mode alone would be worth the price if added to the already outstanding gameplay,  but the developer seems to be active in the forums and seems to express a desire to add plenty of other content, and already has added quite a bit since early access release. Based on what this game can become, I ultimately must recommend this game. I must make sure to revisit this review in the future once the game is completed, whenever that may be.UPDATE: Road Redemption has undergone an engine change. Historically, an engine change mid development results in classic games like Daikatana and Duke Nukem Forever. Thankfully, this game may be an exception to the rule.The boring time trial missions appear to have been removed entirely while the car rain missions (referred in-game as ""Hallucinogenic chemical zone"") have been altered so that cars are always avoidable. In addition, one new track was actually added to the gameGraphics were mildly improved with the engine change. I've been informed that performance has improved though I cannot confirm as my current PC is far over recommended specs. They've been able to add in more traffic and more racers as well - a welcome addition. Jump Jets now have a meter of their own, and only appear on the rooftop missions. The only downside to this change (or perhaps I simply missed this flaw before) is that unaligned traffic seems to target the player despite being supposedly unaligned.			"

								Everyone seems super caught up in comparing this to some older game I don't care about.Road Redemption is a great game. Fast paced action, loads of different weapons and upgrades and boosters. As well as permanent upgrades you buy at the end of your run when you either die or beat it. Experience points to spend depend on how well you did. For an EA game it's really kick♥♥♥♥♥ great game, great sound track. When the multiplayer gets built in, it will be an absolute blast to play online or with your friends!			"

								This game is totally awesome.To be honest,i didnt think i would like it that much at first,because im not really into racing games.But since you can beat up others while driving and they will add a multiplayer mode,i decided to give it a try.And i didnt regret it.Its like mario kart for grown ups.A lot of weapons,a good melee combat system(that needs some changes but anyway,its good!)and a very awesome soundtrack.I didnt try it with a controller yet but im fine with mouse and keyboard.

								I've got 21 hours in since I bought it nearly a year ago well before it was on steam(most of the accrued hours were fairly recent).  It was nostalgic and fun from the start, the improvement has been steady and often lately. My character is all maxed out now so the experience points are useless, but I feel like the fun will always be there(especially if/when they add multiplayer!). I'm a stickler for surround sound, so I'm hoping they plan to polish it enough to include that. However, I got my money's worth a long time ago as far I'm concerned.If it were me developing it, I'd make it so it went full screen after someone dies during split-screen gameplay. It bothers me a bit to waste the screen space on a dead character wiggling around. But that's me.			"

								It's getting better. The music sucks and this game really needs a race type setting. The lack of a starting and a finish line kills the fun that road rash brought into a game. **UPDATE**Played again after some updates 10/13/15 to be exact. I actually like this game a whole lot better. This game seriously needs to get some licensing on intro music from well known rock musicians. The MUSIC is horrible. Also the lack of a save feature sucks also. Come on guys let me quit playing and start back on level 4 if I want to. I am happy at least that this team of developers actually are updating their game. I could see this game being huge on the ps4/xbone/pc multiplayer modes.			"

								A great local co-op capable game. Controller support , quick wacky races full of melee and gun combat makes this a great couch playing game with friends or roomates. Mindless at times, it is easy to get sucked in and play multiple tours in one sitting only leaving you at the end to say.... One more?Came back to this game after about a year off. It has only became more polished and hilarious. Some new weapons, and tracks. Also good to note, it has local split screen. Graphics have improved. Racer AI seems a bit better. This is a no brainer for hours of giggles and worth the asking price.			"

								The game is an amazing revival of the classics that i enjoyed on PS1. I cant give too much info on it at this point since the game lags too much for me to try everything out. Local Multiplayer, online multiplayer aint out yet. Character loadout and perk system is interesting. I love the fact i can change my weapons, to even guns xD. A lot of carnage, and a lot of crashing (for everyone) for other people the game may work smoothly right now....but not everyone. Its a good game to support at this time tho.Edit #1: After 2-3 updates, the performance of the overall game has only improved slightly to the point where it starts off fine but then gets worse and worse. I have a high end gaming laptop that normally can handle games smoothly with no problems when others say they cant play properly, but not for this game. I dont know about anyone else though. Anyways.....the latest updates did come out with some new interesting content that does add on to the overall game, like new characters, weapons etc. They did state that there was some huge performance fixes but as i said.....i dont see them. because of the still current lag-fest i have not been able to get more then a total of 1 hour playing. But im sure more updates will come soon and i will try again for my second Edit of this review.Edit #2: We got another decent update with a few smaller ones before hand, and even tho they add to the campaign, i still can't play on any graphics settings higher then ""Fastest"". And even on Fastest it lags a lot. This is my main concern with this game over any new content.			"

								The controls are a bit sloppy, the graphics are a bit fuzzy, and the physics are certainly not spot on, but damn it, I have fun playing it. Good ol' fashioned video game fun right here folks. I absolutely loved the original Road Rash series, and this makes me smile just like it did. Motorcycles, cattle prods, and grenade launchers...what's not to love?The developers continue to improve the gameplay, and those sloppy controls/graphics/physics I mentioned are being improved upon as the weeks pass. I just did a playthrough on 7/20/15, and the graphics/controls are definitely better than when I first played the game in February. Everything appears much sharper than before, and it feels a bit more like actually riding a motorcycle. The physics have been made more realistic as well, although there are a few hiccups at times when I'm pretty sure I pass straight through objects. More than anything, I just hope multiplayer gets added (I'd love to have co-op, cracking skulls on motorcycles with a friend? Yes, please).At this point, it's worth at least a solid 15-20 hours of single player gameplay. Is that worth $20 bucks? For me, yes. If multiplayer ever gets added, I'd absolutely recommend buying it without hesitation.			"

								As you've probably seen in most reviews of this game, it is almost a carbon copy of the golden years of Road Rash, not that last piece of garbage for Playstation that was the last of the series but the early sega genesis days. The speed is fast, the turns are tight, the cops are in pursuit and the combat is brutal. There are an array of weapons that can be used from a board w/ a nail in it to an AK-47. This is early access so expect bugs and not a ton of content besides weapons. Needs more bikes, character variants and maps. Once you die, the game is over but your attribute tree is perminent.			"

								If your looking for a good, new, modernized road rash with upgraded controls.. This isnt it. The game is rather bland, the controls awkward, and just falls flat. You spend your time following a straight route with no choice. Your given missions to earn money, which is useless. none of the items are of any use. You cant upgrade your bike, buy weapons, or do any sort of worthwile upgrades. after you crash you lose all your cash and upgrades you bought and some of its converted to XP. Xp can be used to level up specials, that are only mildly useful. start with a slightly better weapon that will fall apart almost immediatly, tiny bit more health (you can now survive half a hit before getting knocked out!) or a small bit more nitro or other things that basicly played out as useless.each time i play this it just leaves me disappointed. there are things that can be fixed, but alot of it seems like it would involve a major remake of the game. Cant suggest getting it, and wishing i hadn't. just not worth 20 bucks.			"

								I expected the speed and the violence. On the store page, Road Redemption looks like a sort of Mario Kart meets Sons of Anarchy mash-up. What I was not prepared for was the extra depth of the rogue-like packaging it would come in. A single crash won't take you out of the race, but if your lifebar is drained, either by too many wipeouts or by other bikers, that's it. That campaign run is over and any winnings are left behind. Experience, however, which is accumulated over the course of the run, can only be used at its conclusion. That experience is used to purchase permanent perks which make your future bikers stronger and net you more money and/or more experience in future runs. After those perks are purchased, the experience total from that run is wiped away and you start from scratch, plus those permanent perks of course. The speed, the violence, and the adrenaline all make for an entertaining experience on their own, but past that, what really stuck me about Road Redemption is that I only started winning races once I noticed that the other cars on the road actually follow normal traffic patterns - as much as one can with motorcycles flying around every which-a-way of course. That means that the most obstacle-free places to travel, and thus the fastest, are the medians. You can jockey around cars as long as you understand that oncoming traffic needs to be avoided differently than the traffic you're following, but you'll only be able to relax and build speed safely once you've returned to a median. It's a surprisingly realistic situation for a game that revolves around swinging an ax or firing a grenade launcher from a speeding motorcycle.			"

								I pretty much picked this up because it was cheap right now and Jacksepticeye played it a lot a while ago. But actually playing it, I run into a few problems.One, the soundtrack is really repetitive and generic. I can think of racing games that came out literally twenty years ago with better music.Two, the controls. How about mouse controls? How about support for third-party USB controllers? How about at least toning down the keyboard controls so basic attempts at steering don't have me pinballng from one side of the track to the other?Third, on a similar point, the camera. I don't believe I've ever played a racing game with a free-floating camera before, and I don't see how it adds anything to the experience. It mostly serves to confuse the player because the vehicle rarely lines up with the view properly, and when I do move the camera in a driving game, I expect the vehicle to steer towards the camera.It might be a better experience later on, but for now it's the most frustrating experience I've picked up from the recent Steam sale.

								Brings back memories of Road Rash for the Sega. Quite addictive and if they support it well this could be a fantastic multiplayer game. Really looking forward to seeing how the it turns out. ProsSimple and Easy to learn/playFantastic soundtrackTons of weapons both melee and ranged to collectConsCan get a bit repetitiveAI has a fun tendancy to cheat ( seriously after level 4 if they dont want you hitting them they will parry EVERY attack)Levels are in the same order every time, you get differant objectives but the levels stay in the same order. I also love the inclusion of the level up system. I hope it see's a little more work done to it but right now its not to shabby.			"

								I'm not one to review games but l found this game noteworthy and would like to spread the word.It's pretty much like if a bunch of indie developers wanted to revive Road Rash to the new game market with some added tweaks like; adding guns, a skill improvement and wanted system, along with racing on rooftops. I'm sure there's other cool crap on here l just haven't played it enough to see all the bells and whistles added. Mind you it's not perfect, there are little hints that the game still needs work like the fact not all the game options are unlocked and it can be a little glitchy when you play.With that said l think it's a good addition to your library and l strongly recommend you play with a controller.

Early Access Review
								This game is AMAZING!This game really shocked me, it looks like a standard arcade game, but after 20 minutes of playing this you realise it's insane fun. I do understand that it's only Early Access but my God I was shocked... I hope the developers add so much more to this...Another little thing I loved about this was the fact it already supported Xbox 360 Controller support as I'd imagine using WASD would be a little awkward,,,One thing I would've REALLY loved would have been allowing custom music tracks to the game but meh... Steam Overlay lets you now and you can mute the music from this game. (The music isn't bad... I rather listen to my stuff)Finally, There is a few bugs to this game (Obviously, Early Access...) but none of them break the game and honestly, they made me laugh such as pinging off somewhere if crashing really hard and driving THROUGH rocks...Things I'd personally change:- On the mission where you need to get police attention, add multiple roads to choose to go down...- At the end of the map, make the road into a tunnel instead of just end ( ruins the feel of the maps )- On the Rooftop maps, Make the roof textures a little nicer, maybe a retexture...Overall, This deserves 10/10... I know it's not complete yet but it can only get better and I have already fallen in love with this!..			"

Early Access Review
I have recieved this game for free as part of a promotion for the game. Regardless of whether I paid for it or not, I remain unbiased in all of my reviews. My reviews reflect my opinion, and my opinion only.So the controls are a little wonky and there really isn't any sense of progression or achievement, but for what it's worth it's fun in a ridiculous sort of way. Knocking other bikers off of their bikes, causing huge explosions and pile-ups, ramping off of random terrain, it's the little things that make it entertaining. If you're looking for a serious game, keep looking, but if you want to kill some time and some brain cells, this is a fun little title. Buy it, try your best to play it, have a few laughs.  P.S. One suggestion, I believe it should be mandatory to have ""Escape From the City"" from Sonic Adventures 2 playing in the background... it adds so much lols.			"

								I grew up playing all of the Road Rash games and this game does them all justice. My only issue with the game right now  other han a few weird design choices is the performace: I have a computer that will run Skyrim on the highest detail setting with no problems, yet this game chugs along at a barely playeble level when there are a lot of things on screen on anything over the ""Fast"" setting. Once they fix that, I can outright recommend this game. Until then, pick it up on sale or wait until it comes out of Early Access.			"

								It's not Road Rash, it's something totally different - and I love it. Road Redemption has somehow managed to revive the car combat genre of my teens, around the fundamentals of Road Rash (with some fantastic additions), and included some wild mechanical changes (i.e. raining cars). I am very excited to see what Dark Seas can do with this game.However, I should point out that the Early Access version that I've played at the time of this review had some problems with framerate (when the level turned especially chaotic).

								Excellent game. A very close comparison to Road Rash, which I enjoyed a lot.  It is a extremely frustrating game (expect to die a lot), so this is sort of like Dark Souls on bikes.It is a satisfying feeling to kick a biker off a bridge, or kick them into oncoming traffic.  I can imagine how the multiplayer would be.So far, there are more pros than cons.  The only cons that I have are some missing weapons (like the chain, which is iconic to bikers and Road Rash) and glitches, which will be fixed soon.			"

								Before the review begins, i would like to note to everyone that i was given a copy of the game for free from the dev team to review, but this isnt a good review based on a contract. 'Road Redemption' dev team gave me, Angry Video Game Nerd, PewDiePie, Angry Joe and many many others early access to their game for free on the basis that they hope we give them a good review, BUT they did it in a much better way, you arent contracted to say good things, and they have given the game free to big game reviewers simply asking for their opinion. No strings attached, they need honest feedback. I have not been paid anything.Thats the sign of a good listening dev team instead of ya know, the generic corrupt corperation. Doing it this way means that both the people are happy to recieve a free game and test it for them, and the dev team are happy to recieve the reviews and attention the game needs, that's PRO advertising right there. Contracts to give good reviews risks harming your company label when people reveal your corruption *cough EA cough﻿* So firstly i would like to say Thank You devs for allowing me to check out your game! This review is totally unbiast and simply my OWN opinion :)--Basic Review--As you may have already gotten from the Steam Videos, this game involves you riding around on a motorcycle in an infinitely generating world, where the track can take you anywhere from rooftops to the dusty deserts. Map generation is absolutely gorgeous as twisty hills and traps are generated all over the place, including hazardous traffic. Immidiately i was having flashbacks to an awesome game back on the Amiga and other consoles of my childhood, because as you, on your bike meet up with opponent racers with a 'Catch-Up' speed system, and knock them off their bikes with swinging a lead pipe to their faces...my childhood heart started pumping again as it felt like Road Rash was finally coming back to me, the game i had always wanted to be re-made.The game is VERY familiar to Road Rash players, but it goes so much further than that, with the ability to ride an upgraded bike that can jump into the air with booster jets, and swing from helicopters with a hookshot. Even the Cars can sometimes be your greatest opponents in this game as they too, compete against you in many campaign missions.Weaponry involves many melee weapons of different ranges and different strengths all the way to UZi submachine guns and grenade launchers, but here-in comes one of the greatest issues of the game at least as a PC user, KeyBoard and Mouse controls are VERY difficult to master as they become extremely twisty and you havent enough ability to drive, aim, attack, handbrake and all the rest at the same time. It is hard to play (but manageable) with a keyboard and mouse, but ultimately this is a game for a Controller. I Highly advise you grab a dual-analog controller and plug it in to maximize your control here. WASD is not very good at how sensitive you should steer your bike and you are going to need to drive with all of your skills here as the difficulty is quite high.You will certainly get a blast out of this game, especially when the multiplayer module comes out, as PvP in this game is set to be one of the most fun things you have done in many years, all about the skill and not about the diceroll. The game is definitely worth your cash, but also a little patience as it is early access and of course, there are bugs and several things needed to be worked out.--In Depth Review--Graphics: 7/10As you can imagine, worlds which are generated tend to look like they have been generated, rather than natural looking, but that's what makes the race tracks all the more fun than realistic, but the graphics in general are great with lovely lighting and shadows, incredible carcrash physics, lots of particles and bits of things flying everywhere, its great. There are however some major issues which lose the game some points here. There is always this kind of Dust Particle which approaches your screen at almost all times, which actually heats up the computer and in some cases, kills framerate even on powerful rigs like the one im running. Another issue is that large car crashes or great moments of vehicle damage causes the game's framerate to take a divebomb down to like 2 frames per second, which often forces you to kill the game and lose your progress. It's still early access so it's very easy to understand that this sorta thing will happen :)Sound: 10/10Countless games fall victim to a lack of sountrack, a lack of variation, and a lack of adrenaline and emotion to boot, but this game features a large playlist of music, each which will pump up your heart rate and convince you to keep driving and keep smacking people off their bike, the wonderful track lineup really keeps you playing the game so you can listen to them all. I hope in the future, like all games that have featured a kickass playlist (MAX Power Racing, Wipeout 2097 etc etc), will allow you to change track in the Pause menu, because i want to play my favorites over and over again! Maybe they could add buttons to utilize 'Next Track' and 'Previous Track' compatability. Weapons feel so realistic whenever you're in combat, from the sound of slapping meat to teeth-grinding chings of an iron weapon meeting someones skull, it sounds terrifyingly good. I have absolutely nothing to suggest when it comes to their sound lineup.Gameplay: 6/10It feels immidiately familiar to Road Rash players and brings back some well needed nostalgia, adding to what is an adrenaline filled game where every gut wrenching moment you fear for traffic over a hill knocking you off your bike, to battling a horde of cop cars and bikes, to avoiding the bullets and melee tools of an opponent biker and for the love of god keep your eyes on the road else you wont last long :D even the race track is twisty, bendy, requires sharp turns, and wants to kill you. It's very difficult doing all of this at once, but that's the beauty of this game and ones like it in the past, it NEEDS to be difficult and challenging...well it certainly is, sometimes feeling even unfair andd cruelly hard when actually sometimes there is nothing to do when you have been overwhelmed but try to stay alive. My only issue is that Police Cars are far too aggressive, where if a single police car hassles you from the beginning of a race, it is too easy and fast for that car to absolutely obliterate you and you dont always have a gun or powerful weapon to deal with it, making your entire race like trying to push or outrun Superman. As i have already mentioned, this game is hard, VERY hard, which is where i would like to suggest a Difficulty option, so that not-so-skilled players, or casuals can drive on easier tracks, with less aggressive AI and perhaps play a more casual and fun game.There is a lack of Online multiplayer and game-modes right now, but give it some time as there already are plans to include them. It is very likely in the future, the 6 rating i have given, will turn into an 8 or 9 after it has been more developed on :)Overall: 7/10   (after development you could even see up to 9/10)You can tell the game is still early access with several bugs, cars suddenly driving on the incorrect lanes, particle and physical framerate slowdowns and ruthless Car AI, but after these are fixed and more game-modes are included, i would hope with a difficulty slider so people can play at their own pace and level, this game is definitely on it's way to being an instant classic, relivving old memories of games long forgotten but better. The development team are very generous, are listening to community feedback, and are hopefully working hard on this title, because Road Redemption if it continues on this path, is going to be a rolling success. It's just missing one thing, YOU.			"

I hope de glitches and bugs are only cuz of the 'early access', this game can be a huge thing.			"

								This game keeps the ol' Road Rash spirit and cranks it up a notch while still being original, highly recommended if you're a fan of the series but keep in mind that this ISN'T Road Rash or a spiritual successor, it is it's own game. It's more extreme than RR, there's guns, explosives and even a harpoon gun and a jetpack, along with the usual array of melee weapons. Hell there's even raining cars! This game is early access so obviously there's going to be some flaws like the framerate gets a bit choppy when there's a lot of traffic and I've been experiencing a few crashes lately after the latest update but other than that I've been having a blast.

Graphics, Gameplay, Sounds and Soundtrack are all perfect.At the moment there are a few bugs and glitches because it is still an early access, pre-alpha game, which can ruin the progress of the game. I've finished the game and have upgraded all attributes to the max, but for me it always seems to crash on level 10, so I'm unable to get all achievements. However, I know these issues will be fixed eventually. Kudos to the developers. I can't wait to see the final product of Road Redemption!!			"

								This game is a fantastic revamp of the classic road rash series and man have they done a good job. Very addictive, with lots of potential and edge of your seat action. The controls are very intuitive with what seems like arcade mechanics, on the flip side it only supports standard xbox controllers and keyboard/mouse at present. Would like to see more focus on bike customisation and confirmed date for multiplayer.All in all, a refreshing new experience with a gameplay feeling that heralds back to a classic age of gaming.

								More satisfying then Sniper EliteDid you ever play Road Rash? Did you like it? If so then this game is for you. Buy it immediately.This game takes Road Rash, a motorcycle racing game with violence, gives it more modern graphics, and then kicks it up a few notches. It's got all the basics. Bludgeoning your enemies, kicking them into oncoming traffic, grabbing them and forcing them into obstacles, shooting them, etc. All your normal, violent, motorcycle race needs. But that's just the beginning.A few levels in you might experience cars dropping from the sky. Why? Hell if I know. But man does it cause a lot of destruction. On level 4 your bike gets Jump Jets. Congratulations, you can now jump several dozen feet in the air. Sound crazy? It's not. Mostly it's just useful. It's also fun as hell. Beginning on Level 5 you start racing across skyscraper rooftops, and yes, it's as fun as it sounds. More fun in fact because you get a grappling hook that allows you to swing your way to victory. The only downside is that it's a bit hard to use. But when you do use it, man do you soar through the air.And it just keeps going. The current last level is fantastic. I shall refrain from spoiling it and just say that it is a racing game classic and everyone will get a kick out of it. Or hate it. But in a loving, nostailgic way. Future updates will provide more levels I assume.As far as mechanics go, it's decently solid. There's an upgrade system, and a shop. You only keep your money and shop items until you die, but upgrades are permenant. Most controls aren't explained super well, but a quick look at the pause menu will give you all you need.I decided to leave the things I didn't like for last, mostly because some if not all of them are likely to change.-I'm not sure how keyboard/mouse controls are, so I would look into that if you don't have a controller. -The game lags severely on my lower end machine. Going off of looks alone it shouldn't be lagging so bad. Either there's a LOT of computing going on or it's just unoptimized. Hopefully that gets better.-Cars are too strong on early levels where you have weaker weapons. They force you off the road and while you can melee or shoot them, it takes a decent amount depending on the car. Especially police cars.-Aiming mode camera needs to have an option to snapback to defaultAll in all it's a good damn game. You should check it out.			"

								Cons:  * It's early access, so you'll run into some moderately inconvenient bugs  * It's early access, so the game hasn't really been optimized yet.  As a result, in order to get the game to run smoothly, you'll need a great graphics card, or you'll need to turn the graphics settings down quite a bit (though, even the lowest settings still look good enough for me)Pros:Imagine that you are in a city of skyscrapers, driving on a motorcycle from rooftop to rooftop.  You pull up along another cycling and kick his bike.  He plummets to his doom.Then, you take out an AK-47 and mow down two more of your fellow rooftop jockeys just for the fun of it.  Their ragdolled bodies tumble off of the vehicles and quickly trodden upon by the other racers.  No one is bothered by this.As the race goes on, you attempt to jump a gap but realize that you don't quite have enough speed to make it.  You take out your harpoon and luckily land a shot on another biker, simultaneously engaging your jump jets to get some more air while you parasitically use your unwitting host's speed to pull yourself across the gap.Once your tires are again on solid rooftop, you drive up alongside the man who just inadvertently saved your life and club him in the head with a pipe.  A man has been murdered this day, but you feel only joy for it.Now, a storm cloud looms overhead and it begins to literally rain cars.  The rooftop race course has become an ever-changing minefield shiny metal boxes.  Feeling misanthropic, you grab one of the other riders and force his bike onto a path straight into one of the skyborn cars, killing him.  He was helpless to resist.  Another of the bikers is feeling high and mighty to have cheated death in the car storm—or so you assume—but you seek to bring him back down to earth.  You drive up alongside him and plant C4 on his vehicle before speeding away.  Within seconds, he and a nearby driver have both been incinerated in the explosion, sending their vehicles flying and creating yet more dangerous obstacles for the other racers behind you.  You speed off uncaringly.As it turns out, you feel empowered by all of this, and you repeat these acts over and over again—always killing—always thirsting for more.  It never seems to get old.Sounds awesome, right?  That's because it is!  This game is amazing!  Stop wasting your time reading these stupid reviews and buy it already!(P.S.

								Great game, lots of potential since it's still only in alpha, but I have to agree with one or two other reviewers here that it needs alot of optimisation. My computer should have no issues running a game like this, I have a quad-core 3.0 GHz processor, 4 GB RAM and a GeForce GTS 450 (old, I know, but still runs most games fine), but it often drops to a low FPS especially when approaching cars and AI that are clumped together at a high speed.Other than that small issue, it's a great game with lots of potential, but I will have to wait for some optimisation updates to play further.

								Not that I'd be original by saying this but wow, Road Rash reborn!  This is old school fun, simple and easy to get into.  Not perfect by any means but it can go places.  Some things are a little out there, like the ""car storms"", but new challenges need to be added I guess.  If you remember Road Rash and liked those games, this will be for you.  Even as and Early Access game it's better than some others that are full releases and price...well, I don't mind the price for the fun I've had already, better than 2 hours at a movie.  Would like to see more in depth leveling (not game breaking if I don't) and classic Road Rash style running back to your bike when you crash...again not game breaking but it was always fun trying to hit someone as they were running.  Good job devs!			"

								FUN FUN FUN! Still in early alpha stages which can be seen and felt for sure but something about swinging a weapon, kicking a player or planting C4 on another motorcycle as you cruise by that brings so much satisfaction at the end of it all. The adrenaline rush you receive trying to dodge traffic, escape the police and take out enemy biker gang members all at the same time is pretty intense. If that isn't enough how about a tornado twisting down the highway in front of you and picking up cars, trucks & semi's to drop in front or on top of you lol. This game can ONLY get better from here and I'm glad I jumped on the Alpha release sale when I did.			"

								Well, this game is awesome. I like to use my harpoon gun grapple thing and spiderman my way around corners and over jumps. I did run into a glitch where there was a guy on abike next to me at all times, invincible, who looked like he had a severe mental disability. It was great, I named him Timothey. I hope to one day see Timothey again! This game is hilarious fun. It isn't a game that I would sit down and play for hours, but I do enjoy playing for 20 minutes every so often. You get a cool assortment of weapons and can upgrade your abilities, so there is some variation in the gameplay. My favorite level so far is the raining cars; it's complete madness and I love it. Verdict: I love this game, and I would recommend it to anyone who was interested enough to read these reviews. Buy it and support the game's development, it's worth it!			"

								A fantastic game, I felt playing Road Rash again...   To be PERFECT, Rusty Cage song could be present in the ST!!!Playing during some time, the game suffered with some slowdowns, FPS were in 15, 20....    Hope they fix this until final version.Through that, the game is great, the missons and objectives the game deliver make us keep going. Another point that make sense, it's the skill tree, it's just, ballanced and gives us possibilities that makes the game grow.Highlights:  Soundtrack, Use weapons while riding, kicking, whatever it takes to move on, skill tree.Points to achieve: The slowdowns are frustratings, even in High End machines they appear.Overall: 9/10			"

								Alright, so for the 65 minutes i've played of this game, i can say it is QUITE fun. Brings me back to my childhood, i remember playing this & my mum yelling at me because you could hit people. Oh nostalgia.. 10/10 for nostalgia points.Anyway, the game is very nice, the graphics also are better than what i was expecting when coming into the game, the death messages are funny (but your ego will get hurt in the proccess) and the controls on an xbox controller are very nice, also the plethora of weapons. The only problem i had with the controls was the aiming with a gun, it seems very hard while controlling your bike and looking out for other cars. For $19.99 though? Uhm.. I'm not sure, it's quite expensive for an Arcade game. However, within the game itself i had no visual problems or bugs it ran solidly on my 5 year old computer.  So all i can say is, if you have the money get it. It's fun and you wont regret, however because of the price, if you're looking for a game around the $19.99 range i'd say hold off until it gets some more features. 8/10, solid gameplay and controls but for the price it may be too expensive for the average gamer.

Good job guys, keep up the good workJuly 2015:More updates with more content, more balance, better performance. Still a good job, was a little worried about development then a big patch came, you guys are doing the early access thing rightnote: Dev's gifted me a copy cant remember why, I think because I greenlit it and commented to something like yay for road rash remake.

Early Access Review
								This game. Oh man. If you loved Road Rash but thought that maybe it could use a bit more variety, maybe a larger assortment of weapons or some different missions besides racing, then you will love this game. This game is an absolute blast.Bored with hitting other riders with bats? How about a shovel? Or a pipe wrench? Oh, blunt objects not doing it for you? HOW ABOUT A SWORD? Don't want to melee? HOW ABOUT A MACHINE GUN? Not powerful enough? HOW ABOUT A GRENADE LAUNCHER? Or have some C4 and reach into the cars that are trying to take you down (yes, some of your enemies are cars instead of just bikes) and stick some C4 in the passenger seat and watch it explode a few seconds later. You'll have more fun attacking other riders than you ever did before. I hope the developers are also going to allow people to mod custom weapons and maps to provide even more variety.The difficulty is just challenging enough that the game is fun and easy to grow into but not so easy that it's boring. With so many weapons, it's not easy to master the timing and mechanics of each weapon, and weapon deterioration makes it so you have to learn to use different weapons properly. I struggled a little bit with using the mouse to control the camera while racing, especially around corners. That's not a problem when using a controller, but then trying to aim a gun with the right thumbstick while still controlling the bike properly becomes the challenge. It's difficult, but not something that I didn't noticably improve on after a couple hours of gameplay.The physics aren't all that realistic, though I don't exactly expect them to be. This is an arcade game and not a strict simulation, and the explosions and crashes are accordingly over the top and cartoonish in the best way. Some of the more nitpicky quirks are that you can avoid a complete wipeout when hitting something (especially on the side of the road) simply by braking or letting off the throttle. You'll just hit something and then stop immediately but not crash. That also applies to big crashes in the middle of the road. I've been sandwiched by two vehicles, but just by not accelerating, I can practically surf the wreckage and leave unscathed. It certainly doesn't bother me as a new player, since I have no problem finding plenty of other ways to wreck myself, but it might become more annoying as I grow into a less idiotic rider.Maybe this is just personal preference, but I would also like to see some longer maps, and maybe an actual minimap in the corner instead of a progress bar. Driving through the city in Road Rash was also fun, and this was something I didn't see in this game (other than the rooftop map, which is a nice, though sometimes frustrating, addition). I would love to see some maps that mix intracity and intercity roads, but I know the developers are hard at work on a lot of other requests. Tunnels are also another racing game staple that aren't in the game yet that I would love to see. Also, if the developers ever put together some sort of map where the course manages to travel THROUGH some buildings, I might just buy this game for all of my friends who want it (I can dream, can't I?).Overall, I'm going to be playing a lot of this game, especially as the developers keep adding more to it. It's very well-polished for an early access game, and I can't wait to see what else gets added. I already have a few friends that are itching to play this in online multiplayer, and I can't wait to strap some C4 to their bikes and kick them off the road.			"

Early Access Review
								In its current state (ver 0.816) Road Redemption is a solid idea that very much needs some more time in the oven if it wants to earn the high pricetag the final version is said to be. The Road Rash roots are clear as day with high-speed motorcycle action fused with a combat system that has just the right amount of depth, but the execution doesn't feel quite right yet. The game's Campaign modes offer a series of randomized challenges. During each session of a Campaign run, you'll earn money which you can use between stages to give yourself certain advantages for THAT PLAYTRHOUGH ONLY, such as doubling your money and temporary health boosts. Once you die you receive experience based on your performance to invest in another set of upgrades that are permanent and carry over into each new playthrough. The idea is solid and incentivizes you to keep going because with each run there's potential to better prepare yourself for the next run. It's a smart gameplay loop that's rewarding and fun to engage with. The riding mechanics and combat are fairly easy to engage with. Riding has a very arcade-styled feel to it and it's relatively eas yto pick up and play. Combat has a surprising amount of depth, though it's still very possible to play thorugh the game never engaging with the advanced techniques like grabbing and deflecting attacks. The basics are here and they're very close to feeling complete. With a bit more polish, Road Redemption will be just as fun and engaging as its inspiration. That said, the biggest issues Road Redemption faces right now are largely performance and balance related.  Depending on your setup, the game will either run like a dream or drop frames at an alarming rate when things get too hectic. This is obviously VERY bad for a game that can sometimes call for some tight precision in order to stay on your bike. The game's difficulty is all over the place, with a dynamic range of ""a bit too easy"" to ""completely unfair."" Since all of the game's stages and objectives are randomly chosen, difficulty fluctuates wildly and it can only take VERY little for a good run to be a total wash in mere seconds. The rubberbanding of enemies feels a bit on the ridiculous side at the moment, and certain objectives simply DO NOT WORK with certain types of stages. Anything involving the ""raining cars"" gimmick feels much too chaotic right now, and rooftop stages that involve forcing the player to eliminate a certain number of enemies or dodging oncoming traffic (ON ROOFTOPS) just aren't quite there yet and often feel unfair and frustrating. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that while the permanence aspects of the game are fun to engage with, the current Campaign mode feels more like an extra mode than what would be the meat and potatoes of a full game. With only this type of Campaign mode, the game as a whole begins to feel kind of empty. I can't help but feel the game would benefit from a larger scale Campaign similar to the Road Rash games, where upgrading and buying new bikes made you feel more connected to each playthrough. It's also a bummer that the game lacks any real sense of character or attitude like those older games did as well.  In its current state, Road Redemption has quite a bit going for it, but if it's going to jump in price after release as the store page claims, then there really needs to be more than what there is now. What's there now is still very playable and fun, but there's still quite a bit of tweaking that needs to be done and content really needs boost. I can only VERY CAUTIOUSLY recommend this game as it is right now. I've had a good deal of fun with it, and if the final product manages to expand on the ideas presented now and fixes some of the balance issues, I'd say Road Redemption will be quite the treat for those who've been thirsty for motorcycle racing and combat.

								Pretty comical game. I remember seeing this waaaay back when it was released and thought ""cool, road rash."" Hadn't ever followed up on it until I received the game via EpicQuest Games.I'm pretty stoned right now writing this so I can't find the words to say, but put it this way, I was playing another game that I invest my time heavily into, got the urge to play this again, so after I'm done writing this, I'll be playing.TLDR; just play this game, its fun and funny.

								Purely from a gameplay perceptive this game is worth a buy however this game crashes within 30 minutes of gameplay which significantly sours the experience. Crashes general occur during loading screens which inexplicably cause my fan to speed up to a concerning level which always results in a blue crash screen, which forces my desktop to restart. This is a serious issue which needs to be addressed before this games final release date. Until this is resolved, I cannot recommend this game.			"

								This game requires a good computer (remains to be seen in the future since performance updates  are being released) and an Xbox 360 controller. I tried to play this game on the keyboard and it's difficult to manuever around the highway and hit your opponents off their motorcycles. This game is in early development and I was waiting for an opportunity to get ahold of it. I was given a coupon from Steam for three or four dollars off and would still recommened people to pay full price for this game IF, they want to play the game with an Xbox 360 controller, and if they have a decent computer. I have an R9 270x so this game performs well on ""Fanatistic"" graphical quality, but I have been noticing suttering issues, which could be related to poor optimization. If you aren't willing to tinker around with the settings or even bother looking to see if the game will even work on your PC, then you should not even think of purchasing this game. Will be playing more of this game once it improves; as it stands, if you don't mind it's hiccups, its a fun game. 7.5/10.			"

								Road Redemption is basically the spiritual sequel to the old Road Rash games. The rooftop levels are sometimes a little overkill (i.e., I'd rather race and beat up other racers than worry about grappling around like Spiderman), but overall a fun game, and most of the levels and challenges are engaging and entertaining. In my experience, playing with a controller is MUCH better than with keyboard, which is a swich, since I'm normally a keyboard & mouse gamer. However, the responsiveness in turning and braking seems easier to control via controller. Ultimately, I think it's been worth the purchase and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished results of the completed game (currently playing in Early Access).			"

								It's like getting a Road Rash full of love from my Childhood. Updated for the modern day, one of the best Arcade titles out there. Few games just focus on a tight ""fun"" experience like this one does. This game will give you a fun, combat bike experience, through several different racing ""Modes"" as you play through the campaign and level up. It has one of the best sound tracks for a videogame, tight controls, and a great twitch experience.The cons: Some frame rate issues, particularly on the car raining episode.No online multiplayer (Yet!)Not enough ""Personality"" like it's spiritual predecessor.When this game gets online play, it's going to have hours and hours of replay value, just driving with other players and beating the hell out of one another. I'm positive the developers will fix the Framerate issues as well.What I would love to see though, is some injected personality for it's single player campaign mode. There was nothing quite like Road Rash where you'd have individual Riders trash talking you (Or randomly helping you out) between races, and who would react to you beating the crap out of them or not too! Give us something like that too, add the Online Multiplayer, Fix the Frame Rate issues and we'll have a modern classic on our hands.			"

								This game is righteous, no more fighting my older brother for the Sega Saturn controller, but I had to call him once I was done with the game to tell him it existed. This game has a large variety of weapons to choose from, but I still feel like they need to bring the chain back.. :) I heard a lot of people complained about the cars falling out of the sky, but I like it, I thought that was a cool idea, and I don't think they should take that out of the game, at least, make it an on/off option.

								I'd recommend it for good fun, but as a huge fan of Road Rash N64, I read all the comments of everyone who was excited as their love for Road Rash was once again relived...buuut I soon found that this game is not as enjoyable as Road Rash (sorry gamers...).  I know this game is not Road Rash, but with the simularities, I assume they were headed for the same direction.  However, after palying this for a little while all it did was make me miss Road Rash.  So I'll do my review of the pros and cons:Pros:-Fun in it's own unique way as some moments from Road Rash are relived-Traffic is certainly more active and makes for a fun ride-Guns are an interesting, nice additionCons:-The gameplay is too fast. You go all out in seconds and are forced to adapt to a very fast pace.  You get used to it after a awhile...sorta-Riders spawn ahead of you.  You don't ride with a set group racing towards the finish (though there are some that remain...) but it's not as enjoyable when random riders keep coming (in my opinion)-Not that many enviromental elements that you can explore.  Road Rash would have interesting little obsticles to ramp and get weapons or whatnot.  This version has you follow a road.  That's it. Sometimes adding a ramp in the road...but it's not as interesting (even the roof top levels aren't all that fun)Altogether, I'm excited about the direction the game is taking and it's an early release so there is more to come...but I still prefer Road Rash 64 over this (thus far anyways).  I'd love it if someone remade Road Rash 64 with updated graphics and traffic.  This is not that game. Yet.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the first game that has actually prompted me to write a review on Steam, despite me being a member since 2004 and playing many great games on here! I loved Road Rash back in the day owning every version there was across the mega drive, 3do and PS1. I still think it is a disgrace the game was killed by EA and never saw a remake or sequel, a real missed opportunity, guess they can’t see past their endless versions of Fifa etc. However, I am very pleased to report that road redemption captures that road rash magic and brings it into the modern world with aplomb. The racing is fast and fun with busy roads making just finishing alive a real challenge. Though it makes the game initially VERY difficult, the one life system does make the game more tense and challenging, adding a necessary sense of danger and a very real failure state. The combat is great fun and feels weighty and satisfying and it is addictive chaining kills and trying out all the different weapons. The guns are very good too but it is a bit disorientating when the camera moves with aiming, at least you can re-centre it (press right stick). And the C4 is just pure genius, that stuff never gets old!However, whilst I adore this game already and think the developers are doing a great job, I do think the game still needs some work to be ready for release and there were a few things that puzzled me and things that just didn’t seem quite right, both in terms of design and the actual game engine. The first ‘issue’ struck me quite early, I was driving alongside a police bike and hit a car and came off my bike, right I thought I’m ‘busted’ (as in road rash) but absolutely nothing happened, the police bike just went by. After extended play I realised the police bikes appear to be a different character and bike skin and nothing more. This is a huge missed opportunity IMO as the constant threat of being busted if you come off your bike was a major gameplay hook in road rash and could be here too. Another thing, which isn’t a fault as such, but just felt weird compared to road rash was having cars (and sometimes even trucks etc) take part in the race. It just doesn’t seem a fair match and the way the cars in the race tend to slide from one side of the track to the other is distracting and just looks weird. I know the game is going for the arcade vibe but you can go too wildly unrealistic too, the cars shouldn’t be able to move like the bikes, they are much bigger and heavier. There is sometimes just too much going on, too much carnage, too many cars, bikes, riders etc flying around. When these moments of pure carnage happened (particularly on the car rain tracks and the ones with explosives on the track) it kills performance (even on a pretty good PC) turning the game into a slideshow and making survival partly dependant on luck, which IMO is wrong, in a racing game like this it should always be skill, not luck that gets you through. Don’t get me wrong, avoiding a car landing on your head or some C4 is great fun, I’m not saying get rid of the car rain/explosives type levels, just make them a bit less frequent (or reduce their intensity a touch) and make the core (racing/brawling) gameplay the game’s main focus.  I’m just saying scale the whole destruction and wackiness thing back a bit, because the game doesn’t really need it, it can be enjoyable (and sometimes best) without it, road rash never had those things going on and never needed them either, the core mechanics of racing coupled with fighting is engaging enough. The graphics are really impressive, especially for an early access title but there does seem to a bit of a lack of variety in scenery and locales (the rooftop tracks seem worst for this). Hopefully, the final release will see some more track types, the city levels in road rash with pedestrians, heavy traffic and tighter inner city roads were great and a nice green countryside type track with rolling fields and hills would really enhance the experience too. As enjoyable as the career mode is, it currently is a bit short and lacks a real sense of progression from one event to the next, they get harder sure but with road rash the races actually got (much) longer too so aspects of survival (vs getting into a lot of fights) and trying not to come off the bike really started to play a part. I’d really like to see the races/events become bigger and longer as you move through the career mode giving the player a real sense of progression.Lastly, in technical terms the game is superb for early access, no outright crashes at all. A few occasions on the roof top events when riding between the two buildings I fell down the middle of them, the game didn’t put me on the track (I was just stuck ‘in’ the building) using the option to reset back to track was tried several times but each time it just put me back in the middle of the gap between the buildings and I fell to my doom over and over until I ran out of energy. This only happened a few times but made me extra careful to time my jumps right!Overall, sorry if this seems a negative review as I think the game is great already and seeing a road rash homage is a personal dream come true. I would recommend it highly as it is right now, I just really want to see the final release be as good as it possibly can be.			"

								Pretty good game capturing the old school feel of that violence that road rash had.  Coupled along some new ideas to go along with it.  Its still missing some major parts as its still in an early phase, for example a main menu/quit button, its only accessible in specific settings, or some stuttering issues with high end gaming machines. My only gripe is the rooftop maps of it is just plain aweful.  You will spend more time dying then racing, the sky hook is a nice touch and makes for some interesting acrobatics but its still not worth the frustration.			"

Early Access Review
								Previously I gave this game a 'no' review. There have been some changes that have made the game playable and even enjoyable. The physics of the bike in the air is ridiculous... but then again so is the whole idea of the game. There is some satisfaction to be had in planting a bomb on a rival gang member's bike or grappling them until they are hit by an on-coming car. Then there's the 'cars raining from the sky' which isn't a bug but an actual developers' choice for a thing to be happening while you are trying to dodge cars and bikers.The biggest issue at the moment on my system is that the game crashes out when trying to load levels. This appears to be due to the game using up all available memory and can be delayed by setting it at the the graphics to 'fastest'. The developers are aware of this and are trying to sort it out.As this game has no plot it can be very satisfying to just jump in a race, smash of few bikers down and then walk away. The weapons have different characteristics and learning to time the strikes is interesting.I wouldn't say the game is worth $20 in its current state but, with the effort being put in to fix the errors, I would say that it will be.

Early Access Review
								Hard to say whether the game is good or not. Reviving the epic Road Rash is a great idea, but for people like me who are nostalgic to the childhood memory may feel a bit disappointed. As long as I remember, one of the best thing about Road Rash is the unlimited freedom it gives to the player, e.g. you can simply drop you motor and run all the way the finish line, however the freedom is absent from Road Redemption.First the new game runs in a much faster pace with much shorter tracks, which leaves the players busily doging coming veichles and runs like hell to the finish line, no time is left for more fun. Secondly the player dies far too easily: either you get hit by a car coming into your face (waaaay too much traffic!), or a car dropped randomly from the sky, or simply got slashed by a axe two times. I would still stick to the idea that you could pick up your bike and ride on when you got seriously damaged. Then it is the optimization issue. The game is supposed to be affordable even for mid tier laptops, but with a brand new MSI with a GeForce 970M GPU I still experience some significant PFS drop. Finally, is it really neccessary to have some troll events like Hallucinogen*****, or to let the player compete with a car? I have already have Goat Simulator so I truly don't need another game just like that, especially for a game that I wish I could invest more time in.For the pros, the game has some really good level designs, for which I mean level 4 where you can compete on the rooftop with a jet pack on your rear wheel. I did not get to all the campaign levels but I believe there will be more surprise to come.To note that this is an alpha version so there is still a lot that can be improved. With a fantastic initial concept I am hoping for future updates. So with my expectation high on this I will give it a yes.			"

One big NOPE.Soundtrack needs to be revised.And we need a ""one race"" mode where we can select a track, race type, motorcycle and weapons to start with.And, probably, solo mode can be more WOW!-ish with ""bullet time"" in ""it was close"" moments (especially ""car rain"" races, they remind me of Split/Second).And there is one very-very-very-very important request - SLI compatibilityBut anyway it's the best motorcycle racing combat simulator that I ever played. I highly recommend it.P.S. On high settings game isn't looking like typical Unity3D game. Great work, guys			"

								This game has me crazy addicted. I think I've spent more time playing this than any other game within the last few weeks. It's nostalgic and plays like a dream. I hate racing games, I hated the rage quit road rash games, but this has something that keeps me coming back. I can't wait to see what else they add, I've beaten the game 6+ times, capped out with levelling and still playing.			"

								While the game is more than playable It is far from perfect or polished in its alpha state.  I am excited to see how it shapes up over the coming months and hopefully it just gets better and better as time goes on. A minor gripe I have with the game is the audio presentation. The explosions are distorted and the music just doesn't seem to fit the gameplay from time to time. It's not a bad game by any means and it's still in alpha stages so I'm excited to see what the future holds for Road Redemption.			"

								This game is too much fun. I have 250+ games on Steam and yet Road Redemption; a game that I grabbed on sale for under $20, seems to be the one I've kept coming back to lately. I think everyone already knows this game basically is Road Rash minus a few things like swinging chains and the ability to get knocked off your bike and have to run back and find it, get back on and join the race. The developers said they intentionally made it this way because it's a waste of time running to your bike and I tend to agree. As for chains I could easily see them adding them in the future. There are also some additions that I don't think were in Road Rash at all, like the Jump Jets. Some people say they are overpowered and overused and that may be true, but it doesn't really detract from the fun had with the game. I've thoroughly enjoyed being part of Early Access this time around since I'm able to see what the game was like at the start, sometimes you buy into early access, you load it up once and you say, ""Okay, I will get back to this game when there is something actually playable here"", but with Road Redemption there is just enough content to keep you coming back and they still have plans for a lot more. So this is basically Road Rash x10, everything is amplified...for example you can get fully automatic weapons and a grenade launcher. One you get the latter, it's pretty much game over for anything else on the road. I really can't recommend this game enough, even if you've never played Road Rash but you want a fun arcade-like motorcycle racing game. This game is CONSTANTLY being updated, I have a ton of respect for the developer(s), I've seen multiple patches on the weekend before. Out of the all my games I think it gets updated more than anything else. In fact, it's Monday, October 20th at 8am right now and there was a patch last night that improved the graphics, fixed one of the only bugs that annoyed me regarding music and many more things. These guys care about their game. Bottomline: If you played Road Rash, there is like 99% chance you will love this game. If you didn't play Road Rash, there is like a 98% chance you will love this game.			"

								Described as the spiritual sequel to Road Rash, Road Redemption is a fast paced motorbike riding katana wielding pile up of a wild ride. From zooming down motorways to leaping between rooftops the gameplay will definitely remind you of your days playing the old road rash series. This time around however, there is no bike shop, and no story mode. The campaign is a series of randomly generated missions that give you cash which you can spend on items such as increased health or weapon damage. However, if you die while playing, you lose all your progress except for any experience gained. You can spend this experience on persistent upgrades such as improved health or bikes.All in all a pretty enjoyable game especially considering that its still in early access. Its early access state is still obvious while playing however, everything has a work in progress feel. Fortunately the core gameplay is pretty well nailed down, so if they continue building the game around this it could be even better upon release.The game also features 4 way split screen and controller compatibility, so local multiplayer is currently possible, and it looks like online multiplayer is on the horizon.As with all early access games, only time will tell as to whether the finished product is worth your pennies, and in some cases, whether the game will actually be completed.

								Well what is there to say about such a simple yet amazing game. to start off with if you are looking for an addictive upgrade game then look no further and buy this one!First off the game mechanics are very simple yet so strategic and tacticle. you have multiple moves you can use to get other riders off their bikes and an arsonal of weapons at your disposal and each weapon feels and plays differently, if its more range or more power or both together,The game offers a campaign and a campaign+. you could effectivly complete the campaign in one fell swoop and it would be very short VERY UNLIKELY. this game is very challanging and requires you to pay a lot of attention and i kid you not, in later levels you will be alive or dead judging on a split secound move. when you get the hang of the game and have upgraded enough to last longer you will get such a buzz from dodging debree and flying cars ect ect. there are many game modes to keep you entertained and its always random in a campaign.The down sides of the game only come with the brand ""early access, i mean these down sides are so small that they could be fixed within the next day from me writing this so they may not even be there.Co-op play is brilliant fun riding around with some mates in split screen madness, not enough games offer this on PC but i feel it was another selling point for me, HOWEVER during the upgrade screen you can heal your rider but you cant see the 2nd players health bar so you don't know if he needs healing. you also share the same pool of money and both get the same upgrades, im not saying this is a bad point but it kind of makes player 2 feel more like an extention than a player in the game.FPS, throughout the game the FPS is brilliant. HOWEVER at some rare moment later on in the game where hell is brought down on earth, the FPS can drop and this makes the game a little tricky considerng every secound counts. however the FPS drop lasts for around 3 to 4 secounds and thats it.as i say these SMALL issues can be fixed easily and i beleave there will be a competative mode coming soon so there is more to look for. this game is addictive frstratingly challanging, has some seriouse replay value and i would say 9.3/10 Love it.

								Remember Road Rash? Kind of? Okay, that’s good enough. The homicidal motorcycle racing genre never went stale. Instead, it kind of never went anywhere. Those games died on the side of some infinite stretch of desolate highway in the late ‘90s. Luckily, the people at DarkSeas flipped open their Necronomicon and decided to revive the genre with Road Redemption and I couldn’t be happier. It’s at least ten times the skull busting, engine revving, cap popping, and jump jetting you can remember.Set in a world where cars can, and occasionally will, rain from the sky, this is the Road Rashiest rehash you could possibly envision. Calling it a tribute doesn’t even do it justice. Road Redemption does more for this niche racing genre than any game before it. It’s nearly perfect and, technically, not even a finished product. Part roguelike, part RPG, and all high-octane violence, this game is both incredibly easy to get into and difficult to perfect. Careen across skyscrapers and swerve around crumbled competition – there are a ton of surprises folded into this title. Pure entertainment and a “must own” for old-school fans.			"

My hands shake from the adrenalin and dopamine, this is better than any pilfered drug.My comms activate: ""Kill all gang members with kicks and grabs!"" It occurs to me that the Brotherhood of Jackals only pilot semi-trucks these days. I had been wondering why my brothers had been calling me ""Sabin.""Cars and trucks begin falling from the sky.

My first review on 28 Sep @ 11:15pmI know it's early access, but i want to believe that the game is in very (very) early development. Pre-alpha or something. This game was advertised as ""Road Rash Reborn"" or something like that, but all i was able to see is ""Mario Kart with Bikes"". The game is very fun, i give you that. But the modeling is poor, the physics is poor. There's no bike selection and the maps although it's proceduraly generated, it bugs a lot. And personally, i don't like the car storm and neither the traffic in the rooftops. This is my temp review. I want to see (the said) improvements in the next update.My second review on 09 Oct @ 9:03pmA lot had improved since my first review. Stability, gameplay, etc. Nice to see the game acquiring it's form and getting polished.The producers also contacted me and really wanted to hear what i had to suggest. It was very thoughtful. I gave a lot of feedback and hope to have helped them. :) "

								Previously I gave this game a 'no' review. There have been some changes that have made the game playable and even enjoyable. The physics of the bike in the air is ridiculous... but then again so is the whole idea of the game. There is some satisfaction to be had in planting a bomb on a rival gang member's bike or grappling them until they are hit by an on-coming car. Then there's the 'cars raining from the sky' which isn't a bug but an actual developers' choice for a thing to be happening while you are trying to dodge cars and bikers.The biggest issue at the moment on my system is that the game crashes out when trying to load levels. This appears to be due to the game using up all available memory and can be delayed by setting it at the the graphics to 'fastest'. The developers are aware of this and are trying to sort it out.As this game has no plot it can be very satisfying to just jump in a race, smash of few bikers down and then walk away. The weapons have different characteristics and learning to time the strikes is interesting.I wouldn't say the game is worth $20 in its current state but, with the effort being put in to fix the errors, I would say that it will be.

								Road Redemption is basically the spiritual sequel to the old Road Rash games. The rooftop levels are sometimes a little overkill (i.e., I'd rather race and beat up other racers than worry about grappling around like Spiderman), but overall a fun game, and most of the levels and challenges are engaging and entertaining. In my experience, playing with a controller is MUCH better than with keyboard, which is a swich, since I'm normally a keyboard & mouse gamer. However, the responsiveness in turning and braking seems easier to control via controller. Ultimately, I think it's been worth the purchase and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished results of the completed game (currently playing in Early Access).			"

								It's like getting a Road Rash full of love from my Childhood. Updated for the modern day, one of the best Arcade titles out there. Few games just focus on a tight ""fun"" experience like this one does. This game will give you a fun, combat bike experience, through several different racing ""Modes"" as you play through the campaign and level up. It has one of the best sound tracks for a videogame, tight controls, and a great twitch experience.The cons: Some frame rate issues, particularly on the car raining episode.No online multiplayer (Yet!)Not enough ""Personality"" like it's spiritual predecessor.When this game gets online play, it's going to have hours and hours of replay value, just driving with other players and beating the hell out of one another. I'm positive the developers will fix the Framerate issues as well.What I would love to see though, is some injected personality for it's single player campaign mode. There was nothing quite like Road Rash where you'd have individual Riders trash talking you (Or randomly helping you out) between races, and who would react to you beating the crap out of them or not too! Give us something like that too, add the Online Multiplayer, Fix the Frame Rate issues and we'll have a modern classic on our hands.			"

								I'd recommend it for good fun, but as a huge fan of Road Rash N64, I read all the comments of everyone who was excited as their love for Road Rash was once again relived...buuut I soon found that this game is not as enjoyable as Road Rash (sorry gamers...).  I know this game is not Road Rash, but with the simularities, I assume they were headed for the same direction.  However, after palying this for a little while all it did was make me miss Road Rash.  So I'll do my review of the pros and cons:Pros:-Fun in it's own unique way as some moments from Road Rash are relived-Traffic is certainly more active and makes for a fun ride-Guns are an interesting, nice additionCons:-The gameplay is too fast. You go all out in seconds and are forced to adapt to a very fast pace.  You get used to it after a awhile...sorta-Riders spawn ahead of you.  You don't ride with a set group racing towards the finish (though there are some that remain...) but it's not as enjoyable when random riders keep coming (in my opinion)-Not that many enviromental elements that you can explore.  Road Rash would have interesting little obsticles to ramp and get weapons or whatnot.  This version has you follow a road.  That's it. Sometimes adding a ramp in the road...but it's not as interesting (even the roof top levels aren't all that fun)Altogether, I'm excited about the direction the game is taking and it's an early release so there is more to come...but I still prefer Road Rash 64 over this (thus far anyways).  I'd love it if someone remade Road Rash 64 with updated graphics and traffic.  This is not that game. Yet.			"

Early Access Review
								This is the first game that has actually prompted me to write a review on Steam, despite me being a member since 2004 and playing many great games on here! I loved Road Rash back in the day owning every version there was across the mega drive, 3do and PS1. I still think it is a disgrace the game was killed by EA and never saw a remake or sequel, a real missed opportunity, guess they can’t see past their endless versions of Fifa etc. However, I am very pleased to report that road redemption captures that road rash magic and brings it into the modern world with aplomb. The racing is fast and fun with busy roads making just finishing alive a real challenge. Though it makes the game initially VERY difficult, the one life system does make the game more tense and challenging, adding a necessary sense of danger and a very real failure state. The combat is great fun and feels weighty and satisfying and it is addictive chaining kills and trying out all the different weapons. The guns are very good too but it is a bit disorientating when the camera moves with aiming, at least you can re-centre it (press right stick). And the C4 is just pure genius, that stuff never gets old!However, whilst I adore this game already and think the developers are doing a great job, I do think the game still needs some work to be ready for release and there were a few things that puzzled me and things that just didn’t seem quite right, both in terms of design and the actual game engine. The first ‘issue’ struck me quite early, I was driving alongside a police bike and hit a car and came off my bike, right I thought I’m ‘busted’ (as in road rash) but absolutely nothing happened, the police bike just went by. After extended play I realised the police bikes appear to be a different character and bike skin and nothing more. This is a huge missed opportunity IMO as the constant threat of being busted if you come off your bike was a major gameplay hook in road rash and could be here too. Another thing, which isn’t a fault as such, but just felt weird compared to road rash was having cars (and sometimes even trucks etc) take part in the race. It just doesn’t seem a fair match and the way the cars in the race tend to slide from one side of the track to the other is distracting and just looks weird. I know the game is going for the arcade vibe but you can go too wildly unrealistic too, the cars shouldn’t be able to move like the bikes, they are much bigger and heavier. There is sometimes just too much going on, too much carnage, too many cars, bikes, riders etc flying around. When these moments of pure carnage happened (particularly on the car rain tracks and the ones with explosives on the track) it kills performance (even on a pretty good PC) turning the game into a slideshow and making survival partly dependant on luck, which IMO is wrong, in a racing game like this it should always be skill, not luck that gets you through. Don’t get me wrong, avoiding a car landing on your head or some C4 is great fun, I’m not saying get rid of the car rain/explosives type levels, just make them a bit less frequent (or reduce their intensity a touch) and make the core (racing/brawling) gameplay the game’s main focus.  I’m just saying scale the whole destruction and wackiness thing back a bit, because the game doesn’t really need it, it can be enjoyable (and sometimes best) without it, road rash never had those things going on and never needed them either, the core mechanics of racing coupled with fighting is engaging enough. The graphics are really impressive, especially for an early access title but there does seem to a bit of a lack of variety in scenery and locales (the rooftop tracks seem worst for this). Hopefully, the final release will see some more track types, the city levels in road rash with pedestrians, heavy traffic and tighter inner city roads were great and a nice green countryside type track with rolling fields and hills would really enhance the experience too. As enjoyable as the career mode is, it currently is a bit short and lacks a real sense of progression from one event to the next, they get harder sure but with road rash the races actually got (much) longer too so aspects of survival (vs getting into a lot of fights) and trying not to come off the bike really started to play a part. I’d really like to see the races/events become bigger and longer as you move through the career mode giving the player a real sense of progression.Lastly, in technical terms the game is superb for early access, no outright crashes at all. A few occasions on the roof top events when riding between the two buildings I fell down the middle of them, the game didn’t put me on the track (I was just stuck ‘in’ the building) using the option to reset back to track was tried several times but each time it just put me back in the middle of the gap between the buildings and I fell to my doom over and over until I ran out of energy. This only happened a few times but made me extra careful to time my jumps right!Overall, sorry if this seems a negative review as I think the game is great already and seeing a road rash homage is a personal dream come true. I would recommend it highly as it is right now, I just really want to see the final release be as good as it possibly can be.			"

								This game is righteous, no more fighting my older brother for the Sega Saturn controller, but I had to call him once I was done with the game to tell him it existed. This game has a large variety of weapons to choose from, but I still feel like they need to bring the chain back.. :) I heard a lot of people complained about the cars falling out of the sky, but I like it, I thought that was a cool idea, and I don't think they should take that out of the game, at least, make it an on/off option. The menus are easy to navigate, I turned off the music, but it was a decent soundtrack.

								Great game! A great remake of the the Road Rash racing games. Unfortunately, me and a friend were playing in the two player mode. Player one could access the store, and he could spend money. If player one bought some health, this was also applied to player two!?! The second player could not gain access the store, to buy health or anything else! So, he ended up having thousands of dollars which he could not spend.A game with real potential!			"

								Close to the feel of Road Rash but still needs more content.  I was hoping you could buy and upgrade your bike etc but as of now all you can do is buy character upgrades that allow you to do more damage and get more ammo etc. Another thing i dont really like is having guns in the game. It makes the game play too easy. Id perfer melee-only similar to Road Rash. Also i hope there are more in depth NPCs and gangs to interact with...and multiplayer(which is coming). Overall its a good game if you can get it for $15 or less.			"

								Heres the thing about this game. It still needs a ton of work but not in the areas youd expect. It has all the components it needs to be a fantastic game but its just... not balanced right. For example take the mission set up. Its completely random. So you could start off with the kill a bunch of cops mission but have like an axe and the first 2-3 waves of cops you drive through are cars. (Hint: You cant kill cars with an axe) Or there are races but you start off like 10 seconds behind everyone. Its not like you cant still win but thats just weird. What makes it worse is that at random any map might get the raining cars mod. So you start off at the back and then have to play catch up while cars rain from the sky. And Im not talking one or two, Im talking like a heavy downpour. Then you get a stupid mission (imo) of kill a certain amount of riders, USING NO WEAPONS! Not impossible by any means but a stupid limiter for campaign. Now it does come up where you can use weapons and that I like but when it flips to no weapons it just feels like a lazy way to make this game challenging.Now all those things I hate about this game could turn around and become the things I will love about it in the future if the creator can balance it right. Right now the scale is tipped towards bad. But even with that I still love this game and can't wait for the future.Stuff you need to know:1) Story mode isnt finished, stops about 3/4 across the country2) Dont get to choose your bike, just upgrade it in a general sense. Really hope that changes.3)If you fail to complete the task of that level but it gives you the option to retry, it doesnt reset your stats to what they were when you started that level but leaves them at what what they were when you failed. So good luck/♥♥♥♥ yourself?4)You dont get to build your gang at all and for the most part they dont show up in levels.5)I know I said story mode isnt finished but its like its not even started. The levels are random and Im not sure how anything you do ties in with the story explained on the store page.6)Cars will butt ram you off the road and there is ♥♥♥♥ all you can do to stop it except slow down and pray your not near something that will kill you7)Still love this game.One last thing. I think in its current state its not worth the 20 bucks. If I were to price it Id say 10-15 bucks tops but Im still happy with my purchase.Edit: Grammer and such.			"

								Road Redemption. Holy crap, this game is absolutely AMAZING. It's so fun and addictive that I had to keep coming back to it everyday! I love the feeling when you smash a baseball bat straight in someones face, or when you launch them sky high with a Sticky Bomb or Grenade Launcher.I've never played Road Rash, but I will say that you do not need to play that game to enjoy this. I had a great time shooting people off their bikes while flying in the air on rooftops while zip lining from helicopter to helicopter. All the different areas are long and very entertaining, especially when you're destroying everything in sight.This game however, can be difficult. Car storms are challenging, fun and frustrating to drive through, while crazy traffic causes mass mayhem and destruction, but it doesn't stop there. Once you beat the normal Campaign (1-3 hours depending on how good you are) you unlock Campaign+ and holy crap, it's hard.The Gameplay overall is awesome, fun, challenging and sometimes aggravating. It will keep you entertained for sometime. The great thing about this is, even though there's only about 3-7 Hours of play, the game is has a lot of replay-ability, with having almost all the levels different each time, with a leveling up system that works pretty nice. Plus, the game is still being developed with a competitive mode in development!Now for the look of the game, the graphics are really good. The texture quality could be improved a bit, and there should be a bit more optimizations rather than the normal Unity start up menu,  but that's just something I'd prefer.The Shadow quality is pretty good as well, but it could be improved upon a bit as well.Overall, a great game with great graphics, great gameplay and lots of replay-ability. A must have for all those people who love destruction and fast paced gameplay.			"

								I am really enjoying this as an early release game. I paid, I think, about 12 dollars for it. If you're willing to get in early on a great game it's worth it. If not, get it on a bigger sale. The game is far from complete but looks like it will come out to be a 30 dollar game pretty easily. Pros- fun and easy to pick up and play- even more fun to master- nostalgic ""road rash"" feel- well balanced store and upgrades- fun arcade actionCons- A little laggy for me but keep in mind I use a laptop not meant for gaming. It does well but early access games are usually laggy- I do get one big lag every first race whenever I play at the beginning. The rest is acceptable- incomplete game but with huge poetential.Grab it on sale or wait for the completed game and pay full price. I have no regrets.			"

								This game requires a good computer (remains to be seen in the future since performance updates  are being released) and an Xbox 360 controller. I tried to play this game on the keyboard and it's difficult to manuever around the highway and hit your opponents off their motorcycles. This game is in early development and I was waiting for an opportunity to get ahold of it. I was given a coupon from Steam for three or four dollars off and would still recommened people to pay full price for this game IF, they want to play the game with an Xbox 360 controller, and if they have a decent computer. I have an R9 270x so this game performs well on ""Fanatistic"" graphical quality, but I have been noticing suttering issues, which could be related to poor optimization. If you aren't willing to tinker around with the settings or even bother looking to see if the game will even work on your PC, then you should not even think of purchasing this game. Will be playing more of this game once it improves; as it stands, if you don't mind it's hiccups, its a fun game. 7.5/10.			"

								Best ""Early Access"" game I've ever played. Not even a contest.Remember ""Road Rash?"" This feels like Road Rash - truly. And if you're too young to remember the original, let me explain what that means: Intuitive, easy-to-pickup motorcycle racing controls mixed with ridiculously entertaining violence. Is another racer pulling up next to you, about to hit you in the face with a baseball bat? Kick him into oncoming traffic. It feels good. It feels real good.Melee weapons are here, of course, but the addition of guns and explosives make for a novel twist to the old formula. And most importantly, I like the way the guns feel. It doesn't feel impossible to aim while driving; The skill came rather quickly, honestly. Automatic weapons are great for taking out small packs of enemy racers, while single-shot weapons make picking off one at a time - even from a distance - possible, and satisfying.I have almost 700 games right now, not counting free-to-plays, and this is the one I keep going back to when I have a half an hour to kill.Buy the game. Buy it. It's $20 bucks while it's in ""Early Access,"" and it's already worth twice as much - so after it's done and they raise the price, it'll still easily be worth the money.Buy it. You won't be disappointed.			"

								Awesome Game!!!  If you enjoyed the Road Rash series of games in your youth, or if you think you would enjoy motorcycle combat then i highly suggest you check this game out.  Yes its in early access but that doesn't mean it isn't a quality game.  I hope to see more story line in game.  Maybe a little more backstory.  I gotta say its very satisfying playing the game.  I use gamepads basically for any games, and the controls are solid.  I had one mission where i had a bunch of c4 at the beginning of a master race, and basically destroyed everyone right off the bat, it was very sweet!My only complaint is that some of the music feels a little weak, and one map its rather odd(you will know it when you hear it)  A great fix for that would be if we could have our own music in game maybe?  I don't know how complicated that would be though.			"

								This game, despite it's hype of bringing back a game that was formely road rash, a game franchise that was massively popular in the 90's, doesn't seem to live up to the hype of the original. By playing or rather trying to play this game for roughly an hour, I spent the better part of that hour frustratingly trying to get my pc gamepad to work with it and even with using the input settings, some of which i'll admit were rather frustrating, in the end did not work.Searching for an answer via the internet I have discovered that an xbox360 controller works just fine on the PC, however I don't have an XBOX360 controller and simply refuse to buy one either. One gamepad for each and every game should work, PERIOD. Not just a specific one.In the end I tried playing with a keyboard and mouse and had limited success, controls are laggy and sometimes the screen freezes when an enemy is killed. It's also rather difficult to make hard or sharp turns when the bike itself even at the very 1st level seems rather sluggish and feels like I need to turn my own body to will it to go left and right.In hindsight, the game reacts and moves just like the old road rash games in that retrospect if you wanted a bit of frustrating nostalga,  however I was hoping for a smoother and better gaming experience that actually and equally goes with the change in the times and of gaming. There is also quite a delayed effect with trying to take the enemies down with weapons, infact its increasingly frustrating, because when you click the left or right mouse button, you expect an immediate reaction, but much like the steering and general incompetance of the game, it too is increasingly slow and delayed.So all in all? Doesn't work with any gamepad except an x360 controller, laggy and slow on turns and attacking, even more frustrating and difficult to play on your keyboard/mouse and quite frankly isn't worth the £15 I spent for it on steam.Yes it looked amazing via youtube and the gamers that reviewed it gave it major props but I still can't help but feel like I've been decieved. Still regardless of my 1st hr impressions of it, no matter how negative they maybe, I'm not going to completely give up on it until I've given it more time, maybe try tweeking it a bit. Till then? Who knows?			"

								Started this game expecting Road Rash 64. What I got was Road Redemption.Let me start by saying I loved Road Rash 64, and if you loved it too, you will LOVE this game.They have tons and tons of weapons, guns, bombs, grappling hooks, knives, bats, etc. They have multiple game modes. Cars hunt you down, cars fall from the sky, cars on rooftops, it becomes INSANE. This game is HILARIOUS to start playing, then after that it gets to be normal Road Rash 64 all over again. It's an incredible game. This is also in Alpha, so I'm extremely excited to see how far this game will go!			"

To anyone looking to buy it i would hold off and wait for either a more stable release or full release as the recommended requirements are either a lie or the game is broken.[Update] Tried playing again a few weeks later after a few updates had been released and its like a new game, runs smoothly even on higher graphic settings.

								Pretty good game capturing the old school feel of that violence that road rash had.  Coupled along some new ideas to go along with it.  Its still missing some major parts as its still in an early phase, for example a main menu/quit button, its only accessible in specific settings, or some stuttering issues with high end gaming machines. My only gripe is the rooftop maps of it is just plain aweful.  You will spend more time dying then racing, the sky hook is a nice touch and makes for some interesting acrobatics but its still not worth the frustration.			"

								Okay, so I bought this game at 50% discount because I have fond memories of Road Rash. And the first few hours, I had a lot of fun.But after 5h, it starts to get repetitive. And I have really big problems with the guns. They are too powerful/have too many shots. They need too be 1 or 2 shot weapons, no upgrades allowed.Also, this game needs multiplayer, the campaing is fun to learn the basics, but that's it.As it's still Early Access and the game feels already great, I give it the benefit of the doubt. Although, I feel it's not worth 20€ at the moment, so get it at a sale or at a later stage of development.			"

								I love this game!! I used to play road rash in the days of windows 95/98 when direct x 2.0 had been released. I love the road rash game because it had a great soundtrack, was playable for a short or long time, never took itself too seriously and was just a fun game.After years of hoping for a updated version of Road Rash, this is about as close to it as I can get. This game is really addictive, but you don't have to spend hours on it though. Its much more detailed than Road Rash, there is more of an objective, but you can generate real carnage during the game. The gfx are superb, the game play really good and I just can't stop playing it.			"

								potential biker gang wars online here. My only concern is the overpowered nature of firearms that could potentially pose online PVP balance issues. The classic road rash games never had guns. it was melee only. I suggest being stingy with ammo in PVP. Even still there is an interesting balance hurdle here. If you steer with keyboard WASD, you'll have the typical non ideal stiff WASD driving controlls but the trade off is your fireaim Aim will be massively OP with the mouse... but if you use a controller, your steering will be better than the keyboard but the tradeoff is your Aim with guns will be awful via thumb stick aim @ PCmaster race keyboard+mouse=superior aim  @ controllers suck for aiming crosshairs in anyway shape or form.  I for 1 would much rather use a keyboard and mouse but steer poorly via WASD because the guns are just too good of a trade off. It's just much simpler to drive stiff with WASD but then blow everybody away with guns as opposed to trying to race them traditionally... and is that really the route they wanna go down in what's ultimately a driving game.. aim and shooting being more important than driving? Something like www.aimpad.com (assuming it comes out) would give somebody a massive unfair pay to win multiplayer advantage.			"

								Overall, a very fun throwback to Road Rash that introduces some new elements that are also enjoyable. Fast action, crazy levels, and satisfying carnage make it a blast. There are a few drawbacks, however. Not being able to map your own keys is a real drag and the rooftop levels have some pretty big flaws, like getting dropped into impossible spots, or somehow warping past about 90% of the level, both of these have happened to me. With some updates and a bit more polishing I'm sure it will be great, but it is still pretty fun.			"

								""Hallucinogenic drug"" mode... Cars drop out of the sky randomly, with no warning, cause totally unavoidable crashes (but the AI can usually avoid, of course.) Rooftop mode... Jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper, you have jetpacks, but they're only good for making minor corrections. Kick AI players into obstacles or off of buildings, they are able to defy the games' driving physics and put themselves back into line before they crash or fall off. Now combine the two modes... Hallucinogenic drug mode ON a skyscraper level... Get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here. Remove these modes. Stop trying to get fancy. Original Road Rash didn't add this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, why do you feel its needed? Add more variety to the landscapes and maps instead of this asinine ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

								This is a difficult one for me. I love the days of Road Rash, was one of my favourite games growing up, and there's a lot to like about Road Redemption in comparison with it. Weapon variety is great, and the arcadey feel is in the ballpark of what I was hoping for. However, this game is very much early access. The content seems rather shallow and limited, it doesn't do a couple of big things which I considered great from the classic Road Rash games... which I hope will change as development goes on. Buggy as anything as well of course, and I'll forgive a lot of it (too easy to get stuck behind objects, I know there's the option in the menu to put you back on the track, but having it on the controller would make more sense) but the big down for me is that it crashed 3 times within just over an hours play. That's bad, even for an early access game (especially one which has been around for a fair bit).I'd like to say I recommend the game, but as it stands I can't. Of course, things will change as the game gets closer to release, and it's not one I've given up on either... there's enough fun there at its core that with a lot of work it will become more playable as time goes on.

								THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE LINUX VERSION ONLY.First time I bought this game, I was on Linux, and it was completely unplayable (won't even start most of the time, and when it did, performance was beyond awful), so, I had to refund it. Then I got a new machine with a pre-installed Windows, so, I thought I'd give it another go, and this time it worked great and the graphics were improved and optimized (I also had a more powerful machine).I was well on my way to give this game a glowing positive review, but I decided to wait until I installed Linux, because that is where I'd be playing it mainly (I don't dual-boot), and also, so that I could give it a more comprehensive review.So, you can imagine my surprise when I found out that the Linux port is an old version of the game, with the same bad graphics I saw the first time I bought it, and no controller support, it was a bloody freaking mess. And I would have gotten another refund if I hadn't already played it so much on Windows. So, naturally, I feel cheated!Conclusion: If you are a Windows user, you'll probably enjoy this game, it's a promising follow-up to the classic Road Rash game. If you are a Linux user, stay the heck away from this game, at least until it's on par with the Windows version, also, the developers hate you!			"

								I'm putting in my two cents for this game as well. Since its debut it has come a long way. After the last Summer patch I can officially say this is going to be the next Road Rash. Even in its unfinished state the improvements and development have turned a somewhat middling but good core game into a full product.This instantly brings me back to the days of the Genesis and cartridges in the 90s. They have nailed the melee in the game at this point, and graphics have shaped up nicely from the earlier more predestrian output. The upgrade system and AI of the other players has received a huge boost and it finally feels like it should. A few things still need some work, but overall this is a must buy for any fan of Road Rash. Period.			"

								Not yet worth it. The simplicity of the driving insta-killed the game for me. I know it's not meant to be a sim, but even for an arcade game, the handling's boring af. Alright, I know the focus isn't even meant to be racing (arcade or otherwise), but everything else is equally mediocre, even the combat. So what is there to make up for the lame driving?Sorry I can't be more help, devs. Just don't know what to tweak to make driving more fun. Alls I knows is it wasn't doing it for me. Some kind of added complexity to the handling, or something...? I don't know, figure it out.			"

July 18, 2015I think this is how Arkham Knight ran at launch. First boot, I almost think it's crashed, but finally the menu decides to show up for work. Dress code must be pretty lax here, as the UI looks like a placeholder. Probably is the case, as the Keybindings button is blanked and unusable. The background environments take me back to PS2 days, but it's Fastest graphics quality. Alright, no big deal, let's do this.Campaign supports 4 players locally, neat. I'll come to wonder how, eventually. 5 bikes, 2 of which look about the same in stats and looks. Shovel Knight character looks cool, let's go. OH GOD. Loading screen visuals make me think this is a mod, and the mission starts with no notice. No countdown to go, not even a quick overview of the controls and mechanics. Maybe it's supposed to be old-school, and you're supposed to read the manual? It's easy enough to play I guess, but WOW that framerate is schizophrenic. 1280x720 resolution, Fastest Quality, and a computer above Recommended specs, and I'm lucky to break 50 frames per second. Controls are a mess when frames are dropping and flying between 20 and 40 fps, and packed races can bring it to a halt. Trying to quit to play something else, it tops it all off with a crash to desktop, losing any XP progression I had. I gave it some extra time later, to see if things were a fluke. No changes, other than no other crashes. Maybe I came in after a bad patch, but it sounds like I'm not alone with issues on the forums.Aside from optimization and bugs, I'm really not impressed with the gameplay. Maybe there is more depth to the combat I haven't found, but I did alright just by attacking, moving aside so I never needed to deflect. Missions get pretty repetitive, along with the lifeless desert roads. The progression system is mostly stats, and nothing interesting, just a way to make the game harder until you grind more. I really haven't enjoyed the game to justify the $8 USD I spent on the sale, and I would be very disappointed at full price. Honestly, I don't think the game is ready to launch this year, unless the developers really go into overdrive before the end of the year. It has good potential, but the performance issues really held me back. Maybe it's just a small unlucky group having issues, but I really would've appreciated a demo to see how good/bad it ran for me. I jumped on the sale, expecting the game would easily be worth under $10 USD. Unfortunately I was mistaken. I should've looked at playtimes of more reviews, I think 16 hours is the most I've seen, and most people stop in a few hours. It's not nearly ready for launch, and the performance issues may mean you won't be able to enjoy the game properly. Check out videos to see if there is enough content for you to enjoy, and be careful. I've learned to treat Early Access games as effectively finalized, as you never know when progress will stop. I expect performance issues to improve, but I'm not certain all issues in the game will be fixed. More bikes/rider skins is NOT the solution.			"

								Early Access - Jan 18th, 2015 updateRoad Redemption is an awesome game if you've been missing the good old Road Rash days. The game has some similarities to Road Rash but has a lot of unique featuers as well, such as vertical jump jets on your bikes in the city rooftop level, and a Just Cause 2 style hook shot thing. The game is also somewhat Roguelike-ish in how it plays, with perma death on your rider, but also letting you upgrade your character for the next attempt.I've played it before and loaded it up again after multiple updates and found the game is even better than I remember. The graphics are great and with updates the performance issues are greatly improved. The music is fantastic and gets you pumped for kicking♥♥♥♥♥on the streets, and the sound effects have been improved and are even better now.Oh yeah, you can race as Shovel Knight now, awesome!Great variety of weapons, melee as well as guns & even C4. The guns are a little hard to control while trying to maintain your place on the road and not wipe out in a corner or on some moron driving their car into you, hopefully things improve on the guns and aiming. I'm not really worried though, because every time I go back to play this it has been updated and is even better than before.Still waiting on the multiplayer, and I think that will be incredible when it comes in. The game itself is fun to play and even has up to 4 player local co-op, but the campaign still feels a bit lacking. I'm not sure what it is, but it needs something to tie the races together, a story or something. You are racing and it's great fun, but you don't really know why you are racing, and the levels - while being fun - don't segway into each other and feel like instead of doing a campaign you have to do 10 random levels then do the last level. I am certain this will be address in the final version, and it is still in early access, so we'll just have to wait and see.All that said, this game is awesome. If you liked Road Rash, and you also like Roguelike games, this is a gooder!If you're not into early access, than definitely come back and check it out after the full release.

								Whether you recall the original this is modeled after or not, I absolutely have to recommend Road Redemption for sheer mayhem and gameplay which is nothing other than pure fun.  When is the last time you almost threw your controller - while laughling ?  It's a game in which the sheer randomness it creates frequently results in unbelievably intense, or humorous (or both) moments.  Yeah, it's got some things I'm sure that motorcycle driving purists won't like (you can steer and accel/decel-erate in mid-air, for instance), and some gui weirdness (sometimes your opponents somehow end up being cars - and sometimes you can outrun the placement of cars and bike npc's, for instance) -- but if you don't expect perfection, this game has pure old school edge of your seat bash-n-dash down to a T.  The maps are fun, and frankly I still can't keep any but the starter bike on the road...As-is currently in early access, the content is somewhat limited but is very replayable - I sincerely hope this ends up being completed and released to the masses, we deserve this game.  And if multiplayer ever becomes real, welcome to my new favorite past-time. "

								This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the ""intelligent"" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A.			"

								Okay, so a funny and unexpected thing happened. I was friended by the developer of this game who told me they take these reviews very seriously and that the newest patch addressed several of the things I brought up. So already I'm liking these guys more, BUTThen I actually loaded up the game, and I was very pleasantly surprised. This game feels great. The handling is responsive, and the bikes feel like they have more weight. This makes the combat a lot more enjoyable just because you begin to feel like you have control over things.And the more I played the more I enjoyed myself. I still have misgivings about the procedural generation as I would rather see memorable tracks, but I think my issues with the handling were a large part of my dislike of that.The game still has a way to go, but that's what early access is for. And based on the way the developer handles criticism, I can't help but trust they'll make this game great.So, I admit it; I was wrong. If you're a fan of Road Rash, this IS the game for you.==OLD REVIEW==As much as I want to love this game, after playing it for a few hours I find myself increasingly bored. The procedural generation makes the tracks completely non-sensical and bland, the combat is only occasionally engaging, and the driving itself is completely unsatisfying.Levels like the races on rooftops and the races with cars falling from the sky seem like the result of a 14-year-old saying ""Oh man, you know what would be AWESOME?"" with no regard to actually making it play well.I've been coming back to this after each update and at this point it's clear to me that the flaws to this game run so deep that there's no real way to fix them.If you buy this, don't expect a ""deep, satisfying 10-15 hour experience"" but a shallow and aimless 2 hour playthrough after which you'll be left wanting so, so much more.

								The gameplay actually has some good mechanics to it that make you feel in control of what is going on, which allows you to get better instead of get lucky. The idea of losing your items and cash when dying, but not your unlocked skills is really interesting.Now, as an early access game, here are some bugs/issues that I think the devs should glance at:-The graphics leave something to be desired though, such as unity's new soft shadows and maybe even actual PBR.-You can grapple a dead biker's unmanned bike. I discovered this because my push to talk button on teamspeak is the same as the grapple button.-You can easily exploit the ""place me on track"" button as it only removes your health and doesnt make you wait for the 5 seconds that crashing normally would. I think this button should emulate you crashing your bike instead.-General optimization issues, I get the same framerate on lowest graphics that I do on highest.-When starting the game with the music turned all the way down, some strange piano song plays and then suddenly cuts out.-Additionally, when starting the game it gets stuck on a light blue screen (similar to the color you see on the background of the unity logo), maybe this could be changed to show a loading image instead?-When switching out weapons at the beginning of the mission, it would be useful to see the durability of my current weapons.-Having a borderless windowed mode would be neat-The road is too visually flat, you can tell by the specularity from the sun-I think that there should be a bit of a minimap, similar to what you already get when racing, on all modes so you can tell whether you should back up or keep going if your goal is to kill cops/bikers.-When I saw the word ""procedural"", I imagined endless races that would randomly change, which I didn't get. Not too bad, but an endurance mode would be interesting with impromptu races and objectives.-Additionally with the procedural stuff, I feel theres not enough variation with each ""biome"". Maybe add more buildings? Some decals on the road?Either way, it's a great game, has some real solid gameplay to it, and worth the buy if you like fast paced racing games.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a lot of fun. especially for one still in early access. If you are a fan of the Road Rash games, then this is for you. There were a few concerns when i started playing, like the addition of guns. You'd think theyd be highly overpowered amd overused, but it's actually quite balanced. Try aiming the camera sideways and not driving into a car or off a cliff. Even at distance, it's difficult to get a shot further than maybe 40 ft. There's also a rather unique Harpoon gun that can be used to spear opponents or, if you're crafty, launch it into a wall or the ground to slingshot yourself. Think Spiderman on rooftop levels.One bit of frustration I came across were some of the bugs. There was one in particular where, if you hit something while turning at high speed, it would just turn you in the wrong direction. In a race/ timed event, that's devastating. There is another where, when striking an opponent, your weapon simply passes through without damaging. The last one I can think of tends to happen on the rooftop races. Your bike will slow or stop the moment it's about to go airborne, or as it lands.Overall this is a lot of fun to play. The campaign mode is short at 12 levels, but it's harder than it looks to make it to the end. There are few level backdrops at, I think, 4. I look forward to seeing more out of this and maybe another couple of modes added on.			"

Early Access Review
								This game initially caught my eye months ago, but I thought the then price of $30 was a tad too steep for me to buy in. So I waited, and I finally grabbed this game on a flash sale. Seriously, I kinda feel bad. I feel like I cheated the devs. Firstly, this game gets frequent updates. In the less than a week I've owned the game, it's gotten 3 or 4 minor bug fixes. Secondly, the core gameplay is fantastic. I never played the original Road Rash but it must've been phenominal. Graphics are meh. and right now optimization is awful, but considering that the devs are clearly working on the game and also care about the community, I think this will make it out of EE and be a true success story.Get this at full price. If you can grab it on sale all the more power to you but it's worth the $20. Did I mention split screen support?			"

								DO NOT PLAY WITH A KEYBOARD! If you want to truly have fun playing this game, you'll need a controller.This game is so much fun! The game can be a little difficult and frustrating at times, but even when you do die, progress is made because you can still level up your character. Whether you've played the old game Road Rash or not, this game is really easy to learn and pick up and play. Don't expect any story (yet?) but do expect to have a lot of fun smacking people with weapons and slamming them into cars and kicking them off cliffs! The game allows you to be as brutal as you can be and allows you to use your imagination a little.Pros:- Pick up and play- Fun combat- Fun racing- Hilarious ways to kill and die- Progress after death- Future online multiplayerCons:- Poor local multiplayer (enemies don't seem to spawn behind players, so whichever player is ahead is the only one who has fun)- Controls can be a little tricky/awkward- Small vehicle/driver selection (but is expanding)- Might be repetetive so some people?- Odd bugs (to be expected, however, since this is Early Access)9/10 for simply being a fun game to play. Looking forward to updates and added content!			"

								I say this with a heavy heart, if you buy this for Road  Rash nostalgia you should not get this game. So far they have minimal similarities to road rash - you have bikes and you hit other bikes. Thats about it. If you want it for the OTT racing get it, but do not get it for Road Rash nostalgia because this game is nowhere near it.			"

								I initially fell in love with this game. Like most others who have purchased it I compare it to the old Road Rash games. It's a great concept, feels good to play, and is a lot of fun in short periods. The problem, at least for now however, is the lack of content and depth. Sure you have the skills/perks to upgrade, but it seems to happen far too quickly. Maybe the solution to this would be to incorporate certain perks/skills that can only be unlocked on the more difficult bikes. It'd certainly give me a reason to attempt to play through the game on the more difficult bikes. It would also be cool to be able to upgrade bikes/purchase new bikes if implemented correctly.Also the number of tracks/environments seems quite stale. I know it's Early Access and this will hopefully improve with time. If things were my way I would have a track selection (See Road Rash 3 on Sega Genesis) instead of working up a ladder of random tracks. That being said the concept of having a random course for each track is cool. Multiplayer isn't really an issue for me, however a lot of the reviews and people I've talked to would have enjoyed it.Overall if you're looking for a bit of fun with combat racing, or want something similar to the old Road Rash series definitely check this out. Just don't expect something that will last in its current form, as unfortunate as it is to say this.TL:DR - It's a great game, although very light on content, and rough around the edges.			"

								Just watch the video and see what you can do. Doesn't that carnage, that sheer violence you can wreak on fellow racers look satisfying?I know nothing about Road Rash. I only know that this game makes pounding and shooting other bikers fun. The racing is a nothing, the front end is ugly as sin, the game design is an attempt to marry per-game style shopping for bonuses with modern indie roguelike persistent levelling buys. I don't think that element will work well in the long run but this isn't a game you play because it is a piece of solid design. You play right now for the wonderfully realized brutal fun of clubbing other bikers.It's ugly, it's wonky, not everything fits together right and may never will, but dangit, they got the feel of motorcycle racing violence right. The actual mechanic that will give you value on your dollar has received all of their attention and it shows all of that love.Watch the video, trust me. That's the best aid you're going to get for your buying decision.			"

								An early access game I've been with since the beginning thats shaping up really nicely, its a modern take on the old 'Road Rash' series which is a ton of fun to play.The game does still have a few bugs in it (nothing major though) but the developers are constantly updating the game and are very active in the game discussion forum which is great to see also.Gameplay wise the game is loads of fun, whacking your opponent with a bat or kicking them into the path of an oncoming car is very satisfying. There's not much in the way of modes or bike options yet although the developers have promised more of these will added and there's enough already there to warrant buying the game as it stands.My only gripe with the game so far is the 'car rain' levels, where, exactly as it says on the tin, cars drop from the sky in droves and bounce all around causing you to constantly and unfairly crash. As it stands its pure dumb luck that gets you through these unscathed and it would be better suited added to some kind of extra mode and removed from the main campaign in my opinion.All in all this is a fantastic game with lots more improvements and content to come, I highly recommend you buy it.

								Road RedemptionMay I start by saying that I loved playing Road Rash back in the day on the Sega Genesis? This game brings back memories of that time, but while being quite different. This game was obviously heavily inspired by Road Rash, and even has some of the same developers working on it. The gameplay is quite identical but with a few key differences.1. There are guns in the game. These are quite powerfull and fun to use.2. The bikes can have jetpacks and grappling hooks on some levels.3. Some levels are spent racing on rooftops. - Some people love this, some hate it.4. There are even crazy levels with cars raining down from the sky.This game doesn't take itself seriously at all. And can get quite wacky at times, but I love it.The game is quite short, you can beat it in about an hour. Though it has quite a bit of replay value.So don't think of that as the end of it.This game is early access, so be warned, it will change. And it doesn't always run perfectly.			"

Graphics are ok, nothing amazing, but it fits the game as it's a bit more laid back.Hoping for a good online co-op experience when it drops, more bikes, more riders or being able to customise a character of your own would be nice too.

The developments so far since buying this have been nice, just waiting for the multiplayer portion now.-----------------------This a great game much like an old sega version.  Great alternative to GTA if you just want a senseless game to drive around and beat on people.  The Shovel Knight is pretty funny.			"

								A definate homage to the original Sega MegaDrive classic Road-Rash. So far this game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing addictive and always have a sense of pleasure by taking out a cop or biker with a fine range of weapons such as bats, swords, shotguns etc teamed with plenty of perks such as health regen, extra health, Nitro, bullets etc. When you officially run out of health is game over but your experience carries on to the next go. Works just fine on the X360 pad with slight confusing controls as sometimes in a rush you will hit left instead of right and aiming a gun can be very attention drawing.Its still EA obviously so it does have some bad points such as cars sticking to you and pushing you back, respawing just be to struck by another car. Theres no quit button so have to Alt-F4 it (doesnt affect save) It does take a reasonable amount of RAM so I would recommend 8GB for smoother gameplay. Frames can drop dramatically when a lot of collisions and debry is flying about especially on the 'Raining Cars' stages. Another bad point is the lack of time it takes to get some stages done, some can be finished in less than 50secs depending on its goal.			"

								This is a must have for any old 'Road Rash' fans. Despite it being in early access and only having just a few levels, it's still amazing fun to play and even more fun with friends.It has a few bugs and glitches, but such things are to be expected in early access.The game itself is based off of a campaign mode (and future planned multiplayer mode) wherein the player races through x many tracks, including lonely desert roads, rocky tall mountains, arctic glaciers and even on top of skyscrapers. Carmageddon vibes anyone?Game plays very simply and with the right set of skills and reflexes it's a little bit too easy to beat at the moment, but that still shouldn't stop anyone from grinding their skillsets up to increase stats such as health and strength etc.Not convinced? Go on youtube and find some very popular lets players playing this to convince you of how awesome and overkill this game is.			"

								RR is not the old road rash , but it could be , and even better . it is fun , but it needs more work ,  it's in the  first stage , controls  , screens are a little buggy and very short tracks , needs longer tracks ,   screen interactions and screen navagation needs work . If the developers stick with it and add lenght to tracks , tweak controls and screen navagation , add new ideas , tunnels,  water hazards , cross roads , burning bikes and cars/ trucks that can catch your bike on fire if you get too close , pedestrians cows , ect.. crossing the road  , don't like missions where you can only kick , tuning your bike should be by engine , brakes , tires . ect , not trading models . this could be the start of a new series not a one shot game . I'll be here for the ride . good luck to devs , maybe every will send their ideas to them , making a great game  6.5 of 10 right now			"

								This game is pretty fun and I would pay 20 dollars for this game. It has plenty of upgrades and if you don't watch carefully you could die very quick. I am proud that the developers made this game. After seeing Ride to hell retribution come out I lost all hope in motorcycling games but this game is fun, fast- paced and once competitive multiplayer comes out then your friends can yell at you for winning.

								The game flat out right now I would give it a 7/10, recommended.  I will start out by saying the games graphics are really sick, you can even change the graphics to the old school look of road rash. Speaking of which, this games seems to be a complete reboot of the great game road rash that was on the N64. It is very simple, beat the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone around you, dont crash, and continue to go the right direction. I will start out by saying the graphics are beautiful, for the money I paid. The gameplay has a few glitches, but the chaos of other bikers and raining of cars was a lot of fun. Broad choice of weapons and upgrades is a plus, as well as getting a few of the characters to play as.Now, the few things that I have to complain about... I found a few glitches of my character dancing around on his bike and was not able to continue on the track to place, well, anything. The sword so far in the game has made it where I can not attack.. the skills are very easy to max out as well. I would enjoy to see online game play for this, a whole lot more of the bikes as well as characters and maps. This game has a lot of potential in it, I know its in Beta. I am looking forward to the overall outcome of this game! Overall, I recommend the game despite all the frustrating glitches. 7/10 is my review. Try it out yourself, its cheap as hell right now from these steam sales.			"

								Oh my god. This game controls like garbage.Now, hear me out. The gripping between the motorcycle and the road (even at its highest level) feels like the ice levels of Mario brothers. I keep sliding all over the place, which wouldnt be so bad if you weren't going so fast in the game.It has a system set up where you can duke it out with the other racers, but the map flies past you so fast that if you take your eyes off the road for even a second, you will either fall off the side, crash into a car, or crash into an obstacle.The races are so broken. Again, everything goes so fast that if you crash once, you are right back to last place, even if you were in the top 3 places. And don't worry, you're bound to crash into something, or better yet, an oncoming car will go into your lane and crash into you.For some reason you stick to everything you touch. Appearently everything, from the cars to buildings, are drenched in super glue, which means that everytime you hit something, you have to come to a complete stop and reverse to unhook yourself. I've even had a few times where I took out an opponent and the unmaned vehicle drifted in front of me, stuck to me, and caused me either to crash, or have to come to a complete stop and reverse to get out. (If this is not a problem that you are experienceing then it just might be me for some reason and you can disregard this point)Even if you DO see something coming your way, everything is moving so fast that you have little to no time to react, which means that you crash anyway.Say what you will about Burnout games, at least they made it so that you can go a fraction of a second looking at a spot on the screen, other than directly ahead, and not instantly die.

								I was big on Road Rash growing up, including always taking the OP chain from Buffy. The bikes handle a lot better from its alpha stage and the dificulty is there like anyother good racer. I was wondering if the PC racing genre was dead from the free to play market, but this game is amasterpiece, the graphics are great and the weapon varity is  if there wasnt gun added to the mix and i know the devs wont take it out even if people complain but atleast lower the ammo capacity for fairness when the online update comes out.

I only hope it gets crazier. more crazy weather, longer races, where are the cows?, i wanna drive the semi, more of everything. save the grapple, make it a weapon. i want to drag a racer behind my bike. the developers are doing a great job. keep it up.  they do care about your experience, that much is evident to anyone that has beat the game. I talked to Ian at 130 in the morning my time. sorry about that.  he asked me about my time with the game and wanted to know my thoughts. I have never had the happen before. I can not wait for the next update. Looking forward to the finished project and any future projects.			"

								Road redemption is instantly fun. It has the core gameplay of Road Rash, though it could use a little polish in that area. Little things like holding back to do a wheelie and jump cars would really round out the feel of this game. However, the game truely shines when it comes to campaign advancement. You earn cash for races and spend it on upgrades for your current life. You earn XP that can only be spent after you die on permanent upgrades. Each race is a random objective, random environment status and random course. Ultimately you are trying to reach the final race without losing all your health. Combined this feels like a racing game I can keep coming back to for as many hours as I put in to FTL.What I still want: More polish (graphics and performance.) Improve the UI/add a tutorial (did you know you boost by double-tapping the gas pedal? I only found out through experimentation.) More maps. More Bikes. I would say more weapons, but there are already a plethora and they all feel interesting.Why you should buy this right now: Lever action slug shooting shotgun that you reload terminator-style			"

								I am giving this a thumbs up in the hopes that it evolves into something great. I was a huge fan of the Road Rash games and played each one on the Sega Genesis (1, 2 and 3) and I am hoping this game will pick up where they left off. Unfortunately this game is definitely as advertised and is not anywhere near complete. Things that need improved: The ability to freeride and explore. There is no point in procedural generation if you just set a cliff 20 bike lengths away from the road that leads to instant death when I approach. Bikes + Individual Parts to upgrade - this is by far the most shocking thing not yet implemented. Even Road Rash 1 had multiple bikes. RoadRedemption has a little upgrade meter but there is no info given. I am going to assume this a major placeholder while they tweek the bikes. Character customization: again shocking its not available even in early builds. They added a flaming pumpkin head which no one asked for but there is still no way to add a long flowing mullet to my character Framerate - even set to the lowest setting (which doesn't even render the yellow lines properly) the framerate drops like a rock when there is a car wreck, cops, and multiple NPCs on screen. If I am able to play AAA games like FC3, AssCreed3, etc. at moderate settings without a problem I should be able to play this at low settings at at least 15 fps. ...and much much more. I figured all this out in about 20 minutes. I hope the devs are working hard and make this a true sequel.			"

								Oh my gosh this game is the stuff of legend. It's super early access as of writing this, and I already love it. The controls are tight and solid as a rock. The combat, while not as hard-hitting as Road Rash, is still implimented well enough to be vastly more entertaining that it should be. The tracks are all varied enough to keep my attention throughout, especially the current final track, that track may just be one of the best things to ever grace this genre.The thing that really gets me, on top of all the amazing gameplay, is the music. The music in this game is a step or two beyond phenominal. Even when cars come flying out of the air and send me on some sort of rocket ride to death-ville, I can't be even mildly upset, the tunes are just too good.With the promise of online play, this game can only get better and better. A rogue-lite, motorcycle racing combat game. That's just a beautiful combo right there.			"

If you see it on sale, it might be worth a buy, but other than that I'd steer clear.			"

If, like me, you were a big fan of the Road Rash games back in the 90's, then this game is for you. The graphics, physics, and sounds are quite subpar when compared to other modern games thou. It is clearly a low budget project. Also, controls are good with Xbox One gamepad. I recommend it, but only to RR fans seeking a new experience in the same spirit of the classic franshise.			"

								Where do i begin! This game is a ton of fun and it's quite a blast of immersive beating and driving combined, and don't be disappointed to begin with either, you do get guns and explosives to have fun with. It is quite good considering it's in the early stages of development, and it has alot of potential.The graphics are very decent if you play on ''Fantastic'' and you will not regret your purchase! It does remind me of back in the day where games such as ''Downhill'' and so. So it brings back good times. Been looking for a game like this, really missed it.So i'd happily give this an early-on score of 7,5/10.			"

								This game is the Road Rash style game we've all been waiting for.  A lot of fun.  If I were to say that something is lacking then it would be in the voice-over sound department.  I feel like the game should have more screams, oofs, cops asking you to pull over, and etc.  I especially loved the long, deep scream that the Road Rash protagonist would give out on a particularly hard crash.  Also, I feel as if the crashes would  be better if the rider didn't necessarily fly so far from the bike so that there was a more natural feel.  All in all, the game is great so if you're on the fence then I would suggest getting it.			"

								I voted this into greenlight because I wanted a modern Road Rash 64 with online netplay, this has so far delivered the modern Road Rash 64 experience. So if you liked Road Rash 64, this is pretty much the same game with even more features and crazy levels. The only thing it's really missing is the online netplay, which is hopefully added later since this is still early access.			"

Early Access Review
								So this game is just in early access, but I have some great things to say about it.Things that work well:The actual combat. Road Rash always felt a bit sluggish, and given its' timing, rightly so. Road Redemption, however, feels really satisfying to play. The controller controls are a little awkward but take almost no time to warm up to - think ~3 hour learning curve, tops. The collision physics are also awesome. The maps, though fairly basic so far, offer some really great variety.Things that suck:The ragdolls need some help, but at least they have some (the developers could have probably left them out for now and gotten a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥ so at least they added some). The jump physics are pretty awkward - you can spin your guy left and right, more or less totally free, but you can't tilt vertically (think in GTA games, you can't go off a jump expecting to stay straight, so you turn your car/motorcycle to compensate landing). The weapon variety could be a bit better - shooting while driving is tough. The ""drift"" or ""accurate turn"" left-trigger is also kinda odd. It doesn't really brake the bike, it just slows it and lets you turn sharply. I know obviously a game all about beating dudes up on other bikes isn't going to focus on realism, but the driving should feel natural. As it is now, it feels a little off - not terribly so but just kinda odd. The grappling hook is ♥♥♥♥ed on those roof maps, I can't use it well for the life of me.Get this game if you liked Road Rash, or if you think this♥♥♥♥♥♥looks interesting. It's really fun and worth a try.			"

								As it is now, the game is just boring. It seems like the devs had no vision, no plan...like most EA game this one will probably die a slow death soon.If the devs can pull their fingers outta there butt, my review might change but for now it isn't even worth it.Even with the upcoming update apparently in the work, I still predict that this game will be vaporware....after all, you can't polish a turd and this game is destined for failure.And now comes an overzealous...foaming at the mouth...mad as hell...blind moderator that banned me for stating facts and nothing else. I never insulted anyone only saying that these devs are clueless and lazy which is true and got banned lol. This game is dead already. The forum dead also. This is a good sign of vaporware when no one post on a game forum. All this time Mr. Moderator continues trolling the forum looking for a prey. Just don't buy into this crap.Update;March 10, 2017. After waiting for 5 months we got a Beta update this morning and it wasn't worth waiting 5 months for what could have been done in a week if these devs had talent (something they obviously lack)So just forget about this pretending motorcycle game. It will never be sucessfull and is dead as of today and will remain dead. Most people just got bored of the devs doing nothing for 3 years and moved along.			"

However this is ruined by the short ""rouge light"" style missions that have you doing something short then the missions over there was no race.  then they throw in some unfun stuff like ramping across building tops.could have been a solid road rash reboot.this game despterately need to a race cuircuit and vast selection of bikes and upgrades to work on like road rash...without...its just a tease.

								5/10I wanted to like this game...err did I?...in fact I may have been looking for an entirely different game altogether. Let me explain. I'm an older gamer (40) that remembers the original Road Rash games on the Sega Genesis. Back in the day, I loved these original bike beaters, and when I saw this - a blatant copy (or maybe homage?) of the original series, I just had to have it. Note to self : DON'T BUY GAMES WHEN YOU ARE DRINKING!The graphics are just okay in this game, but the gameplay itself is very limited and doesn't have that much replay value. I think I could pop in the old games on the sega (*If i had one)  and have more fun. I didn't ask for my money back, as firstly, I do like to support indie developers and secondly, I didn't want to admit I had made a drunken blunder and purchased this crappy game... (Sorry Mr. Developer- but for my $12, I DO get to call it crappy).			"

								So, there I am. Waiting for the game to be installed, waiting for the final verdict. Is this a true Road Rash successor or a failed attempt? I saw the reviews getting better and better. So there was hope....But alas the hope was in vain…. This is by no means a true successor to Road Rash. Not by far….It is not a bad game per se, but it’s not good either. It needs more depth. The gameplay is shallow, I miss the feeling and handling from the old arcade racer. I know, strange, it was an arcade racer, yet Road Redemption feels arcade and Road Rash a sim in comparison.this is about beating, but the somehow forgot a bit about racing and real pacing and position within the race… Anyways, I stopped after playing for half an hour of the same, more of the same, some more of the same, but without the golden olden magic…. Could be this can grow to become good, since I have no idea from where the development comes…. I can give it to the developer, the did capture the vibe, now they also need to add the soul…. "

This game feels like a true ripoff riding on a great game that was done so much better all those years ago, it truley in no way whatsoever feels like Road Rash so dont let the motorcycle combat fool you into buying this game, tired old same animation on all weapons and the same goes for the crashes. As you can see by the playtime it didnt take me long to realize how id been fooled, This will never be the SEGA title i once loved, just a cheap cheap cheap wannabe knockoff of an insult....shame on you developer			"

								Update (12-28-2014):  All the performance problems have been solved at the ""Beautiful"" setting.  It is somewhat playable on ""Fantastic"" even though the frames do dip.Notes: I have beat the game 12 times, gotten 12 of the achievements, and played on the most recent update (12-28-2014).  Reviewed on 3.5GHz i7 with 8GB RAM and a GeForce GTX 980, using the Xbox One game pad.This game was billed as a next gen Road Rash on Kickstrarter when I backed it back in May of 2013.  I received my steam key on September 18 2014.  I have played about 13 hours so far and I have to say I’m disappointed.  I hate to say it because I believe game developers are hardworking people and I understand it’s hard to create something and even harder to figure out what people (gamers) want.  If what is currently available is their vision for the game I wish them nothing but luck but it’s simply not for me.  The way the game works is you get cash, which converts into XP, for races and killing cops, enemy vehicles, and other bikers.- Even though it say it has random terrain generation I have seen the same road ways over and over to the point where I can tell when the finish line is coming without looking at the race progress bar.- The rainbow road and roof top levels should be hidden bonus levels at best.- Cars falling from the sky for some reason when you’re racing.  They updated this by calling it a ""chemical hallucination zone"" but it doesn't change the fact that it doesn't make sense.- Civilian cars going against traffic for no reason.- All melee weapons sound the same.  Even though that one sound is very satisfying.- Doesn’t feel like you’re in a gang.- Needs more melee weapons like a chain, Nunchaku, and maybe a whip?To me this is very unfortunate because when silly things, like cars falling from the sky, are not happening it does feel a a little like Road Rash.  I can’t imagine why instead of roof top they didn’t make levels based on real road ways.  It’s very scenic in some section of highway here in the US and this could have been imitated to great success. To the games credit there are some good thing like:+ The driving feels okay.+ The melee combat feels good.+ Some of the music is okay.Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game to somebody looking for something like Road Rash.

								Well this game has riding a motorcycle, being able to hit other motorcyclists with weapons and being able to kick other motorcyclists. The similarities between this game and the old road rash games ends there. If you're looking for an actual modern road rash this is probably not your game, if you just want to hit people with things while riding a motorcycle you may like it.Performance is bad.Controls are not very good.The sound and music levels are off. Sound track doesn't really work with the gameplay. Sound effects sound like canned effects you could get for cheap off the net.Level design is bad to horrible. Why is there traffic driving on roofs going off the ledges like lemmings?, why make a grappling hook level when it's not interesting to use or fun. In some levels both lanes are head on traffic. What's with the tornado level, the level barely looks changed and all the level accomplishes is showing off how unoptomized the game is and creates frustrating no win situations. Are the random bombs in some levels adding that much to the game? It seems like a lot of stuff has been thrown in to be like ""look how crazy we are!!"". The core racing portion of the game is unsatisfying, it seems this game is more about hitting people with weapons.Enemies go from your standard motorcycle games to armored humvees. The car enemies in this game are the perfect anti fun!The upgrade system could have been interesting but the options are a little boring. More health, more ammo, more that stat, more this stat. Basicaly the same thing you will see in so many flash based upgrade games or rogue type games.			"

								Being a fan of the original Road Rash on Playstation, I thought I'd give this a go. O.K., the gameplay is not too bad, but OMG!!!, the Graphics are pretty rubbish. If this game was on sale at £1.99, it's worth it, but at full price, it really is a Crapfest. Avoid this one, unless you are desperate.			"

								This game is entertaining, but in all reality, I don't like it.I guess that, before they updated it, it waaaas, fun? Yeah, I have seen gameplay, now, you have very few lives, and beating the game is highly unattainable. Not to mention, the last few levels, or at least the ones that include car storm, are the most fun.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game when it was understood to support multiplayer support. Multiplayer support means, at a minimum, over LAN or even better Internet. Local co-op sucks. I don't want my kids, wife, or anyone else using my gaming rig (I bought them all their own computers for a reason).Now that this game is headed to leave early access and Road Redemption Store Page shows only local co-op and single player  so I decided to write my reivew. Store Page does mention ""Online mode coming very soon. "" I'll revise my review after that option is supported.The game has zero replay value to me, friends, and family. I'm glad I only bought two copies (wife and I) that we both played for about 5 hours. I have already maxed out every option.Without true multiplayer this game is worth about $1. My friends and other 4 family members will not be buying copies.If this game adds multiplayer, then I'd buy 4 copies plus recommend to 4 to 6 friends who wait for me to recommend multiplaer games we'd play on weekends.

								Refunded it. Its no where near as fun as it looks in the videos. The most difficult aspect of the game, you'd think would be enemies and challenges. Nope. Its just staying on the track. The ""best"" starting bike with the most grip just slides all over the place and when it says to brake to drift and make tight corners, it automatically does it too far and it just slows me down to a point where its faster to just go outside the track. So every track boiled down to me just focusing on staying on the track and spamming kick when enemies got close. No need to even try to hit them with something. Also, trying to shoot guns in this game using a controller is just beyond clunky. Its useless. And dont even get me started on that broken rooftop stage.			"

								When I first reveiwed this, it was in a very crude state. Its has come along was since I bought this. The graphics are much clearer. There are still a few annoying bugs, but these guys are really showing a lot of effort in this title. This is the closest thing we have to the old classic Sega Genisis game known as Road Rash. At this point it is in many ways better. I only bought this for the nostalgia of a childhood favorite. After testing it again today for the first time in a while, I am certain i will be playing this again. If you missed Road Rash, then this is a blast from the past.Its not exactly like Road Rash, it has some things you may or may not like, but over all its a good simple game.			"

								Second Edit: This game does not present itself well. The first hour is not very good. The starting areas are ugly and you start out with mostly combat, hardly racing at all. After an hour or so the environments get prettier and you can actually do some 'racing'.It's not exactly Road Rash either (I've got the Genesis version right here, and still play it), and the Kickstarter backers assuring you of that (and voting this down) are full of crap.  There's not enough racing for that, too much combat.Good stuff: The soundtrack is great. The combat is meaty and it's quite satisfying to take someone out. I do like the weapons (C4, boom!). The mission structure is interesting - it's basically a roguelike where you gain money from stage to stage and buy upgrades, but lose that all when you die. But then you can use your earned XP on permanent upgrades.  It gets prettier and less 100% combat after an hour or two.Biggest issues left: As noted, the first hour is crap and this needs a much better out of box experience. The physics are wonky as hell, pure 90s, which is fine for Road Rash, but then they pair it with a rooftop level that sticks bamboo slivers under the fingers of the wonky physics.  Also, the steering is still far too tuned for combat. You can't go off the road unless you're not paying attention, which makes the driving bit kind of boring.BUT The devs seem to have fixed the worst thing, which was a 180 degree camera rotation if you used the fast turn.  I'd switch from No to Neutral if Steam would let me. And I haven't asked for a refund yet.			"

The developer gave me a review copy - thank you to them, for that.Lets get one thing straight - this is a direct clone of Road Rash. It is also wayyyy too expensive for what it will end up being. But with that being said, its fun. There are permanent and run-based upgrades. There are different bikes with different attributes. There are different riders (Shovel Knight makes an appearance). There is night and day and different maps. Lots of different weapons, including guns.Pros:+As many flaws as this has, it is fun to cruise around and crank people with a tire iron+Music is actually goodCons:-Way too expensive, so get it on a deep discount-Physics is way wonky, it could use some more realism - like how I can fly off the road and fall into a valley and then super jump back on the road lolz-Graphics are super generic. Not sure if they are premade assets or what-Loading screens are bad, and remind me of PS1-Menus are clunkyIt is fun, but get it on a sale. "

								I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  Even though it is still Early Release Beta,  the game is incredible.  The graphics great, the fluidity of the physics and the AI makes the game fun to play.    If you come into the game thinking you will be mastering and making it to the end of every race without crashing, you are going to be disappointed.    A good chunk of the fun is watching the AI come up next to you, and somehow knowing  the perfect time to kick you off the side of the bridge or into oncoming traffic.  Reckoning back to this games inspiration, Road Redemption makes me laugh out loud at some of the crashes your rider goes through.   The multitude of weapons you can acquire adds to the fun.  A very entertaining piece of work.    Multiple thumbs up!			"

								First you think: ""Yay! A Road Rash follow-up!"". Then it's fun for a few races until you realize how the game mechanics work. Opponents will never go full speed as long as you are behind them. Try overtaking someone they will immidiately blast up to full speed trying to knock you off your bike. It becomes too predictable in the long run. The best tactic is to stay behind the pack until halfway then try to use your nitro wisely and speed past everyone and avoid getting killed (which doesn't work very well either). Try to engage in a fight while going fast you will almost always end up crashing with an obstacle or finding yourself fighting with five other bikers you just overtook. I understand the game isn't meant to be realistic. But compared to Road Rash, this is just trash. All in all, good idea, poor execution. I don't think this game has any potential because the flaws are already too many. Total waste of money.			"

I start the story mode the intro was 68-69fps, but when the game started it dropped to 24 during the first 2 stages and when i got to the 3rd stage and my fps dropped to 5. pretty much unplayable at that point. I'm only saying I ran this game just fine before and ever since the recent updates It does not run well for me. Acording the the specs I should be able to run this at 60fps no problem, if the recommended requirements have changed, then that section should be updated. I really enjoyed this game when I could play it. And for that I cannot give this  positive review until these matters are addressed.			"

As I don't feel like buying a 50$  Xbox controller just to play this game, and playing a racing game with Mouse&Keyboard is not fun, I have yet to (hopefully) enjoy playing Road Redemption. Is there a way to make this game a little bit more open minded with choice of controllers ?  "

								If this is supposed to be road rash then I suggest the developers start again. this game is so far from being fun. it has alot of ""crazy"" random events which doesn't really mask the shallow unchallenging gameplay, shoddy controlls and cheap ugly interface. I'm a huge fan of the original road rash games and I really wanted to like this. hell If the made a HD remake of road rash 2 I would buy that but this game is awful. the structure of the game is perhaps the worst thing about it. it's set out: win this race and continue or lose, spend you won points on stats and start from the beginning. This is not how to structure a racing/combat game. This is how to structure a rogue like dungeon crawler. The menu's and artwork are really bad they look like original doom/wolfenstein era menus only much less proffessional. If that hadn't tipped me off that perhaps this wasn't the game I thought I was buying then there's the handling which is sloppy and unwieldy but the price is the biggest insult of all. If this game were a shoddy road rage clone it might be worth the price to fans like myself but this game is lacking that (amongst many other things) which made road rash so memorable...fun			"

								This game is not new road rash. Road Rash was fun. This game is frustrating- bots in this game are really annoying. They always attack player and don't pay attention to each other, they never crash into the traffic and can evade cars in impossible situations, some of them even unbeatable with weapon and you can't push them off the road (somehow they are able to return to track even if you push them off the roof), they slow down when you behind them and get incredible speed boost as soon as you pass them even if you use nitro- there is no point to win race or complete missions. You just have to survive- tracks are boring- no bike upgrades- when you lose all your health - you must start from the beginning. Again. Also you lose all you money and upgrades- soundtrack sucksBut I believe multiplayer will be fun.			"

								Road Redemption is vicious and sick. Like the old days of Road Rash with a big upgrade in violence. Feels good to be bad in this game.New map/road everytime you play, diferent bikes to choose, outfits, store to buy powerups, weapons and an awesome rpg system . No more spoilers.  It's an EA game but even at this point, it offers plenty of content and features though.Whoever likes racing , action games  and a bit of rpg... You've all in one here.			"

								I wish this game was better. I supported it, backed it on kickstarter, shared it with friends. The developers promised a Road Rash revival back in 2013 with a projected release date of aug 2014 for xbox 360, WiiU, and PC. What this game has become is a true disappointment. They developers have completely abandoned the xbox 360 and WiiU ports which they had specific backer tiers for on kickstarter with hundreds of backers. I have spoken to devs who have just let that fact stay quiet even while fully admitting privately that those ports are no longer possible. However despite the questionable ethics involving the kickstarter the game is still in rough shape in its existing form. This is not the Road Rash revival that you were hoping for. The game feels off, bikes feel like they are floating around on the road, there is no sense of impact or weight. The game is played entirely with weapons, there isnt even an option to throw punches against other riders, and ever rider is equiped with weapons. The ""races"" are full of endless spawned bikers that have no effect on the standing of the race. The rooftop races are a total disaster with bugs that will have you endlessly falling with no way to stop but quiting the race entirely, losing your progress. on top of the extremely mediocre execution of what should have been simple game mechanics the visuals do nothing to pick up the slack. I play the game on the highest possible settings and it is still pretty unimpressive, even for an early access game.to summarize this game is mediocre at best, and doesnt look like at has much hope of leaving early access. Its been almost a year since the projected release date and they do not even have this game functioning in online multiplayer, or have a finished single player campaign. I had originally written a less harsh review for this game, because I was still under the delusion that things would get better, but after closely looking over the timeline and having an extensive talk with one of the devs Ive decided to give up the ghost on this one. Maybe someday someone will fulfill on what this game promised... but I dont see that happening with Road Redemption. Buyer Beware.			"

								What's good about this is that's it's an interesting diversion, albeit one that's fun for only a few minutes. Gets quite annoying after that. Unless you're on the development team with access to god mode, apparently.What's not good:No Free Roam. Players need a way to just explore and try different stunts without having to deal with such an annoying campaign.Traffic randomly crossing the centerline and insta-killing a player.As noted above, no sign of procedural generation.Ramming the rear of a vehicle usually results in the camera being moved to where the player can't see where he's going.Crash detection needs lots of work. For example: player rides, and sinks, through some rock formations whereas others wipe him out by virtue of him just being nearby.No way of knowing where rivals and police are unless they happen to be in the player's field of view. Why no on screen map for this?Less than a minute to take down three rival riders on a twisty road without using weapons? Really?Whose bright idea was it to map Kick to B and Attack Right to Y? Shouldn't that be the other way 'round? Attack Left is X, one would expect Attack Right to be directly opposite at B!Why is there no mention of RB also being for Shoot Gun? Is there any way to aim a gun other than straight ahead?			"

								I was a huge fan of this game until the recent update. That's right... it was updated. They didn't even bother telling anyone on the steam page this occured.  Notifying the fans who gave this game glowing reviews might have been on the list of priorities I think.  But, I digress -  I played the game about 25 minutes into this new update.  Some things I like, some major things I dislike.  Things I like: Graphics are sharper and more vibrant.No immediate problems with stabilityMy biker seemed to respond  better to my inputpick ups on track are  a neat additionThings I dislike:You threw your Wii U Kickstarter supporters under the bus with this update. Not cool. I don't care if there were only 2.Biker selection. What happened to the garage?My biker seemed to respond better to my input. Yes, I listed this as a both a positive and a negative.  The more responsive play control also made the game easier. Take kicking, for example. Before this update, I found kicking awkward and difficult to use. If I missed, I often ended up the victim, plunging to my death after my mometum carried me into a ravine. After this update, I was kicking dudes all over the track.  They were helpess against my size 13 boot to the face. I think on one track I killed everyone by kicking them. Even if weapons didn't degrade, there's no reason to use them.  Oh, wait....No more weapon degradation. I swear to God almighty I thought this was a bug when I first booted up. This is a HUGE change to a major gameplay mechanic. I'm going to elaborate on this a bit, so bear with me. Not sure who's idea it was to change this, but it was a stupid idea.  I assume it's the guy who leaves his phone number at the end of play sessions.  How or why this change made it through the development processes is anyone's guess, but it altered the entire game in a bad way and falls into that ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" category.  Here's one example of what it effects: the game has 50 or more weapons. You won't use a third of this content in a playthrough because there's no reason to get rid of good weapons you pick up. Not only did this kill some of the variety in a game that could use it anywhere it gets it (lets face it, the devs made a level where it rains cars just to give players something different), but it killed the difficulty as well. The difficulty was a selling point for me. I literally played through half of the available levels and I didn't have to cash in my experience once. I was too busy smashing skulls with a sledge hammer that never disappears. Before, I had to strategize which weapons were effective in certain situations and I had to keep those weapons fresh and ready for use. If I failed to have the right weapon, or my biker was too weak, I was screwed. Back to the XP to upgrade and maybe I'll get further next time.  It was like a game of chess. It was fun. It added to replayability by having to level up my biker to account for weak weapons. No one asked for this. No one thought weapon degragation was bad. No one believes that easier games are more entertaining. Replayability is gone. It's stupid. Change it back.That's it. There are other parts I could harp on, like no more Santa, but removing weapon degradation was a game changer for me.  I have no doubt other long time players feel the same way.No, I didn't spell check.			"

								Growing up as a HUGE Road Rash fan, this game is exactly what I wanted it to be.  I've been waiting for a new Road Rash for so many years now and THIS IS IT!  It's finally here!  So if you liked Road Rash alot and have been waiting for a new version it has arrived and I highly recommend it to you, if thats what you're looking for.  Heck and if it's not and  you have no clue what Road Rash is-I still recommend this game-it's a style of raceing game to enjoy.			"

								If you are old school and remember how amazing Road Rash was on Sega Genesis, this is the game for you. However there is no bike customization, ie. grinding races to earn money to buy better parts for you bike, or buying a whole new bike. The  only customization lies within the skill system. With that being said it is an arcade racer, not a racing rpg like the old Road Rash. Never the less the game is early access and is quite fun. I am excited to play the final product.			"

								This game is really fast paced and awesome. However, the current issues with crashing are hair-tearingly horrible. I managed to beat the game in one run and as i got to the screen to use xp the game crashed and all progress was lost. It crashes right when you need to save the game. In its current state, I would still recommend this game, but be wary of the fact you will rage quit.overall 8/10 even with crash issues.			"

								I've only played this game for a couple of hours so far but it's great fun, and can't wait for it to be feature complete. It brings back memories of Road Rash from the megadrive but with lots more added goodies. Grabbing people and riding them into oncoming traffic, grappling with the harpoon and jump jets and slicing other riders up with a longsword is awesome. Being able to play as Shovel Knight is an added bonus.Other things I like: Medieval weapons, guns, explosions, hallucination zones, grappling ninja speed runs, Shovel Knight, local multiplayer.  TL/DR: Liked Road Rash, but want more? Buy now.			"

								This is an awesome game if you loved the old arcade racers and Road Rash on the sega especially.  This is a lot like that but with more weapons, unlockable upgrade and co-op play.  Even in early access this is a fun game and worth the price for the nostalga and fun alone.  Works great with a xbox controller and has great potential.  The controls work great, haven't tried the keyboard at all to be honest.  I do hope more maps and modes are in the future.  Also the camera needs a reset or centering button.  I hope there is a lot more content because it seems like you could do the whole run in under 3 hours, if i can get half way across the map in 30mins I assum there can't be a long campaign.  Overall a fun game that I hope just keeps getting better.  Keep up the good work guys.			"

								I just finished my first run through the normal game mode and wanted to share my thoughts. Awesome game so far, and the devs. are updating it consistently!  One of the few early access games i would fully recommend.  Also, it's basically a full game,  only needs some minor work,  so grab it now before a price hike!  If you liked the old classic Road Rash, or sometimes wish you were able to bash other motorists without repercussion for poor driving, then this is your game. ProsEasy to pick up (Controller is HIGHLY recommended!!)  works great both m+k and controllerHuge Upgrade system. Each ""run"" you can upgrade temporary things, like increase in defense, more health, more stamina, etc.  After you die, you are then able to put your xp towards permanent upgrades like better starting bike/weapon, higher health, better starting weapon, etc.Varied race types such as Race, take down X number of baddies, time trial, only kicking and grabs, etc.Extremely fun and satisfying.  Every time i play i have a huge grin on my face, its one of those games that is just fun to pick up and playI have yet to have a crash or encounter any bugs.Room for improvementOnly a few locations (rooftop, desert, snow covered, and rainbow) could use one or two more. (Maybe a downtown, a suburban,  or a dirt race track)  Could use one or two more race types (Maybe like a tag style game where you have to bump another bike to ""tag"" it and the goal is to not be ""it"" when you cross the line, or something that incorporates your gang, like take down 5 baddies before they take down 5 of your gang.)Would be cool if you could actually name, customize and upgrade your bike gang in game.More use of your gang.  As of now it just feels like they are kind of getting in the way and not really all that helpful.  Would be cool if they actually followed/flanked you on some missions and were more active in taking down baddies.Posted 2/9/2015			"

								Update: I decided to change my feedback of this game from ""not recommended"" to ""recommended"". I actually had a chance to talk with the design team, and they were genuinely concerned with the comments I previously made. They have been contacting me asking if my previous issues have been addressed and after the latest update that was released on February 8th, 2015, the game is finally playable on my machine. I haven't encountered nearly as many game-breaking bugs as before either.Another thing I noticed with one of the recent updates is a ""tip"" to use ""jump jets"" when you are racing on the city rooftops. You can push the left bumper to hover up into the air to prevent falling to  your death. I didn't even know that there were ""jump jets"" in my initial review, which sort of gave me a ""AH HA!"" moment. I am still not a fan of the races on the rooftops, but to each his own I guess.Overall, the races are really fun and the team behind this game seem to take pride in their work. They are constantly improving the game and making it more stable on slightly older machines. My pc is a 4ghz quad core, 8gb RAM and I recently swapped out my graphics card with an Nvidia Geforce GTX 750 Ti 2gb. Keep in mind it's still an early access game, but they have finally polished it up enough to make it worth adding to your library.I also can't wait to see how the multiplayer modes turn out. If you are a Road Rash fan and want to get a quick combat-race fix, you should give this game a try.My older, original feedback/review of the game is below:------------------------------------------------------------------------I know this is an ""early access"" game, but it runs so poorly optimized on my pc that the game will run at 5 fps at certain points. I can run every  other game on my pc just fine and I have a decent graphics card (AMD R7 260x 2GB). The graphics are nothing to write home about, which makes me wonder where all of the wasted processing power is going. The game can be sort of fun when the frame rate is high enough, but even when I turn the settings to ""fastest"" and lower the resolution it doesn't help much.In terms of gameplay, it borrows many elements from Road Rash, but it has a ""rogue style"" element where you start over if you die, but can unlock additional perks at the end of each session. The levels are randomly generated, which adds variety, but this can also introduce game-breaking bugs. I had one level where you are racing on top of city skyscraper buildings and jumping from one roof to another. The only problem was the beginning of the race generated two building that were too far apart, making it impossible to land the jump across and finish the race.I don't hate this game, but at the same time I can't recommend buying it in its current state. I will update my review if some dramatic improvements are made to fix the frame rate issues and other bugs. The devs hearts are in the right place trying to make a Road Rash clone, but in the end it just makes me wish someone else out there could make a proper Road Rash sequel. This game feels too much like a rushed cell phone/tablet game than a proper console experience I was hoping for.			"

Early Access Review
								Back in the early ninties, there was a game called Road Rash where you were supposed race motorcycles and occasionally beat the crap out of the competition using random weapons.There is now a game called Road Redemption, where you are supposed to beat the crap out of the competition using random weapons and occasionally race motorcycles.Let me start by saying this game is tons of fun to waste some time on, and addictive as heck.  Once it's complete and the bugs are ironed out, I'll likely be spending quite a bit of time on itThe above paragraph was from my previous review, from late November 2014.  It's now February 2015 and all of the above still applies.Quite a few of the most glaring bugs have been ironed out, primarily having to do with video/processor lag.  There are still a few small ones, but nothing particularly game-breaking.  Before, I had to play on the lowest video settings to really get through most of the game.  Just now, I tried out the 'experimental' Fantastic video setting, and other than a few spots that stuttered (crossing a bridge or going through a tunnel), it was smooth.So, what I'm saying here is that this game is tons of fun.  From what I've seen, the developer isn't going to stop working on it until it's done and polished, so you're safe even though it's still early access.I mean. how often do you get to ride a motorcycle in plate mail armor and weild a battleaxe?

								Outrageously fun, a game with huge potential. Highly recommended.Reminds me of a cross between Motorstorm (PS3) and the classic Road Rash games (various platforms).Nothing like slashing opponents with a sword. Or dodging cars that fall from the sky. Or racing on top of buildings... at night. The game will keep throwing s*** at the fan all the time. You can almost picture developers laughing in the background. What a creative bunch. "

								Actually a very good and enjoyable game that you can just pick up, smash out and put down again without any real thought. By far one of the best games I have played at this stage of its development. You dont really have any control over the weapons, and while I play with a controller it makes trying to fire guns quite a difficult task. Especially while simultaniously turning a corner and trying to kick some off a bridge who is hitting you with an axe while avoiding a brick of C4 about to go boom.Really impressed where this game is a going and is certainly well worth a purchase.

								Ok, this should be considered a ""First impressions"" instead of a full review, which should come later.Road Rage is fun. Yet unrefined. The first thing I noticed is that this game taxed my system pretty hard, while not looking all to great. I ran it on Medium-High with my rig, a GTX 760(2GB VRAM), an i3-3220, and 8GB ram, all while barley staying over 40FPS. Keep in mind, this rig runs damn near anything(Take a look at my Steam Games) on High with no problems. Anyway, it just didnt look too good. I also noticed a lot of clipping issues, along with some really soddy textures.Graphics aside, the game sounds pretty good. I loved the music, and all the sounds are pretty good.In the gameplay section, its pretty good. The goal is to win a race by any means nessesary. You will pick up guns, melee, C4, and anything in between to kill the other racers. All of them ""Feel"" good, and are all fun to use. All the ""Maps"" are pretty good, yet they are repeated way to often. Yet, my largest complaint comes with the games Xp/Cash/Single Player Elements. Ok, in short, all money is lost upon death, along with all items. Maybe this was a thing in the original game, but I'm a bit to young to remember back that far. I found this system quite annoying. But it wouldnt be so bad if the only way to level up was to die. I mean, the Xp system is vast and fun to explore, but...Also, maybe i'll get the hang of it, but the game just seems to lack any sort of coheasion as far as the SP element goes.Yet, I feel like this game could turn into something good, maybe great. I'll try to play more of it as time goes on. but just take the ""Yes"" recommendation with a pinch of salt.			"

								Remeber ROAD RASH? Rejoice fellow 16 bit and uppers! ROAD RASH is back, and slightly better than ever! In this updated version of the classic illegal motorcycle racing game, you get to play a more RPG style character, (through multiple playthoughs) with upgradable skills that follow you through multiple deaths... and there will be deaths... Even for a veteran rasher from genesis to ps1 this game is HARD!I had to play almost a full day (according to steam timer) to upgrade absolutely everything in the skills page at game over, although it was worth it. Now my guy actually catches up to first, second, and third placers off the get go. Starting off in this game is INFURIATING. I broke 2 keyboards and a mouse trying to beat level 3. I had to lower the mouse sensitivity to .1 as to avoid overlooking left or right while I'm turning. Which is a main issue, but now I can only shoot about a half block behind my target. Then I discovered the xbox360 controller works for this game! Now I am a fricken PRO!  Ripping across the side road on nitrous, C4ing as I pass, hitting every ramp jumping over cars, etc! Shooting is still hard, tho I might boost the up and down axis to get a little more aim maneuvering.Besides the jumpy keyboard controls, the game is pretty solid, the store purchases make losing almost every race tolerable, and I loved that you can stack damage upgrades you buy at the store, making your current playthough character a one hit killer! (store upgrades do not carry over after game over) The upgrade for an extra life DOES NOT WORK. A waste of 2.2k$ I don't know if its buggy right now (early access game) or that I died and it didn't register because I bought other store upgrades after it and it lost track? The store prices are ridiculous. Even with the skillpoints for better store deals, a hot dog is 750$ when you race for 1,000$? math needs to make sense here.  DEVs need to get on patching the glitchyness of the game. So many times I have been dragged by random taxis I tried to bounce off the sides of (ala classic road rash) and end up catching a hitbox corner to be dragged allllll the way into last place. (Even have a snapshot of me being dragged on my profile page on steam) Every golden gate style bridge in the game has a center curb at the beginning of afforementioned bridge that causes either a small ramping jump, or total collison. NOT SURE WHY? Oh and the random collison with nothing every once in a while, either skimming too close to a cliffside wall, or barely passing a random turning sign that just stops you cold dead. The signs should just breakaway as per this game's predecessor, it would help the fun factor of this game. Also cut out the bullstuff crash as you fall off a bridge melodramatic camera work. It wastes precious racetime, and pisses me off. The rooftop levels are nototrious for 25 second falling camera angle (staring at the side of a building you didnt gap )proceeded by losing the race entirely. And forget takedown missions on rooftops, you can hardly get a shot in before they either kill themselves not jumping a gap, or you waste your entire killtime falling, dealing with the camerawork, or jump boosting riiiight over their heads just to have to slow down and maybe clip one of the other players, but still slow down just enough to not make the next roof jump. And whats with the grappling hook? I have not successfully saved myself from a fall with that nor have I ever hooked anything thats worth even using the damn thing for. The mechanics to that weapon need tweaking to say the least. The AI of the cars and semi trucks are godawful, they really intend to destroy your race times by flipping cars onto your bike and just all out ram the poop outta you. TOO HARD. Even the random cars change lanes right into you, or a disabled car smashed to death and stalled will just come to life as you pass it, T-boning you into losing the race. Oh gotta LOVE the random van in traffic that can't make the steep hill and starts rolling backwards into your bike as your neck and neck with a [sigma] rider...BAM! SUCH FUN. (all sarchasm)I loved the use of guns, C4, stickybombs, and grenade launchers make takedown missions ultra fun... better than GTA fun! There needs to be an autoaim option, because shooting is really frustrating, half the time you overlook and shoot above or below the target, only to hit oncoming traffic! A difficulty option would be grand.The graphics vary obviously from system to system, so don't expect to have jacksepticeye quality framerates/crystal clarity if you got a 2.5 gig processor running one GPU. I have a 3.5 gig one GPU and still have blurry road ahead of me and skippy framerates. I haven't tried any steam machines, or supercomputers so all I have is my experience. Regardless, I do recommend this game to anyone who loves racing games, and F.ing S. Up.			"

								All the comparisons to Road Rash are obvious at first glimpse, but only skin deep.There is 'combat on bikes', that is essentially where the similarities to Road Rash begin and end. This is NOT Road Rash 2015, though reviewers keep saying ""If you loved Road Rash buy this!"" It's closer to a linear GTA on bikes than it is to Road Rash.There is much more emphasis on killing than racing, including using assault rifles and grenade launchers to take out your competition. Some levels can only be finished by killing a certain number of opponents or getting the police/military angry enough within a certain time/distance (GTA getting 5 stars).It's mindless, and i do mean mindless fun for a few hours. A couple of the randomly generated levels are actually about racing and finishing in the top three to advance, but the primary focus is usually on killing.A little bit of replay value is offered through the rogue-like elements of upgrading your passive stats after each playthrough, but after you have played it through once, you have pretty much seen it all. No bike upgrades or better bikes to purchase.And following the trend in modern media, gotta add a dash of good ol satanism for some reason...Not a bad game overall, but not the new Road Rash I was hoping for.Recommended if you're looking for a fighting game with racing, not a racing game with fighting.

Take your aggression out on other riders while trying to race to win.Obviously its still in early access with more features like online play to come but for 20 bucks I feel it was well worth it just in the state it is now.So If you were a Road Rash lover do not let this game slip by...buy it download it and unleash your wrath while you laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off			"

								In the 90's I remember playing a game on my old Amiga / Commodor computer.  I believe it was called ""Road Rash.""  Nice motorcycle racing game, but I always thought ""You know what this game needs?  Baseball bats, or swords, or guns or something.""Road Redemption is working to make that dream a reality.			"

								I did buy this game because i'm a fan of the old road rash game, which i did play alot in the ""old days"". I find this game right as much dependent to play as i did to road rash. I would like if there was some more bikes and riders, and a way to customize the color on them, i also miss a restart button when i'm paused to restart the race i'm going insted of drive the whole way the finish line. When this is told is this game one of my favorit game of all time.			"

Road Redemption is basically Downhill Domination from the PS2, only on motorcycles. I used to be addicted to DD, so seeing this game on Steam made me super pumped, and I instantly bought it.  To skip reading my review, check out my playthrough below, otherwise, you can continue reading for more: RR is a fast paced driving game, in which you're racing on a motorcycle against AI also on motorcycles, cars, and other vehicles. The game offers multiple different options of motorcycles to drive, from the Honda CBR to various choppers, and even different riders to choose from. There aren't a whole lot of options, but maybe more will be added in time, since I haven't unlocked any through playing just yet. The gameplay is somewhat laggy/jumpy even on Fastest quality setting, but it is early access so hopefully that will be cleared up. There is also no multiplayer option available, but I'd like to see the game more polished before trying to add others just yet. However, there is a split screen option available which is very rarely seen, and which I have not tried out just yet, although I don't see any reason for it to be any more laggy than single player.  In order to use the split screen option, the other players must use gamepads. There are plenty of obstacles to avoid, such as other cars on the road, poles, and even falling debris on some maps, which add a nice challenge to the game. Swinging weapons and shooting guns are failry straight forward and easy, although the controls are somewhat confusing. In order to grab or kick, you must have your camera facing the direction slightly that you want to kick or grab, while swinging your weapon only takes clicking either the left or right mouse button. So far, I have seen weapons such as shovels, crowbars, long swords, magnum revolvers, shotguns, pistols, and more, so you won't get tired of using the same weapon. Timing on the weapon swings feels just right, and I have plenty of fun knocking other riders off their bikes, or smashing enemy cars to destruction.The controls of the bike are where the game is lacking most, as the turning is either too drastic, or not enough. I find myself overcorrecting myself too often, and launching myself off the side of the map. The turbo is a nice touch though, and helps with catching up. Also, if you completely fail, the other riders will never be too far ahead, allowing you plenty of time and chances to come back before the finish line. Each race has 3 different levels/maps that you must complete, and each race gets progressively harder and adds more content to the game. If you fail one of the levels, you must restart the entire race, but your previous races, progress, and skill points will be saved. There are plenty of skills and perks to choose from and purchase, from increasing bike speed, armor, health, weapon durability, and tons more! Overall, this game was tons of fun, and I enjoy it a lot! I look forward to what the developers have in store for the final product, and I will continue to play as they continue polishing and improving this game.			"

								Game is fantastic fun will add to review asz game is updated :) Loving this thing.Summer Update; Yaaaay you added more, and alot in a short tme outta nowhere. Thanks guys ca't wait to try it :)Great enhancements game plays more like a game than an arcade stint, i miss some of the quirky glithches, still get to use my grapple shot for op speed, it spawned while you had the roofto[ps skipped cause i think it whent through the process of adding the associated equipment before reaching the next level. Though the rooftops are back so dont know if that persists. Still kinda hate the last level, notr completed the + version yet witht eh new terrain maps. Still hoping for more levels, maybe rampage mode could be a timer with a set amount? Then after killing a bronze siolver or gold amount of enemies wwhen the time runs out you need to get the hell out of dodge?Great game but i'd wait if you are hoping for more than rapid injection of all your fun chemicals at once. As in that's currently the best quality of the game. OP amounts of fun, instant uncut fun.I would like more updates or a news page so we know when to expect more, i can be botehred doing the last race any more so i kinda stopped playing. Worth it for supporting the full release however personnaly don't know how long we have to wait for updates. It ranges from a month like last time to longer like the current gap. Race modes with tracks and laps would be better for hopes for multiplayer and i had kinda hoped from the description there was gonna be like and endless mode just ride the highway until your dead. Fighting of increasingly difficult police and gangs.Idea's for further development,After each race you can select a different ""path"" that leads to differing events and a different route across americaEach area could have differing gangs and boss's and suc h making the game hefty replayableUnlockable bike and skins possibly even custom riders with unlockable clothes and such.The police don't make sense iun your appocolpyse story nor the taxi's everywhere but i don't mind as they game wouldnt be as fun without the cars there to slam your opponents into.airborne stunts? Depending on bikes they could be a good way of generating boostyou could have player run gangs in the game and your recruit them along the way, they would have differing weapons and skills like the enemy mobs but would ride with you or even let you draft behind them for speed bonus.

								I think I'm echoing a lot of people when I say this game is great and the Road Rash influence is clear enough without me mentioning that either. It's been a long time since I've played a game that made me gasp with excitement when the sh*t really hit the fan and I'm getting that a lot here. It's fast, furious and mad as hell.What I'm really writing this review for is to get some ideas for future updates out there, again, I think most of these are echoes of other peoples thoughts too, but here goes.Customization would be a huge boon to the game. Especially if you could ""lock"" your choices so each time you die you didn't have to re-choose your player. In addition to this (though a lot tougher to impliment) would be a more intricate customization option. Clothes, models, bikes. What you could also do is impliment a secondary monetary system that would be used solely for buying material goods for the racer. There's a fine line between ""grindy"" and ""fun"" though, so I know why this could be a risky path to go down though I think most of us would agree that we'd love to play as some homage to the war boys from Mad Max. (Or Wez from Road Warrior if you're an old fart like me)This would also be great for when the multiplayer takes off (I can imagine it being HUGE for this game) people would really want to show off their unique flair when online. Guess you just have to look at the hats from team Fortress for that. Love the game and can't wait to follow its growth.			"

Fun maps, combat is just as fun as you'd expect. The satisfaction of smacking a guy off his bike with a freaking shovel made for an awesome first impression. Hopefully to come I would love to see more weapons, more bikes, and more characters. Hell, maybe a customizable character or bikes even. A lot of potential here and fun times to be had.			"

								All the comparisons to Road Rash are obvious at first glimpse, but only skin deep.There is 'combat on bikes', that is essentially where the similarities to Road Rash begin and end. This is NOT Road Rash 2015, though reviewers keep saying ""If you loved Road Rash buy this!"" It's closer to a linear GTA on bikes than it is to Road Rash.There is much more emphasis on killing than racing, including using assault rifles and grenade launchers to take out your competition. Some levels can only be finished by killing a certain number of opponents or getting the police/military angry enough within a certain time/distance (GTA getting 5 stars).It's mindless, and i do mean mindless fun for a few hours. A couple of the randomly generated levels are actually about racing and finishing in the top three to advance, but the primary focus is usually on killing.A little bit of replay value is offered through the rogue-like elements of upgrading your passive stats after each playthrough, but after you have played it through once, you have pretty much seen it all. No bike upgrades or better bikes to purchase.And following the trend in modern media, gotta add a dash of good ol satanism for some reason...Not a bad game overall, but not the new Road Rash I was hoping for.Recommended if you're looking for a fighting game with racing, not a racing game with fighting.

								Well like many others before me said already this is the spiritual successor of Road Rash. So if you liked and played RR you will probably like Road Redemption. This game is so much fun. Lots of different melee weapons from spiked clubs over katanas to broadswords and C4. Different fireweapons ala AK47, shotgun, pistols and wth a ♥♥♥♥ing grenade launcher :D.  Other the that you can grep, kick your opponents and even use your ropethrower on them. So many possibilities for combat.Missions range from checkpoint races, to normal races, reach pursuit level and knock enemies out. Each time you start a game the missions are randomized to be not too repetitive.Ah well and the upgrade system is pretty good. But you are fast to get every point. Hope it will be extended.First time play for me was around December last year. Game was already fun and good looking but I had massive problems with the framerate (probably due to the Psysik effects) especially in the carstorm levels.With the last big summer update these guys fixed it completely (putting the Physics on multiple cores) and to top it off the even improved the graphics a lot and added new textures and racetrack enviroments.Now the game runs smooth at 2560x1440p at highest with my i7-4930k and Radeon 7970 GHz.I can only recommend this game as it is fun and the developers do their best (which is really good)  to improve the game for everyone. Kudos to you guys.			"

								No clever puns, witty jokes or attempts at humor here. This game is too good for that.A very fun, intense and challenging tribute to the old road rash series. Definitely worth the money already, and with ""online support coming very soon"" you won't even need to pretend to be friends with that guy (you know, that really weird, creepy one) you met at work one day to play this game with other people anymore.8/25/15: ""Very soon"" must have been in Valve Time. Regardless, the game is still great fun for a bit, and splitscreen definitely increases its lifespan if you're one of those crazy people that have a PC set up for local splitscreen multiplayer (who even does that though?).

								If you are old school and remember how amazing Road Rash was on Sega Genesis, this is the game for you. However there is no bike customization, ie. grinding races to earn money to buy better parts for you bike, or buying a whole new bike. The  only customization lies within the skill system. With that being said it is an arcade racer, not a racing rpg like the old Road Rash. Never the less the game is early access and is quite fun. I am excited to play the final product.			"

Road Redemption is an adrenaline fueled, Road Rash inspired, high octane smash fest of brutal speed and even more brutal mechanics. However, it is still plauged by bugs that will frustrate you to the point that you want to reach through the screen, grab that pipe, and smash your computer over and over. First of all, to get it out of the way-- If you're looking for a modern Road Rash game, this is it. At least, this is as close as you're going to get. Now that that's out of the way...Basic Overview and Rogue-like SynopsisRoad Redemption picks up the ever popular ""rogue-like"" genre and attempts to cross-breed it with another genre like so many others have done before. In this aspect, I feel it succeeds for the most part. You have cash to spend on upgrades between levels while you're still alive, but these upgrades and your cash all join you in the dust the moment you die. Fear not, as you then get to make permanent upgrades based upon the XP you've received during your adventure. This is calculated by how many levels you've completed and how much money you had on you when you made that final mistake.GameplayThe controls are tight and smooth, giving you the exact reaction when you need it most. There is a plethora of weapons available to you. You have three weapon slots and you always start off with at least a single bone-crushing instrument or gun. Upgrades can make these stronger as well as allow you to start each new game with better and better weapons. You get more weapons by defeating opponents, and occasionally a choice of one of three at the beginning of a level. Only three weapon slots though, so sometimes you'll be juggling replacing that half broken pipe wrench for a giggle-inducing time bomb while still keeping your eyes on the road and the action. The racing is smoothed and only occasionally suffers slow down (especially after the most recent update. I hardly see it at all anymore, thanks guys!). GraphicsThe graphics are nice (especially for a game made in Unity) but nothing to write home about. For the most part you'll be seeing the same old randomly generated desert plains with two different types of bridges. Stay alive, and you get to see some more variety, but not much. However, I personally spent more time concentrating on the road, the other drivers, and my inventory to really care that much.MusicThe music is... a rough spot for the game. It's not that it isn't good (it is), but that it's all over the board. Only a couple of the tracks really seem to capture the feel of the game, while the rest are just kind of... there. The primary menu screen is the worst offender here. It's a light, nostalgic, rainy day sort of piano tune that makes me think more of a casual RPG than a fast-paced motorcycle slaughter-fest.StoryThere is no story. Period. Now on here, in the description, you're given a basic story premise. But it is not apparent anywhere in the game except for the very end. You are racing and fighting just for the sake of it until then, but really, that's what you bought the game for, so who cares?Bugs and Balancing IssuesThen... there are the frustrating game-killers. Some of you (like myself) will see past these and continue to pick up and play an addicting titles. Others will be quickly put off. Collision damage isn't consistent. I can barely graze a car in the same side of traffic and be sent hurdling face first into the dirt. Likewise, I can be flooring it and hit an oncoming at full speed but miraculously just sort of ""bounce off"" its front fender without taking the slightest bit of damage. This problem also leads to my personally most frustrating bug. So sometimes when you hit an oncoming car dead on at full speed, rather than crashing, you get plowed along helplessly until the car crashes or something hits you to dislodge you. Ever want to feel like a bug in a front fender? Now you can! Seems ridiculous that it still hasn't been fixed. Its hard enough to catch up to anyone, let alone the top spot, once you've crashed. But now you're being dragged against your will and not amount of gas pushing, or smashing the other car will change this.The only other ""bug"" worth mentioning may actually be a part of the game's design. If the enemy is barely in front of you, they will be able to strike you, but you won't be able to hit them. They can cave in your skull, and even the block/parry button is useless to prevent it from happening.Some of the game is definitely skewed in the computer's favor. Semi trucks that can literally smash through anything and take quite a beating to destroy appear quite often as a fellow racer. Sometimes there are more than one of them. Humvees that can spew out mines that you never quite see in time. First place racers who gain that position and hold it eternally as if the Gods themselves had pre-determined no one else was worthy of taking home the gold. Unrelenting cop cars that are far more interested in you than your malicious motorcycle mates. Almost all enemies that are not a direct part of the race will stop what they're doing to someone else in order to match your speed and give you the hazing of a lifetime. Who paid these guys off?Final Score - 6.5/10I still recommend this to anyone who ever loved Road Rash, but with the warning that you will get frustrated by unfair mechanics, controller throwing bugs, and the occasional kick off a bridge. Get past these and there's a worthwhile game here. Certainly not worth the $10-15 mark-up they plan on completetion. Arguable whether it's worth the full $20 they're already charging. Pick it up on sale and you won't regret it though.			"

The upgrade system is excellent...It puts you in a place where you have no choice but to improve your playing skill in order to improve your stats.  Highely reccomend!			"

								Takes me back in the day when I used to play road rash on my console system.  This game will remiind you of the good old day's rampaging on the streets with just a crowbar.  This ain't just the new road rash but, there are plenty more weapons, bikes, and riders to choose from.  Yeah, there isn't no expensive cutscenes but, the graphics and action are sick.  Hurry up and buy this game if you want a new road rash.			"

								I think its safe to say with this last update (june/15) that the game is pointing to a good direction, one that is safe to recomend it. Im not saying the game is perfect in its current state and that it doesn't have its flaws, but I'm not gonna bother pointing it out since its clear to me that the developers are working hard on their game and that they care for the final product.The way I see it. The point of Road Redemption is to depict the most critical moments of every bike event (be it a ""race"", take out bikers, attract the police, etc), where tension and danger have build up to their highest. If you consider that and keep that in mind, than this game delivers it very well. Its very action packed and keeps you at the edge of your seat 99% of the time (even that not being the ideal for me, personally, but that is a matter of taste).I think its fair to see people disapointed with this game because they expected a Road Rash remake, and you can't acctually blame them because the developers used the Road Rash hype to get attention directed to them. But you can't also blame the developers for wanting to make their product to stand out on their own and bring their own ideias to light.--x--So, for people who were expecting Road Rash Remake I leave you this: The only thing that Road Redemption and Road Rash share in common are the bikes and the weapons (not the ranged ones). Their game design philosophy are totally different. BUT, even so, Road Redemption still is the closest you can get to Road Rash in modern games (at least that I know of).			"

								This game is a lot of fun, So far i have enjoyed every minute of it, especially the ending of the campaign (no spoilers). It doesn't quite feel the same as Road Rash in some ways, but its as close as were going to get. There is no seperate bike and rider health, it seems much faster paced and reflex intensive, and there are far more enemies with less health than in road rash. So far all the bikes are the same tier and no difference in riders. There are no cattle prods or pepper spray. All of this may change, I don't know, if it does i will rewrite this review.  All of these changes aside, this is A REALLY fun game that is worth picking up if you liked road rash "

								OK so the graphics are sub-par the interface and menus are alright at best and there needs to be an actual story and a way to recruit/upgrade gang members, but I'll be dammed if I didn't have a blast playing this one. I wish there was more money and some real publishing power behind this cause the world really needs a new Road Rash and I beleve this is the skeleton vital organs and nerves now all we need is more flesh. BTW I hope the devs don't spend all their time on multiplayer yet flesh out the single player add some more value take some cues from Road Rash 3D and add some cool cut scenes, hey maybe even customizable riders or gangs then go for the multiplayer or even save the mutiplayer for an addon pack with new modes and maps later. So far great job folks, keep up the good work and we will have a winner.			"

								I just finished my first run through the normal game mode and wanted to share my thoughts. Awesome game so far, and the devs. are updating it consistently!  One of the few early access games i would fully recommend.  Also, it's basically a full game,  only needs some minor work,  so grab it now before a price hike!  If you liked the old classic Road Rash, or sometimes wish you were able to bash other motorists without repercussion for poor driving, then this is your game. ProsEasy to pick up (Controller is HIGHLY recommended!!)  works great both m+k and controllerHuge Upgrade system. Each ""run"" you can upgrade temporary things, like increase in defense, more health, more stamina, etc.  After you die, you are then able to put your xp towards permanent upgrades like better starting bike/weapon, higher health, better starting weapon, etc.Varied race types such as Race, take down X number of baddies, time trial, only kicking and grabs, etc.Extremely fun and satisfying.  Every time i play i have a huge grin on my face, its one of those games that is just fun to pick up and playI have yet to have a crash or encounter any bugs.Room for improvementOnly a few locations (rooftop, desert, snow covered, and rainbow) could use one or two more. (Maybe a downtown, a suburban,  or a dirt race track)  Could use one or two more race types (Maybe like a tag style game where you have to bump another bike to ""tag"" it and the goal is to not be ""it"" when you cross the line, or something that incorporates your gang, like take down 5 baddies before they take down 5 of your gang.)Would be cool if you could actually name, customize and upgrade your bike gang in game.More use of your gang.  As of now it just feels like they are kind of getting in the way and not really all that helpful.  Would be cool if they actually followed/flanked you on some missions and were more active in taking down baddies.Posted 2/9/2015			"

								Update: I decided to change my feedback of this game from ""not recommended"" to ""recommended"". I actually had a chance to talk with the design team, and they were genuinely concerned with the comments I previously made. They have been contacting me asking if my previous issues have been addressed and after the latest update that was released on February 8th, 2015, the game is finally playable on my machine. I haven't encountered nearly as many game-breaking bugs as before either.Another thing I noticed with one of the recent updates is a ""tip"" to use ""jump jets"" when you are racing on the city rooftops. You can push the left bumper to hover up into the air to prevent falling to  your death. I didn't even know that there were ""jump jets"" in my initial review, which sort of gave me a ""AH HA!"" moment. I am still not a fan of the races on the rooftops, but to each his own I guess.Overall, the races are really fun and the team behind this game seem to take pride in their work. They are constantly improving the game and making it more stable on slightly older machines. My pc is a 4ghz quad core, 8gb RAM and I recently swapped out my graphics card with an Nvidia Geforce GTX 750 Ti 2gb. Keep in mind it's still an early access game, but they have finally polished it up enough to make it worth adding to your library.I also can't wait to see how the multiplayer modes turn out. If you are a Road Rash fan and want to get a quick combat-race fix, you should give this game a try.My older, original feedback/review of the game is below:------------------------------------------------------------------------I know this is an ""early access"" game, but it runs so poorly optimized on my pc that the game will run at 5 fps at certain points. I can run every  other game on my pc just fine and I have a decent graphics card (AMD R7 260x 2GB). The graphics are nothing to write home about, which makes me wonder where all of the wasted processing power is going. The game can be sort of fun when the frame rate is high enough, but even when I turn the settings to ""fastest"" and lower the resolution it doesn't help much.In terms of gameplay, it borrows many elements from Road Rash, but it has a ""rogue style"" element where you start over if you die, but can unlock additional perks at the end of each session. The levels are randomly generated, which adds variety, but this can also introduce game-breaking bugs. I had one level where you are racing on top of city skyscraper buildings and jumping from one roof to another. The only problem was the beginning of the race generated two building that were too far apart, making it impossible to land the jump across and finish the race.I don't hate this game, but at the same time I can't recommend buying it in its current state. I will update my review if some dramatic improvements are made to fix the frame rate issues and other bugs. The devs hearts are in the right place trying to make a Road Rash clone, but in the end it just makes me wish someone else out there could make a proper Road Rash sequel. This game feels too much like a rushed cell phone/tablet game than a proper console experience I was hoping for.			"

								It's Road Rash with 4 player splitscreen. Hyper-fast and tons of fun.Apparently Vs. hasn't been implimented as I write this and you can only do co-op - but that didn't stop me and my friends from whacking each others heads in with a wide variety of instruments.I like to have a range of easy to pick up local multiplayer games at the ready. This will probably start to come out at parties as much as Nidhogg or Samurai Gunn does. Cooler still the developer gives you their number when you complete the game to offer any critisims. This is exactly how early access should be done. Well done!			"

								Actually a very good and enjoyable game that you can just pick up, smash out and put down again without any real thought. By far one of the best games I have played at this stage of its development. You dont really have any control over the weapons, and while I play with a controller it makes trying to fire guns quite a difficult task. Especially while simultaniously turning a corner and trying to kick some off a bridge who is hitting you with an axe while avoiding a brick of C4 about to go boom.Really impressed where this game is a going and is certainly well worth a purchase.

Early Access Review
								As it is now, it's a pretty solid bike racing / fighting experience, in the spirit of the old Road Rash games, which is good because I loved that series and I've been waiting years for a game like this.Anyway, keep in mind that this is an Early Access game, so it's safe to pick it up if you're a Road Rash fan like me, you'll most certainly love it, but it is not a finished product. It suffers from the poor performance issues of Unity 4, so until devs update it so it will run on Unity 5, the most crowded moments of the game will seriously drop your FPS, but overall it's playable, so it's not that big of a deal, considering that updates are released pretty regularly and I think that the transition to to Unity 5 will be only a matter of time.Also, it currently lacks competitive multiplayer and online, so at the moment you'll be only able to play 2-4 players co-op. When competitive and online multiplayer comes out, it will be a great boost to the replayability factor of this game, which is already pretty high considering that the campaign is procedurally generated and the skill system along with the temporary upgrades that you can buy in the shop between races makes every campaign different from another.Procedurally generated tracks are generally good, but are not so varied and tend to get a bit repetitive really fast (expecially rooftop ones, and it's a shame considering that at first it's a really fresh and fun concept). Also you can't save tracks in any way, so even if you loved a track and want to play it again sometimes, or with friends coming over at your house, you currently can't. I hope they'll add an editor of some sort or even a seeding option to play around with the track generator and why not, share tracks with the community.Weapon variety and fighting are great, it's so funny to get rid of rivals by smacking them in the face with a spiked bat, grabbing them and ramming them into the upcoming traffic, or slicing them with a BATTLE AXE! Firearms are a bit OP obviously, this being a bike racing game, but they come with limited ammunition and if you like challenge, you can choose to not use them at all (but give the grenade launcher a try, it's funny as hell), since CPU rivals will not (save for a specific event in which there are some bikers with unlimited pipebombs). I hope they will be toned down a little when online and competitive MP will be added.At the moment there's not a large choice of bikes and characters, and there are no upgrades that change bike stats (other than damage resistance) or its appearance.So, to sum this review up, I give this game 7/10, only because it's clearly unfinished (after all, it is an Early Access game), and I recommend it to anyone who played any Road Rash and/or likes the concept of racing/brawling on motorbikes, and I recommend buying it in the meantime (consider buying it when it's on sale if you're not a diehard Road Rash fan or you're not sure you want to buy an Early Access game) to support developers, so updates will be released faster, and also because it's very likely that it will cost more when it will be finished. Also it's nice to see that devs take time to read our opinions and answer to them in the forums, so this is another good reason to buy it and play it so that your feedback will help making the game better and better. It really has potential, and with some tweaks here and there it could easily become the best game of its genre.			"

								If you are looking at this game expecting all the joys of your younger years playing Road Rash, you are in for a nice little treat. This game entertained me fore hours while I batted and kicked other riders off their bikes and into oncoming traffic. This is everything Road Rash had and then some. I haven't seen any bugs, the game looks pretty solid. Totally worth it!Rating: 10/10			"

								One thing that would make this much more interesting is if they used the formular of Road Rash games for the main content. As listed1. Race to place in top 3 for cash. Complete the series for bonus cash.2. Use cash to purchase new bikes or upgrades to current bike. Repetition required until bike is worthy to enter tougher events.3. Battle with other racers and police for positions. Included occasional road rage motorist hit by your weapons or grazed by bike.4. More realistic non random roads/tracks and bike mechanics.Additional content or non campaign can feature the current game modes random tracks and all. With vast improvement to sound effects. Graphics frame rate needs improvement and/or update requirements. If I can run Farcry 4 at max graphics I shouldn't be suffering frame skips.If these changes get made before the final product I would recommend to others. Until then I will be checking up on it with each update.I was going to go negative but recommending in the hopes that reviews will be read and players requests will be answered.			"

								I've only played this game for a couple of hours so far but it's great fun, and can't wait for it to be feature complete. It brings back memories of Road Rash from the megadrive but with lots more added goodies. Grabbing people and riding them into oncoming traffic, grappling with the harpoon and jump jets and slicing other riders up with a longsword is awesome. Being able to play as Shovel Knight is an added bonus.Other things I like: Medieval weapons, guns, explosions, hallucination zones, grappling ninja speed runs, Shovel Knight, local multiplayer.  TL/DR: Liked Road Rash, but want more? Buy now.			"

								This is an awesome game if you loved the old arcade racers and Road Rash on the sega especially.  This is a lot like that but with more weapons, unlockable upgrade and co-op play.  Even in early access this is a fun game and worth the price for the nostalga and fun alone.  Works great with a xbox controller and has great potential.  The controls work great, haven't tried the keyboard at all to be honest.  I do hope more maps and modes are in the future.  Also the camera needs a reset or centering button.  I hope there is a lot more content because it seems like you could do the whole run in under 3 hours, if i can get half way across the map in 30mins I assum there can't be a long campaign.  Overall a fun game that I hope just keeps getting better.  Keep up the good work guys.			"

								If you are old school and remember how amazing Road Rash was on Sega Genesis, this is the game for you. However there is no bike customization, ie. grinding races to earn money to buy better parts for you bike, or buying a whole new bike. The  only customization lies within the skill system. With that being said it is an arcade racer, not a racing rpg like the old Road Rash. Never the less the game is early access and is quite fun. I am excited to play the final product.			"

								If you feel you docile nature to be... underwhelming... If you wish for a more action-filled persona, on with nerves of steel and temendous strength... If you want to roll down the highway giving people serious, life endangering injuries while weilding various edged, blunt, jagged, projectile, automatic, semi-automatic, explosive, hilarious weapons and making money, eating meat, tapping into your inner road rage sadist, and wearing a full suit of blue knight's armor with foot-and-a-half horns and a matching motorcycle, then look no further.This game will sate bloolust that you did not know you had, then create more just to sate that as well. (Almost) Every skull you crack open gives a pinatas worth of blue boost juice, sweet, creamy white experience, and cold, hard, green cash. You level up your body and bike alike with a simple well ordered skill tree type upgrade system, that will force you to get some essentials first, then free you up a bit to tailor your skills to your liking. But that's really irrelevent, because if you play your cards and wallet right, you'll be swimming in an olympic pool's worth of a mixture of cash and the aforementioned creamy, gooey, sticky white experience. And not long after that, you'll have the whole tree blooming with the fruits of your highway hunting.Don't want to start on level one anymore? Fine. Here's a permanent boost to level two. More XP, eh? Here's level three.Want to be stronger? Here's a boost to your overall attack power. Go bust some guys teeth out.More bullets for that gun you now have the option to start every level with? Here ya go, it's also permanent!My only complaints about this game contain just a couple of bugs and freezing issues that will most likely be handled in the full release and that there isn't enough variety of weapons. Right now there are only about four different environments (not including the SUPER MEGA ULTRA SECRET ONE), but that is something that I know will change.My only real complaints? Jump jet levels are boring and with the addition of The Headless Horseman (who unfortunately did not come with a matching bike) and Shovel Knight, that opens the door for more outlandish characters, instead of just a normal group of generic professional biker models, which is what all the other selectable characters are.Anyway, I fully encourage the purchase of this game, the playing of this game, the loving of this game, and the cheating on of your wives and girlfriends, but only on the condition that it's with this game.http://store.steampowered.comhttp://store.steampowered.com "

Well if So, Just you wait. You've found the Mantra of Road Rash in a PC. Do you like games? Games with cars? Games with cars and Motocycles? Oh Yeah, Add Cops, Gangs and rooftops...Have I forgotten anything? ♥♥♥♥ yeah! But who cares? This game's legit. 2 legit in fact. I'd suggest it to my friends and enemies. Multiple Graphics settings, From Cheese to Please... it's got it all.  Beautiful is kinda hokey, but looks great until it poops out.Button Mashing asskicking shooting people with gernade launcer kinda fun. ALL DAY.Now mind you, this is still in alpha.. I think? if not, It's probabbly an EA game, but if it's just in Alpha, then it's just a glimpse of how awesome this game is really going to be. Someone slobbered on about something something +campain mode.. and extra gameplay.. but screw all that... You like your games like you like your women, Hardcore. So that's where +Campain mode comes in to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over your face again and again. I hope you brought a bib, cuz this game's gonna feed you your♥♥♥♥♥and make you beg for seconds. Did someone say Mario Rip off? I say ♥♥♥♥en awesome! Yeah, You heard it right.. Rainbow Road ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. With Bad♥♥♥♥♥Motorcycles. and flaming helmets.. what? You need shells? I got Shells, a box filled to the brim. And Now it's Shooting time. Lets see how this AK does against your blue turtle. Yeah, that's what I thought.Oh yeah, Did I say Multiplayer? No? Oh yeah, cuz there is none. But who cares. This is a BAD♥♥♥♥♥GAME, No room for losers like multiplayer. This game is like masterbation, One on One.

								I would first like to say my friend got me this game last year around Christmas last year for a present. So where do I begin?Well when this game first came out, there was a lot of optimization problems with framerate and I don't think antialising was supported when it first arrived and they added it with a update along with all the settings and antistropic filtering, I'm giving this a thumbs up on it because this game reminds me of the old Road Rash 64 and the playstation 1 game and I love these type of games of riding a motor bike and wacking the bikers off as they try and kill you to get to the finish line. I don't play this game much but as a bordum I would recommend  this to anybody it's a fantastic game, the weapons in this game are fully loaded and there's a fall arsnal of guns, knives and c4 to do damage with and the optimizations of this game are all fixed, runs smoothly and is a great all round game in general. My computer specs are Processor, I7 6700 non k version skylake. My motherboard is the Asus Maximus viii itx board. and 16gb of ddr4 dominator  2100mhz. And my Graphics card is the Geforce GTX 980 4gb strix runs 1080p 60fps no problems.			"

								With the new update, I have to change my review a bit. I'm more going to review the update than the game as a whole.Pros- Handling much improved- Combat feels more smooth and responsive than it has in the past- Music and sounds are getting better.- Visuals have improved marginally- I like the stage setup more and the little bit of voice acting gives more personality- The nitro is significantly improved. It's actually useful now.- Ability to keep more weapons is a plus.- Using the Critical hit on kicks is soooo satisfying.Cons-F*ck the F*cking God**amn hallucinagen zones.-I still hate guns in the game. It just doesn't add anything fun to the gameplay.-I'd almost like another way to trigger the nitro. Everytime I feather the gas into a corner, I go flying.Overall, I'm happily changing from Thumbs down to up. There's still room for improvement, but it's a huge step in the right direction. More bikes to choose from would be neat. Any sort of customization would add some depth. Having some allies instead of just neutral would make a player feel like they're in a gang too and not just solo.			"

								I've pleyed a lot more since my new machine and the update, can honestly say this is going to be a real time sapper.It's not Road Rash, it's an ode to Road Rash.I remember playing the original RR with friends and 'taking turns til you die'.This is a lighter, though no less forgiving, modern itteration of a true classic.  Has the makings of a modern cult classic and with a bit more polish could be an absolute monster of a game.  Steep difficulty curve but ultimately rewarding as you grind your way up.

								I just finished my first run through the normal game mode and wanted to share my thoughts. Awesome game so far, and the devs. are updating it consistently!  One of the few early access games i would fully recommend.  Also, it's basically a full game,  only needs some minor work,  so grab it now before a price hike!  If you liked the old classic Road Rash, or sometimes wish you were able to bash other motorists without repercussion for poor driving, then this is your game. ProsEasy to pick up (Controller is HIGHLY recommended!!)  works great both m+k and controllerHuge Upgrade system. Each ""run"" you can upgrade temporary things, like increase in defense, more health, more stamina, etc.  After you die, you are then able to put your xp towards permanent upgrades like better starting bike/weapon, higher health, better starting weapon, etc.Varied race types such as Race, take down X number of baddies, time trial, only kicking and grabs, etc.Extremely fun and satisfying.  Every time i play i have a huge grin on my face, its one of those games that is just fun to pick up and playI have yet to have a crash or encounter any bugs.Room for improvementOnly a few locations (rooftop, desert, snow covered, and rainbow) could use one or two more. (Maybe a downtown, a suburban,  or a dirt race track)  Could use one or two more race types (Maybe like a tag style game where you have to bump another bike to ""tag"" it and the goal is to not be ""it"" when you cross the line, or something that incorporates your gang, like take down 5 baddies before they take down 5 of your gang.)Would be cool if you could actually name, customize and upgrade your bike gang in game.More use of your gang.  As of now it just feels like they are kind of getting in the way and not really all that helpful.  Would be cool if they actually followed/flanked you on some missions and were more active in taking down baddies.Posted 2/9/2015			"

								Update: I decided to change my feedback of this game from ""not recommended"" to ""recommended"". I actually had a chance to talk with the design team, and they were genuinely concerned with the comments I previously made. They have been contacting me asking if my previous issues have been addressed and after the latest update that was released on February 8th, 2015, the game is finally playable on my machine. I haven't encountered nearly as many game-breaking bugs as before either.Another thing I noticed with one of the recent updates is a ""tip"" to use ""jump jets"" when you are racing on the city rooftops. You can push the left bumper to hover up into the air to prevent falling to  your death. I didn't even know that there were ""jump jets"" in my initial review, which sort of gave me a ""AH HA!"" moment. I am still not a fan of the races on the rooftops, but to each his own I guess.Overall, the races are really fun and the team behind this game seem to take pride in their work. They are constantly improving the game and making it more stable on slightly older machines. My pc is a 4ghz quad core, 8gb RAM and I recently swapped out my graphics card with an Nvidia Geforce GTX 750 Ti 2gb. Keep in mind it's still an early access game, but they have finally polished it up enough to make it worth adding to your library.I also can't wait to see how the multiplayer modes turn out. If you are a Road Rash fan and want to get a quick combat-race fix, you should give this game a try.My older, original feedback/review of the game is below:------------------------------------------------------------------------I know this is an ""early access"" game, but it runs so poorly optimized on my pc that the game will run at 5 fps at certain points. I can run every  other game on my pc just fine and I have a decent graphics card (AMD R7 260x 2GB). The graphics are nothing to write home about, which makes me wonder where all of the wasted processing power is going. The game can be sort of fun when the frame rate is high enough, but even when I turn the settings to ""fastest"" and lower the resolution it doesn't help much.In terms of gameplay, it borrows many elements from Road Rash, but it has a ""rogue style"" element where you start over if you die, but can unlock additional perks at the end of each session. The levels are randomly generated, which adds variety, but this can also introduce game-breaking bugs. I had one level where you are racing on top of city skyscraper buildings and jumping from one roof to another. The only problem was the beginning of the race generated two building that were too far apart, making it impossible to land the jump across and finish the race.I don't hate this game, but at the same time I can't recommend buying it in its current state. I will update my review if some dramatic improvements are made to fix the frame rate issues and other bugs. The devs hearts are in the right place trying to make a Road Rash clone, but in the end it just makes me wish someone else out there could make a proper Road Rash sequel. This game feels too much like a rushed cell phone/tablet game than a proper console experience I was hoping for.			"

								It's Road Rash with 4 player splitscreen. Hyper-fast and tons of fun.Apparently Vs. hasn't been implimented as I write this and you can only do co-op - but that didn't stop me and my friends from whacking each others heads in with a wide variety of instruments.I like to have a range of easy to pick up local multiplayer games at the ready. This will probably start to come out at parties as much as Nidhogg or Samurai Gunn does. Cooler still the developer gives you their number when you complete the game to offer any critisims. This is exactly how early access should be done. Well done!			"

								As it is very, very unfiniished and very, very nuts and boltsLots of glitches, very basic menu navigation and optionsGraphically it has a long way to goAs for the Road Rash thing... at the minute it is as if the Dev was given a brief as to what the Rash was and left to set to work.However, it has great potential and so long as the Dev keeps working away worth a sale price.Look forward to the finished project.

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is awesome. Just like the old Road Rash games. Buy it to support the developers, but wait until it is finished to play it.Right now it's got all the cool gameplay elements it needs, but requires quite a bit of polish to truly make it great. The sounds seem to be placeholder and there are crashes every now and then.			"

								I did buy this game because i'm a fan of the old road rash game, which i did play alot in the ""old days"". I find this game right as much dependent to play as i did to road rash. I would like if there was some more bikes and riders, and a way to customize the color on them, i also miss a restart button when i'm paused to restart the race i'm going insted of drive the whole way the finish line. When this is told is this game one of my favorit game of all time.			"

								The game is totally awesome. Is keeping the same old structure as road rash, which was one of my fav multiplayer games(co-op) for consoles.The graphic is very good and game looks well optimized in singleplayer mode, split screen still v buggy and slow even on high end specs.I have tested(played) the game on two different computers: Windows 8.1 ( i7 4930k, 16GB ram, 970GTX, Evo SSD) and Mac OS Mavericks( I7 3820QM, 8GB Ram, Nvidia 680GT, Vortex 4 SSD).It works great with xbox controllers but I feel more confident to play with a keyboard and mouse.I can't wait to see the project done. Good job guys.			"

								UPDATE: In response to my review, the developer has re-given me a copy of the game again, claiming he has improved it and it's worth another try. Well, I'd definitely agree that it has been drastically improved since I first bought and then refunded it. The graphics and performace are now miles better and the game feels more responsive (althought I definitely recommend using a controller). I do still have issues with the 'floaty' physics of the game and the attack animations get very repetitive in my opinion.Most importantly however, the developer cares about his game and steadily improves it.All of this has compelled me to change my recommendation to a thumbs up, although perhaps on sale :)~~I could forgive the ugly graphics, less than stellar controls and awful physics engine if it was actually fun, but I got bored after a few races. Then it crashed, so I uninstalled and requested a refund immediately.~~			"

YouTube™ Video: Road Redemption Playthrough | Road Rage! | Episode 1 

			Views: 75		

			Lead your biker gang on an epic journey across the country in this procedurally-generated driving combat adventure. Steam Link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/300380/ Please remember to like and...		

Road Redemption is basically Downhill Domination from the PS2, only on motorcycles. I used to be addicted to DD, so seeing this game on Steam made me super pumped, and I instantly bought it.  To skip reading my review, check out my playthrough below, otherwise, you can continue reading for more: RR is a fast paced driving game, in which you're racing on a motorcycle against AI also on motorcycles, cars, and other vehicles. The game offers multiple different options of motorcycles to drive, from the Honda CBR to various choppers, and even different riders to choose from. There aren't a whole lot of options, but maybe more will be added in time, since I haven't unlocked any through playing just yet. The gameplay is somewhat laggy/jumpy even on Fastest quality setting, but it is early access so hopefully that will be cleared up. There is also no multiplayer option available, but I'd like to see the game more polished before trying to add others just yet. However, there is a split screen option available which is very rarely seen, and which I have not tried out just yet, although I don't see any reason for it to be any more laggy than single player.  In order to use the split screen option, the other players must use gamepads. There are plenty of obstacles to avoid, such as other cars on the road, poles, and even falling debris on some maps, which add a nice challenge to the game. Swinging weapons and shooting guns are failry straight forward and easy, although the controls are somewhat confusing. In order to grab or kick, you must have your camera facing the direction slightly that you want to kick or grab, while swinging your weapon only takes clicking either the left or right mouse button. So far, I have seen weapons such as shovels, crowbars, long swords, magnum revolvers, shotguns, pistols, and more, so you won't get tired of using the same weapon. Timing on the weapon swings feels just right, and I have plenty of fun knocking other riders off their bikes, or smashing enemy cars to destruction.The controls of the bike are where the game is lacking most, as the turning is either too drastic, or not enough. I find myself overcorrecting myself too often, and launching myself off the side of the map. The turbo is a nice touch though, and helps with catching up. Also, if you completely fail, the other riders will never be too far ahead, allowing you plenty of time and chances to come back before the finish line. Each race has 3 different levels/maps that you must complete, and each race gets progressively harder and adds more content to the game. If you fail one of the levels, you must restart the entire race, but your previous races, progress, and skill points will be saved. There are plenty of skills and perks to choose from and purchase, from increasing bike speed, armor, health, weapon durability, and tons more! Overall, this game was tons of fun, and I enjoy it a lot! I look forward to what the developers have in store for the final product, and I will continue to play as they continue polishing and improving this game.			"

								Love the game due to Road Rash, but this game could use some improvements. In the large scheme of things the game is awesome - mayhem on the road, on a motorcycle, with a weapon. It's the minute details that need a little tweaking in this game. I liked the screams and grunts when you hit people in the original Road Rash. If you're going to create a game about mayhem on the road, you should have that. Variety is deeply needed - variety in the courses, variety in the riders, variety in the motorcycles. I don't like that when my motorcycle is fully upgraded that there is no visible difference. Also, no choppers? I'm a motorcycle guy, and choppers wouldn't stand a chance in a race, but they're so iconic, why not have them---there's just so much more that could be done with the motorcycle designs --- the recent light cycle that was actually created from the Tron movie in real life as a bonus motorcycle? Anything? It would make sense to have a visible difference in the motorcycle if it has fully achieved the next level. The game itself is awesome, the minute details need a lot of tweeking to take this game further. The motorcycles, courses, and riders sorely lack any variety, which will kill the replay value. The roof level is horrific too. Why not have courses on a freeway, in a green country, on the coast, just look at Mario Kart for inspiration as to the location of the courses...anything but roofs...., but maybe I just haven't made it far enough in the game to get past desert and roofs. Also, the lack of the ability to choose the course and the nature of the course (race, take down the gang, take down the cops) is a bit of a bummer. Would be awesome if you could pick the course and choose what the goal of the course will be. Seems like the latter should be easy to accomplish, and it would greatly increase the replay value.			"

								This game is so fun! Road Redemption is, in a nutshell, a racing game where you are able to shoot, smack, kick, or do anything you can to knock your opponets off of their motorcycles while racing to complete an objective. It is in early access right now because there isn't a whole lot of stuff, but my god is it fun! I'm surprised this idea hasn't been done before! (unless it has I don't know) I can't wait for future updates for this game to see where it goes!			"

								Hey I absolutely Love this game but I want to suggest some updates needed I am going to make this post here and on the forums so more people can see it.Okay there needs to be an ai update because sometimes I will be riding down a road and I will see a bunch of riders not doing anything not approaching me not fighting each other. The fighting should be random so anyone should be fighting anyone at any given time.There should be a few levels that are added to the game like a street level where it is nothing but skyscrapers and you are going through a city.A super hilly level that goes up and down kind of like san fransisco. A level that is dark and spooky that is nothing but a forest at the dark of night. On top of that you should have incoming traffic coming from both sides so accidents can happen from that as well.It would be crazy coming across an intersection and a car or a truck destroys everything right in front of you or you get hit.  Where is the gasoline trucks that you shoot at the truck and it explodes or it makes the ground slippery but you shoot at it the whole roadway turns to flames and people who go into that get turned into fire. Where are the mines you can lay out and make people blow upWhere are the extreme jumps where you jump for 10-seconds 20 seconds on to the street and you have an air batle with someone.There should be formations that riders make with gangs. Like across the whole road A straight line vertically a star formationa circle a squarea diamondyou can do this in so many ways that would make the game interesting You can even make gangs have special formations like the 666 gang have a pentagram as their formation. With this in the game you would have to make decisions on the formations alone and it would allow unique gameplay experiences.You can do this with cops and cars too. make all the formations go in sync with each other and have them attack other gangs in front of you or cars or cops and let them have no remorse for anyone but themselves.You could even make them be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s where they bump you back and forth between each other and this should happen with other riders too that are not you so you can be like oh♥♥♥♥♥♥these guys are coming I need to protect myself. All these different formations should come with new types of gangs and weaponslike a punk gang who has punk atire and mohawks. With the punks they have brass knuckles and they punch their victims off.A death metal gang who has long hair black clothing maybe they can headbang and you can hear music come from them and they have knives or machetes or chainsaws.A black metal gang that could have the same thing as above but in black metal style. A grunge gang with grunge clothing and their weapon is ciggarettes /alcohol bottles/ heroin needlesA stoner gang who uses pot paraphenilia to attack their enemies.A mob like gang who use vintage weapons and dress up like gangstersA ninja gang who use nunchuks and ninja starsThis can go onand onand on with as many gangs as you create. Then when you have more then one gang fight amongst each other they will have their set style and fighting style. You should be able to hijack other bikes and make it challenging so if you mess up you fall off.Other people should be able to do the same to you. Also police should be able to pull you over Make it so you can get away but make it a challenge for you to get pulled overMake it so they can pull over other people even people that you are in a race against and they do not even care about you.You can make choke points where they set up barriers They can hit you and make your bike wobble at the end. Just do all cop things even make those things that pop your tire You can see cops in the distance and then they follow you after you pass them.This is all the ideas I got right now.			"

HOWEVER, with the latest update the game has improved dramatically. + More story+ More characters and bikes+ More meaningful stats for characters+ Improved Graphics+ More and New Music+ Positive balance changesThe latest update has upped the fun factor and breathed new life into this game. Its pretty solid as is now. If they can get some of the other features tuned, and the online multiplayer up and going good, this will be a legendary game!			"

								Game used to be fun - it's not awful but it's gone the wrong direction since I've been playing. Weapon system didn't need changed, somehow the handbrake does less than it used to (which was still a complaint), ai still as rubber-bandy and poorly skilled as usual. The on road pickups (health, nitro, jump jet fuel) are a nice addition but not enough. Maps have improved a bit but missions seem easier/more boring. Don't know if harpoon is still glitchy but gun damage still isn't affected by range.Edit: Similar feelings though a bit better. The dev just doesn't know how to implement a challenge naturally. It's artifical as ♥♥♥♥.			"
