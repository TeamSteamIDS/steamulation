												This is a very tentative recommendation. I really want to love this game to bits. It creates a really interesting small scale tactical experience that I've never seen in another game. It is not a shooter. Don't expect something like Conflict Desert Storm.The problem is this game is fairly broken. There's horrendous performance issues and the sound is bugged to hell.The performance issues are largely caused by the game constantly trying to contact a server that no longer exists. To find this you can add the following line to your hosts file: ""127.0.0.1 fswpc.available.gamespy.com""If you don't know what a hosts file is you probably shouldn't try to attempt this. It's a system file and that means it's serious business.The sound problems have no simple fix. You'll just have to live with constantly glitched sound if you want to experience this game.			"

												A perennial favorite, FSW has always been dogged by being a game that is difficult to pigeonhole. Is it a third-person cover-based shooter? Is it a strategy game? Is it a puzzle game? It is a unique combination of all three that combined forms a whole greater than its parts. Unfortunately, gamers expecting  a single genre tended to be discouraged by this unusual mix and the game never got the recognition it deserved.Despite its age - and all the technical difficulties that entails running it on a modern PC - the game's visuals remain surprisingly attractive, and it is not difficult to lose oneself in the fantasy of a fighting through the streets of the war-torn Middle East. There numerous incidental animations - be it a civilian scurrying for shelter, birds scattering as you approach or the laundry flapping in the wind - make the game's world seem alive and keep you on your toes at the same time. But it's the gameplay that is the real star; leading my two squads through the dangerous, twisting streets of fictional Zekistan felt more realistic and true-to-life than all the Calls of Duty - or even Arma - games combined. Your crew's limited toolset - a handful of movement and attack options - are more than sufficient to engage and defeat the enemy if combined with a bit of cunning. It is almost puzzle like; ""If I move fireteam Alpha /here/ and then toss smoke like this, the enemy will react like /that/, allowing me to maneuver fireteam Bravo into position /there/!"" Figuring out the optimal method to not only kill the enemies but also do so in a way that minimizes casualties and ammunition use is amazingly  satisfying (fortunately, for those less talented, you can often ""brute-force"" your way through most challenges). The game's difficulty curve is gradual and never overwhelming.The AI is not particularly skilled but can at times be gratingly tenacious, and failing to keep your team in cover will often result in the quick loss of several soldiers. Fortunately, the tangos' skill set is even less complex than that of your troops - mostly they just hunker down behind some cover and take potshots at you, although a few do use grenades - but they make up for this deficit with numbers and being well placed. Attempt to maneuver around them and they often - but not always - will seek new shelter, requiring you to trap them between your two teams coming at them from different directions. The occasional heavy weapon (rocket launcher or machine gun), tank or technical adds to the challenge and variety. Unfortunately - and this is the greatest fault of the game - the initial locations of the enemies is hard-coded into each level, which greatly reduces the replayability of the game. Best of all, once the mission is over, you can watch a replay to relive your successes (or failures), and even - should you chose - jump into the action at any point. Would that other games offered this feature!Released in 2004, Full Spectrum Warrior can be difficult to get working on modern computers; in my case, I had to edit my HOSTS file, tinker with the soundcard settings and muck around in a configuration file before I got acceptable performance from the game. Even then, the dialogue was filled with pops and crackles. Nonetheless, the quality of the game was well worth the effort.Full Spectrum Warrior remains one of the forgotten classics of gaming and those willing to go into the experience with an open mind will be well rewarded with a challenging and exciting game.

												The original pulisher use to be THQ but it was mostly sold off towards the new owners Nordic Games. So far there has not been any attempt to provide an official forum sticky of contacting for support regarding games they now own the best way to  contact them is to reach them via the store page and look under info. I' am operating with Win 7 Home edition. The game works alright but just a warning this is an older title so this will not be the ""best"" in sound or video by todays standards. There are common reports of audio ""clicking"" or the game completely unable to start. So please make sure to check with Nordic Games about issues with graphics, OS, or any other problem. This game is ONLY compatible with Windows XP, 2000. So even if you run this program in compatibility mode it still might not work. I use to play this game on the original Xbox back in 2005 I believe.I had alot of fun when I played this before and for me this game had alot of replay factor. I still have not played the 2nd one yet but I do own both. I found that using a controller was easier for this game's mechanics involving orders and camera movment. It is not so bad using the keyboard and mouse, just have to get use to it.As this title is around 10 years old, I would recommend you look elsewhere for a newer game. Your time (and money) will be better spent.In the end the choice is all up to you. Thanks for reading!Jay			"

												Absolutely brilliant game. Couldn't recommend more great for any tactical gamer who wants a modern twist. Sure ArmA has better graphics but this will run on most systems, currently playing on a laptop. However the graphics are pretty good for the age of the game, the tactics are easier to handle imo than ArmA aswell as a change from the first person shooter gameplay of the flashpoints, ArmA and other less tactical shooters. Massive game. BUY IT!However there is no DayZ. Downsides.			"

												Ah, the memories. The first in the Full Spectrum Warrior series and it is a pretty fun game. Less hardcore than the second but still very strategic. Command 2-3 squads depending on the missions. Command, point fire, suppress, flank, eliminate enemy, the basics of the game. Shows you how soldiers perform on the battlefield. It's a pretty fun overall game. The story is not as intense as the second one but still a pretty good story. This game is just too much fun. It is faster than the second and very playable. The tactics is just so much fun!!!! You better own it! 9.5/10!!! Get it!!!!!!!!			"

												Full Spectrum Warrior is a great game, though it is old, and it clearly shows. I remember playing this game on the origianl Xbox, and I enjoyed it so much that I remember that I ended up writing a report on it, as well as doing some research on it as well. Originally an Army idea to train soldiers, the game gave also saw the rise of another training aid that replaced the game, and created a bit of a controversy. The game uses the typical Army scenario of a conflict in a made up country, using information from real world areas to make up things like demographics. You end up taking command of a squad, composed of two fireteams that mirror eachother in layout but have some different characters that attempt to give you a connection to the men; sort of giving them life. Going through various missions, you will occasionally pick up a Charlie team to help complete objectives, and utilize the sitrep system to save your progress. The game can be tough, as it requires you to be a mix of cautious but aggressive. You need to use both teams to effectively move around the mission area, and to obviously complete your objective; this idea will get hammered into your brain fairly often and early on. Teammembers can get wounded, though I do believe the limit is one per team, and anymore then that will cause the mission to fail. If a teammember is wounded you only have so long to get to them before they bleed out, at that point one of your other soldiers must firemen carry, and you need to drop him back off at a CASEVAC/Resupply point; this eliminates another soldier from being combat effective. Though once you pick him up you can take your sweet time. The game is not an FPS, not a TPS, if you haven't guessed already. Instead it is a real time squad tactics game, with some somewhat lackluster camera angles. However its a good buy that will keep you busy for several hours to say the least, and it has sequal out that adds some cool new features as well; like buddyteams. A fun game, and perhaps it connects more to me since I played it when it came out, and it harks back to those military days. Embrace the suck without actually embracing the suck.			"

												FSW is a difficult game to rate. It is a SIMULATION of infantry tactics, not strictly a game. Careful deployment of soldiers and proper use of cover and overwatch is what will win the day and bring them back alive at the end of the day, not heroic charge. Despite the look, this is NOT a FPS, but a third-person game where you give commands to your four man team or split the team into two halves and have them coordinate in pausable real-time. The problem with this game is the commands are clunky, and the campaign is... difficult. The autosave don't seem to kick in at the right time. Being a 2004 game graphics are subpar but good for its days, and each ""level"" had to be approached like a tactical puzzle. Do you setup watch in this corner? Flank? Do you have enough ammo? Where is the CASEVAC point? Failure to use good infantry tactics will result in massive casualties, and sometimes, even if you did use tactics, sometimes, Murphy's Law applies and you will lose nonetheless. So should you get this game? IMHO, no. THQ is no more and its assets had been sold off to various bidders who don't really have any more support for it. And I personally think the FPS: Close Combat: First to Fight is a better sim for infantry tactics as its a true FPS with squad ordering, more visceral that way.			"

												This was one of the main games I played as a kid, other than SOCOM.Its honestly one of the best military games I've ever played. You take command of two squads. You are the leader, but you dont control him like you would in COD. Instead, you tell your squads where to move, when to provide covering fire for the other squad to move, what area to cover, etc. When one of your members is shot in this game, you will need to have one squad pick them up, while the other squad covers them. Then the squad who picked him up will need to carry him to the medic station.You have tools such as frags grenades, smoke grenades, calling in artillery, commanding a soldier to use a grenade launcher on a specific spot, etc.This game is still great after all these years. It has authentic visuals, and the squads movement animations can be very appealling to see, if you are a fan of Navy Seals or other special operations forces. You will not be running-and-gunning, you will not be jolting side-to-side to avoid enemy fire, and you will not be 360-no-scoping anyone. The main key in this game is cover and flanking.			"

												While there are merits to Full Spectrum Warrior, I cannot recommend the game. I have little doubt that when the game launched in 2004, it was top-of-the-line, however, it has aged poorly.To start, the visuals are not a problem. Yes, they are dated, but they still hold up surprisingly well. The sound, however, is buggy. Sometimes effects make noise, sometimes they don't. At the very least, the voice-overs are in sync.That's the good news. The bad news is that the gameplay is massively dated. After having played games like XCOM, Men of War,  Dawn of War 2, and Red Orchestra 1&2, I cannot say I enjoy playing Full Spectrum Warrior. The premise is novel, squad-based combat, multiple fireteams, cover that actually acts like cover. However, the interface is bad and as a result, the game is not fun to play. The visual cues are poorly placed and hard to see and the controls are far from optimal.The gameplay itself is interesting, however, the locked camera view and clunky controls make it very difficult to efficiently order your fireteams around. This is especially problematic when making use of destructable cover as whole fireteams can be wiped out before you can get your soldiers into flanking positions. Furthermore, Marine marksmanship apparently counts for nothing, as no matter what, enemies in cover cannot be hit.I wanted to like this game, but in the end the clunky controls and almost nonexistent GUI killed the experience for me. My recommendation? Find a paintball or airsoft field and play the real thing.			"

												the cool fireteam-based movement system is completely ruined by your men's reluctance/inability to shoot at enemies, which is a pretty crucial abiliTY TO HAVE in a warzoneyour guys will only shoot when you tell them to, and you do that by telling them to watch a certain area.  if an enemy enters this sector they're watching, they will open fire.this would be cool, but if this enemy is behind any sort of cover (and therefore invincible) your guys will just keep dumping and wasting ammo on him until you tell them to stopsometimes enemies get flushed out of cover, and they finally become possible to kill.  but the only way you can get that opportunistic kill is if you already had a team ineffectively shooting at them ahead of time (and wasting ammo) or if you're incredibly fast at telling them to start firing before he gets away.  if your squad sees a guy get flushed out and run out of his cover, they will NOT fire and will sit there and watch him run away.  so your choices are either waste ammo, or let him escape.if you don't explicity tell them when and where to shoot, every time, they'll just stand there and watch an enemy walk up to them and shake their hand.  I'm not sure if there's a ""weapons free"" mode I missed somewhere that gives them a little more discretion as to when they fire, but right now your squad will sit there with their mouths hanging open while they watch an enemy run across an empty parking lot instead of picking him off.even when you do tell them where to fire, they only watch a very tiny area.  there is not 360 degree awareness option/formation.  instead of intelligent thinking soldiers it feels like you're commanding a squad of pacifist robots.if you want a squad-based shooter with suppression and flanking mechanics, just play the Brothers in Arms series			"

												Terrrible port is terrible.Running on Windows 7 x64 Ultimate, I suffered from frequent instances of the game suddenly forgetting all of the control bindings, causing the game to be completely uncontrollable -- requiring a close via task manager and a reset of the profile, preventing any progress in the game.There are also serious problems with audio quality (which is understandable for an Xbox port, really), including on occasion dropped sounds and static interference.I always wanted to play this game, but never had the chance to do so.  Unfortunately, that is still the case.			"

												This game is riddled with issues due to it not being updated in years, good luck trying to run it on a modern PC. Chances are you will have unplayable FPS, fear not though, that happened to pretty much everyone and there are plenty of fixes. Problem is none of those fixes worked for me, maybe it will work for you I don't know but even if you fix the framerate which is already annoying enough as is you'll still have to deal with other issues like audio stutter and clipping in cinematics. And god forbid you decide to try out playing online or even LAN.As it stands the game is nigh unplayable and should be avoided. It's a shame though because it's a really good game.			"

												Too bad!! This game totally can't run right now. It has many bugs in new pc, in win7 and no one want to fix it. It should have a patch.			"

Amazing cinematics and visuals, but lacks entertaining gameplay.Think of this game as Brothers In Arms, but not being able to move freely, it sucks a**.5/10 "

												I honestly couldn't play this game. Since it came out a long time ago, it runs better on a single core system. So I tried to disable multi core operations for it to see if it'd run better. But unfortunately it still ran at roughly one frame per second. I'd love to play the game and enjoy it, but I simply can't.			"

												This is one of those ""never judge a book by its cover"" games. I judged it by its cover when it was on sale (luckily) but it is a waste of time and money. You get groups of people and you have to accomplish the missions in a ""strategy"" style. It really sucks don't get it unless you like that stuff			"

												I never thought I'd see an opening splash screen lag so badly. However, when I got to the main menu, I felt a surge of hope the game would actually run better. Everything was going so smoothly, that is, until I went into a mission. I honestly wouldn't buy this, regardless of how cheap you may find it in future sales. I'm sure it was perfectly fine, if only it ran higher than around 5 fps (and .02 FPS for the splash screen). I cannot reccomend this whatsoever.DO NOT BUY!EDIT - I don't have a bad computer, granted its not running a GTX Titan, it should be able to run anything (maybe with lower settings), and well meets the system requirements to run THIS game. At the time, I was using a weaker PC, but it wasn't terrible either. In comparison to other games I was playing at the time, this game looked worse, and had abysmal performance. Anyone questioning my PC should consider that the begging screen (when they show the publisher/dev) shouldn't have been going at such a low frame rate (taking minutes for a 15 - 20 second animation) regardless of my hardware. Even at the lowest setting I could run this at, it the framefrate really tanked. I'll launch it up to see if my current PC does any better, but still, my review stands.			"

												Full Spectrum Warrior is definitely showing it's age, mostly in the fact that it's barely functional on modern PCs and less that it didn't age well. You should save your $5-10 and go get a PS2 version if you really feel the need to play this game.			"

												The U.S. Army is the most powerful ground force in the entire world. The backbone of a ground invasion is the U.S. Army Infantry, and in the midst of combat, their skills, courage, and teamwork are put to the test. While readiness continues to be the U.S. Army's top priority, how it goes about its business is changing. Full Spectrum Warrior began as a training aid for the U.S. Army to reinforce Army doctrine and team effort within the troops. It is the most realistic portrayal of Infantry-level urban warfare via unique tactical action gameplay. Players become the Squad Leader, commanding Alpha and Bravo squads. There is potential for danger down every alley, behind every window. Watch those angles folks, we've got a job to do here. Hooah! - Unique combination of tactical and action gameplay. - Authentic implementation of U.S. Army Infantry doctrine. - Simple control scheme lets you command eight soldiers in real time. - Squad equipment reflects real weaponry and equipment currently in use by the U.S. Army. - Immersive urban environments with danger around every corner. - 2-player co-op, each player controls one fire team. - Includes 2 exclusive bonus levels not available on Xbox.

												It's a squad command game, and if it was the only around in its day then it would have been pretty cool. However, it absolutely does not stand the test of time. Antiquated mechanics and a resolution that maxes at 1024 really make this game not worth anyone's time. Go play the legenary Arma 3			"
