AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Fieldrunners 2 Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Tower Defense, Strategy, Action, Casual  My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-35 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWFieldrunners 2 is a fun tower-defense game that lacks any true innovation but is very well-crafted across all of the fundamental aspects of the genre.  Anyone who is a fan of the genre should find this game enjoyable, and should be happy to have it in their library. This game is a large improvement over the first one in the franchise.  All of the core gameplay from the first game is still evident in this, with many tweaks and improvements.  Anything you could find in the first game, you can find in this one— but better.  There is also significantly more variety to game modes and level design.Great fundamentals are at the heart of this game; everything a good tower-defense game needs to do right, Fieldrunners 2 does right.  Also, the wide variety of game modes, map designs, and difficulty levels all contribute to the diverse and enticing core gameplay.  The lighthearted nature and cartoonish humor inherent in the graphics and soundscape encapsulate a charming identity that makes the game unique.  A ridiculously large amount of towers to unlock, random event bosses, and achievements add a satisfying amount of replay value.  Fieldrunners 2 has a lot of good things going for it.The game can be quite difficult at the highest difficulty.  Normally, not a bad thing.  But some levels require an extremely specific solution that, for the average gamer, can take away some of the fun of trying to solve the levels via your own experimentation.  If you get stuck on a level and don’t want to look up the solution online, you can grind coins by playing the game and then buy items or unlock new towers to facilitate your victory.Fieldrunners 2 is a good game, and a great tower-defense game.  There may be no groundbreaking features, but it does have a charming, unique identity and sound fundamentals.  Anyone who truly is an advocate of the genre should enjoy playing this.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												I didn't really care for the first Fieldrunners game, but the developers tweaked, streamlined and improved the game. I am really happy with the improvements. Its not just the same map with a different background. There is an actual campaign instead of just unlocking maps. The game does a really good job of instructing you and easing you into the game without forcing tutorial levels on you. The graphics and animations are also a lot better than the original game. The fun facts / tips make the game feel more alive. There are now items to use and you can pick your own towers that you'll be able to use.Fieldrunners 2 is a very simple and shallow tower defense game with a cartoon look. The game consists of a campaign of several unique maps. You start with a certain amount of cash to buy your towers. You can place these towers anywhere, well almost anywhere. The enemies don't attack, they just run from their starting gate or gates all the way to your base. The game says your base, by base, I assume they mean your gate, because you don't see a base. These are basically open courtyards. If enough enemies get into your base, you'll lose the game. The limit is 20. I am very happy the game maps don't force you to do 100 waves, instead its 20, 30, 40 and so on waves. It makes the game feel much less of a chore when you can breeze through levels. There are other objectives too, like defeat X number of runners within Y time. The maps are really beautiful with a great art style. Far better and more diverse than the original game.You're tasked with arranging these towers, making walls of towers, and making a winding path for enemies to follow. Basically make a maze of towers. Can you plug a gap and make an unsolvable puzzle? Nope. The enemies will plod through from left to right. If something blocks their way, they'll path around it, but not intelligently. They'll chose a path that can end up having more of your towers. Some maps have paths already predetermined. There is a wide variety of enemies, standard soldiers, a heavier soldier, they'll eventually get jeeps, motorcycles, tanks, helicopters and giant robots. What do they all do? Just walk. Again they don't attack you. The helicopters and planes will at least fly over your towers in a straight line headed for your gates. There are now troop transports that when they explode, the troops come out and keep running. Your job is to destroy them before they enter your gate.Now that we've covered the enemies, let's talk about the towers, there are a few types of towers based on what mode you're on. Before each map / level, you'll fill 6 tower slots with towers you've unlocked by buying them with coins you earn for beating levels. This was a great change from the previous game that forced you to have 4 or 6 specific towers. Gun towers with short range, goo towers, that have a longer range, but will shoot goo to temporarily slow enemies down, there are oil towers that do the same thing, but to multiple enemies and the effect doesn't last that long. Next up there are long range missiles, which are great to have, there are bomb spitters that I feel are too similar to missiles. There are new laser towers that don't have an attack radius, but rather can attack up, down, left, right in a line. You can upgrade each and every tower by right clicking it and selecting to upgrade it for a price. Do you want to know which towers do the most damage? The stats are in the help menu item, but they should be hover items that just appear when you go to select which tower you'd like to place. There are new usable items as well, things like air strikes and mines. They're a nice feature in the game. The tower guns turn, but the electro towers don't turn and you'll pay extra for it. You can hit the space bar to pause the game to plop down towers, but there are only two speeds, normal and fast.The previous game had you type in your name for the high score, this game just uses your Steam name. There are 3 difficulties for every map / level and I think it just adds waves onto the difficulty instead of making the enemies more difficult. The achievements are more time consuming than they are difficult. Its pretty easy to get them, but you'll invest 2 hours for the first one, which is a far cry from the first game where you could achieve the first few within a few minutes of the game. I wouldn't bring up achievements if the game didn't have 50+ and the previous game had 90+.Overall, its a great upgrade from Fieldrunners 1. Its worth a try, and it might feel more like a mobile game than a PC game, but its still a fun little game.			"

												8/10Overview: Traditional Tower DefenseThe Good:+ Bright colorful graphics. Towers, enemies and special effects are unique, vibrant and can be easily distinguished from one another especially when a lot is happening on screen. + 25 levels spread across different game modes and 3 difficulty levels. Each map provides a different entry/exit points along with different obstacles/hazards that you can use to your advantage. + Multiple game modes: Survival is your traditional tower defense game. Time attack has you killing a certain amount of enemies before time runs out. Sudden Death pits you against a never ending massive wave of enemies, forcing you to kill a certain amount. Puzzle mode is a twist on the standard tower defense formula by changing some of the rules forcing you to think very carefully where you place towers on the map. +28 different tower types, 23 different types of enemies and 5 rare elite enemies that randomly show up in certain maps. Each tower is unique and has its own strengths and weaknesses.+The game has items that can be purchased with coins that you get by completing levels. These itmes are completely optional as every level can be completed on the hardest difficulty without them. The items are a good way to perfect your strategy and provide some help on some of the harder maps.+ The achievements are much more bearable than its predecessor. Only a limited amount of achievements require grinding+ Good difficulty balanceThe Average:The game is an ios port and that may turn some people off. In order to get items and some of the new towers you first must purchase them with coins. Coins are collected after every map. These however are strictly optional and are not required to finish the game. In app purchases have been removed from this version and the cost of each item/tower is significantly reduced over the ios counterpart. You will gain a lot of coins simply by playing the game and I never felt the need to grind for coins other than for an achievement. The Bad- Does very little to innovate the genre ConclusionThis is a great tower defense game and makes some significant improvements over the first one. Anybody looking to get into the genre or is looking for a new game to play, this is a great game to check out just to expect anything new or exciting. "

												As a tower defence game, this is brilliant, there are loads of towers, lots of replayability as harder difficulties are almost impossibkle without some of the later locked towers, 25 missions across multiple modes including some which really get you thinking.The ONLY thing I would of quite liked is if you could set turret targets, such as simaing for the enemy most health, least health, highest speed etc. Otherwise from that I don't see how they could of made it any better.A deffinate 5 stars from me.

												A semi-open enenmy pathing mechanic makes this game exceptional.  Similar to how sanctum works, the enemy path is created by you as you maze your towers as effectively as possible.  Enemy re-pathing isn't always consistent and can lead to difficulty disigning mazes at harder levels that limit your design by introducing new level mechanics or obstacles.  Good fun overall and recommended for any casual td player.			"

Personal rating 3/10Although I'm a big tower defense fan and I only played it half an hour I already can't recommend it. Why?1) it is obviously a tablet game. That means there aren't many functions, everything is realy big and the gameplay is very slow. The first level after the tutorial takes 50 waves and there isn't even a ""next wave"" button, only fast forward but it still takes far too long to end it.2) It has micro transactions although it costs 10€ and that is definitely a rip off. You need the coins to unlock new towers or helpful ingame items. And if you don't want to invest money you have to connect it to facebook and twitter and that is one thing I don't appreciate when you are indirectly be forced to do some ""free advertising"" for a game.3) The enemies are very one dimensional. That means the only get faster or more health and as the waves progress they just get more health over time. So you are fighting the same enemies over and over again.In my opinion you might be still able to enjoy it but I don't think it can be long-lasting.If there would be a possibility to install steam games on a tablet then I might play it more often.

												By far one of the worse tower defence games made.Its obviously going for the mobile market and was never made for PC.there are very few enemy types that come at you. They might look like the same enemy but they get harder as the match goes on.The difficulty levels go from kindergarden to impossible.It's intended to be beat on easy, then normal, then hard. you unlock turrets as you win matches. so the only way you can win harder matches is by using turrets you dont have.Steam has better Tower defence games made for PC and not android/IOS			"

												Personally, I can't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy this game. I was impressed with the original Fieldrunners and when Fieldrunners 2 came out, I was blown away. They took a great game and made it 1000% better and more enjoyable, which I didn't think was even possible. Once you get into this game you may very easily be hooked, as I am. The Heroic difficulty is challenging, but after gaining some experience (and unlocking more towers), you'll find they're not nearly as insurmountable as they seem at first.For those concerned about having to buy coins (with ""real"" money) in order to beat all levels and earn all acheivements, I totally disagree. I started playing the game on iOS and have since unlocked every achievment in the game. I have subsequently started playing on Android and Steam (now my preferred platform--love the large screen experience and the convenient keyboard controls). I have never spent a penny on In-App Purchases (sorry, Subatomic Studios). You can earn plenty of coins simply through normal game play. As for the Steam version, I am only 1 acheivement away from collecting them all--and that one is just a matter of time since it's the ""play once a week for 6 months"" card. I'll have no problem there, because I can't stop playing. Even after seemingly accomplishing every challenge the game has to offer, there's always room for improvement so my current activity involves finding better strategies to get the highest score possible, and learning new and creative ways to use various towers.For my tastes, this game is a good as it gets. I don't know if there are plans for a Fieldrunners 3, but I can't imagine improving much on what they've already done here (though I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it). I would just like to see more maps and challenges to conquer! I would rate it a solid 10 out of 10.			"

												In it's simplest and purest form, this Strategy game proves once more that bigger / complicated isn't always better. Unlike some other Tower Defense games, you can really influence the game because you have to make a path for the units. It's not liked the locations for the towers are fixed. Whenever a Tower Defense game makes use of this type of Tower Placement, it already scores a lot of points on my list.The core of the game is very solid, the levels are very challenging ( Depending on one of the three difficulties ) and the amount of control you can practise on the battlefield is amazing. This can be done by making complicated choices between Quanitity and Quality. For Example: Do i want to build 4 more chaingun towers? Or do i want to build a tower that slows units down, thus giving the excisting towers more time to destroy them. And do i want to spread the towers out over the map or do i want a very dense 'killing zone'?I can certainly recommend this game. Even to people that aren't into Tower Defense games. If you're doubting, just do it!			"

												I only paid 2 dollars and 49 cents for this game, yet still I regret that I purchased this complete and utter shash. Fieldrunners 2 is simply a terrible tower defense game in every single respect. Obviously aimed at mobile money markets with microtransactions removed for PC, this is definitely the worst tower defense game I've played in several years. Generic cartoony graphics don't even attempt to hide the lack of originality or character (but still somehow the game has long load times even on 2500k @ 4ghz, GTX 780, 16gb DDR3, and SSD). The levels, characters, and art design are generic flash TD fodder and have not a single iota of verve, originality, or even competence. Seriously, I wonder if all the other products that this game rips off even realize it? For example I bet Valve doesn't realize that they stole the TF2 Heavy model and animations almost verbatim (plus the TF2 soldier model and anims, just to name two), and several other models and animations have been copied slavishly from other titles. There are almost no options in the game for anything whatsoever. As far as I can tell there is no hotkey to instantly restart a level, or to bring up the normal ESC menu with the normal options. Apparently you have to click on it, because if you hit ESC it instantly asks you if you want to quit the game. Clueless, greedy, incompetent mobile devs. Yuck.Beyond the simplistic mobile approach and total lack of creativity, competency, or imagination, the worst failing of Fieldrunners 2 is that it's built entirely around the worst TD grind mechanics you can imagine, and they're all hidden invisibly underneath a layer of flash/mobile simplicity. The waves are seemingly endless, randomly thrown together without thought, and invisibly leveled in HP while still using the same models and animations, with no indication that the enemies are gaining massive amounts of HP. There is no ""next wave"" button or indication of what the next wave comprises. One of the earliest levels has 50, yes FIFTY equally boring and generic waves, most of which comprised identical looking enemies whose HP scaled invisibly up to the moon. Who likes that? Maybe someone on mobile who has never seen a tower defense game, but even then only for the first hour or two. I get that the game sucks and grinds purely to drive microtransactions, but I rebel against this negative approach to game design. It creates enemies out of your customers and generally makes people hate you. -I- personally hate you, Subatomic Studios, for this game. You created an enemy out of me, and I will make sure to track your company in the future purely to avoid your products and warn people about how much you suck. This game should have never been released on PC, or anywhere. It is trash. Total, complete, and utter trash.			"

												I've played a ton of Tower Defense games and while nothing comes close to Defense Grid, this is really great. Compared to the first game that was pretty mediocre, the developers listened to the playes and changed everything around: Towers now show where they shoot, so the Lightning Tower that only shows in 4 directions doesn't have a  circle but the 4 directions. You get informations about how much DPS the various Towers actually do and the maps are a lot more creative with bridges and trenches and the ability to make the Fieldrunners go in circles like idiots....there's nothing better than that. There are a lot more weapons and the special weapons you need to buy with coins you collect, i don't think that forcing a player to ""like"" the game on Facebook and Twitter in exchange of coins is a good way, but you'll earn enough of them by playing the game regardless. There are puzzle maps too and a lot more story and special unique enemies like a legendary panzer and even the Hindenburg. It's way better than the first one and highly recommended to every one who likes Tower Defense.			"

												If you enjoyed Fieldrunners 1, or like tower defense games, this is a pretty good tower defense game. With that being said, if you're looking for innovation, you won't find it here, unless you're a fan of IOS-styled games on Steam. I'm a sucker for games in the style of Kingdom Rush (get 3 stars on each level to unlock extra towers, etc), so this game tickled my fancy.If you like tower defense, give this game a try; but if you're looking for something new in the world of tower defense games, this game definitely doesn't innovate the series.

Each level has three difficulty levels, along with options like endless, time attack, and so on.   So if you don't want to buy every td game out there, and just want one that has a little bit of everything, this is a decent choice.			"

What I do not like but is the fact you can get more coins by liking there facebook and you see this at the end of every match. That just annoys me. Also I would love to see a death count for each turrret like in Balloon Tower Defense as it is handy to see what is not pulling its wait. Aside from that this game is great though you should play the first aswell.			"

												Gut gemachtes Tower Defense Spiel.Die verschiedenen Spielmodi:Überleben von RundenX-Anzahl von Fieldrunners innerhalb einer bestimmten Zeit eleminierenPuzzle Screens..Fieldrunners mit beschränkten Mitteln durch Tore/Minen schickenZur Hilfe stehen einem dabei jede Menge von verschiedenen Türmen zur Verfügung.Die meisten muß man durch erspielte Sterne oder Münzen freischalten.Außerdem gibt es noch (ebenfalls zu kaufende) Hilfsmittel wie Minen.Natürlich kann man die ausgewählten Türme (in einigen Szenen werden sie vorgegeben) im Spiel selbst nur dann setzen, wenn genügend Geld durchs elemenieren der Runnervorhanden ist. Diese Türme können dann noch aufgewertet werden.Zwischendurch können noch Sonderziele wie z.B. Der rote Baron erscheinen, die zwarkeinen Malus geben, wenn sie fliehen können, ansonsten aber Abzeichen freischalten.Es gibt noch ein Sammelkarten System, wenn man dort die gestellten Aufgaben/Abzeichenerledigt hat, bekommt man Coins/Gegenstände.Jeder der Szenen kann man in 3 verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgraden angehen.Je höher dieser, desto mehr Münzen und bei Lösung natürlcih Sterne bekommt man.Das Spiel macht Spass. Und es ist lösbar! (Selbst für einen solch alten Knacker wie mich)Einige der Aufgaben sind allerdings dermaßen verzwickt......vor allem weil in höheren Levelndie Runner enorm viele Hitpoints haben und zudem sehr schnell sind.Da hilft dann nur der Einsatz der Spezialtürme.....aber für die braucht es wieder eine Menge Geld....

												What's that? You have lots of time up your sleeve to be productiv and finish that project hanging over your head? Just take a short break... *load fieldrunners* .... hey, where did the weekend go?An incredibly re-playable, engaging and entertaining TD game that just absorbs whatever time you have to feed it.

												I agree with many of the other comments, something about FR2 stood out to me and it ended up being a great purchase. I paid full price for the game and do not regret it one bit. I Have milked about 20 hours out of this 10 dollar game. As many others stated, FR2 is vastly improved when compared to FR1. If you like any style of tower defense, chances are you will find something about this game to like. I just hope Subatomic Studios keeps these games coming, and keeps them on par with FR2!!!			"

												If you don't tend to like Tower Defense games but feel like you owe the genre at least a little attention - this is the one.  I'm not a tower defense fan in general so I don't have the same sort of expectations some others might have, and I'm not looking for something with devastating difficulty levels.  This game still manages to be both a good quick timewaster, and something more dangerous - the fun cartoony gameplay can wind up addicting you for hours before you realize you'd intended to go to bed quite a long time ago.  Is fieldrunners 2 an awe inspiring game? Nah. But that's not what it's going for - it's fun.			"

												If you loved Fiendrunners there is no reason to not pick this one up.Defense grid was the must have tower defence game for the better part of the last two years. And while I still feel Defence grid set the standard for all tower defence games. Fieldrunners 2 has surpassed that standard, encorperating all the great open, closed, and open maps with fixed points. While adding 28+ unique towers with advantages and disadvantages in each. Not to mention the at least 8 maps and variations of each map with three diffrent modes of game play on those maps. Its alot of game for 10 bucks and a must have for any td fan. Basic story at casual difficulty will take around 20-25 hours to complete, but will take around 100 hours+ to unlock all the towers and get three stars on all maps...if not more.			"

												I spent most of my time playing fieldrunners 2 on the tablet (android) and not pc. Man this is one addicting game! It is really satisfying to unlock new towers and finish levels on 3 stars. Guaranteed many hours of play! Lots of different towers (AOE and Single target). Original graphics and effects.If you are looking for a good tower defense game on either PC or Android look no further because fieldrunners 2 is awesome!			"

												Fieldrunners 2 looks great, sounds nice and is a blast to play. It has multiple layers of difficulty with extra hard modes, challanges, puzzles and score attack. It also gives you room to experiment and try different approaches with a large variety of tower types.And when you revisit a level, for example to try it out on a higher difficulty, there will be an optional developer commentary audio track waiting for you.

												I picked this up on a whim and I am surprised at the ammount of fun I am having with it. This is originally an iOS game, but it's a great little game to play at your desk too. The PC version has commentary, like you'd find on a DVD,  on each map after you've beat it once, The art style is fun and there are some interesting map designs and Tower effects that make for good old fasion fun. Easy to play to just sit and knock out 15 minutes only to realize 2 hours shot by.			"

												This is an awesome little game.  No 10m budget.  No $1000 video card needed to play.  It is simply fun, addicting, and a time sapper (watchout Civ you have someone in your mirror trying to catch up).  For the price and the fun, can't beat this.  Is a little less serious than Defense Grid, but I would recommend that game just as much, maybe 1/2 a star less.			"

												9.5/10I've played dozens of tower defense games. Of them all, this is easily one of the most well-made/feels-good-to-play ones out there, and I've barely got any time in it at all (I say this because that just goes to show how well done it is.)I've yet to find anything Fieldrunners does that other TD games don't have (aside from wonderous sarcastic humor at every turn), but it is visually appealling, rewarding, offers endless mode on each stage after you reach your goal (thank god), and overall pulls the best of all TD games into one.I'll update this if I ever remember (read: I won't, but I'm sure it's only going to get better.)
