Early Access Review
								Developers disappeared from the face of the Earth for six months, only to reappear and announce that Stardock will no longer be publishing the game and they're thinking about what to do next. They even asked players for advice on what to do! This doesn't instil much confidence. I applied for a refund, but no luck (have had the game for more than two weeks). In any case, my advice is not to buy this game until it has been properly released and you've had the chance to read some reviews about the game. Right now, it doesn't seem like there's going to be much progress and there's no telling at this point what the game will eventually look like. Avoid.Update 3 June 2016: a new patch is incoming. Notice: incoming. It's not released, but in development. And what are they focusing on? Some balance changes, making things faster, and squashing a few bugs. The bottom line: they did nothing with Servo for more than half a year and now they've basically restarted development with this new patch that will change the game in small ways only. Too little, too late: continue to avoid this for now.Update 23 September 2016: some minor bug fixes in the months since the developers deemed fit to post an update and more promises that further patches and fixes (and so on) are coming ""soon"". Don't buy this game unless it actually leaves Early Access. And will it ever leave Early Access? I have my doubts, and even if it does, the chances of it actually being good are slim to nonexistent. The game is simply not on the developer's list of priorities.Update 5 October 2016: the developers have posted in the forum, rather laconically, that development will cease. Apparently, BonusXP thinks it's absolutely fine to screw people over by asking them for money and then not delivering a functional product. From forum posts I gather that the servers are also offline and you can no longer use the game as it is. A waste of money and time. Steam didn't give me a refund, since I've ""owned"" the game for too long now. Bottom line: don't throw money at the game and avoid this developer like the plague.			"

								Been playing this as a founder.  This is very early development at this moment, but this is destined to be a classic.  Great talent with some super prior games.  Simple, but addictive, single and multiplayer.  Kill the other base, get scrap, upgrade your bots.  Really great and classic fun!!!			"

								----------------About the gameplay----------------It feels like someone's trying to make another version of Total Annihilation, but couldn't program a second resource.Skirmishes are absolutely insane. There's no wait period, no breathing room, no chance for you to think for a moment about your next step.It's ""hurry and teleport in"" before someone steals your rez node and then you gotta turn around 'cause you already have baddies gunning at your dropship.If you somehow survived the first wave AND managed to snag at least one node, then you have very little time to build up your strength before the meteorites show.They show every 800 resources. Global. Meaning that if you didn't get one of the first two nodes, you're screwed with only your servo and the starter turret.If you manage to get a roving force and destroy one of the two meteors (they drop them in pairs, I think), then another one will take its place.I can't recall of any other strategy game that does this. Dawn of War, Starcraft, Age of Empires... Even the freaking MOBAs give you a little breather between waves.This reminds me of a map I once made for Blood. Since I made it, I knew the order and where every secret was located at, and assumed everyone would be able to figure it out.Not the case. I received evey complaint about difficulty and got a bad score because I realized you could glitch the dogs at the first room by going prone under them, but not everyone else did.----------------About the AI----------------Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ.Why on Earth would you allow allies to build within your influence if THERE IS NO RESOURCE SHARING!?SO. MANY. ♥♥♥♥ING. TIMES. I have had the AI claim all the resource spots when THEY'RE NOT EVEN THERE!I've only been able to play this with AI, since I haven't been able to get paired with someone online, but I'm absolutely certain you can get stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammate that will steal every resource node from under you, leaving you wandering aimlessly, telling yourself ""Why did I download this?""I know it's an early access game. I don't care. It's currently not worth the buy.----------------About the customization----------------You'd think that for a game that boasts about customization, they'd have at least several different parts set up. So far, I've only seen:-first weapon-sword-pistol-rifle-shoulder rocket (single)-shoulder grenade launcherAll bodyparts are exactly the same, with slight variations in color.Oh yeah. There as a shield unit in there, but it was so weak that It was essentially the same as going naked.----------------Final thoughts----------------Right now it's not worth the buy. Maybe check again in a few months.Don't buy early access stuff this early! If they sell every copy during early access, they won't have any reason to finish the game!			"

								Game appears to have been abandoned by developers who rarely comment in discussions anymore. However, the developers still find time to work on their IOS games. Check on recent Stardock promotions and you will notice they don't even mention this game. I beleive even they are starting the think this is abandonware .  Stay away.			"

Early Access Review
								edit: Update for people reading this in early 2016 and considering purchase. Updates to the beta are very slow now. If you are only preordering I can still recommend the game, if the planned price increase happens 20 bux is a deep discount. But, it is not worth buying just to play the beta. Cautious types may want to wait and see despite the prospect of a good price. This game is still in beta, but it is in very safe hands. The developers are all industry veterans with a record of shipping good games. Patches are coming regularly about 2 weeks apart with many changes and added content each update. If I had to compare it to anything it would be Warcraft III. You have 3 heroes and a base, units and creeps on the map, the objective is blow up the other guy's base. There is also a coop mode offering a variety of challenges against both creeps and dug in AI forces. 2 major things separate it from WC3, heroes do not gather XP from creeps, they gather resources which can be spent on anything. The heroes go up in rank with your base, which is done by buying resources. The other is the hero units are customized giant robots made out of parts you get out of loot crates, bought between matches with ingame currency. This is where the game gets really interesting, parts can give your robots stat boosts and abilities. There are many types of items with more on the way. The way your hero team will play depends on these parts. They give you a lot of free parts at the start to let you try this out.There are no free to play elements, or additional monetization beyond the box price. It features profile levels, though. Thankfully, this level has a cap and it is reasonable to reach, and being a beta not many people are bothering to get to max level. Grinding is not a requirement to enjoy the beta. Players are a little scarce right now, this is best enjoyed in multiplayer so I recommend having a friend to play it with. The game only has 2 player modes so far though. The solo version of coop can be fun but single player isn't quite as fleshed out as multiplayer.Being a beta there are times where things change a lot between updates and items are changed, removed, or your profile completely reset. If you want a complete game, wait a while. If you don't mind beta games Jump In. You can see quite a lot of the content playing multiplayer casually.			"

								First off I know allot of people say ohh this is like total annillation or supreme commander - no its not the only 2 things these games have in common is mechas and RTS to compare them to each other does not do either justice why? time - time is a big factor in these games a single match of Total annillation or supreme commander could take hours where as this game is made to take 10-15mins per match in a more get in and get shooting mentality - if your lead unit dies the timer resets on it and you respawn it free of charge giving you a range of options as long as you protect your command ship so we now what its not - so what is it? I'd say this game is closer to metal fatigue or air mech then what most compare this game to - its fast in your face no time to debate or pause and make strategy - get in shoot use your mechs special attacks and hope you hold long enough to snag some resources and make some generic units to back up your servosthe co op hold your own map reminds me more of Dawn of war 2 Last Stand as you get waves of enemies while trying to collect resources and build up - the limited resource types helps keep your mind on fighting over micromanagement is a bonus since attempting to sweep away enemies with limited resources can be tough So buy this game if you are looking fora fast paced RTS with RPG stylequick in your face matches a interesting choice of mecha options- arm them with pistols swords grenade launchers brass nuckles rifles and differnt armors and pilots the pvp is fun quick shoot em up style rtsDon't buy it if your looking fora new supreme commander - or total annilation - these are not the same please stop comparing them I love total annilation far to much for people to keep bashing every game in its name - they are not the same let the game rest in peacea long in depth campain or story line - these are pretty much just not in the game only 2 campains to get you started I already beat them in first 2 hours of play on all difficultys a no bugs perfect in all ways game - its early access it has bugs it has some wierdness and balancing needs major work still - does that make it less fun? for some yes so hit follow or wishlist it till you think its worth the cashso after 2 hours would I buy it again? yes - 7/10 solid early access with tons of potentiol (and I'm talking real diamond in the rough not great """"personality"""" )also to anyone who attempts to troll me or leave some grammar nazi response I will delete you - if you have a legit response or complaint about my post I'm all for responding so please ask awaybut folks remember - I'm a gamer not a Grammar professor so please please keep that kinda rage for facebook maybe youtube but don't leave it on my door step I won't deal with it			"

Early Access Review
								So, what can I say about this game. If you want to read a whole review, then look no further. If you're one of THOSE guys, that just want to know if the game is good.....well...look no further either.Let's start with the short one.Game good. You play. You smile. You happy. The End.And now for those of you who want to know MY thoughts and experiences with the game. Also know, I go for a full blown out review, as such is my...way of the ninja? Cause I have quite a bit I really want to get out. So bare with me. Or not. First a little story about me. As a young little ninja child Age of Empires were pretty much my one favorite game. Even to this day it pretty much is. So you can probably understand that, when I read, and I quote, ""key create talent behind the beloved Age of Empires seriers"", I got pretty excited in my...head. So, no questions asked, it's an early access game, but who cares, I bought it and I bought it GOOD. I even straight ahead recommended it to a few friends whom I used to play AoE with as a child. Needless to say, they got pretty excited as well. I downloaded it, I played it and boy did I love it. I really love RTS games, if done right, and a RTS game with mechs makes it just all that better. Mecha games has a special place in my heart, so you must understand that, AoE creators making a new RTS game with a mecha theme, I got EXTREMLY excited. BUT enough about me and my love for RTS and mechas. Now about the game.Note that when you buy this game, you buy an EARLY ACCESS game, there isn't that much content as of yet.The game itself is really good and well balanced, going into combat doesn't feel like the enemy is outpowering yourself, but this is because of the fact that there currently only is ONE...faction I guess you could call it, Earth. More, probably, will be added later on. There are a few enjoyable game modes as well as maps, although VERY FEW, they are still enjoyable. From what I can tell there's only about 4 maps (or maybe it was 3? 5?, oh well), the game modes can vary depending on which map you chose. We got the standard Deathmatch, PvP or PvB. Also note that the maps are only able to hold up to two players at once. So playing with a friend against and AI bot is right now not a thing, unless you and your friend want to tackle the horde mode together against swarms of enemies. We also got the Arena mode where you play up to five maps in different ways, by betting 1000 cash, you can win, sometimes, quite a few good things at the end. Also, keep in mind that I haven't gone out to play against other human players yet. Not that I don't fancy it, but that I tried and failed. There's not THAT many playing yet. Most is still getting a hang of the game.The whole ""make your ideal team"" thing isn't all that good yet, but still good. There's not that many parts to chose from when it comes to weapons and such. There's only 3 pilots along with their Servos (as the mechas are called) available by the time I'm reviewing this. Each with his/her own special ability. But, despite the lack of weapons and such, there's still quite a bit of ways to make YOUR ideal team. There's your sword, shield, pistols and rifles and fists. Swords can be dual wielded or you can go with a shield in the off hand instead. Pistols can also be dual wielded, but I prefer the rifles to be honest. I do hope spears and axes as well as deployable mines.Let's take my current team, which I no doubt will change in the near future.(Edit: More than those weapons do exist. They are just higher level parts, such as a drill (dual wielding).(Edit #2: Deployable mines do exist within the game, found out playing against an ""Insane"" difficulty bot)I go for ""Sword and Shield along with a few launchers on the back"", a ""long range sniper along with some swarm missile launchers on back"" and then a ""dual wielding swords man, with a few tricks up his back as well"". By combining your ""heroes"" abilities you can do some devastating damage, with an EMP blast and a acid pool of awesomness on the ground and my sniper swarming the enemy with missiles, a enemy Servo can easily be taken down, and fast, as well as reducing the enemy forces to almost nothing. Combining your Servos abilities is almost a must if you want a quick and fast game.But getting new parts isn't all a walk in the park, you need to dedicate a few minutes, or hours to get some really good new parts. When you do get them good parts, boy do you feel like a child at Christmas getting getting that toy you really wanted, that you saw in the window of the toy shop when you and your mom when down to the mall to buy the rest of the families presents so you just walk past that window containing that awesomness. The parts can go from weapons, arms, heads, body, legs, shields as long as some other additions on the back and inside the Servo CPU system, kinda like rings in Diablo 3. Much of the customization feel like a good RPG game such as Diablo. You battle, you win, you get stuff, you equip said stuff (if good) and sell the rest for some scrap which can later be used to buy weapons of mass destruction. The whole base construction isn't all that yet. There's not that many building to chose from, but I figure more will be added later on. Such as missile turrets, walls, better units and more. Or at least this is what I hope for. Walls. And if the creators is reading this, think about this. Walls...on which you can place your turrets. Aaah? Not to shabby ey?Anyway, I love it, I'll keep on playing it. I'll support it. I'll master this. It's just that worth my time.So if you love Age of Empires, Diablo and also that one awesome mecha game for pc which is also a RTS game. Then, my friend, this is for you.LET ME REMIND YOU! This is a EA game, EA for Early Access. UNDERSTAND THAT before you buy it. I have a feeling ALOT more will be added in the time to come. To sum it all up.Game good. You play. You smile. You happy. The End.(With a few setbacks as the lack of maps, factions and a little crappy online play)			"

								I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys customization and the RTS play style. There are bugs to deal with but it is early in game development so keep that in mind. I would like to see more content for the Mechs and possibly more Drones (Mini brawling drones, for front line fighting?). The game is similar to a MOBA/RTS play style. The game reminds me a lot of Warcraft 3 when Blizzard introduced heros into the RTS game play. There is great potential for this game but that doesnt mean it will amount to greatness. If the developers continue taking feed back from the community to heart to expand on the foundation they have laid, this will be a great game to pick up for 20 bucks.			"

								Customisable mechs? fun RTS? yay. there is both to be found here. A simple yet quiet fun RTS game. and the big mechs with plenty of gear is also a huge pluss. It might dissapoint the hardcore RTS fan as it is a bit simplistic on the RTS front, but that should not be seen as a negative thing. in the context of the game it is in, it is quiet suiting with the light RTS bit. it is just enough to keep you thinking. I have had so much fun playing this, and can not wait to see what the developers have in store for this. Also I am hoping for a few more mech types :D			"

Of course it is in early acces phase.This game has a future if only the developers dont stop develop it and pump the game with content. This game CAN be an awsome RTS with big range of HERO Robots , big variety of units, items , armors, arena mode etc...This game worth its price if the developers keep make this game awsome. Multiplayer matchmaking is still freaking slow and you can barely find players.Remember this is early access and dont count on 999 type of units, armors and possibilities.I recommend this game because I want it to grow bigger and bigger!

It is a game where you will have fun with the abilities and may i say they are something to master in a good way. This game is good and I will be playing it in its current state through the updates as i watch the game grow in content and all that good stuff. Grab it up its worth a buy.

								Lacking in content. Not even halfway done. Yet it draws me to play it again and again. The idea of building your own customizable mech and throw it into real RTS battle, with possible upgrades and random loot... That's just great.If you liked Metal Fatigue or mechs in general, you should keep a close eye on this.As it is now, the game is a great teaser for things to come. Just don't expect this to be the final product. While it can be fun as it is, it still needs a lot of time (which is a relative thing :P).			"

The Ai could use a bit a of tweek or two I have destroyed the enemy base a few times by just sneeking round the back with my guys as a huge group of powered up servos just stood there and didn't seem to mind it happening. ha ha haStill it seems slick and it is fun, the flying units are also a little hard to control though.7 out 10.

Early Access Review
								So lets think of it like like this, right: you got yourself this... thing, right? it's slow, it's ugly and moves like at a pace that'd make your grandma get inpatient. Most the things that it need to function are missing and at times it just would operate. Hearing ""beta"" makes you cringe because you want instant satisfaction and dont want to wait for something that you paid for to slowly get better. But guess what? dont you twish you tested all those horrible games and told the makes to send that abomination back to spawning pits of cthulu's den. Your job as a beta tester is to break the game, post the problems and talk about what can make it better instead of stomping it out instantly. this game is that ""thing"", it's at the early months of developement and needs help to make it's way to where it can be that game the helps the rts franchise.Now to get back on track, the game is ok even for an early access game. they release at least one map a month including new parts and weapons. currently on each map there are different coop missions you can do with a buddy. You can deploy a team of three servos each having a pilot with different skills, and as your dropship level increases you can get more pilots. sadly at the moment you data will be wiped with every monthly update i think, have to put my ear to the ground to know if that will change, but at the same time it is a good thing because old stuff will be switched out with new and better items, as it progresses further i dont think they'll need to wipe as much (heh). THIS IS NOT A MOBA! When people see  a ""hero"" unit with much weaker and small units they think moba, but this is far from that, this a base building rts game with resources and base management. You might be tripped up when you see enemies are called creeps but it's not what you think, it's because the main enemy, the bloomspawn, do not need to build a base as they fall from the sky in meteors, they also play a part in pvp holding down refinery spots and on field resources.The Servos are giant mechs piloted by brave men and women with a hunger for destruction. Ever watched that movie Pacific Rim? well, you can think of it similar to that with different mechs of multiple designs and sizes and a large arsonal of weapons. Servo's are the units that you will use most in this game and put in in front when charging a base, there are smaller, faster and weaker units but they are mostly for providing support for the servos, like healing or long range sniping. but your servos are not invincible, they will blow up in a grand explosion thats almost worth the loss, you can bring them back after a long cool down but you have to know when and what to engage the enemy with.This game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of fun, no joke. you will spend a long time naming, costumizing and battling with your 60 meter monster. I geek out when ever a new update comes out cause i know its a whole list of new things! You can imagine my excitement when i heard their adding air units! I love seeing my servo duke it out with a massive Juggernaut looking bloomspawn! or launching a salvo of missles on a hoard of little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!! trust me when i say this is a game with a ton of potential.

								I cant really tell you if this game is good or not because i have played this game for almost no amount of time. The reason being is because this game is not toaster friendly as of currently.I bought this game thinking it would be great fun, and still do! The only problem is that I have a above average toaster. I tried to play this game and my average FPS was about 2-3. Once i turned down the setting to the third lowest possibility (to the point where this size text was made up of 4-7 pixels) the fps jumped up... to around 5-6 FPS. Basically im trying to say if you have a good computer get this game. Otherwise, you should probably save your money until later because this issue may be due to it being very early in the making. Toasters beware of the great and mighty servo!P.S. From what i have seen of it outside of the actual gameplay the game is awesome.   "

								Much the same problems as with the Command And Conquer series.  Maps are too small and confining.

								I am a starcraft fan and I am a bit addicted to this Servo game.There are guns and explosions. Laser things and missiles flying in the air, boom boom boom boom. Either your servo is still alive or dead and countdown to respawn the servo.There are just a few confusing moments in campaign missions. I didnt know that you can actually build around the servo (like a portable pylon, and buildings dont need constant power, only build and it can power itself). I kept creating Beacons at first, just like pylons with the protoss in starcraft, so i can reach power to build refinaries at the located spots... after some thinking of why was i able to build refinaries anywhere in the tutorial, it finally hit me, the servo controls the area to provide the ability to build near it. (buildings can provide its own power when built).i like how there is a shop to buy parts for the servo. its only a little confusing as it doesnt provide specific detail of how a noob can use this part and where it installs at, also has no compare feature for what current install.I completed the tutorial and then later complated the only 2 missions on insane mode. only 2 missions available in early-access so far... I find the 1st level is easy game-physics-learner level (i wasted couple hours on easy mode) and after some learn, was also easy on insane.2nd level on hard was very annoying as i was impatience, after a break from the game, i wasted time on hard mode but learned about it when i played insane mode. insane was also a bit annoying because that 1 single tank comes out every few minutes and will eventually kill you (complete level fail) because of not enough health around. i spent most the time using a slow reload missile shot to take down dozen enemies (slow couple hours for a single mission). quite boring from the repetetive wait-wait-wait-missile wait-wait-wait-missile. Its a bit annoying to learn optimization for each level completely by yourself (an un-addict would just quit playing the game, like most the games i bought on steam sale)			"

								Well I have to admit I was very eager to get this game: Giant fighting mech suits, Exp system, loot and a whole load of other pluses? I couldn't stay away.The overall impression is that this game has potential to be a huge amount of fun, even for an Alpha stage game I was actually impressed with several of the mechanics involved.The building system for the RTS side of it is simple to pick up and after a few games you will, be putting your roots down quickly and getting on with the fun part of smashing the enemy to bits.As for the customisation of your mechs? Well yet again has great potential. Whether you're a gunslinger, boxer or sniper there are loadouts for you. There is as yet no options to customise colour so your look is completely down to what gear you have.The basic weapons are complemented by extra things like shields and rockect pacs so the potential for a wide range of fighting styles is in the pipeline and mix that in with each poilet's own powers I feel I will be dreaming up new builds for weeks at least.A key refreshing element is the servo team idea itself, you with every tech level you get an additional servo to use in game from the stock of already unlocked pilots. By early mid game you can have a whole squad of stompy mechs to deal damage with.So the rougher points:Obviously the game isn't finished, so while it's good fun to play a few times right now you will quickly chew through the early access content. Though even this isn't too bad as even though you can't access all the cool things now they are there, especially in with the A.I controlled servos who are armed with some of the shinier things you will be able to get just to make you drool and feel good about yourself as you pound their over geared mechs to scrap ^_^On the subject of the A.I, sadly they will not tax you terribly right now, with only basic commands and some almost hilariously stupid actions (Ignoring your entire army/base defences to chase one little drone round and around or just sitting at their own base scratching their heads as you claim the whole map. But as I said before early days.There is some balancing issues to be resolved, but yet again that is nothing new to a work in progress game. Some one of the two co-op levels is simply impossible with an A.I ally to complete while the other is hardly taxing at all. Unless you raise it the next difficulty and watch your A.I ally dance in circles.The only major gripes I have is the loot drops and lack of other players right now. It is almost sole destroying to earn the in game currency, playing for hours for what feels like terrible small gains. From what I have seen it takes at least four games to earn a reasonable quality loot crate which turns out to be another gun you don't need.This is offset somewhat by the 'daily quests' where you have to achieve certain goals like building ten base turrets ect, but in my experience it's not enough.Yes you've crushed your foe in an epic battle, ground his servos to scrap and blasted his base to atoms. You finally catch your breath and find what feels like a couple of loose coat buttons and can of knock off soft drink for your troubles.The devs has stated that the early release focuses on multiplayer right now, which is all fine and dandy except the teaming up engine seems to be lacking at the moment. I was lucky to find a fellow player to duke it out with (In co-op or PVP) having only had about five games with other people since I got the game a few days ago, less than one in ten searches resulting in a match.So to conclude my review I would say this game will be awesome if they keep up the good work. As for buying it right this second? Not so sure. You will have a few hours fun testing out the basic format and gaming system. If you have a dedicated friend to play it with, to strive and overcome the co-op missions or to beat the snot out of in PVP then the fun will last longer.I would see it as a long term investment, the more people who support the game now will hopefully encourage the devs and we will see more cool content sooner. The big promise that is given is this game will not be a 'pay to win', everything will be included in the one time payment of the game.Over all I'd give this a thumbs up, with hope that it lives up to expectations. Buy investing in the game you make it more likely that a real gem will be at the end of the tunnel. If you're not up for that risk then it may be worth waiting to see where it goes.			"

								For those of you that remember Metal fatigue, this game scratches that itch! Although not as in-field dynamic as metal fatigue, such as being able to swap parts from fallen foes in the middle of battle. It does however let you customize your pilot, head, torso, legs and a weapon on each hand and each shoulder. Choice of weapons is pretty broad, which is nice. my only complaint? no WASD map move. It's either screen bump or using the arrow keys like it's 1999.			"

								Servo is a very interesting twist on the giant machine combat of Planetary Annihilation in that you can tune the robot to your playstyle by selecting different pilots and swapping out main and special weapons without sacrificing anything.

Early Access Review
								Alpha/EA first impressions: This is sort of the RTS version of what Torchlight is to RPG/Diablo-esque games. It's arcadey and a little cartoony but it's fun and even the alpha/EA version runs well and has a variety of game modes even if certain things are placeholder or a little sparse still. You can have up to 3 Servos in battle along with 15-20 or so drones in a typical skirmish. There are several different types of drones, eco and armoury upgrades, turrets, unit producing factories, healing beacons, some neutral roaming monsters and different economy nodes around the map to capture. There's a variety of gear and parts you can earn and swap around on your Servos between games to go for certain playstyles. It will have a campaign/SP side on release and has MP and Co-Op already. I'd like to see it get a bit more depth and character as it develops. It is a little too generic/cartoony for my tastes aesthetically right now but, again, it's an alpha and there's a lot more to be added so I'm curious where they will take it.Update: Changing my review to a thumbs down. One of my few Early Access regrets. It's been many months since my initial review and there's been zero communication from the devs on what's happening with the game. There was a single small update in the past 6 months. The game stopped working on my new W10 PC and support was not able to find a reason or solution. I've completely lost interest in the game and it seems the devs have as well...			"
