Early Access Review
								Pit People is XCOM, Fire Emblem, and Pokemon thrown into the minds of Behemoth and what they made is a funny and good looking game. The meat of the game is doing battle with teams of bad guys with your very own squad that you find through the story mode until you find Sophia the Recruitador (a lot of characters in this game have funny names). Then, the game branches into another way of playing it. You can capture any unit you fight on the battlefield when you leave it as the last one alive. There are several character classes from the human fighters to the penguins to the beefy giants to the cupcake healer class. Every character has their own name from Gluten to Pipistrella.This is an early access title as of January, and it shows only in the story mode. The rest of the game is polished and balanced with each weapon type and class, but the story mode is farly short. What it lacks in length it makes up in character and gameplay. The narrator Stamper was present in their previous game Battleblock Theater as well but he takes the role of a godlike bear that overlooks the story as a sort of meta-narrator, talking to the characters and talking to the player. Apart from the short story quests, there are a few side quests that are all five parts incrasing in difficulty. These serve the same purpose as side quests in different games, to give you some more gold and flesh out the characters. These side quests take a bit longer than the story. Apart from the insanely fun singleplayer, there exists an in-universe multiplayer PvP called the Pit, which is pretty much the only reference to the title of the game. You and a partner control your squads to defeat two other people's squads. It's a very satisfying game mode as you can learn from the other people's squad composition to increase chances of success. Think XCOM PvP. You get story rewards as well depending on how many games you win per day. As it is now, Pit People is very fun and well balanced even though the story mode was short and as sweet as the cupcake healer class.			"

								I haven’t seen very many qualitative reviews yet, so I’m attempting my own. This is based on what I’ve experienced in the game so far playing three hours on my Xbox One and on Steam altogether.A turn-based strategy game, you can build a team of up to six characters with their own customized equipment. Everyone can have different weapons, some with effects and some that are strong against enemies wearing particular equipment. An example of this is that swords will be weak against people with helmets but maces will be strong against them. While customizing you character, you will see a bar graph which tells you their equip load, damage, range, defense, and dodge. Going above 100% equip load will reduce the character’s move points by one, and staying below 50% grants an additional move point. You can designate one person on your team as the hero. Doing so gives them more health, damage, and greater equip load.The combat is fairly simple. Move your melee team members adjacent to enemies, and they will attack them. Ranged team members supposedly need at least one empty space between the enemy and themselves. If there are multiple enemies that can be targeted within the vicinity, that unit will seemingly choose a random enemy to strike. Some of the fights can take a few minutes depending on how fast your thinking is when it comes to moving your team.Early in the game, you will find a city where you will be buying some of your items, fighting in the pit against A.I. or other people online for gold, and customizing your characters or changing your team members as you obtain equipment and people throughout the game. Gold and items can be obtained outside of this place, but you are limited to how many items you can carry. Two important items I’ve come across are campfires, which allow you to heal your team outside of combat, and recruit cages, which allows you to recruit enemies to join your team. Mind that you will need to unlock the recruit cages through meeting a certain character first. I would recommend not fighting in the pit early in the game against A.I.'s beyond story mode. Three consecutive rounds can be difficult to finish.Story mode is not finished yet, but there are many battles across the map you travel through outside of combat. Alongside the story mode quests, there are other quests you can choose from. You can also encounter optional quests while exploring the map. The game will point you to the objective once you’ve accepted a quest.The art and music are reminiscent of previous titles, but they feel updated as well. The narration is just as funny as it was in Battleblock Theater. Castle crasher players will recognize the combat style immediately. Battleblock Theater players will know how this game is loosely connected to it.I've recently tried co-op. Pretty much the second person you play with will have the same stuff as you from the very beginning. When you unlock a character, they get a variation of them as well. They will also have the main characters in character selection when they have the chance to change team members.I have not tried PvP yet, so I can’t say anything about them. Hopefully someone else can tell you guys about them. Other than that, that’s all I can tell you about the game. Hopefully you will find other qualitative reviews better than mines. If you buy the game, I hope you enjoy playing it as I did.			"

YouTube™ Video: Pit People - Review (Early Access) 

			Views: 3,045		

			Pit People is a strategy adventure game with turn-based combat brought to you by the developers who also made BattleBlock Theater and Castle Crashers.		

TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Pit People is a strategy adventure game with turn-based combat brought to you by the developers who also made BattleBlock Theater and Castle Crashers. Pit People is a different genre of game than their previous games, but the character style and sense of humour is consistent in Pit People as well.You create a team to with up to 6 characters on it, and battle against the enemies in turn based combat until one team is defeated or your objective is accomplished. I’ve been playing mostly on normal difficulty. I always heal to full health before each encounter, and so far I haven’t found the fights too challenging. I tried a mission on the insane difficulty, and if it wasn’t for my characters leveling up (to restore them to full hp) mid-combat, I would have died for sure. You can bring more than one of the same character type at a time, but the cupcakes don’t heal other cupcakes. If all of your characters die, you lose some gold and maybe some items, but there is no perma-death, so the game is forgiving in that sense.During your turn you lock in all of your moves at once before ending the turn. If you make a mistake with the move, you can always change it before you end your turn. You are given plenty of time to lock in your moves. The combat has some random factors, like dodging, crits, and most notably which target you actually hit. You have control over your team’s movement, but you have no say as to which target you will actually attack. For example: if you place a character in a hex that’s adjacent to multiple targets, your character can attack any of the available targets, and not necessarily the target you want. There is friendly fire with AE abilities, and you can accidentally heal enemies as well. You journey out from town to explore, or complete missions by driving around the map in a nitro-boosted wagon...that poops. There are enemies everywhere, but it’s nice that you can easily avoid combat by stunning them and running past if you want to. It’s a lot better than having to flee combat, since fleeing makes all of your characters take damage, and drops your items on the ground. You can play by yourself against the AI, or in two player co-op either online or locally. There is voice and text chat In co-op, so you can coordinate easier. Both you and your ally take your turns at the same time, and there are a lot more enemies to compensate for there being a second player. There is also an arena where you can battle against other players in 2v2 battles or compete for scores on the leaderboard against AI.In almost every battle, you have the option to recruit the last remaining enemy by capturing them with a net and cage. I think it’s awesome that you can capture any enemy you come across, and that it never fails to capture. It’s also neat that you get to keep all of the equipment that they are wearing when you are recruit them. Sometimes I wish I could capture more than one enemy per battle though. There are different species that have special abilities, and other species that can be equipped with gear. There are no skill points to allocate, but the equipment let’s you customize each character.Pros:the same Behemoth style and humourlots of side quests to do, and some have their own mini stories to go with themTONS of collectible items to find - most are purely cosmetic, while others have various combat stats, and you can also trade items with other players (I played for about 10 hours, and only got 9% complete)the gameplay is fun, but can get repetitive after a while (I still got my money's worth)voice acting for the narrative (Will Stamper, from BattleBlock Theater) is amazing, and the goofy made-up language with voice acting is rather entertaining at timesmost of the sound effects are decent, and soundtrack is good, but it won’t appeal to everyone.good looking unique and colourful environments that are all designed with hexesawesome animations, and fantastic character customizationskeybindings are fully customizable, and there is full controller supportCons:the game lacks a full-sized map that shows all the areas you’ve explored - since you can only have 2 active quests at a time, it would be nice to have a large map marking points of interest you’ve seen, but not yet completednot much of the main story it available yet as expected in early access (but at least there are a lot of side quests available)(nitpick) the clouds everywhere blocking vision while driving around is annoying(nitpick) the randomness of which targets you actually hit can be a pain sometimes(nitpick) it can sometimes be hard to tell which hexes you can’t walk on(nitpick) when you are running through enemies avoiding combat the aggro sound is quite irritating (they should lower the radius that prompts the sound)Conclusion:If you’re hoping for story, there isn’t much in the way of a story campaign just yet, but there are still plenty of quests to do.  Playing against the AI as single player is fun, but it feels repetitive after a while. The co-op is enjoyable, but I wasn’t able to try the PvP since I got impatient waiting for it to pop. Overall, it’s a nicely polished turn-based strategy game that’s not too punishing, and it has an abundance of collectibles, and the sense of humour you would expect from a Behemoth title. I have no regrets with the purchase, and I look forward to more of the story being added.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations here.You can also view this review on my website here.[www.azralynn.com] "

Early Access Review
								First thing to note is that game being early access just means the story is not complete. Gameplay is finished, and there's a lot a of quests (which vary a lot) and stuff to do, including PvP mode, and extra difficulty. However, expect that after 2 hours, you'll have finished the story in it, which doesn't mean the game ends.I loved the presentation of the game. classic Behemoth style, with a lot of humor, the same hilarious narrator from Battleblock Theater, and a lot personality behind it. Great music, with a lot of variety. For me, one of the selling points.The gameplay is also great, however, is much simpler than your average turn based grid strategy game. Your characters attack on their own if they are on range of an enemy, for example. If you're looking for ""hardcore gameplay"", you might be disappointed with it. But I think that it goes in the right direction and if fits the game, while being very accesible for people not so into the genre. This is neat because the game has local and online co-op, so you can play this with a lot of people, not just hardcore turn based gamers.Overall, i really liked the game. I would recommend it if you like the presentation, and you want to be playing it just to explore the world that the Behemoth people hace created. If you're looking for a story driven campaign already finished, wait for the full release.			"

								Such a fun and fluid game, I was a fan of Behemoths previous games but to me this is the best one yet. Turn based strat games don't always appeal to me but here they have done away with a lot of the micromanagement whilst still retaining the depth and fun. Couple that with the ""recruit"" (basically kidnap your team members into slavery) mechanic, the mind boggling amount of team combinations, 2 player, The Pit where you can PvE or PvP and the ludicrous amount of loot and this is a no brainer. I am trying not to burn out on the game as its in EA but I keep coming back for more,  there is already a staggering amount of content with more to come, highly recommended. "

								Buy it! Buy it for your friends! Buy me another copy! CONQUER ZE WORLD! I have a ton of hours in this from beta. It's an amazing game. Great combat. Great story. Absolutely hilarious (even after 30+ hours). The music is STELLAR, especially the techno track; I can't wait to see what else they have in store. Co-op PVP AND co-op campaign; we can be friends. The beta was my favorite game of 2016, pretty sure this is going to be my favorite game of 2017 as well.So.. stop reading and buy it. I'm a huge SRPG/Tactical Turn based fan and this game gets it so right. Some people have complained about the ""cartoonish"" graphics... and as Cypress Hill said, ""Some people can F*ck off and go to hell"". ^_- No, but seriously, I adore the graphics and animations and their 'language', it totally fits with the awesome narration.BUY IT.

								Pit people is a really great game. The teams are varied and very customizable, and the strategy is easy to pick up/surprisingly complicated.The main strategy (since targeting is random) relies on 1. Picking off their weak characters2. Keeping your low hp characters in the center of formations where it is hard to target them.The placement of ones units becomes increasingly complex when regarding for robots, mushrooms, and mortars, which promote certain spacing and clumping restrictions accordingly.If you enjoy strategy games, and are very into PVP I can recommend this. However, because the PVE gets droll very fast, You should probably  have a friend to play with before you buy if you don't like PVP.			"

								I'm happy to add another positive review to the thousands of already existing ones. Let me explain why.Pit People is a great game and yet another instant hit, like Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theater before it. It might seem like youtuber bait at first glance, with all the ""memes"" and (literaly) toilet humor, but it's got depth, it's got great customisation and it's got humor that is gonna appeal to all ages. The Behemoth team delivered again (might I mention, they are the only devs with multiple games that all have 95% on steam I know) and I'm looking forward to watching the game evolve and grow.Now let's get started for the actual review. As you might have already noticed, the aesthetic is very similiar to the previous games. The similarities don't end there either. You will often encounter creatures from the previous games and all kind of other references. These apear mostly in a huge variety of costumes and already mentioned creatures. So how is Pit People different? Well, almost everything else is new. The combat system is turn based, kind of simplistic but very well implemented. Each creature has its own (mostly passive) abilities and stats, which can further be modified by items and weapons. Latter stands mostly for humans. There are four different types of elemental damage (fire, explosion, poison and ice), but there are also helmets and shields, armor, dodge and many more mechanics, that make fighting interesting (hint - stay AWAY from the farting mushrooms).Your base of operation is a town where you pick quests, equip items, fight in a pit or simply buy new items and fighters (there is no need for that really, as you frequently get them during wandering anyway). Once you set foot on the huge map, you encounter various groups of enemies, which you can avoid or fight. You can also pick up new quests on the fly, ranging from quite a selection. I've heard there are more than 100 avaliable.Another big thing I've yet to mention - co-op. It's not 100% required in order to have fun, but it helps to have a partner. You both plan out your turn at the same time and due to much larger number of fighters, it can really get quite chaotic (which suits the theme of the game). However a thing that has been bothering is the camera, which is quite wonky during co-op battles, expecialy on larger maps. But hey, that's why early access exists. The last thing I'd like to cover is the look, sound and narration. I've already stated the cartoonish look suits the game perfectly and I stand by it. Naration is done by Will Stamper, same old cynical guy you've had to put up with in Battleblock Theater. He does a fantastic job in being both annoying and funny at the same time, pestering your heroes and making smug remarks. The soundtrack is great as well and I haven't gotten bored by it even after 10 hours of play. ConclusionWould I recommend Pit People? You bet your♥♥♥♥♥I would. It might not be 100% finished, expecialy the main story is lacking at the moment and I hope more creatures get introduced during development. Still, the game is well worth its price and has made me chuckle many times (expecialy some of the names). It's just as silly as it is serious and the combination simply works. BIg thumbs up from me!Rating: It's early access you silly, I can't give a rating.			"

Early Access Review
								* Do remember this is Early Access, and as such the value of this title as I review it.  My review is based mostly upon the mechanics and what is here, rather than a story that has yet to unfold.Behemoth once again delivers a class A experience with their one of a kind over the top humor. A robust and expansive world, a myriad of memorable characters, and enough loot to make your butt fall off.  Pit People has a diverse and simplistic combat style accessible to players new to the strategy RPG format. Yet still it goes so much deeper than that to the true strategist. Offering near limitless customization this game allows for any playstyle. From people who like to hide behind ponies, to those who crave the boom boom, to those who simply love rainbows. Whether you are a tried and true fan of Behemoth and their past works, or a newcomer to the party, I do believe this is shaping up to be one of the best games of the coming year. That being said, if you are looking strictly to play a large story filled with conquest, glory, and pain, Pit People may not be the title you want...YET. As it sits you will not run short of things to do, amongst them being PVP, Co-Op shenanigans, loot hunting, side quests, and dying with laughter. This is not a typical gotcha early access. What you get right now, without the story, is well beyond the price value. Behemoth made the right decision to let us get the jump start on such a sweet game.Pros:+ Excellent Voiceover+ Wonderful and Diverse Art+ A+++ Soundtrack+ Fluid and Simple Combat+ Deep Customization+ Fantastic Price Point+ Contains the Color Teal+ Fantastic and Lag Free PVP Servers+ Co-Op Couch Play (Bless you Behemoth for keeping the old ways alive.)+ Early Access (This game is well and far beyond what I expected to get at day 1 early access.)+ Flawless Controller PlayCons (Most Likely To Disappear by Full Release) :- Early Access (This is only a con because my body is ready for the whole thing.)- Difficulty Curve for The Unsuspecting/New Player (A.I.'s beyond story mode is a CHALLENGE, PVP garnishes more experienced SRPG Players)- Keyboard/Mouse Controls Need Refined- Can't Buy The Soundtrack			"

Early Access Review
Pit People is great fun! A few things definately need to be worked on and tweaked, but hey - for an Early Access game from a well-trusted developer, this is looking real good.Essentially, this plays like a modernized quirky version of Final Fantasy Tactics. Everything you want from a tactical turn-based party battle management game is pretty much here. Lots of collectibles, both functional and cosmetic. Definately has a good chunk of different kinds of units (the deep customization really helps here in making it feel even more extensive). The online play is off to a great start - they are doing it right.One thing I'll say right up front is that I'm thoroughly confused about people complaining about the short 'main story line' right now. First off, that's the tutorial folks - there is more coming. Secondly, there are over 100 missions WITH storyline dialogue that will certainly take you over a dozen hours to complete. Thats a conservative estimate, too.You can read about all the good stuff in, well, like every other review. What are the negative points?First off, the camera desperately needs work with local co-op. They already said they would fix this as a high priority, so fine. Secondly, while the map is huge, it sort of, well, lacks a strong flavor. I think it feels very flat, and simply uniformly dotted with either small buildings or landscape chunks. While the map artwork is good and that is set, I'd like to see a bit of TLC go into making the terrain feel better in general. I hear keyboard and mouse controls are abismal, so be warned (I didn't try them because of this warning). Lastly, I think the music is fantastic, although it is not very artistically cohesive. One minute it is high fantasy classical-esque, then it's western cowboy music, and yet another it is techno-ish. Don't get me wrong, it is all very good, but sometimes this difference made me wonder about how it was all chosen and put together.Another thing I'd like to mention is the difficulty. In five hours, I had never lost. Mind you, I didn't play on 'insane' difficulty, but still. I finished the 'main story', which is just a tutorial or prequal to the actual story (this version ends where it appears the real story begins). I finished 11 quests and a few other things. After a while, I got lazy and stopped really strategizing and just kept throwing units in haphazardly - and I still won. With only a few hours in, I'm going to chalk this up to early game build-up. Plus, I think online play will likely be a different story. I did play online, but only very briefly.Lastly, I felt that single player mode felt much better than local co-op. Local co-op was fun, but the screen was almost too busy, and I felt there was even less strategy. It was like 'just send the units wherever they are next to an enemy' kind of thing. It worked, which is the questionable part.Pros:+Fantastically addictive combat; everything is done really really right+Although I didn't like Battle Block or Castle Crashers as much as everyone else (I felt they were shallow), this game has really hit the mark with the depth it brings, respectively+Controller support is great+Don't be fooled - there is a ton of content right now; yes the 'main story' (ie. tutorial) is less than 2 hours - I assure you this will change; further, there are over 100 side quests and some 1,300 collectibles right now (I could see 15-20 hours easy - as an estimate)+There are various parts of this game to enjoy, and it smartly lets you choose - you can turn on AI to actually do all the battling for you, which is great if you just like the larger aspects of the gameCons:-Difficulty is questionable - I can't seem to ever lose-Local co-op is just too busy to be enjoyable; it hardly felt strategic, either-While the music is great, there is no artistic cohesion; this may be fine, albeit weird-Overall, I'd like it to feel like there is more strategy involved than what I've felt so farI think this title is great, and definately worth full price.

								I have nothing but respect for those at the Behemoth, one of the first indie studios out there, from alien hominid on ps2 to castle crashers to battleblock theater, the effort they put into their games stands out not just in quality but personality. The lineage for the company is one worth reading about, and If you're familiar with Newgrounds, you probably know the long history there,but these guys have been at their unique blend of game-spices since I was a wee lad, and it was a bootstraps effort to put the dream in motion and it wound them here on release of a hilarious fourth incarnation of a game only they can make and would be a pity to miss.  Unlike anything the Behemoth has done yet, the gameplay is layered, but easy to pick up, about as time consuming as you'd like it to be. The trailers speak for themselves, but the voicework from Stamper, the animation from Dan, the coding of a team that wrangles the madness together know what they are doing-if the early access tag has you 2spook'd. Cmon. It's the Behemoth, so for what I was anticipating, I was not at all let down. I say fifteen is a steal, and with all the art and animation and style and humor in here, you're not likely to find a game that has the kind of charm and wit with gameplay to match. Unique In short spurts or hours of competing for leaderboard rank, this hexa-brawly-turn-based strategy has more to offer than many out there of it's nature. As far as early access goes, this is tip top fare and well worth your $15.			"

Early Access Review
								If you're here reading my review you must be wondering if this game is worth buying or not. Well, I'll go ahead and let you sort out your own opinion and you can decide for yourself. PLEASE NOTE: This game is in Early Access, so don't let this review effect your views on the actual game when it comes out. Thanks!Pros:Great Team-Builder type game. If you love the type of game where it's critical to build your own team, this one is for you The units I've discovered thus far are as follows: Tank, short ranged but fast archers, long ranged but slow morters, healers, heavy hitter, DPS, and self-sufficient. All characters spare Healer and self-sufficent are interchangable. You may equip them with items varying from a rainbow.. bow to a chalk board with Einstine's ""E=MC2"". Though beware, as weight limits may prohibit you from reaching your characters full potential!In the world, you may fight to get loot. Beware though! If you lose a fight or flee you may lose your items! You must make the difficult decision of staying outside and battling for more loot as you complete quests, or you can venture back home and attempt to drop off your loot. Very good system!Wonderful balance. The game does a great job of making you feel challenged but not overwhelmed. Never before in this game have I desired to quit the game because a level was brutally unfair to me. It gives me a great challenge, even if playing with a friend, but if it gets too easy for you INSANE MODE is already implimented in the game and ready to use. Turning it on is as easy as completing the tutorial level.The game becomes self-aware.. mostly. The game only makes you complete its lengthy tutorial once, and after that you can jump right into your 5 out of 6 starting group and play away the day. It also holds nice polishes as to changes in the HUB city. Incuding little changes you might see after completing a quest.. The characters and personalitys are diverse. Going into this I was scared that all of the characters might be static and comedy-esq where I know they only joke. While yes this game has an AMAZING sense of humor, it is very careful to pick and choose when to be full on comedy and when to dawn the garb of light hearted seriousness.Many refrences. If you're a proud owner of BattleBlock or Castle Crashers like I am, you are rewarded with headwear for your characters that have.. actually pretty reasonable stats. Long live Hatty Hattington, The Tearful Warrior!Cons:The interface for equiping weapons and armor is... foreign to say the least. Things don't add up. There are three kinds of swords: Short, Medium, and Large (Forgive me if the names are wrong, but that's the jist). Good mechanic overall, but the swords vary in damage only slightly while other stats such as DODGE and DEF. may suffer or benefit greatly. I found myself unable to equip items that may have looked amazing, or that I got from the games Early Access finale. Worst of all is that the swords add to your weight, so I find myself using almost only the starting weapons since they have the most balance.Leveling is broken. A big part of the appeal to this game was the Leveling system.. only to find out it does nothing. Amidst the wilds of the map you might discover a wild band of raiders you wish to attack. You kill one and a beam of purple erupts from your character while the letters, ""LVL UP!"" appear briefly. Is it noticable? No, the ATK, DEF, Ect buff is so small you'd have to level up quite a few times. I'm talking 20+ times, and leveling up does get progressively harder.Armor eye appeal. There is said to be 1300+ items in the game to equip, and the majority look pretty cool. Be it a cup of joe to a Doge refrence. However... don't expect your people to look cool if you favor stats. As unbalanced as the items are currently, you are ALWAYS stuck with the default ""T-shirt"" so to speak. Cool helmet? Great. B.A. Sword? Even Better. I just hope those things look cool on your plain white shirt or furry black hair troll.Overall:This game is a wonderful game in my eyes, and I hate turn based combat spare Pokemon. It will take you on a few laughs and possibly make you wonder if Stamper's voice hurts after hearing his strange diologue where he occasionally yells. I feel this game is a wonderful addition to the Behemoth family and is on the forefront of breaking the bad trend of video game companies pumping out reskin sequels.For only the price of 15$ I would reccomend this game if it had a few more fixes onto it. It has a nice touch to it and great replay value to those who enjoy playing with team building options.What could be fixed/changed:Wagon upgrades, something to spend the money you'll accumulate as you progress. Something that's not needed nessesaraly, but something that would make the journey more enjoyable if you could customize your ride with cool looking cannons or an alternate horse type.Biome types. The game is very scattered and geographically makes utterly no sense. While yes, it is the Bear-apocalypse that doesn't mean the world should be as mixed as it is. I feel as if the map should have started with plains at least, expanding into a mountain zone to the west and a lake/island region to the east. Something to help pinpoint where the player is at. Something where the player could say: ""To get to the Desert, go North onto the flaming fields, once you've reached the volcano zone stop and head east towards the island region. Follow along this route North-east until the islands begin to clump together and you'll see the desert. Enjoy!"" Biome types. The characters are diverse in this game, but you take no advantage of it. Keep the little bandits in the fields, and the massive cyclopse men in the farther out areas so the player FEELs threatened. Am I saying exclude them from the lower levels? No, but I would suggest making them more frequent and powerful the farther they are from the current location of your Town is.Town/HUB Movement. It's a good idea, but if you went off of the Biome type idea I mentioned previously you might see an oppertinuty. This town movement instills adventure out of your comfort zone, but having the biome types could help the player navigate the landscape and perhaps even feel a bit more comfortable dodging the raining bear blood on their next quest.The Pit. Give the player the choice to ""Descend"" the pit. It would eliminate part of the feel of grinding enemies outside, but here's the twist. The pit only gives EXP and little gold. The real incentive is if you can make it to X floor then you get a reward. However, to make it a challenge for your team you have to get down to X floor in one go. Perhaps a checkpoint at every 5th, 20th, or 50th floor depending on difficulty of individual floors? This pit idea would make the overworld seem less comforting as you'd be spending less time there, and the game would seem bigger as there's another objective for the player to do.ADD TORSO EQUIPMENT. I've already said this in my review, but PLEASE add this. My team looks really sad-sack. I know the game is in the apocalypse, but the fact they never change shirts shouldn't hold in that situation either..Leveling. Perhaps if you got your character to say... LVL 100. There should be some kind of choice you can make. Here's what I think that choice should be. Getting to LVL 100 unlocks a quest where you BLAH BLAH BLAH you're left with the option to keep them at 100, split the 100 with the other team members on your team, or spend the levels on unlockables NOT NESSESARY TO THE GAME. Ex) Rare music disc's, unused Stamper audio, paints to re-color your items to make them match. Things a perfectionist, most people who reach 100 would be this, would crave.That's about it for now, as I'd hate to waste anyones time who's still reading this. I hope this review helped! Have a nice day!			"

								Is it good? YesIs it nearly finished? NoWorth the dolla? Hell yes.I bought it looking for something similar to Banner Saga. This is not quite as complex but unlimited customization potential definitely makes every encounter unique, and the ferocious pvp scene is always a winner. However I do not advise buying it for the pvp alone yet, since I have yet to find an online game, but I do battle friends offline. This may just be because I live in South Africa, but I dont see why lag would be an issue in a turn based game.  "

								Pit people is a hilarious, turn based strategy game. It WILL have you laughing the whole damn time. What the game offers so far is a few hours of highly enjoyable gameplay co-op or solo. I would recommend getting a friend to play with though. As far as the ""main"" story goes I completed it in less than 2 hours and that was with some messing around and exploring. There are tons of side quests though and the Pit where you can do 2v2's or face the AI. You will gain daily rewards for winning in the Pit. The best part about Pit People is that it is genuinely funny and has the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥of a narrator that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. The narrator is a giant bear that tries to ruin your characters lives in the funniest, worst kind of ways. Every third or so time you return to your city, the bear will pick it up and move it somewhere else. Which isn't all bad because it keeps things fresh, but the nerve of some people, am I right? Just know that he will be intervening and ""helping"" you out in any way he can. PROSActual Humour""Easy To Learn Hard To Master Combat""Great TeambuilderCo-opTons of Loot and Cosmetics to CollectGreat SoundTrackCONSSort of Annoying Inventory Selection (I only used a mouse)Took Me Around 2ish Hours to Complete the Main Story Quests (EARLY ACCESS)RNG (not terrible xD)Overall Pit People definitely isn't a finished product hence the EARLY ACCESS, but there are still hours of fun to be had and plenty of laughs to well....laugh. If you are wanting a great game and are willing to wait a little while for more content then I would suggest picking it up. If you are into solo gamplay and want a story driven experience, I would probably wait until a few more patches or the full release some time this year.			"

Early Access Review
								I am someone who doesn't often purchase games.  However I played this to see what it was like yesterday with my girlfriend and we loved it so much I bought it.  It reminds me a little of Dokepon Kingdom on the wii.  I'm happy to purchase it and contribute towards its developement.   If you have a girlfriend that isn't so good with controllers or real-time games I recommend this to you.  I hope it has a lot of work and lots of improvement.  I still don't understand the leveling up or stats of each weapon (There are three types which are different) but I think the rest is just cosmetic.Edit 1 (Feb 11) :  Still extremely enjoying this game.  I understand now that the levelling up each time gives a toon 0.25% more stats.  Update two is also going to bring a lot of information regarding the weapons.  This game is awesome and I can't stop playing it with my girlfriend. It has got her into games so much I am out to buy a newer laptop so we can play more coop games like divinity etc.  Thanks behemoth! I will keep this girlfriend now!Edit 2 (March 29) : After the third update (Emperor's orders) I have to say this game is easily becoming one of my favourite games of all times.  I think I'll always remember it, kind of like, Borderlands 2 or WoW.  It has truly earned a place in my blackened heart.   We still play local coop and completely rip s*** up.  Mostly people are nice, but occasionally you'll find a bitter loser you'll tell you to suck some ****,  and you know, where else can you have a little cupcake wearing a robin hood hat tell you to suck his frosted candy pole?  It even uses his cute little voice while trying to portray his apocalyptic rage (since our tactics are flawless).  Edit 3 (April 13) :  Overall wait times to play 2v2 have increased a lot.  We wait 30-40 minutes for other players and they're usually the same 3-4 people we recognise.  Not sure what is happening.			"

								Simply incredible. This game isn't even finished yet and there is so much fun to be had and so much to do! The custimization is awesome with over 1,000 items to get for your units. The Behemoth never fails to make an awesome game, with the success of Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theatre being two of the funnest games i've played, PIt people takes the cake. The narration is hilarious as is the voice acting. For anyone who liked The Behemoth's last two games of just likes absurd little games with so much to do, this is for you. I highly recomend buying this game while it's price tag is at $15. I'm sure The Behemoth will keep improving this game only for the better and I am excitted to see what new content and gamplay mechanics will be added in the future! You have my 100 hours Pit People!			"

What could I say - I fall in Love. I feel unconditional, pure, raw Love for Pit PeopleThis game was on my radar since fellow named TotalBiscuit made a first impression video on it from PAX. Since then I was patiently waiting for time to come so I could play another game from The Behemoth - studio so different with their vision, with exciting and ridiculous sense of humor.Day of release has come, but I wasn't entirely sure to dip my toes into this fun loving, colourful water from get go, and I wanted to wait for full/finished product.Everything changed when I watched video by another fellow named Jesse Cox. Him and gentleman I already mentioned few sentences before, started series together. Watching them play, and having fun encourage me to jump right in without any hesitation.Oh boy! Oh boy! This game delivered.Five hours in so far and I'm having so much fun. Too much fun. Insane amount of fun; and what I say now, might be a stretch, but I feel Pit People is fun loving cousin of Darkest Dungeon and  XCOM in terms of excitement that I have in me while playing.Gameplay is just too damn addictive.Writing and humor so ridiculously charming. Possibilities with customisation are endless, same as number of different characters or creatures. Music is absolutely awesome, I can't wait for official soundtrack to come out.Visuals as always nice to look at, with many, many, many, many, many, many bits and pieces that makes the world feel vibrant and alive. Everything this shows how much though was put into this game, and you can see it from start thru multiple playthroughs.Besides unfinished story mode this game is polished to perfection ... well, I guess not perfection because inventory management bugs me quite a bit, more then I would like - but with this exception it is perfection in my eyes in terms of gaming experience.Well done oh mighty The Behemoth. You guys delivered another instant classic.I know, I know I'm just gushing no much saying praises, but it is just because I am filled with satisfaction and overwhelmed by how good this game actually is, and I need to get out of my system and spread it around. If you liked previous efforts from this devs, I don't know what are you waiting for; don't be like me and just do it! - BUY IT!Grade: A+ "

Despite it being ""Early Access,"" it really doesnt feel like it since there are loads of things to do, see and unlock. Not to mention there are already over 100 quests in the game.

								In Pit People you are a farmer and also a father who has lost his home and son. As you continue on, you dive deeper into insanity as you massacre entire populations of towns. You witness as innocent people are kidnapped in front of your eyes while you can't help them. You capture people to kill more efficiently. You let them die but bring them back to life to have them suffer the fate of death again and again. You kill people just for the hat they have on their heads. The story told is dark and chilling, showing us the struggles of Horatio in this unique setting. Pit People is possibly one of the greatest horror games of all time and will remain my favorite.			"

								Hi friends, This is the only game thats inspiried me to actually write a review.  If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy Tatics you'll love this game.  Although this is still early access the game is very much complete although some of the story is missing.  Not only is it hilarious but the game is very fullfilling to play.  The reason I've already played 24+ hours of this game is because of the pit.  The Pit is a place you can use the characters you've developed to fight other people in 1v1 or 2v2.  There are countless classes, weapons, armor and tatics on how you can win your next battle.After each battle if you keep 1 person alive you can capture him/her/it and it will join your team.  Any battle you encounter you can capture 1 of the enemies no matter how large they may be.  You then can use its armor/weapons to put on your other characters or keep them whole.  I'd easily pay $50 for the game as it is right now.  One of the best games i've played in a long time.  If your on the fence, buy it, you won't regret it.Much love and life! "

								This is a really good game! The art, animation, music, humor, and gameplay are all great. Also, the voice acting is great too! The only major downside of this game is that, since it's in early access, the story isn't finished yet. I think it took me about an hour and a half to finish the story. Still, this is a really fun game and I don't regret buying it. The only other con I can think of is that: navigating your team's inventory is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying with a mouse. It never goes to the option I want, ect. But it's not that big of a deal because using my keyboard to navigate the inventory menu seems to work just fine.			"

								Fun game with a great sound track.  I've been playing Behemoth games since their Kongregate days and they've yet to disapoint.  A good purchase if you're looking for a casual strategy game with a sense of humour. No real problems except a few minor annoyances with the games lack of tool tips when you mouse over items.  Inventory system could also be improved for ease of use.  Game does seem optimized for console controls over mouse and key board.  All my problems so far have been minor polish issues.			"

Early Access Review
								For a game that's early access, it really doesn't feel like it. I'm going to highlight what I feel is wrong/needs to be improved, in hopes the devs see it and consider it. For a review, I'll keep  it short. A very interesting world, full of LOTS of stuff, like LOTS, complete with music, great sound, and mostly good controls The music is amazing, I'll have it stuck in my head for days. Behemoth has yet another wonderful game out on the market. On to some gripes about the game.The PC controls are mostly good, but could use some fine tuning to make them not so wonky when selecting loadouts, the default controls are questionable, but rebindable so that's not that big of a deal. Also, in the intro, the load out screen and differences between ""tiers"" of items (i.e. cosmetics, light helmets, heavy helmets) isn't at all explained. It was super super confusing because I had no clue what I was doing. So the tutorial could use some more fine tuning as well. There are other things not very well explained, like what's on the HUD, I didn't know what I was looking at, or what it meant for a while. The items, such as campfires, and how to buy them isn't at all explained. I think my #1 glaring problem was the lack of explanation, so if you're reading this, Behemoth, it would be good to look into that.These are the most notable issues I saw, but damn this game is freaking fun. Doing Coop is sooooo much fun, but online is a mess. The biggest thing this game could benefit from is more flushed out tutorials, really explaining what everythng is. Keep it up Behemoth, it's a damn good game. Also, put people queued together on the same team. Or at least have an option to.			"

								GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 98% YES / 02% NOGOODSome of my favorite visuals and animations. An incredibly cute and fun style.Combat is fun and frantic. You quickly internalize the best way to use the hex-based combat and how the AI targets units. There's a great amount of risk & reward, especially with the units with more powerful ranged attacks.Daily pit fights are a great way to test your teams out against ""unfair AI"" as the game lovingly describes them.An absolute silly amount cosmetic weapons & armor that make constantly refitting your crew a joy.Overworld is exciting to explore, especially since the space bear moves the town around every so often so you have new maps / areas of the maps to explore.Side quests galore! So many objectives to complete and even new ones to find in the overworlds. You're able to recruit so many units! Around 20 different species to unveil and collect. I've had a blast finding them and trying out their unique abilities. It makes building your 5 spot party intriguing as you wonder if you should have units that only take up 1 spot, 2 spots, poison immune, etc.The sound effects are incredibly pleasant and spot on. I'll also include the music in this section since it keeps me happy and smiling. They did great work on the soundtrack.Stamper's back to narrate from his Battleblock Theater debut and he nails it here as the evil space bear.The developer has stated they're 99% certain there won't be a wipe for data since most of the game is here. The side missions and combat are done, but they're still building the rest of the story missions.For $15 there's a lot of game in here. It's a great price.NEUTRALThe story missions start to drift away from the thrill that is the rest of the game, since I haven't touched the main characters for awhile and they've been out of my parties. Granted the story is still fun, albeit the portion that is being finished. I still love hearing the space bear ring chaos onto the land, but I'm barely invested in Horatio and Pipistrella's quest for revenge. SUMMARYAs an early access title, Pit People nail the fun, frantic nature of turn-based hex combat. Everything's an absolute delight down from the visuals to the soundtrack. I'm eagerly awaiting the full release but that won't stop me from enjoying it a great deal before then.			"

								Absolutely fantastic game.Despite being in Early Access, all the key elements and ideas the game wants to use are there and they work very well together. This mad mix of Fire Emblem, XCOM and Pokemon works exceptionally well, and serves as a nice introduction to strategy/turn based games.The game comes with traditional Behemoth humor where anything can happen, and Stamper returning as the narrator makes for a very enjoyable experience!If it looks interesting to you, you'd be doing yourself a diservice to not try it now while it's in its cheaper Early Access build. You can learn and get a grip of the main mechanics for when the rest of the story mode is released in the full release, which is really the only thing that is missing.			"

(obvious reason is.. obvious?)Always do i enjoy Behemoth titles! :D (going as far as back as when all content was on NewGrounds and browsing NG was all i did.. and what glorious days those were!)im not just a Tom Fulp fanboy.. to this day, i legitimately enjoy 90% of his works. mix in Paladin's fart humor; and ive yet to grow tired of what is released by, what is now, 'The Behemoth'! truly, a unique group of 'artists' if i do say so myself. they tend to the child in me that doesnt ever want to grow up (;P.S. hm.. as far as being labaled a 'fanboy', or 'dickrider'(more appropriate?), goes; i started using/abusing NG within the first years of its indoctrination into the world of the internet, and ive kept up with their work ever since.. so i suppose i cant hide where my loyalty lies!

								According to Steam I dumped 18 hours into the Closed Beta during the week+ it was going on. I haven't replayed the main quest yet to see the finished animations and whatnot, but just from the short amount of time I've run around the map in the Early Access version, I'm seeing the same fun game but with more. More quests, more loot, more customization, more ridiculously good time.Whereas the quirks of the Narrator and the occasional plotpoint rearing its head has put Battleblock Theater at the top of the list, for Pit People it is the sheer massiveness of the content combined with the replay value. I foresee this game being a favourite of a lot of people for the coming years, myself included. There's just so much to do and discover, and no chance of it tapping out any time soon.Highly recc getting this game, even in Early Access. It's a complete game, you just have to wait for the rest of the main quest to unlock. That's not so bad, right? In the meantime, there's a multi-tiered quest in Tinkletown waiting for your assistance.			"

(you just have to play the game to understand) Time and time again, they have produced high quality entertainment, while keeping their games reasonably priced. All in all, this game is super insane, and just downright fun with friends. Cant get much better for $15.			"

								Stratigic, and yet simple. You have to think your moves and party members out carfully, but it's not one of those game where yo have to be super human to keep track of everything going on in the game. As far as the story goes, weird, a little crude at times, but over all, quite entertaining. Don't get this game if you don't have a sence of humor, but if you do, take a deep breath before you play because once you get going, there will be points where you won't be able to stop laughing.

The PVP “pit fights” are worth the price alone, and you have a full game of joyous world map quests, creature collecting and gear finding to go along with it. Even in early access this game is worth twice the purchase price............really it is, that’s insane!Yep get Pit People, no one ever regretted buying Pit People.

								This game was one that I was hesitant to buy purely because when I looked at a lot of the reviews I saw people with 1 hour or 2 hours at most, and though that was an original worry I soon learned that these pepople were not doing much more than the main story.  Yes currently the game has a very brief period of story to play as it has been in developement for a brief period of time and as such what they have playable to do with the story is small.  The parts that are available are currently bug free, the online has little lag and is very clean, and the fact that the side things to do are very impressive leads me to say that this game if you enjoy Behemoth and their games get it.

								Pit People isn't even completed yet, and it fills me with all kinds of happy!  And blueberries.  I normally avoid Early Access and just wait for a finished product where I can plainly see if it's reliable and entertaining or not, but I have a lot of confidence in The Behemoth, and watching TotalBiscuit & Jesse Cox's co-op playthrough footage convinced me that the game is indeed in a good enough state for Early Access.  It is absolutely my kind of humor, especially with Stamper's quality narration, but I am also adoring the game on a mechanical level.  It's simple enough to where you're not bogged down with tons of tedious information, but still challenging enough to where you need to be aware of positioning and planning (before and during battle), or a Pixie may just burn off the faces of your entire team.Conducting battles is mentally stimulating, WINNING battles is often deeply satisfying, and the humor is the sweet, delicious frosting on the cupcake that just makes it that much better in the end!  I can't imagine a world without The Bear....			"

								Highly polished tbs. Everything about it is done well from its unique asthetics to the excellent and amusing voice work to the gameplay. I am told that the single player content to this point is pretty short but even once the storyline is finished I can see it becoming a game you only go back to for what would seem to be some cool pvp and co-op pvp. Regardless of how it turns out in its final state this game is certainly worth its price as it is now. The devs have also indicated that the, admittedly low given its quality, price will change to an extra 33% once Pit People leaves early access. Given that it's in good shape already my advice would be simply ""don't wait"". And that's a rare thing from someone who hates the whole way Early Access generally works.			"

								Lets just start with pros. It's funny. And it's pokemon of sorts. It also is a tactical turn-based game, where you need to position your squad well, or face the consequences.Lets get to cons. It should be a game. But as of now, this is just a humor collection (and not the finest one either, let's be honest). This ""game"" horribly lacks one thing, and one thing only: GAMEPLAY. If you pick a character ""A"" and a character ""B"" of the same race, the only difference it will have is their level (and i actually doubt that it even has any significance). You can wear same gear as your other character, so what's the point? And most of the gear has no difference exept the looks. You wanna crush your enemies with golden scepter? Sure. You wanna do it with a lolipop instead? Fine, it matters not. You can even pick the giant ice-cream cone and it will be still as good for crushing your enemies, as the sax or some actual mace (this is somewhat untrue, since really rarely you get the gear with additional effects, like fire resistance, poinsoned attacks and stuff. But still). My biggest porblem as of now is that on the Xth battle you get bored. You probably have same characters as you had X-1 battles before, so you just do the very same thing you did for X-1 battles before, and kill your enemies the very same way you killed them for X-1 battles before. WHY? I had 30 level ups already, can't i be somewhat stronger? Can't i have some new skills to test? The best way to describe this game would be ""like heroes of might and magic, but without heroes, and all you have is your army - which is forever limited to N units per squad"". But if, one day, having 2 cupcakes will mean more than x2 healing. If, one day, having hummie ""A"" will mean something different from having hummie ""B"". If, one day, Horatio will actually DIE. That day will be the day when this game becomes much better than it is now.TBH, i cant say that this game is bad, or good. It is neutral. If you want some funnies, you will find this game better than neutral; If you want to play a game, you will find this game worse than neutral. But i will press the ""not recommended"" button, just for the sake of keeping balance with all those ""recommended"" reviews this game already has. Besides, this is Early Access. The game still has more room for improvement. So lets hope for the best, and watch events unfold.			"

								This game is amazing, coming out of its shell from Newgrounds, The Behemoth has out done them selves with creating a game with more ear tingling voice acting from Will Stamper as every different race ever and a giant bear, but with also that iconic The Behemoth art style from Dan Paladin. And provides a new ""Chess-like"" turn based fighting system that also breaks out of there ""Hack and slash"" fighting style they had for Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, while also completly move away from the side scrollers such as from the previously mentioned and Battle Block Theater. While also introducing even more of a variety of weapons then Castle Crashers, but allows the use of different effects from different armor, swords, sheilds, and characters. Not to mention the stunning crude humor it gives with straight out toilet/feces gags, to sarcastic, whimsical, and  just plain funny word play. At the moment i have come to the point of the game where things are starting to become dry in the free roam world (Which by the way, it has a free roam world) for i have beaten all the major quests, and sign up-able quests, and im starting to run out of run along quests that you find on your own, but while you wait for those updates to come rolling in, you can spend your time PvP-ing in the pit gaining wonderful spoils and gold, enjoy!

								I don't like turn-based strategy games all that much, but this game is spectacular! I have never enjoyed a game's voices and characters as much as I have with this game. Stamper made this game wonderful to just listen to with his beautiful voice. Stamper, I know you don't consider yourself a good voice actor but I think you are a wonderful voice actor with a very unique voice. Range don't mean nothing when you've got a voice like that.tl;dr This game is great even if its early access. So go out and buy it.			"

								This game so good for early access even the main story content way too little. But it doesn't matter for me. This is an early access, the story will come.  For an early access i would like to say that+ Art style+ Soundtrack+ Several Classes, weapon+ Replay feature+ Side quest+ Nice humor btw by The Behemoth- dont read my review10/10 as always for The Behemoth. Im waiting what else we can buy in the market. Im thinking that there is not much to do with the market with a little things to buy. Next review when the game get a new update or im waiting the full release.			"

								It's worth the buy at $15 dollars right now, even if you're on the fence. In the future I can see $20 dollars being a very reasonable asking price as well. The voice-acting, art, music, and animations are all top-notch. Behemoth's creativity goes unparalleled. It's really a great game - you can't go wrong with this developer.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game based on the fact that it had an incredible 97% positive score from over 2300 reviews and Stamper voice acting. For the first hour or so I was very entertained by Stamper, but I noticed the combat felt extremely simplistic. By the last couple of hours I played it for I was half-convinced I was just not understanding the greatness that clearly must be there based on the reviews. After reading the negative reviews I think maybe I'm not crazy and the gameplay in general is very shallow.I get that some people probably really like the collectathon aspect of the game where you capture all these different creatures, but when it comes right down to it all you're really doing is moving characters to appropriate hexes and ending your turn while hoping they crit with their one attack which you don't even get to decide who it's used on in many cases. Even the gear you equip your characters with has no real effect besides a few preset options like sword with shield or sword with bigger shield. The sword might be a candy cane or a golf club and the shield might be a cake or a playing card, but that has absolutely no effect other than cosmetic customization.It seems like a lot of people are very loyal to Behemoth and I get that maybe they're also investing in the potential greatness of the game down the road, but as it stands this game is absolutely not one of the Best games on Steam in my opinion like the ratings would have you believe. I hardly ever review anything unless I think the reviews are very skewed in a way I don't agree with and this is one of those cases. I do not at all believe this game is worth $15 in its current state, but I understand why some people might buy it in good faith that it will be in the future and then some. To anyone else reading this please do more research on this game rather than relying on the review system if that $15 matters to you.			"

								After giant space bear crashed on the planet life never be the same again.Land shattered on hexagons, time starts to be experienced by turns.If you here for a narrated story campaign it's not here yet. Only introductional part and single quest. With damn good cutscenes. But there several dozens of one-stop side quests on a world map, 4 bigger side quest-lines, nineteen species to catch/recruit and more than thousand of collectible accessories and weapons to collect. Exploration, adventuring, quest dialogs and stories, secrets and rarities, battles in a pit versus other players which beside being showcase of tactical genius also works as showcase of collected rarities and oddities.I'd say it feels like fusion of Shining Force 2 with adult version of Adventure Time cooked on Behemoth humour.Oh and music is perfect.

								I can't come up with much for this review because this game is so awesome! The humor in the dialog for the characters got me laughing (even the simple cutscenes with your team meeting up with some quest giver within the world map are funny for how they talk) plus the variety of weapons, armor, etc. are full of memes. One of the helmets I got was based off of the doge meme and another one that's based off of the I see what you did there meme. If I had to pick a favorite species in this game it would have to be the Vampiress. I look forward in seeing this game fully finished and off the early access side to play the rest of the other side quests and main quest. :D			"

								Game is awesome! The story and humor are what you would expect from a The Behemoth game (only played Battleblock, not Castle Crashers). Game play is relatively simplistic on the surface but there's a lot of potential for thought and optimisation during play and I assume especially for PvP.I likened the game to friends as Final Fantasy Tactics mashed with Pokemon with the art and humor of Battleblock.Worth a try even during early access as the game is very polished. If you can appreciate The Behemoth storytelling, this is for you, and if you like the idea of turn-based strategy games, this will be right up your alley as well.Also, the music is just great and so fitting in the game. If that's something that you like in a game, then the music just adds another reason to give it a go!			"

YouTube™ Video: Let's Play Pit People Co-Op (Early Access) Pt. 1 - Tales of Blueberries 

			Views: 2,212		

			Pit People, the next game from the developers of Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater, has hit Early Access on Steam, and Jacob and Murphy are here to try out this new wacky tale of bears,...		

As a turn-based adventure game, Pit People greatly differs from The Behemoth’s beat-em ups Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers and puzzle platformer BattleBlock Theater. As with these games, though, the patented wacky Behemoth humor is definitely present and possibly at its best, with silliness around every corner, craziness that will leave you confused yet smiling like an idiot, and references to past games hidden (or not so much) in every nook and cranny. Stamper as the voice of an omnipresent narrator is particularly on cue with his side-splitting spiteful commentary and nefarious interactions with the game characters and world that can happen at seemingly unexpected moments as he looks to kill his boredom at your expense.For being in Early Access, the game looks and plays great, with solid controls and crisp, styled 2D sprites, though some of the UI could perhaps be cleaned up a bit or better explained. Your house in town where you can change out your team initially felt a bit overwhelming, requiring a lot of clicks to change out equipment and lack of button cues leading to a team member almost getting sold. Likewise, we received no warning that a quest would receive an F for Failure by returning back to town before we completed it, leading to an awkward visit with the local principal. Battles, meanwhile, could begin to get cluttered and claustrophobic, especially with the extra bodies and input in co-op, with allies and enemies having similar color and designs bunched up together on screen at once; there was often confusion on which character was currently selected and who was moving where. Our gripes are minor compared to the refined edges, though, and once you get things down, battles can feel intuitive while still retaining strategic complexity, allowing fights to be as fast-paced or as slow and methodical as you wish them to be. With a discount while in Early Access, Pit People appears to be another great game by The Behemoth that is worth a pick up and play, and we are excited to see the rest of the crazy content and wacky adventure that will be in the finished game.Catalyst Players/Reviewers: Jacob and MurphyVersion: Early Access - Jan. 18, 2017Played: Co-Op Campaign (3hrs)			"

								This is a very fun and simple game, yet it's deep and complex in a unique way.The story is comedical and light hearted which we've come to expect from Behemoth. The dialogues between characters are very humorous and unexpected. Although the story is very short as of now (the game only being in Alpha) the immense amount of side quests and the arena for PvP already gives this game long playability.The combat system is very well implemented, having different characters which are effective against others gives for a very diverse team builder. There is no one way to build your team and it is fun to test out different combinations and see what works.The character customization is a very fun aspect of the game, allowing you to collect, trade and create a very unique looking team. Since most (not all) of the changes in the same catagory affect only the look and not the damage you have no punishment in making your team look as crazy, funny or badass as you want. And I guess i should mention the NPC names... They're amazing. Enough said.Overall, I've been playing this game with a friend throughout, and I can say it is a lot of fun. We are excited for the whole game to come out but are right now content with finishing the many side missions and trying to beat the unfair arena (which by the way, is VERY unfair). I would strongly recommend this game to anyone. It's light hearted, funny and addicting; it's nice to see a game in Alpha that shows so much promise. I'd even go as far to say that if this was the final form of the game I would still spend the money on it.Now if you'll excuse me, I have a unicorn mortar team to make.			"

The TL;DR Version: I'm only a couple of hours into this game and I've already discovered a Unicorn that doubles as artillery and a pair of gnomes in flying toilets as well as beaten numerous people to a pulp with a giant lollipop. Nuff said.The Actual ReviewThe humor is crude in the most wonderful way and it suits the art style perfectly. Speaking of art style, it's the most adorable looking game I've seen in awhile, it's really dorky in all the right ways and it contrasts beautifully with the over the top violence that is the game. The overworld aspect is a weird mixture of the really old school Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda games with Pokemon, a lot of people have compared this to pokemon on account of how you recruit new members for your roster.The main villain is one of the best I've seen so far, and right on Par with Dusan from Watchdogs 2 (perhaps a controversial opinion but I really liked him as a villain) and his near constant interference in your affairs will keep you on your toes without being a pain. Not to mention his voice overs. I want to give special mention to the actor who voiced him because he is just wonderful.The music is the other feature of this game that's absolutely stunning, it's an interesting line up of electroblends, from swing to funk and a few others in between, and if you get sick of the music in the city (which is pretty hard to do) you can always find records and unlock new songs to change it too. One of the best features is that the song will remain changed until you change it again, even if you leave the city and come back.Pit People lures you in with it's charming villain, humorous story and adorable art style but make no mistake, it will not be an easy experience. The game is forgiving enough, as death only has consequences up until you return to the town, but the battles can quickly overwhelm you if you're not paying attention and often times you'll find yourself losing fighters without immediately realising why. This game is incredibly fun though and I don't think I could recommend it enough.			"

The upcoming title by the legendary The Behemoth, will it be fun? i hope so, as of now playing this game for about 20 hours i feel like it's a solid game with a few tweaks to be made before the full release, easily worth the money so far even with the limited content.7.3/10			"

								If you've kept up with this companies games, you'll know even if you don't like a game you should buy it because the next game tends to benefit from also owning a game.That said, this one fills a niche in Steam that was muh needed to be filled.  Its simple and yet offers a varity of ways to customise fighters.  Some items have 0 effects, while others trade off one benefit for another.  The game is fairly well balanced because of it, with nothing giving you a 0 absolute advantage over another.  I would say of the 4 games this company has produced in the years, this is one of the top end of the 4.			"

								This game! Oh boy!Behemoth has done it again, this time they hit what could quite possibly be one of their most engrossing ands fluid experiences. I've owned and played all of their games (excluding Alien Hominid) and have to say, this is easily tied for my favorite of their games.Strategic, fast-paced fun, that's all there is to it. Behemoth's signature quirky style and humor gives this game an edge on other TRPG wannabes on the steam store.A few notes for the Devs though, if they're reading!As of Home Improvement 1, there is no skip turn button in combat. While it's nothing major, it does severely effect the flow of the game for TRPG veterans, or people who understand how the turn will play out. Since movement is fairly.. Slow, due to low movement ranges and large maps, this makes a very tedious experience during overworld encounters, and while most will be fine with it, it'd definitely be a welcome change. "

- The soundtrack is pretty iffy. Some times it's good, other times it's like ""what am I even listening to?""- If there's more than one target that your character can hit, you can't choose who you're going to hit. This can be extremely irritating in scenarios where you can either hit someone who's weak to your attacks or someone who's strong to it.- Aforementioned Newgrounds artstyle. It's alright, but comes off as a little... unprofessional?In short, Pit People is worth your time if you're looking for a creative, albeit somewhat generic turn-based combat game. I give it a 7/10.

 Overall a Great Game This is a game that i purchased a while back, and since its early access realease i have sunk in hours. The main aspect of the game is to recruit the many different types of fighters to join yoiur team. You can recruit anyone at anytime as long as you have proper materials. Once you have created your dream team, you can take your team to the pit, where you battle against real people. The overall experience i've had with the pit is amazing. Some bugs need polishing here and there but overall it's very stable for early access. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, and even to people who don't enjoy turn based games. It's not just a turn based game, it has wacky characters and will make you laugh constantly. So try it out even if you don't think it's your thing, i never really enjoyed turn based games, but this is one exception.			"

								Pit People is honestly the one game I have played the most of in the last week or so - even though it's pretty obviously ment to be a more casual title.I won't try to explain to you why I did this, instead, let me just tell you about the things you can expect within this title that may lead you to become the same irrational human being I am as of now:- It's full of great, over the top humour. If names like Stamper and Psychicpebbles ring a bell, it's in the same vein as their stuff.- The combat is extremely simple with very little decision making. You don't decide what abillity a character is going to do and you do not decide which enemy he is going to attack. All you decide is where he will move. The Game will highlight his possible targets at the position you're moving him. He'll attack which ever one he feels like upon arrival. If there is only one target, of course, he will attack that one.- Another thing that adds to the combat is the variety of humanoids and monsters you can catch and add to your troops, with every race having different perks, passives and attacks. They all come with random names as well (which you will be able to see BEFORE catching them, so don't worry if you only want serious names.) Because, let me tell you, there are some real hitters in there. As of me wiriting this review, there are a total of 18 Races, not counting the different weapons some of them can use, which essentially makes them different units again.- The Main-Cast of characters is charming as all hell. Sadly, the main-story is not, currently,  very long - however that's going to be expected of an early-access title.- Staying with the theme of early-acces: This is one of the few games that actually seems to use that term rightfully. It's very much playable and you can already sink a good amount of hours into it, however, it's still, noticeably, not done. Don't worry though, the devs said previously that you are going to keep all units, items and general progress during the developement of Pit People.- Did I say Items? Yeah, for some people this is the biggest factor: You can find an insane amount of items in this game for every race that change their looks, sometimes drastically so. The same goes for weapons. Very rarely do these items have a bonus effect (the likes of: does fire damage, but less physical, etc.) - Also, there is meme-gear. I'm sure our creators look upon us in pure hatred and disgust at this point. So why not enjoy the ride until the inevitable heat-death of the universe. "

								There's a giant bear form space that crashes into the planet, where a farmer with a dead kid and a princess with daddy issues go after a band of gladiators on a shuttle, meet a hardcore Demi-clops, a cupcake (named Gluten), who heals you (with its' own frosting), and a strange Spanish lady with a fetish for netting people, help a guy poop in a town shaped like a giant toilet where pooping is banned, take part in the revolutionary war against the damned R3D C04T robots, save a burning town from the dreaded Fire Men so that it can keep on burning, find an orphaned baby leopard and return it to Dave, the Leopard Master, who doesn't like leopards, and generally enjoy a wondrous romp around a weird world full of nonsensical creatures and characters.Made by The Behemoth. Yes, THE Behemoth, not just a Behemoth... THE!!! Behemoth, capital E! From the same guys that brought you the co-op, cat-ertainment and spectacle-puzzle platformer BattleBlock Theatre and ridiculous side-scrolling adventures of CastleCrashers, comes Pit People, a ""baby's first tactical game"" with enough character and humour to finally fill that empty void inside!But what do I mean by ""baby's first tactical game""? Well, Pit People is a tactical arena fighter wherein you have several pawns with different abilities, strengths and weaknesses, which you move around on a hex grid in a turn-based fashion. Think XCOM.But unlike XCOM you don't really have absolute control over your pawns. You can't really tell them what to do, only move them around (hopefully) ""strategically"". This makes the game somewhat more straightforward and easier than your average, XCOM-like turn-based tactical game. It does however present some difficulties XCOM veterans won't be used to.For one, since you can't tell your pawns what ability to use or which target to attack, you're pretty much left to the mercy of whatever Nuffle-worshiping algorithm decides that. More on that later however.In general, the game is pretty easy to grasp, the RPG aspects are limited to mainly just customisation options. While there is a ton of crazy loot, there's no plethora of uniquely different items with different stats- a tall shield is a tall shield, whether a garden fence or a giant beetle. However, within each item category there's the odd ""special item"" that sacrifices some of the normal stats of that category for a particular bonus. Want a shield with some fire resistance? Well, that comes with less blocking power, though not enough to make too much of a difference.Different character types (Cupcake, Cyclops, Demi-Clops, Human, Pixie etc.) have different proficiencies and characteristics, making them more or less potent with different items and loadouts and in different roles.There's no skill tree or talents (currently, as of Update 1, though that may also be planned), so every level your pawns gain is just a straightforward increase to all their stats, though not a major one. So there's no need to worry whether a 3% crit chance is better than a 1.5% increase to rate of fire. A level 10 character will always be objectively better than a level 9 one from the same type. In fact, the game (again, currently, Update 1 did make some stats clearer) makes very little effort to let you know what the exact stats of your pawns are. There's a bunch of nicely stylised bars - LBS (how much equipment a pawn can carry, since, as you can imagine, a tall shield is heavier than a buckler, which affects their movement and agility), DMG (how much total, maximum damage a pawn does, based on pawn type and equipment), RNG (range, for ranged pawns or ranged abilities like cage-throwing, each level on the bar represents a hex), DEF (defence against melee attacks, usually determined by helmets), BLK (ability to block arrows and other projectiles, usually determined by shields) and DODG (dodge chance, the lighter the equipment a pawn carries, the higher their dodge chance, based on pawn type), that give you some information on how powerful a pawn in a particular loadout is, though, save from the damage value, it's not particularly clear.There's also a range of icons for the different abilities and resistances pawns can inherit based on their type and equipment, though those provide little identification for what they actually stand for (since Update 1, the percentage chance of a particular ability to take effect is displayed below the relative icon, though that doesn't help much). Unfortunately, there's really no indication of a pawn's weaknesses, except maybe a vague footnote in your Recruitment Book (written and kept by the aforementioned Spanish lady).This may be a deal breaker for min-maxing nuts who care only for the most optimal approach to things, but in the spirit of this game, it's a well implemented system that takes little effort to get used to and navigate. Also, if you're one of those nuts, get out of here! This is a casual game, go back to your XCOMs! It also works well with the games' combat mechanics, or really lack thereof. Combat is determined on a rock-paper-scissors basis. A helmet blocks a sword but a mallet trumps a helmet. The UI is quite clear in this regard - if your pawn has an advantage against an enemy, there's a Facebookish ""thumbs up"" over that target, if it's weak or less effective, it's a ""thumbs down"".Attacks and order of operations is somewhat weird however. As I said above, the action and target a pawn picks is pretty much random. To a point. You can, and in fact have to, in order to make the most of every encounter, position your pawns in such ways so as to ""guide"" their algorithm.For instance, if there's two or more targets your pawn can reach, it will most likely spread its' attacks between all of them (or several of them, depending on how many attacks the pawn can make). If it has an advantage against one of them, it may favour that target with more attacks, or it may not. Moving your pawn to a hex where it makes contact with only one target makes it attack only that target however, giving it all its' got.Ranged combat is somewhat trickier however. Pawns with ranged weapons will always attack all enemies within their range for as many attacks they can make. They also attack in melee however and in fact prefer melee if they're ""threatened"" (have an adjacent enemy). They also usually have a ""dead zone"", a range of hexes below which they won't be able to fire at range.All of this makes combat both straightforward and engaging. Yes, all you're doing is moving chess pieces around, but much like actual chess pieces, your pawns have certain rules they follow when attacking/performing actions and you need to think about their order of operations and placement. Movement time is something you also need to consider as pawns that don't move/finish their movement first will attack/do their action while those still moving are still... moving, making for some unexpected results of potential targets getting flung out of reach of that perfect surround you had planned, just because that Hair Troll attacked first. And you can't simply overwhelm your enemies with numbers and brute power. Sure, larger pawns are more powerful, but they also usually take up an extra space on your team, so there's also that to consider. It is in fact you who would most often be outnumbered, since you'll often be engaging groups with more enemies than your team (even in co-op, the game adjusts accordingly).There's also no permanent death in this game, unlike other games of the kind, like XCOM, Darkest Dungeon etc. When a pawn dies in combat, it remains unavailable in your team until you return to town, after which it's as good as new! (scars and PTSD notwithstanding) As for the world and story... Oh boy, are you in for one wicked whirl!(Continue reading in the comments, this is a long one)			"

								Pit People is an adventure/turn-based strategy combo with an emphasis on humorous storyline, excellent cartoon artwork and the epic voice of Will Stamper.GameplayYou have a home village on a world map - it occasionally gets moved around by a giant purple six-legged teddy bear, but that's another story. You prepare your team of 6 fighters (selected from a growing pool of available fighters) with weapons and armour, then venture out in search of enemies to battle. You can either just go out and battle random enemies (they are all over the place) or else follow the quests. When you defeat an enemy, instead of wiping out all the fighters, you can capture the last one with a cage and recruit him into your squad. After a victorious battle you have to make it back to the village where all your loot is redeemed. If you're intercepted by another enemy on the journey back you risk having to battle them and lose your loot from the first encounter, but if you pay attention you can avoid this by using the cannons on the wagon to stun the enemies and slip past them, or use nitro to mow them down!The battles are turn-based, played out on a hex board. The way I've played there's not really much thinking involved and it's quite fast-paced. You move each fighter into position one by one then hit the spacebar to proceed, and they each make their own decisions about which enemies to hit. As they inflict damage and defeat enemy fighters they gain XP, making them stronger for future battles. The different weapons/armour you give them also make a difference to the team dynamics, if you want to get down to the nitty gritty. My 4 melee, 1 ranged and one healer has served me well so far.Inside the village you can buy new equipment in the market with the gold you've made on your excursions and play around with squad customisation, replacing members and switching equipment around. You can fight the AI in the Pit (within the home village) to gain some quick XP and gold, although I haven't had much success in there, I think I need to improve my team strength a bit more. You can use the big phone to dial up a PvP battle - I haven't managed to get a match yet but I haven't been too patient. This is a popular game so in general I don't anticipate any problems finding matches should I want to get involved with that later. At the moment I have more than enough to keep me busy with the singleplayer campaign.The quests (which you can pick up in the village) advance the storyline as you defeat and rescue various characters along the way. The cutscenes are a highly anticipated treat.Controller is supported but mouse is better.ArtworkWhen you look closely at the cartoony graphics you realise there's a great deal of detail here. Everywhere you go, the screen is packed with a seemingly endless array of funny looking enemies, absurd weapons and fabulous cutscenes. You never know what delightful thing you're going to discover next and it keeps you motivated to continue.SoundThe first thing I want to talk about is the theme tune. In my reviews I always comment on the quality of the music, but I'm always judging it as game-music, I would never dream of adding it to my actual music collection. Here is the first exception I've ever encountered. It's an awesome, rocking beat that belongs in the real music charts. The down side is that I have trouble starting the game. I sit at the main menu with my mouse hovering over the start icon, my neck jerking like a strutting pigeon. When I finally manage to tear myself away from that tune and log in to the game there are more great tunes to enjoy - selectable on the gramophone in the village - it's all very original, memorable and suits the game down to a tee.Will Stamper's voice acting has reached legendary status in the game world, his narration alone is worth the price of admission. There is no other voice like it. The absurd silliness and the way he yells ""shut up!"" is something I could listen to all day long. There is a lot of his voice in the game, but there is also a lot of content so naturally it's rather spread out, in the cutscenes and the odd impatient comment during battles telling you to get a move on. For me it's the main highlight of the game.DifficultyOn normal setting the singleplayer campaign and quests are fairly easy. I've won nearly all battles by just pushing my melee fighters towards the enemy and keeping my ranged and healer further away. In the home village there's an 'insane difficulty' switch that I dare not touch. I assume that you'd need to pay far more attention to the strengths and weaknesses of your team and your weapons in that mode.The Pit is difficult even on normal setting - you have to win 2 out of 3. I can usually win the first round but my team's health stays depleted for the next battle and I always lose. Perhaps I'll have better luck later on when my team has levelled up more.In conclusion, for me the enjoyment of the game is in the content so I'm glad that the battling is nice and easy and allows me to progress and discover it all without any hold-ups or frustration.PerformanceThe game is in Early Access but if you weren't aware of that fact you would never guess. There is still more content to come for the single player campaign, that's why it's in EA, but it already feels like a full game. Totally bug-free as far as I can tell, tons of content and it just generally feels finished and polished.Windows only, but there is a firm promise of Mac/Linux on release.ValueAfter 10 hours of gameplay I've barely scratched the surface. My overall progress bar currently sits at 10% so that should give you an idea of the amount of content here, not to mention online PvP multiplayer battling. It's not only the amount of content that's impressive, but the general quality of every aspect of it. The price right now is a steal and you should grab it right away - there will be a price increase after final release.SteamAchievements, cloud support, local/online co-op, local/online multiplayer. No trading cards but in this case it really doesn't matter. If you're going to let that influence your decision to buy then you're crazy.VerdictThe battling gameplay isn't exactly ground breaking or unique but it's very well implemented and satisfying. Everything else about the game - storyline, humour, voice acting, music, artwork, animation is absolutely outstanding. If you don't normally go for turn-based strategy, this is still a game you will love just for the bonkers fun of it all.The Behemoth: ""We Make Games"". Yes, they most certainly do.			"

								I usually don't like turn based games, but this games general feel makes me love it. It's really difficult to describe. Maybe it's the sound track, maybe it's the funny characters, or the random encounters. My point is, even in EA this game is pretty great. Also, it should take ""no longer than a year and no shorter than a couple months"" to release, along with a tiny chance of the game ending up like most EA games considering it's Behemoth.			"

								Fun and challenging, without being punishing. A lighthearted glee is evident in every aspect of this turn based, hex-map strategy and collection game. Music is some of the best, and the Narrator is great. Unfortunately there seems to be very little of said Narrator. With his the only voice of the game, other than gibberish played over text, Pit People can rely too heavily on its otherwise excellent sound design. I found that with no actual dialogue to draw me in I just skipped past more and more of the admittedly  clever and funny story as soon as I read it. Plays well with a good strategic options base. Tons of mostly cosmetic items to collect. Wide and shallow with equipped items dictating character class for humans while creatures you recruit can only use their default skills. Since you can't predict the type of fight you'll face this specialization limits their utility and use.Too much fun with co-op, can't wait for more.			"

This Game Rocks!I have never been a fan of any sort of turn based games, but this one is a true gem. My skepticism was snuffed out by the humor and large amount of working content already available. The turn based combat can be rather amusing and I've even been on the edge of my seat in some of the battles, too. The co-op is incredibly fun with good friends. Hours have been lost trying to build the right tag team combo with, of course, the coolest looking apparel for my troops. I understand if you're not a fan of turn based games, but give this one a shot. It's way better with friends and the mindless exploring isn't too bad. My one and only con for this game is the story block. At the moment, the story is a work in progress and seems to be releasing in increments. That's not entirely bad, but I'd really love to dig into it all at once and see where Horatio ends up.Other than that, this game is great and would recommend to anyone!			"

								Okay so this is an early access review.So far, this game is amazing. It has catchy music, easy to pick up gameplay, while still being challenging, interesting quests, customizable characters, plus I love their recruiting mechanic. See a cool enemy? Just have Sofia toss a cage at them and now they belong to you. Honestly it's great going around, getting into fights, and grabbing whatever cool looking dude shows up, I just gotta catch them all. Even though I already did all the early access story, I can already tell I'm going to spend hours just dicking about. I finished up the story in a day, and am so hooked for when the game fully releases so I can experience it more.Highly recommend picking it up now, while it's in early access.			"

								Battleblock theatre was more or less my entry in this wacky world The Giant Chicken threw me into, and I had a nice time. It was irritating at times, but they proved they can make a good and instantly challenging platformer, while at the same time, throwing exellent humor at you from all sides.Then I played Castle Crashers, where the same chicken proved it could make an excellent beat-em-up but this time, they had more subtile humor. Now, you got this. Pit People. The Chicken's shot at fire emblem. And it is utterly glorious. Right away they give you rules of engagement that, classically, you'll forget instantly, and wonder why you keep losing. Such as how you should only be using maces against dudes with helmets. I forgot about that and wondered why I wasn't doing much damage.The narrator jumped out of Battleblock and right into Pit People, and he makes me truly happy. Ulitimately, a chicken programmed this game.A chicken lent it massiveness to this game, and speaks in the royal 'we'.If that does not give you reason as to why you should play this gem; I nary know what will.Its in early access and I don't care. I have much history with them, and this is about as solid as all the others.Happy to support the chicken once again.I'd keep making chicken jokes, but at some point they'd get rather fowl.easy 9/10			"

								I LOVED Castle Crashers back on Xbox 360, and I know that these devs are outstanding. This game is excellent, as good as castle crashers in my opinion (though they are slightly different games, turn based v.s. hack n slash). This has the same great feel as Castle Crashers, while still doing it's own cool new thing! I love the story so far, and I am frankly excited to play more a.s.a.p. This game is absolutely worth the $15 price tag, even in early access. There is plenty of fun content to enjoy and keep us busy until full release. I am having SOOO much fun already, it's like Gladius (PS2) and Castle Crashers had a kid! These Devs hit the nail on the head every time though: the comedic elements, the outstanding music, the cuteness, the horror... lol GET THIS GAME! You will not regret it. Hats off to you, The Behemoth, another homerun game! I'm already counting this among my classics, and I can't wait to play with friends!			"

								A really well polished early access game, and i am looking forward to the full game, the sad thing is right now is that me and my friend beat all the quests in less then a day, i really do hope the full game is gonna have a long story like CC and BBT had,Uhh small little edit of march the 22nd 2017, they did a little update, they added like 3-4 more missions to the main story, so yeah, thats that ^_^			"

								Pit People is a fun isometric turn-based combat-strategy game made by the lovely folks who created Battleblock Theatre and Castle Crashers. Pit People features many recruitable characters, including (but not limited to) Pixies, Spiderpeople, Unicorns, Cannibals, Zombies, Gnomes, Cupcakes, Mushrooms, Robots, and a pesky moustachioed man named Horatio.In Pit People, William Andrew Stamper is the incredibly charismatic and not-at-all-psychotic Narrator, just as he was in Battleblock Theatre. Now, onto the gameplay itself. While it is early access, the combat is still quite sound, and I've yet to encounter any bugs. One of the only issues that I've encountered is the fact that the main storyline is incredibly short (which is understandable, given the fact that the game is still in Early Access). Despite this, there are still dozens of side-quests to occupy your time, as well as multi-player combat in The Pit.Just like Battleblock Theatre and Castles Crashers, you can play the majority of the game with another player, in Co-Op Mode. Unlike BT and CC, you can only play multiplayer Co-Op with ONE other player (which is understandable, it would be rather difficult to balance a four-player Co-Op combat system, unless every player was restricted to 3 fighters instead of the usual 6.) I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy turn-based combat and comedy similar to Battleblock Theatre and Castle Crashers.  "

								Still in early access, but quite a fair price as these things go, especially from a dev with a good rep.The game may or may not be close to the finished article, I don't know, but there are a few obvious gaps in gamplay styles. I'm not sure what their plans are, but i hope they don't mess it up by trying to be too clever or add nonsense.Basically, leave the city, capture monsters/heroes, use them in battle. There are no paid perks and after a short time of yomping around the map I'd picked up a few characters to play with. I'm not sure the balancing is quite right, and the leaderboard is very basic and does nothing to encourage participation.But the real strength of Pit People is in the actual battle gameplay, which is very straightforward and easy to get to grips with. I'm not sure if the game is designed for tablets too, but it has that vibe. You command your troop movements, but they decide what to do when they get there. Sometimes that's a joy, other times a pain.I liked the game, and I have definately had a great time with it and got my money's worth. But I will wait now for the launch version and take it up again then.In the meantime I'd have no hesitation in recommending this game to anyone who likes turn based strategy. It isn't Advance Wars, but it's still pretty good.			"

								A friend and I recently purchased the game for eachover as we are both big Behometh fans. We were not dissapointed. After playing it for almost 6 hours straight these are my impressions:The level of customisable aspects for characters seems equally as vast as in previous titles.There is also a plethora of completely different characters, with even the weirder characters seeming to fit well into the world that they have made (e.g the cupcake that heals others by flinging little bits of themselves at allies)The main story that is currently in the games has very funny and well made cutscences and dialogue if a little short (But that is to be expected with an early access game and is more than made up for with things like the Pit or Insane Difficulty Mode)Their appears to be a wide number of sidequests and random things to do.My only complaint is the weight system for equipping weapons and armor makes choosing some of the cooler weapons annoying as it involves having to reshuffle the rest of the equipment.Definitely worth the purchase and I look forward to further content being added!

								Just to be clear, I absolutely love the game. It is the most fun I've had with any game in the past year, and I am definitely looking forward to the full release.That being said, the one issue I do have is the zoomed-in nature of the combat screen. I find it to be incredibly bothersome, and it makes moving throughout the map a real nuisance, especially when I have characters spread across the combat map. If there is a feature that allows for that focus to be removed and I'm just being stupid I apologize, but if there isn't I would highly recommened adding that into the full-featured game. The zoom makes sense for console (which I'm sure is what this game is intended for), but on a non-console device it just feels like I have tunnel vision. I'm sure a lot of PC people would appreciate making this change.Other than that, thanks Behemoth, this is the game I've been looking for.			"

								My playtime in this so far has felt like I experienced a twisted hybrid of Fire Emblem meets Adventure Time, and I'm having a blast with the hours I've put into it at the time of writing this.Pit People sports a pretty wacky lineup of playable characters, music and art style which I feel have really tied in well in its current released state, of course if you aren't a fan of that certain style or Turn-Based Combat than this one might completely go over your head with little notice.As of writing this the game comes with a reasonable roster of characters, bunch of unlocks - purely cosmetic and some that add different elements, solo/co-cop/pvp, a fairly large world to explore which I think cycles through a few variations, heaps of side quests and a main story line which isn't complete yet as of right now, I think i spent about half an hour/an hour to complete whats available of it, the story line that is.All-in-all if you're a fan of Turn-Based Combat I think you should definitely give this one a try, even if you aren't and have the time, fire up a video on the interwebs and have a see if this might tickle your fancy. I feel like it's a pretty solid title, especially for an Early Access, probably the best $15 I spent in quite some time. Oh and the narration is awesome too, if only I had it for my daily life routine.			"

 Wonderful Game It has a lot of character and it looks as though a great deal of thought was put into every aspect of it. Even the beastiary leaves you with a smirk after seing the illustrations.I will say though that the game feels built more for controllers. M+kb navigation of menues can be irritating at times. Given its current state I still can boast that it is more than worth the 15 USD price tag and honestly in hindsight I would have paid twice that. It already has over 1000 items and 100 quests leaving so much to be discovered beneath the surface. The one main drawback is the fact is only has a few story missions  currently .  Items Currently items of the same type act uniformly aside from elemental damage and resistance. There are a couple items that have interesting effects like slow and knockback but generally you are choosing between lightwight with high damage/movement/dodge or heavy that are more survivable. The non human characters have less customization but I have yet to see an item that I felt was not thoughtfully made and memorable.  Quests The quests are absolutely bonkers. There are some delivery missions and find this missions but even something you would intitially dismiss in other games turns out to be comedic. For instance  in one side quest you find a lizard and are tasked with taking it to its owner. The owner immediatly says he is going to eat it when you find him. You find out the lizard is sentient and blows up his owner telepathically.   Characters  All of the characters names are procedurally generated with a huge pool to choose from. There are a decent amount of types of enemies and even the worst of them is still viable with the right team. There is some balanceing that needs to be done still. One of the ways they balance currently is by making larger units take up more space on your roster. For example you have 6 slots after unlocking the final ones with in game currency. These can be filled in the following ways.Huge Unit = 3 slotsLarge Unit = 2 slotsRegular Unit = 1 slotsPair of Small Units = 1 slotSome units can spawn up to 6 spawn units during each fight.In this way a 2v2 arena fight could theoretically have 8 entities on the field or 84.  8 massive troll moms without thier spawn/ 12 gorgons and up to 72 spawn  Difficulty  Overall the game is not incredibly difficult after learning the basics but with the inclusion of Insane mode and elite enemies you will be pulling your hair out. Conclusion  Remembering that this is an early access game and everything is subject to change, I give it a perfect 5/7 stars.  Look forward to seeing you in the PIT.   "

								From what I have seen and experienced from the early access of this game, i must say it has a lot of potential. The Behemoth keeps its amusing sense of humour which I and many of you have enjoyed from its previous games, but introduces it to a turned based style RPG mechanics. I am quite glad they (The Behemoth) always use a different stlye of mechanics each game they produce. Also, I do not know if this is just me, but I really like artwork and design these charcters have. The overall way The Behemoth's artwork for their games are really nice to look at, kind of how some cartoons look so simplistic and weird, yet they are like a nice and sweet taste to the eyes. One thing that I do need to mention is that I wish there was a way to either skip or fast forward when your enemies are taking their turn. That is more of a pet peeve then a negativity and it really does not take away from the over arching experience of the game. So, in the end I highly suggest you check this out even though it it still in early access and I give it a solid 8.9/10. Can't wait to see what The Behemoth has in store for this game.			"

								First up i don't enjoy turn based combat.. usually.. But this game is absolutely amazing. Pro's: This game is hilariousDefinitely good for playing through solo or with a friendIt has the amazing sense of humour expected from BehemothDid i mention you will laugh lots?Cons: At time of writing only 1 story mission, but what appears to be hundreds of side missions so thats a positive.You definitely gave away your blueberries			"

								It's a really awesome game, with even more potential awesomeness.There isn't much story implemented yet but there is a big open world full of people who need help and all sorts of crazy creatures that you can recruit(kidnap, whatever you wanna call it i guess)for your epic quest to save the world from its current state of absolute havoc!Although I wouldn't quite say it's worth the 15€ just yet, I'm certain that it will be when it's complete.

								Just to be clear, I absolutely love the game. It is the most fun I've had with any game in the past year, and I am definitely looking forward to the full release.That being said, the one issue I do have is the zoomed-in nature of the combat screen. I find it to be incredibly bothersome, and it makes moving throughout the map a real nuisance, especially when I have characters spread across the combat map. If there is a feature that allows for that focus to be removed and I'm just being stupid I apologize, but if there isn't I would highly recommened adding that into the full-featured game. The zoom makes sense for console (which I'm sure is what this game is intended for), but on a non-console device it just feels like I have tunnel vision. I'm sure a lot of PC people would appreciate making this change.Other than that, thanks Behemoth, this is the game I've been looking for.			"

Early Access Review
								From what I have seen and experienced from the early access of this game, i must say it has a lot of potential. The Behemoth keeps its amusing sense of humour which I and many of you have enjoyed from its previous games, but introduces it to a turned based style RPG mechanics. I am quite glad they (The Behemoth) always use a different stlye of mechanics each game they produce. Also, I do not know if this is just me, but I really like artwork and design these charcters have. The overall way The Behemoth's artwork for their games are really nice to look at, kind of how some cartoons look so simplistic and weird, yet they are like a nice and sweet taste to the eyes. One thing that I do need to mention is that I wish there was a way to either skip or fast forward when your enemies are taking their turn. That is more of a pet peeve then a negativity and it really does not take away from the over arching experience of the game. So, in the end I highly suggest you check this out even though it it still in early access and I give it a solid 8.9/10. Can't wait to see what The Behemoth has in store for this game.			"

								I mean, its a behemoth game. You really dont need any more reasons than that to buy this game. The humor, is top notch, and so are the pop culture refernces (such as the shield ""hold the door"" which literally is a door, a refernce to GoT. or the umbrella, which also is a shield, named ""will it work""?, that being a refernce to the umbrella used by the kingsmen, in the movie kingsmen). The music is fantastic. The narriation... if youve played for battleblock theater, you know what to expect.The gameplay? Well, its, sort of like... If Castel crasher and the banner saga would have a baby. But then the narrorator from battleblock theater kidnapped that child. and kept it in a cellar, and all it heard, was his voice. Wow, that went wierd fast.Its a great game. Even if you dont like the gameplay that much, its almost enough to keep playing just for the music and the writing.			"

								Pit People is the newest nugget of raw charm from our friends at The Behemoth. It plays like a sort of manager-slash-isometric strategy game, with various units dressed in silly attire. The game doesn't by any means feel ""Complete"" but it's still in early access, so the amount of story that's out can be forgiven. However, I do have a few gripes, such as levelling up, aside from filling your health bar at a critical moment, feels inconsequential. However, such a gripe can be overlooked for me. Given Pit People's current price I will cautiously reccomend it, you'll love this game if you come to Behemoth for the charm and cartoony gore, however if you're looking for a strategy game, maybe look at a video first, instead of my poorly-written review.

								I've never really liked this type of game. The ones with the tiles and stuff. But this is phenomonal. Like the other Behemoth games, this blew me away. Would recomend to at least try it out, and if you don't like it, refund it.			"

								this game is a breath of fresh air  as most behomoth games are beat em ups (there still great non the less) but pit people is such  a well thought out very funny and addicting game the charecters can be customized with headgear and you can tell that with the headgear they put SO much thought and care into it with nods to Gean wilder which i loved and now i have a pixy that is also condescending wonka and a very strange spider creature with a DAT BOI frog mask in fact i love the meme mask so much i made  a team alll with meme helmets and it makes me so happy. more about the gameplay its simple with very abstract concepts gentally placed in so of course turn based games have been in many games but its what behemoth throws in that somewhat makes it own genre as where else can you a ghost with a babys face shoot purple stuff out of its a i quoute from the game its self ""face flaps"". the multiplayer however is rather sad i spent more time than i should to find a game and that angers me because multiplayer when you do play it IS SO MUCH FUN but im certain it will be so much better as the developers update the game. another fun thing to do with your coop buddy or just a random guy/gal you found online is just the story and side missons that i found my self doing over and over and over with my coop buddy its non stop very dark but funny humor all the way throught and i would highly recomend that you get this game and heres the great part its only in alpha so theres so much more to come and i cant wait to see where this game will take me			"

								My playtime in this so far has felt like I experienced a twisted hybrid of Fire Emblem meets Adventure Time, and I'm having a blast with the hours I've put into it at the time of writing this.Pit People sports a pretty wacky lineup of playable characters, music and art style which I feel have really tied in well in its current released state, of course if you aren't a fan of that certain style or Turn-Based Combat than this one might completely go over your head with little notice.As of writing this the game comes with a reasonable roster of characters, bunch of unlocks - purely cosmetic and some that add different elements, solo/co-cop/pvp, a fairly large world to explore which I think cycles through a few variations, heaps of side quests and a main story line which isn't complete yet as of right now, I think i spent about half an hour/an hour to complete whats available of it, the story line that is.All-in-all if you're a fan of Turn-Based Combat I think you should definitely give this one a try, even if you aren't and have the time, fire up a video on the interwebs and have a see if this might tickle your fancy. I feel like it's a pretty solid title, especially for an Early Access, probably the best $15 I spent in quite some time. Oh and the narration is awesome too, if only I had it for my daily life routine.			"

								Ever since I heard of Pit People being released I was hyped considering it was a Behemoth game.It didn't disappoint.I don't have much time in the game right now but for the 2 hours that I've played it it's absolutely amazing. The soundtrack is unique and zany (but still amazing), Stamper returning as a voice actor is great because it adds the humor that the game needs, and the visuals are absolutely stunning - never have I loved seeing Behemoth's art style like in Pit People. The game looks promising as something I can put many hours in and not get bored, as the adventure aspect of it seems to be pretty long.Great game, I didn't expect anything less from Behemoth.			"

								Written review below, I also made a video here:  Pit People Co-Op ReviewHIghly recommend ths game! Got into the PC Beta and was happy to see that all the progress we had there was moved onwards to the early access. As The Behemoth mentioned, the early access period is only because they realized the game was in a fun playable state. It feels extremely polished from a gameplay standpoint and only really a few gripes I could notice. In co-op, if playing with controller, the only to even begin playing is to hit the F2 button which is a little unintuitive, especially if you're away from the keyboard. Further, the camera is shared between players so it's a little hard to navigate through a large map if you end up on both sides. Outside of this though, the game is hilariously funny and well made. Really awesome and well made so far with plenty of co-op quests to really have fun with. Nice to have local co-op, haven't tried single player yet but I'm betting it will be super fun as well.			"

								So, this is one of the first reviews I've written, so if you disagree with what I say that's fine!To start off with I will just list some of the basic pros and cons-ProsBy The BehemothNo microtransactionsf2p, f2w.A vast variety of customizations, from characters to weapons to... to... HATS!!!Easy to learn, easy to master (but hard to battle other people who have mastered the game 20/10)Very addictive and fun.~ConsPaid (although this isn't very much an issue, most games are paid and it is quite cheap compared to other games which are lesser of Pit People... im talking to you, Overwatch)There is a bit of grinding (not too much though)It is in early access still, so there will be some unwelcome glitches and, unfortunately, exploits (although i have not heard of any exploits)It is addictive (yes this can be a bad thing)Now to describe what the game is like!The game itself is very simple, a team crafting, (slightly) strategized turn-based 2d game. The graphics are top-notch (3D isn't necessary for every game that exists). You can have at maximum 6 fighters in your team, although you may find that you have to have less, as some characters take up more than 1 slot due to sheer awesomeness. There is a wide variety of different species that you can collect, and lots of items to customize them with. If there is something you dont want, ring up a friend in the oversized phonebox to the far left of the city, and you can easily swap items instantly. You can hold up to 500 recruits in this game. Also, some of the species would be the demi-clops, rainbow unicorn and pixie.Now to the actual game mechanics!As you are in a battle, you take it in turns to move your team to your desired positons. But, beware, all species have weaknesses. While crafting your team, you can see their health, move points, defense, dodge chance, heal, special abilities and defenses (like freeze resistance). All characters have up to 5 move points. Characters can become the hero to have stat boosts, like health, damage, and usually move points. Now, back to fighting itself! In a battle, each tile is a hexagon. Each hexagon you move costs 1 move point. Some hexagons are different, and damage your team or cost 2 move points, or just can't be moved onto. Some flying creatures, like the pixie, can fly over gaps and water no problem (water is what costs 2 move points). You can have 2 main types of attackers - melee and ranged. But, if you choose so, you can have a troop with melee and range! But the range will not be very powerful, or, if you are a mortar or ranger, the melee will not be very powerful. If your troops can target multiple enemies, they decide which they will attack. This means you really need to make sure you move your character to the exact spot you want them to be, so that you attack the enemy you need to be dead.If you are lazy, or not exactly the best at the game, or have a team that is too big to control (some characters come with 2 people in only 1 space, so the max amount of characters you can have is 12) you can turn on the Auto Battler! This will move your characters instantly, although it may not always be very reliable. Only use it if you know that it will work well with your team.That's all for now...     -ProNub			"

								So far this game is truly an amazing piece of gaming software. I enjoyed every second of it and I am excited of whats to come storywise. Will he get his son back? Or is it going to be a crude joke, with behemoth anything is possible. I quite enjoyed exploring the outside world and recruiting interesting characters. Im still unsure if its possible to get Medusa or the big trolls as characters since they keep reproducing, hindering you to capture them.The one thing I am kind of sad about is that you cannot change most of the characters base costumes. Humans, cyclops etc all have a white shirt on, I hope this will be changed in the future. I WOULD like to change my cyclops base color to purple, so I can have a ""Dad"" unit.All in all it is a lot of fun!			"

								Ah yes, Pit People, my new favorite! Even on its unfinished state.THE GAMEThe game is a turn-based RPG strategy with the witty humor and a beautiful cartoonish art style that made me fell in love with The Behemoth's games. Its a simple, yet clear take to Turn-Based Strategies, a genre that I was completely unfamilliar of. You can explore the world to kidnap recruit other fighters not only because of their stats, but their names too, find more gold MONEYYYYYY and loot, and undertake a LOT of other sidequests other than story mode.(more on that later) The game also has a multikill indicator and its the most satisfying thing ive ever heard.THE STORYAlthough short, it was hilarious! And honestly the very antagonistic narrator (who's VA also voiced the narrator from BBT) that is also a giant space bear is slowly becoming my new favorite bad guy and might even kick Bill Cipher from the TV show Gravity Falls (which is kinda hard tbh) from the ""Best Villan"" pedastal of my heart. The first snippet of the story already features fourth wall-beraking antics, and a really meta narrator that proclamed himself God of this post-apocalyptic hex-patterned earth. Plus the fully animated cutscenes are really cool!MUSICThe. Soundtrack. Is. Gud. Pls. Listen. 11/10THINGS I WAS slightly BOTHERED ATSuggestions>It was kinda hard to know what fighter you are currently selecting right now even with my 23-inch monitor on my PC well then, its been updated to a yellow outline for the selected fighter! It's now eaiser to see what fighter are you currently selecting right now.>the lack of a mac version aaaaaaaa (im aware that a mac verison would come soon tho)>more compatibility with touch screened laptops, so I was able to try the game in a laptop with a touch screen although with a option to include a end turn button on screen (and shaking btw) was a bit helpful, I personally think that it needs a bit more essential controls like cancel placement and player switch for tablet PCs (Surface Pro, Wacom Mobile Studio Pro, and the likes) and 2-n-1 convertables (Lenovo Yoga)			"

								OMG where do I start?  Okay first of all if you are a fan of turn based strategy and must play all of them stop reading this and buy the game now.  If you are new to the genre but are interested in tactical games I can truly recommend this for you.  If you are seasoned turn based strategy fan this is also for you.  For starters I want to say that the combat is very well streamlined.  In most TBS games you move your character, choose a direction and then choose a type of attack.  If you are a healer you choose your character,  move him into position, choose your spell and finally heal who you want to heal.  In Pit Poeple this ihs simplified.  The healer character will simply heal whoever it can within it's range while dealing damage to itself.  This may seem oversimplified but it tends to work and speed up the healing process. Combat is also streamlined and faced paced.  You simple move your character into postion and he will choose to attack whomever he wants.  It sounds dumb but it works well in the game.  There area good amount of weapons, armor and charactrer classes to keep you guys.In terms of audio the music is just simply fantastic,  You can tell they had alot of fun coming up with great lively muslc that will tickle your funny bone.  Sounds effects and the narration is through the roof.  I did find some of the jokes totally lame but In the spirit of the game it was perfect.To sum it up,  I'm an avid TBS gamer and this was a complete and total surprise!+Excellent animation and graphics+Psuedo open world gameplay+Excellent memorable soundtrack and voice acting+Simplified TBS controls that are streamlined and keeps it fast paced-Main quest super short-still in early accessOnce this game is complete I can recommend it to anyone who has ever liked a TBS tacitcal game.

								Great game, tons of ways to personalize your team (appearance and composition), as always The behemoth never fails to make a fun game. Amazing competitive play that lets you try and go againts many types of enemy comps also co-op it´s really fun and would definitely recomend getting a friend to play with.A little bit on the down side, game it´s still on an early stage and while PVP/co-op it´s practically fully implemented the current campaign is very short, however theres A LOT of mini quests to play and they are fairly challenging and fun, theres a good amount of units to costumize your team and strategy but would love to see more units get added in the future.See you guys in the pit!

								I'm sorry to say, but, this is the BEST game i have ever played. It's a spin off of your common ""Strategy"" Game. But this, this is just a normal game for fun, with the VIBE of it. It's unique and fresh, and a pleasure to play. The soundtrack, Great!! It's simple, but, not TOO simple. It doesn't get annoying from Just 5 minutes. the sound effects are 10/10. great characters, and funny thrown in jokes, too. If you have $15 lying around, do yourself a favor. Buy this game. I think this is the best $14.99 i have ever spent. Whatever you're doing, Behemoth. Keep going.			"

								I'll start this off with saying that I'm normally not into games like Pit People; It's not generally a type of game I look to play. However, Pit People is definitely an exeption! So after ""beating"" the early access version, here are my Pro's and Con's:Pros:+ Great, colorful artstyle.+ Exceptional writing and voice acting.+ Very funny dialog and cutscenes.+ Fast-paced gameplay.+ Working online arena mode.+ Expansive world map.+ Large amount of character upgrades (armor, weapons, etc).Cons: - The game is in early access, so as of now it's lacking in terms of content.- While the game stays interesting the entire way though, if you're not open-minded or a fan of this genre, I don't think you'll enjoy it.Notes:* Lack of explaination / tutorial in worldmap and town area. I'm assuming this is due to early access.* After finishing the early access story, it seems the only things to do are grind for gear and play arena. ---While Pit People is in early access, I could definitely see myself paying full price for it if I had found it post full release. It's a cute, well-written, adventure that makes me very impatient for the full release.If you're unsure about buying this, I would very much say to do so if you're okay with an incomplete story as of now. If you're not okay with that, I'd say to wait untill full release and pick it up then.When this game is fully released, I'll make sure to write an updated review on my Medium[medium.com] or  Blog.[kyotoshift.com] "

								So far, so good. A lot of people seem to say this game bores them , but for some reason I don't find it that boring, even when I watch other people. I really enjoy the customization options. While the interface is confusing at first I got used to it. I do have some complaints like  how the mercenaries cost 7000 coins eventhough you can just catch some in the overworld(Although I do have, like, 9000 coins, but still). Another complaint I have is that once you leave the secret area, you can't go back which is frustrating because I accidentally left it without getting my prize (I know it was my fault, but I was confused and I didn't know what was happening). Here are the bugs I've encountered so far(I know there's a bug report option, but I think I have to be logged in to their site to report it. Either that or I'm really dumb lol): Invisible objects and entitys in the overworld and in battle, killing or an enemy killing an ivisible entity crashes the game, game crashes whenever I complete the first Moltenasia quest. But this is still early access so obviously they're going to fix these bugs. Other than the bugs the game is great! (There's also lots of stale/dead memes in the game. This isn't really a complaint I'd just thought let people know lol)EDIT: I've found out that you can redo the secret area switches so that's nice!EDIT 2: The newest update fixed the invisible bug!

								Written review below, I also made a video here:  Pit People Co-Op ReviewHIghly recommend ths game! Got into the PC Beta and was happy to see that all the progress we had there was moved onwards to the early access. As The Behemoth mentioned, the early access period is only because they realized the game was in a fun playable state. It feels extremely polished from a gameplay standpoint and only really a few gripes I could notice. In co-op, if playing with controller, the only to even begin playing is to hit the F2 button which is a little unintuitive, especially if you're away from the keyboard. Further, the camera is shared between players so it's a little hard to navigate through a large map if you end up on both sides. Outside of this though, the game is hilariously funny and well made. Really awesome and well made so far with plenty of co-op quests to really have fun with. Nice to have local co-op, haven't tried single player yet but I'm betting it will be super fun as well.			"

								oh   my   lordI had an extra $20 after buying Witcher 3 so I browsed the featured section of the store looking for a good title and came across Pit People. I bought and installed the game and I didn't put it down until I finished the main story. I mostly play first person shooters like CS and I'm not really into strategy games so I came into this game thinking ""I'll probably enjoy it, it's  made byBehemoth after all."" and came out thinking ""That was amazing""!The one problem I have with this game is that the main story is way too short, seeing as it's an early access game. I hope Behemoth keeps working on this wonderful game and finishes the main story.			"

If your a fan of strategy games or you like The Behemoths games i would recomend it. Cons are the coop in myopinion is a little lack luster me and a friend sat down for a few hours and tried to play but the coop wasnt nearly as good as the rest of the behemoths games in terms of coop.

Early Access Review
								I'm not one for many turn-based combat games. Xcom and Civ are my only exceptions honestly, and I'm not very good at either of them. I do enjoy them nonethless. Pit People was hanging on the edge for me; I love Behemoth and their games and humour, but the whole turn-taking thing was a bit of a step away from their usual slash-fest style. However, I had some money and time to spare so I thought I'd give their new game a real chance, and man, am I thankful I did. Pit People is a wonder (even in early access) to play. The usual from Behemoth can be expected: a crazy and cartoonish art style, over-the-top humour and stupidity, but the new direction this game takes is suprisingly well done and very simple yet fun to play. It doesn't require a whole lot of planning and thought like other turn-based games do. Simply move your characters to where you want them to go and they will attack who they think is the best, provided that they can. You can't target specific enemies, which I thought was awful at first, until I realised that all-in-all, it works very well. Depending on your weapon depends on how you attack. For example, melee weapons such as swords will be just one tile away for an attack to occur, but if a character say throws axes, you need to position them two tiles away instead so they can throw the axes towards an enemy. If they can target multiple enemies at once, they may split the damage if the AI deems it necessary to, or just attack one enemy for more damage. I like this simple formula that avoids the player themselves setting up positioning as well as attacks, and it's very easy once you get the hang of it. The combat isn't the most in-depth ever seen in a turn-based game, but in my opinion, it succeeds because of this. It creates a fast-paced action game where good positioning will win you the game, sort of like chess in a way. The other section is a pokemon styled run-around a map and find things game. You can seek out enemies that then take you into a more focused battle, and the best part is the quests, which allow for a lot of freedom to do what you want to do instead of sectioned levels. The story is crazy just like all of Behemoth's games, and I won't spoil it (even though there is only a certain amount of these story quests available currently) but there's a giant teddy bear that has crashed into the Earth. The narrator as always is ridiculous and funny. Customisation is plentiful and once again, outrageous. The hub town holds a market place for new fighters and weapons, an arena named the pit sort of like a colosseum as well as a home for you to mess with your characters and team. Overall, awesome game and a real treat to play. Simple, elegant, funny and over-the-top turn-based action with what seems to be a mind-boggling but intriguing story that never lets up on quick remarks, twists and plot. Support this game and Behemoth! They deserve it :D			"

								As a foreword this review was posted on the 6/2/17 and is with regards to the early access version of the game.Pit people is a delightful little strategy game by The Behemoth with narration by Will Stamper. In other words if you enjoyed the zany comedy of Battleblock Theatre, Castle Crashers or Alien Hominid then you will probably enjoy the style of humour found here. Whether it is the main 'story', multipart quests or the shorter sidequests the dialogue is constistently funny without getting too repetitive.The gameplay is a simplistic turn based combat system that takes place over a hexagonal grid. You assemble a team via collecting new units by defeating enemy armies and then customising them with various collectible items, mostly cosmetics but with some offering varied stats or attack styles. While the player's control over their units is limited (you pick where they move but not who they attack) your ability to customise the contents of your team adds a lot of depth to what you can do. Fans of games such as X-Com or Fire Emblem will likely enjoy what the game has to offer but it is also accessible enough for players new to the genre.Multiplayer operates smoothly with no real connection problems and offers both local and online co-op and versus. While some units may currently be considered suboptimal and others might be considered above average there is no feeling of there being a single perfect team composition in multiplayer, versus matches often featuring relatively varied teams.At present the main concern to be had with the game is that it is incomplete. Considering the low price I'd say even in it's unfinished state you will likely get your monies worth, especially as it seems bug free (in my experience at least) but if you are only planning to play the single player content you might want to wait for the full release. At present the storyline  consists of the tutorial content and a single mission, with numerous subquests and 4 quest chains also available. Hopefully the full release will expand upon this considerably, ideally with additional unit types being added as well.			"

								Pit People doesn't just look ""promising"" in it's current state, it's already simply an amazing game.It's a game that can be as simple or as in-depth as you want it to be and there's already tons of content to enjoy, all in The Behemoths signature style (little disclaimer here, the story is far from finished right now but there is A LOT to do already, ultimately, deciding on wether or not to get the game at the moment comes down to how you want to play it).The developers are engaged and responsive to community feedback in a way I haven't seen before, definitely Early Access done right.You can wait for the official game launch or get it in Early Access right now, either way you'll be getting more than your money's worth.

								Did you ever feel, like your life was incomplete? Did you regret, not being able to shoot your enemies with a bow made from roses, while wearing a bow tie and a top hat?In this case, Pit People might be your saviour. This colourful and humorous turn-based strategy-game is not only easily accessible for rookies, but offers an enjoyable experience for everyone with a taste for absurd humour. While it does offer you a Co-op-mode, it is equally as fun to play just by yourself. Quests and fights do not take a lot of time, allowing for a player to drop in or out, even if he has merely a few minutes time. That said, the customization-feature would let you spend hours, equipping your recruits with ridiculous outfits and weapons, if you so desire. Quests and storylines are filled with pop-cultural references and the soundtrack is certainly unique.A minor point of criticism is the lack of information concerning status/wapon effects. For example, you can tell by purple bubbles surrounding them, that a character has been poisoned. However, it does not tell you, how long they are afflicted by it and how much damage they will suffer from it, in an easy way. This kind of information should be presented to the player in an unmistakable way. The game itself is nonetheless absolutely worthy of your attention and I can give a hearty recommendation to buy it, without the shadow of a doubt.			"

								I adore this game so much and it may be one of my favorite games of all time. Not only is the story hilarious and strange but the game itself feels balanced and just so expansive. Though I would like to preface that right now at least there is not much to the story as this is still an early access game. This game simply feels like there was a lot of love and sweat put into it. Truly 10/10			"

Early Access Review
								I'm not one for many turn-based combat games. Xcom and Civ are my only exceptions honestly, and I'm not very good at either of them. I do enjoy them nonethless. Pit People was hanging on the edge for me; I love Behemoth and their games and humour, but the whole turn-taking thing was a bit of a step away from their usual slash-fest style. However, I had some money and time to spare so I thought I'd give their new game a real chance, and man, am I thankful I did. Pit People is a wonder (even in early access) to play. The usual from Behemoth can be expected: a crazy and cartoonish art style, over-the-top humour and stupidity, but the new direction this game takes is suprisingly well done and very simple yet fun to play. It doesn't require a whole lot of planning and thought like other turn-based games do. Simply move your characters to where you want them to go and they will attack who they think is the best, provided that they can. You can't target specific enemies, which I thought was awful at first, until I realised that all-in-all, it works very well. Depending on your weapon depends on how you attack. For example, melee weapons such as swords will be just one tile away for an attack to occur, but if a character say throws axes, you need to position them two tiles away instead so they can throw the axes towards an enemy. If they can target multiple enemies at once, they may split the damage if the AI deems it necessary to, or just attack one enemy for more damage. I like this simple formula that avoids the player themselves setting up positioning as well as attacks, and it's very easy once you get the hang of it. The combat isn't the most in-depth ever seen in a turn-based game, but in my opinion, it succeeds because of this. It creates a fast-paced action game where good positioning will win you the game, sort of like chess in a way. The other section is a pokemon styled run-around a map and find things game. You can seek out enemies that then take you into a more focused battle, and the best part is the quests, which allow for a lot of freedom to do what you want to do instead of sectioned levels. The story is crazy just like all of Behemoth's games, and I won't spoil it (even though there is only a certain amount of these story quests available currently) but there's a giant teddy bear that has crashed into the Earth. The narrator as always is ridiculous and funny. Customisation is plentiful and once again, outrageous. The hub town holds a market place for new fighters and weapons, an arena named the pit sort of like a colosseum as well as a home for you to mess with your characters and team. Overall, awesome game and a real treat to play. Simple, elegant, funny and over-the-top turn-based action with what seems to be a mind-boggling but intriguing story that never lets up on quick remarks, twists and plot. Support this game and Behemoth! They deserve it :D			"

Early Access Review
								As a foreword this review was posted on the 6/2/17 and is with regards to the early access version of the game.Pit people is a delightful little strategy game by The Behemoth with narration by Will Stamper. In other words if you enjoyed the zany comedy of Battleblock Theatre, Castle Crashers or Alien Hominid then you will probably enjoy the style of humour found here. Whether it is the main 'story', multipart quests or the shorter sidequests the dialogue is constistently funny without getting too repetitive.The gameplay is a simplistic turn based combat system that takes place over a hexagonal grid. You assemble a team via collecting new units by defeating enemy armies and then customising them with various collectible items, mostly cosmetics but with some offering varied stats or attack styles. While the player's control over their units is limited (you pick where they move but not who they attack) your ability to customise the contents of your team adds a lot of depth to what you can do. Fans of games such as X-Com or Fire Emblem will likely enjoy what the game has to offer but it is also accessible enough for players new to the genre.Multiplayer operates smoothly with no real connection problems and offers both local and online co-op and versus. While some units may currently be considered suboptimal and others might be considered above average there is no feeling of there being a single perfect team composition in multiplayer, versus matches often featuring relatively varied teams.At present the main concern to be had with the game is that it is incomplete. Considering the low price I'd say even in it's unfinished state you will likely get your monies worth, especially as it seems bug free (in my experience at least) but if you are only planning to play the single player content you might want to wait for the full release. At present the storyline  consists of the tutorial content and a single mission, with numerous subquests and 4 quest chains also available. Hopefully the full release will expand upon this considerably, ideally with additional unit types being added as well.			"

								Imagine playing a game of chess where you could make up the rules for your pieces.What makes the game interesting though, is that your enemy makes up their rules as well...Now imagine having an oddly deep bond with each and every one of your pieces that aren't so much pieces on a board anymore... but actual characters. Chosen, equipped, clothed, and trained by you since the day you found them wandering in the wilderness with their original pack of heathens. Finally, imagine watching all of your beautiful pieces you love and treasure so dearly getting murdered one of one thousand ways, one at a time, right before your very eyes.Now realize you cannot even begin to comrprehend what i'm talking about, unless you have played this game.One of a kind gem, just like the other games that the Behemoth backs, and I will probably play this game casually for the rest of my life.Great gameplay, a great experience, original content, and it's updated with new items and quests almost every month?Worth every single penny.

Some people may have complained about it's repetitiveness but they cannot see how each battle goes with a different story. The whole point of this game is basically strategy battles! but with humour! Aside from the story which they have not yet completed yet, there's so much side quests, easter eggs, puns, jokes, and memes as well. There's a lot of customization so your team is as unique as others. There's so much going on here. Better get it early before they raise the price!			"

								First off I want to say this game is still in Early Access , when I'm writing this review. This is a turn-based strategy made by the Behemoth. At first It didn't sound promising to me , but I decided to buy it. And I do not regret that. I enjoyed this game a lot because of the unique Behemoth art style and all the humor. But the game lacks a little bit in story content. The story quests can be finished in around 2-4 hours. I'm more into the story of the Behemoth games , so I stopped playing after that and a few side quests. Sure , there are a lot of side quests but I'm not really interested into those. That doesn't mean I don't like the game , it just means that there's a lack in story content but it's still fun to play. I've stopped playing it for now but I will continue to play when more Story quests are added. The music , environment , voices and everything else is top-notch. I give this game an 8/10 ,			"

								Pit people is a game made by Behemoth, and that's why it's good!That's it, go home.You're still here?Aaagh, fine.I'll keep things simple by explaining all things this game could be compared to.Because I'm lazy.Adventure Time: definitely. The game is set in a colorful, cartoonish fantasy world that has some elements of the modern world (and also takes place after the apocalypse). The main character is just a normal guy who suddenly becomes a hero and meets all kinds of crazy characters, fights monsters and hangs out with 3 friends: a princess, a sexy Spanish lady and his cyclops bro. The game also mixes random humor and serious moments like the show.XCOM: Eeeeeeh. Apparently every turn based RPG game is going to be compared to XCOM 2012 these days. I'm just going to say that this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There's no permadeath or saving the world from the alien invasion (not yet at least) but you can create your 6 member team from randomly generated characters, but honestly I would rather compare this game to Final Fantasy Tactics series and other games from the Turn Based Strategy RPG gentre.Pokemon: now that may sound weird, but let me explain. You can recruit all sorts of characters and creatures with different abilities to your team, but it works in a different way than you would expect. When you're fighting someone and see a character you want in your team, you need to leave that unit alone and kill everyone else, then you can make someone drop a cage on this unit and BAM: now it's yours. There's a ton of different units you can find, and also all of them have strenghts and weaknesses against others.Other Behemoth games: IMO it might be the best game they ever made. The gameplay is super cool, the humor is fantastic and the artstyle is really good as well.Now you might think two different things depending of what kind of person you are.1. ""Ham Man, I don't play turn based RPG's that much/I never played a turn based RPG in my life, will I enjoy this?""It's not as complicated as for example Final Fantasy Tactics on PS1, the rules are pretty simple and you should learn how to play quickly.2.""Ham Man, I played turn based RPG's all my life, will this game challenge my genius mind and allow me to destroy powerful enemies with flawless tactics?""I know that I said that the game is simple literally 30 seconds ago, but don't be alarmed. The game can offer a fair amount of challenge as well. There's Insane Mode that greatly increases the difficulty, Unfair Challenge that makes you fight 3 battles in one go (yes, there is Insane Unfair Challenge), you can also fight other players. There's a ton of different ways you can build your team and some characters have good synergy with others. Tactical planning and using the abilities of your heroes well is important in PVP and harder challenges.Well, I think that's it.The game is cool, buy it.Bye.			"

								Apart from a slightly annoying bug, which makes you unable to scroll down in order to select characters while in combat, and the occasional framedrop or two, Pit People was one of the more stable experiences to have with Early Access games. More than that, it’s one of the most polished Early Access titles one can get their hands on. It was genuinely fun and hilarious, always making it clear that the team had a unified vision to which they’ve stuck quite well. It goes without saying that I’m looking forward to see what the next updates will bring and, more importantly, to getting my hands on the full version of the game. In the meantime, though, I’ve a ghost wearing an afro to catch. Full Review[www.noobfeed.com].			"

								Behemoth never disappoints. A new refreshing game with great art and fun gameplay, Pit People is just like Behemoth's other classic games with the humor, voice acting, and ridiculous weapons and cosemetics to match. :) I usually don't get into strategy and turn based games, but Pit People makes those who aren't interested in that genre love it. Such a weird combination of genres comes together in Pit People, and it's great. There is so much to do in Pit People, and I can't wait to see what Behemoth has in store for the full release of this game. Since it is still in development, some things are not complete(like the story), but there is much to explore. They are very attentive to the community as many major improvements from Beta recommended from the community and I love that. Tutorial is much better now and so are the animations since beta. Current early access price of $15 is a good deal, considering how well developed and different this game is from other mainstream games. (After early access the price will go up to $20). Some cons to the game are the controls for mouse+keyboard. The game was designed for Xbox, and is best played on a controller. It's still ok though, but if you don't have a controller, you may find it annoying. There is also no world map, and the screen makes it hard to see sometimes while traveling. It is different and a cool idea, but can be frustrating.P.S there is a LOT of grinding(it is part RPG). If that's not your thing, then don't get this game.Thank you for another wonderful game, Behemoth <3			"

								Pit people is a game made by Behemoth, and that's why it's good!That's it, go home.You're still here?Aaagh, fine.I'll keep things simple by explaining all things this game could be compared to.Because I'm lazy.Adventure Time: definitely. The game is set in a colorful, cartoonish fantasy world that has some elements of the modern world (and also takes place after the apocalypse). The main character is just a normal guy who suddenly becomes a hero and meets all kinds of crazy characters, fights monsters and hangs out with 3 friends: a princess, a sexy Spanish lady and his cyclops bro. The game also mixes random humor and serious moments like the show.XCOM: Eeeeeeh. Apparently every turn based RPG game is going to be compared to XCOM 2012 these days. I'm just going to say that this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There's no permadeath or saving the world from the alien invasion (not yet at least) but you can create your 6 member team from randomly generated characters, but honestly I would rather compare this game to Final Fantasy Tactics series and other games from the Turn Based Strategy RPG gentre.Pokemon: now that may sound weird, but let me explain. You can recruit all sorts of characters and creatures with different abilities to your team, but it works in a different way than you would expect. When you're fighting someone and see a character you want in your team, you need to leave that unit alone and kill everyone else, then you can make someone drop a cage on this unit and BAM: now it's yours. There's a ton of different units you can find, and also all of them have strenghts and weaknesses against others.Other Behemoth games: IMO it might be the best game they ever made. The gameplay is super cool, the humor is fantastic and the artstyle is really good as well.Now you might think two different things depending of what kind of person you are.1. ""Ham Man, I don't play turn based RPG's that much/I never played a turn based RPG in my life, will I enjoy this?""It's not as complicated as for example Final Fantasy Tactics on PS1, the rules are pretty simple and you should learn how to play quickly.2.""Ham Man, I played turn based RPG's all my life, will this game challenge my genius mind and allow me to destroy powerful enemies with flawless tactics?""I know that I said that the game is simple literally 30 seconds ago, but don't be alarmed. The game can offer a fair amount of challenge as well. There's Insane Mode that greatly increases the difficulty, Unfair Challenge that makes you fight 3 battles in one go (yes, there is Insane Unfair Challenge), you can also fight other players. There's a ton of different ways you can build your team and some characters have good synergy with others. Tactical planning and using the abilities of your heroes well is important in PVP and harder challenges.Well, I think that's it.The game is cool, buy it.Bye.			"

								Apart from a slightly annoying bug, which makes you unable to scroll down in order to select characters while in combat, and the occasional framedrop or two, Pit People was one of the more stable experiences to have with Early Access games. More than that, it’s one of the most polished Early Access titles one can get their hands on. It was genuinely fun and hilarious, always making it clear that the team had a unified vision to which they’ve stuck quite well. It goes without saying that I’m looking forward to see what the next updates will bring and, more importantly, to getting my hands on the full version of the game. In the meantime, though, I’ve a ghost wearing an afro to catch. Full Review[www.noobfeed.com].			"

								Got the game on day one of its early access steam release for a friend and I. This is some of the most fun I've had in a long while from a -$20.00 game which is fun with a friend but also maintains its enjoyability in single player. If you enjoyed the humor of previous behemoth games you'll definitley love this with some fantastic voice acting from Will stamper (Hatty from battle block theater). This is a game thats clearly gone through careful development and is the most prepared Early access game I've ever played with the only thing ive been dissapointed with is the length of the story which is quite short at the moment (Devs have already said this isnt the complete story and there will be more!) this game easily gets an 8/10 for me and I hope to be there for the continued development of this game!

								I feel compelled to make a review for this phenominal title by none other than the Behemoth. I've loved their games ever since Alien Homonid. Pit People takes a new perspective on the strategic turn-by-turn action of Fire Emblem. The Behemoth shine with their comedic charm once again. The humor is perfect. The thought of a goliath sized space bear with star nipples plumiting into a planet turning everything into turn-by-turn world dictated by another evil space bear with star nipples is something only the Behemoth can think of. Now I saved the final part of my little spiel for one of the best gaming soundtracks EVER. Period. The animation is crisp, combat is spectacular, diverse species to build a team with, incredible soundtrack, hilarity every step of the way. 11/10.			"

								First of all, i have never heard of the behemoth. But, i have played games at newgrounds a long time ago and it was fun. I was looking at some indie rogue like games and suddenly i saw castle crashers a few weeks ago. Then, i saw that pit people will be releasing on 13th January. After watching a few gameplay videos, I bought the game on that day and knowing that it is release as early access. i have played turn based strategy like ff tactics and tactics ogre. This game definately attract my interest. For me, i really like the humor that resembles rick and morty. The animation that resembles adventure time and catchy soundtrack. The gameplay is quite simple and the difficulty level is okay. They also provide insane difficulty level. Loots are basically reskin of equipable item and only few provide different attributes such as elemental resistance or damage. It is understandable due to there are too many items. Maybe different stats for items will be implement by dev or not. I am okay with that.The game is still at early access stage. Some people are complainig about the short main story. But it is not a problem for me. Within 11 hours of playing this game, i did not touch the main story. I only played side quest, explore the map, catching units and played pvp. PVP is quite interesting because of the leaderboard motivates me to get a better position on it. It is understandable that finding people on online match is quite hard for sea server. But it is easy to find people in online coop for me.This is my opinion. I recommend this to people who like this kind of game. You could watch youtube for gameplay. If you only want to play single player, it is advised to wait for the full game to be released.			"

								For an early access game there's a surprising amount of content. Whether it's making a new team comp or finding some new quests out in the wild, or doing PvP in the pit, there is an endless stream of content to play through in this current state of the game. The humor is on point just as all Behemoth games are and the concept of the game is simple and well executed. I normally don't like recommending early access games but this is an exception.			"

								Even in this game's current Early Access status, I can easily recommend this to my friends, and to anyone who's played either Battleblock Theater or Castle Crashers. This game has all the charm and uniqueness as these past games, taking aspects of them both (i.e. The Narrator from Battleblock Theater, the stupid but well implimented poop jokes from Castle Crashers) and smashing them all together into a 4X turn based strategy RPG game that re-defines the genre entirely, continuing the saga Behemoth has left behind in their unique twists on the genres of games.I don't know how to make a long enough or good enough review to give this game the justice it deserves. It's fantastic, and it could easily be released right now but the fact that the devs want people to bug test it, while also adding new things to the game while it's in early access is amazing.Behemoth and Blizzard are definitely my favorite developers (Blizzard because they don't do DLC's for Overwatch, and Behemoth for their creative games and wonderful humor.)Thanks a lot guys, and keep up the good work!

								At first the game seems of, the combat is wierd, the world seems limited (but the comedy is on point). But once you settle into it becomes really fun. The combat becomes strategic (especially if you play on insane mode), its not that strategic that you need to take ages to cotemplate strategies each turn, it just forces you to be smart with every move (perfect for PvP). The world expands into a difficult and large open world, jam packed with content (very strange content). After getting through a weak start the game becomes amazing.My only dissapointment are the choices of weapons and armour, I was expecting a more RPG type weapon system how every individual item has their own stats, but the game only has set 5 weapons with different stats for each type of weapon (e.g. sheild, sword, ranged). However, this is redeemed by the wide array of characters that you can have in your party. This can vary your strategies depending on the set of character you captured. I'm honetly suprised how this game isn't on the ""top seller"" or ""popular new releases"" section on steam. It might be early access but I havent come across any bugs.I think this game is a 9/10, would be 10/10 if the beggining was more engaging.			"

								I bought this game the second it released. So far, it's amazing and it's only gonna get better as it approaches release. While it may be easy to write this off as a casual turn based strategy, the army customization is beyond every other turn based strategy I've seen. With tons of variety in units, items, and equipment, you will always be trying to go out and farm just one more hero/item to add to your dream roster.			"

								Pure excellence as is the usual with The Behemoth. The animation is wonderful, the art style awesome, the humor hilarious and off the wall, the gameplay is super solid, the story is so far, priceless. I love the narrator. The game does kind of fail to explain its self very well, luckily I'm familiar with turn based, grid based, rpg games. The fact that it IS LOCAL CO-OP, makes it awesome for me and the wife.  To be to the point, thus far it's a 8/10 easy. It could very well be as good as castle crashers in a lot of ways. We could have an award winner here.PROS-Great Behemoth style game just like Castle Crasher and Battle Block Theater.-Wonderful humor/art style-Solid turn based RPG gameplay, great animations-Local Co-Op (as well as online, so far though it seems to be invite co-op only)-Online Competitive play, if you're into that sorta... thing...-Absolutely mind blowing soundtrackCONS-The tutorial is rather haphazard. While I slid right into playing, I didn't feel like how the game worked was very well explained, it just felt familiar enough to pick up and play.-The quest system didn't seem to be explained at all, I didn't even realize I had ""quests"" outside of what the story narrative covered as the general 'story' quest. I didn't realize there were quests in a sort of quest log format that could be turned in for rewards until I saw my first quest complete pop up. - Your ""Home base"" i.e the town you return to during your adventures to rest and upgrade party members, gets randomly moved about every 3 returns to it or so. It is only ever moved when you are in it, so you don't have to worry about it moving while you're gone, but you can't really make any exploration progress this way because you're continously being moved to new places you don't know.-You have a limit to the amount of loot you can carry, you must return to town to deposit your booty and then head back out. -Trading is not explained in co-op, at least not in local. When you return home in co-op you'll get a screen of loot between you and your partner, the left and right represent players 1 and 2 respectively. From the start nothing is 'selected', anything selected is automatically given to the other player. I say given, instead of trade, because if the other player doesn't select anything, they still get everything you clicked anyway for free. This isn't a problem, especially in co-op where maybe someone got something they don't need but the other does. The point is, what this screen even meant let alone how it worked, was not explained at all. -So far no luck match making. I'm not saying it doesn't work, I just am saying I've tried to find someone to do the Pit Co-Op with and gotten nothing three times over two days.			"

								It's like a cross between earthbound and south park canada without the vulgarity. One of the few games I've laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off while losing. There is almost no story at this point, but the multiplayer, sidequests, and random map stuff will still keep you busy, for the price I'd say its worth it in its current state.On the down side, mouse and keyboard controls are not intuitive, the game is definately prioritizing consoles with its design, it's not terrible but it does need mentioned.Edit: The devs have assured the community that the controls were an attempt to streamline gameplay, and the game is fast paced which is difficult to accomplish with a turn based game. They have also said that making them less clunky is something they are working on.			"

								A really good turn based strategy game. I don't usually care for TBS games so I was kinda iffy on it even though it's by Behemoth. After watching some gameplay I finally talked myself into buying it and I was not disappointed. All the funny jokes and gags are there that you would expect from a Behemoth game.Pros- Really funny- Great Art Style- You get to collect and capture multiple enemies to use on your team- Story is amazing (What there is of it anyway)- Multiplayer is really fun- They have a auto battler installed if you aren't good at TBS games and just want to watch your team fightCons- Story isn't complete- Some of the menus are a bit buggy- nothing else really the game is Really Really good so far.

								Excellent game by Excellent DevsGame may be in early access, but Devs are active in their communities, and keep everyone up to date with the latest plans and info. Another oddity of Early access is the game runs with practically Zero issues, I myself have never had any. The game is very polished and depending on how complete you want to be, there are many many hours of gameplay. It took me over 30 hour to do all the side quest currently in game, and at over 150 hours I’m still collecting things.The only draw back of this early access is the main storyline is not finished. In place is a solid game, with tons of side quests, over 1000 collectables, many different units, PVE, and PVP Arena, and a ton more features on the way. Even if your hesitant of Early access, if this games gameplay is your type of game, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing it before release,			"

All the funny jokes and gags are there that you would expect from a Behemoth game.Pros- Really funny- Great Art Style- You get to collect and capture multiple enemies to use on your team- Story is amazing (What there is of it anyway)- Multiplayer is really fun- They have a auto battler installed if you aren't good at TBS games and just want to watch your team fightCons- Story isn't complete- Some of the menus are a bit buggy- nothing else really the game is Really Really good so far.

								Seriously, is there anything ""Behemoth"" CAN'T do? Personally, i'd equate them to the ""Family Guy"" of the game world. Everybody loves what they do, but the highbrow snob in them denies that you enjoy it.Anyways, if you like turn based tactic games, get it...Hell, even if you hate em, get it. I know somebody who hates this genre and he thinks it's awesome.Lastly, if i post an uneducated review of a game raving about it, you know it's godamn awesome.			"

								I'm no RTS fan normally, but I am a fan the The Behemoth game studio. Castle Crasher is a fond memory of my Xbox days of playing it with friends. Pit People so far has delivered on the comedic stylings and simplistic controls that made its predecessors so great. The randmness of who your units target when surrounded is a little annoying, but with good positioning it becomes a simple task to move forward in this game even if your characters may not be fully leveled. Again, I'm not an RTS buff, but the Behemoth is giving me a chance to enjoy the genre of game.			"

								I think Pit people is one of the best behemoth games made (even tho theres only 4 behemoth games). Its kinda like ""the behemoth game that only requires ONE hand to play"" so for all you people who have broken hands, or just straight-up lazy, this is the behemoth game for you. I LOVED this game and I think they put a really good price on it. But theres one thing I didnt like, in battleblock theature the narror ator was so hyper and funny (especially forthe secret song, wich sounded more like he was crazy and drunk), but now he's just like ""...I'm so exited..."" he's just not verry interesting now... But besides that its been a GREAT game! And I CANT WAIT for update four, and update four HAD BETTER BE MORE STORY, OR ELSE!!! also in tinkletown the people are called ""peeple"" LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!

								When you hear the name ""Pit People"", I'm sure the first thing that comes to mind is a game about underground cannibals battling to get to the surface. This game is nothing like that. Yes, I'm pretty sure there's a cannibal or two somewhere. Aside from that, this game has solid, exciting gameplay that never seems to get too boring or repetitive. The humor is so quality that you could impress your dad. Playing co-op is a must. If you don't have a friend, it is worth kidnapping somebody just to experience the multiplayer. I do not think kidnapping is a good idea, but I also think missing out of the multiplayer is like missing out on some of the best fun this game has to offer. Yes, there's still some kinks to iron out, and some things aren't very well explained, leaving you to figure it out on your own. Overall, a very solid of a buy. I'd give it a ""rock"" rating of solidity.			"

								Fun simple strategy game.Its lighter than I prefer.  The units could use a skill with a cooldown or some card/abilites for the players to use. Only being able to choose where the units move feels like the game is missing a layer of depth. The entire production is all top notch excellent sound, music, art, humor in a genre that usually doesn't get this treatment Pit People is superb.

								Ah, Pit People...Pit People is a great game, and with it being early access, has huge potential. I am a huge fan of The Behemoth, and, as with all Behemoth games it has great humor in it, the narrator (who is Stamper again, by the way) is pretty much god and will do whatever he wants, moving the main city randomly around the map whenever he wants, and  just messing with the characters. The story so far is about 2 hours, maybe 2 and a half (although, maybe a little shorter if they explained you needed cages to properly recruit people, god, that took me like, three whole fights to realise you needed a cage to ""recruit"" someone) you create your own team, which can consist of whoever you want, each character can have a different weapon, helmet and shield, all cracters have there own eqipment and a team can have up to six members. There are 6 base ""classes"" for a team, Assault, Ranger, Healer, Big Dude, Recruiter and Mid-Range personAssaulters are your main attack people, Rangers sit at the back and shoot, Healers do just that, heal damdged team members, Big Dudes do a lot of damdge, have a lot of health but con only move a few Hexes, Recruiters are not super powerful, but can get you new team members and Mid-Range People can throw, uh, stuff to stun enemies. The game lets you choose your team pretty much how you want it and, if you want you can go six rangers. Personally, i go for two Assaulters, a Healer, a Ranger and a Big Dude, which unfortunately means i only have five due to Big Dudes taking up 2 slots on your team,The gameplay is simple but nice, you tell your team members to go here, if they can they attack the enemy or heal your team they do, if not they just kinda, stand there. Then the enemy do the same thing. Ten you do it. Then the enemy.Then you, ect. The gameplay might not be super complex, but when you get a kill it feels super satysfying.A great game with good humor, satisfying gameplay and lovely strategy. It has great potential, and will probably become a 10/10 when fully released, though due to it not having tons to do currently, i would say about 8/10, but i still frigging love it.~Dusty			"

								I am really enjoying the game! So I watched gameplay videos etc to get a sense of wether Pit People would be for me. I took a leap (with my credit card that's no unheard of) and I do not regret my decision for one second! The game isn't perfect but it's great for me. I'll list pros and cons and depending on your taste in games you might have a different experience.Pros- Simple to learn system. You move your character to where you want and if they can do an action in that space they will. - Character customization: You have your stock plot characters but you can also recruit any of the denizens of the world. You can't change their name or ""class"" if they're a monster, but you can collect literally 1000 different helmets, (which are somtimes hair styles) weapons, armor etc. Getting a character with a funny name is many a player's goal.- No bugs for me. I haven't found any bugs yet, or graphical or sound problems.- I love the music, it wavers between this weird techno to silly haphazard metal.- The animation is smooth and I like the simple style.Cons-The game itself is not complete and that's ok for me, it tells you and you can keep playing after that part in the plot. Technically a con but it's out there in plain site for us to see befor we purchase.-Atmosphere. I enjoy the abstract and comedic design of the game's world, some people might not. This isn't a dark and brooding tactical rpg clearly. - Interface! I DID have trouble figuring out what buttons do what in some cases because they are simpily a graphic, not actually labeled. I don't like how if you hover to another character by accident or another equipment (like from helmets to weapons tab) you go to that field as if you clicked. BUT you can also go there by clicking so it creates some confusion but it's not game breaking or anything. I suggest one interface method or the other when it comes to menu screens. Everywhere else in the game is great.Watch videos, ask the message boards, check out screenshots, whatever you wanna do. As always see how you feel befor you buy this game and research. I made a good purchase.			"

								Ah, Pit People...Pit People is a great game, and with it being early access, has huge potential. I am a huge fan of The Behemoth, and, as with all Behemoth games it has great humor in it, the narrator (who is Stamper again, by the way) is pretty much god and will do whatever he wants, moving the main city randomly around the map whenever he wants, and  just messing with the characters. The story so far is about 2 hours, maybe 2 and a half (although, maybe a little shorter if they explained you needed cages to properly recruit people, god, that took me like, three whole fights to realise you needed a cage to ""recruit"" someone) you create your own team, which can consist of whoever you want, each character can have a different weapon, helmet and shield, all cracters have there own eqipment and a team can have up to six members. There are 6 base ""classes"" for a team, Assault, Ranger, Healer, Big Dude, Recruiter and Mid-Range personAssaulters are your main attack people, Rangers sit at the back and shoot, Healers do just that, heal damdged team members, Big Dudes do a lot of damdge, have a lot of health but con only move a few Hexes, Recruiters are not super powerful, but can get you new team members and Mid-Range People can throw, uh, stuff to stun enemies. The game lets you choose your team pretty much how you want it and, if you want you can go six rangers. Personally, i go for two Assaulters, a Healer, a Ranger and a Big Dude, which unfortunately means i only have five due to Big Dudes taking up 2 slots on your team,The gameplay is simple but nice, you tell your team members to go here, if they can they attack the enemy or heal your team they do, if not they just kinda, stand there. Then the enemy do the same thing. Ten you do it. Then the enemy.Then you, ect. The gameplay might not be super complex, but when you get a kill it feels super satysfying.A great game with good humor, satisfying gameplay and lovely strategy. It has great potential, and will probably become a 10/10 when fully released, though due to it not having tons to do currently, i would say about 8/10, but i still frigging love it.~Dusty			"

Early Access Review
								So I have not been given anything free, and it's rare that I write reviews.This is a wonderful start to a very fun game! As it is early access, it is unfinished in the plot/storyline, but so much fun that it is worth the current price for a few laughs and a fresh spin on positioning based combat systems. Here are my Pros and Cons. Some of the Cons list will be the kind of things that are almost always an issue in early access, but a Pro is a Pro and a Con is a Con.Pros:1. Excellent animation in a captivating style. It turns brutal and nearly meaningless violence into a humorous romp with silly characters that throw strawberries and beer bottles as shuriken and use fences and beach umbrellas for shields. Despite the 2D style it has a visual depth and variety that keeps it interesting.2. Outrageous and hilarious narrator that is apparently quite evil and argues with the main character about how the story is supposed to go.3. The world changes constantly, with the heroes home moving from place to place in the world. Not clear if it's procedurally generated each time, but don't focus too much on scouting with this game at present. You'll always be somewhere new soon. It forces a different style of planning and play in that way.4. Currently playable in a way that the combat system can be learned and understood in it's current form. Fun fights.5. Unkillable allies. Allies get wasted left and right in some fights. If you lose somebody(0 health) they will be waiting when you return home. No cheesy paying gold for resurrection mechanics. You are penalized by not having them in the field for that time, but you can spring for a resurrection potion if you know you might lose someone before completing a quest. They are pricey.6. No leveled items as yet. Some items seem more common than others in each game area, but there is not a ""sword of a thousand truths"" to completely destroy the game balance. All weapons and items have a direct weight/damage/special ratio, so a big sword with high damage and a flame attack may be all a character can carry, while a guy with a light sword might carry the heaviest shield, or forgo armor for greatly improved movement speed.Cons: 1. Unpolished combat mechanics. The controller system could use a few improvements as some of the controls seem unintuitive especially around interacting with the home and markets. Have not played keyboard controls, but the controller(xbox) works well enough to play, I just make a lot of mistakes due to buttons functioning differently from menu to menu. Dumb mistakes in this combat system can be costly since combat is accomplished solely by moving to take advantage of the strengths and weaknesses of each character/enemy. It is hard to tell if the system of strengths/weaknesses/elements is rudimentary or just complex and not fully applied. The Devs seem to be aiming for a wide variety of playstyles with a complex and intuitive turn based combat system. I think they can do that, and will eventually. This whole game centeres around strategic combat encounters.2. Weapons and armor don't have much variety in function, despite many many different appearances. Some weapons have special properties, but most are standard in function with a different appearance. I prefer this to a game with progressive overpowering of items and player groups, but more variety of weapon/armor functions would be nice. Ex. A mace beats in a helm but does less damage than a sword of equal weight. Helms deflect swords for greatly reduced damage, and light armor or no armor may offer a slight dodge chance. That's about it for armor effects. Many more ways of making fights dynamic at the equipment level through unique abilities(rather than leveled items and such) is how I hope they improve this. Bows and other ranged weapons are not very useful yet, in that they create a more unrealiable team when it comes to combat, though they are not useless, just uninteresting.3. Grindy. Unfinished story, yes, but if you don't do story quests then all that is left is to fight and collect fighters at the moment. The characters level up over time, but why is currently unclear. It seems to make them stronger slowly, but so what? This is probably a mechanic not yet well developed. As the game is, I have no reason to care if the characters level up, and kind of hope that aspect of the game is removed for some alternative.Overall this is a whole lot of fun and laughs, and mentally stimulating to play. My 11 yr. old Nephew thinks it's funny, and I would consider it generally appropriate for modern kids. Needs a lot of work to add more than one dimension of play. I don't play ""collect them all"" games, so I hope Devs continue to focus on refining and expanding combat mechanics first and foremost. I hope this has been helpful.			"

Early Access Review
								So I have not been given anything free, and it's rare that I write reviews.This is a wonderful start to a very fun game! As it is early access, it is unfinished in the plot/storyline, but so much fun that it is worth the current price for a few laughs and a fresh spin on positioning based combat systems. Here are my Pros and Cons. Some of the Cons list will be the kind of things that are almost always an issue in early access, but a Pro is a Pro and a Con is a Con.Pros:1. Excellent animation in a captivating style. It turns brutal and nearly meaningless violence into a humorous romp with silly characters that throw strawberries and beer bottles as shuriken and use fences and beach umbrellas for shields. Despite the 2D style it has a visual depth and variety that keeps it interesting.2. Outrageous and hilarious narrator that is apparently quite evil and argues with the main character about how the story is supposed to go.3. The world changes constantly, with the heroes home moving from place to place in the world. Not clear if it's procedurally generated each time, but don't focus too much on scouting with this game at present. You'll always be somewhere new soon. It forces a different style of planning and play in that way.4. Currently playable in a way that the combat system can be learned and understood in it's current form. Fun fights.5. Unkillable allies. Allies get wasted left and right in some fights. If you lose somebody(0 health) they will be waiting when you return home. No cheesy paying gold for resurrection mechanics. You are penalized by not having them in the field for that time, but you can spring for a resurrection potion if you know you might lose someone before completing a quest. They are pricey.6. No leveled items as yet. Some items seem more common than others in each game area, but there is not a ""sword of a thousand truths"" to completely destroy the game balance. All weapons and items have a direct weight/damage/special ratio, so a big sword with high damage and a flame attack may be all a character can carry, while a guy with a light sword might carry the heaviest shield, or forgo armor for greatly improved movement speed.Cons: 1. Unpolished combat mechanics. The controller system could use a few improvements as some of the controls seem unintuitive especially around interacting with the home and markets. Have not played keyboard controls, but the controller(xbox) works well enough to play, I just make a lot of mistakes due to buttons functioning differently from menu to menu. Dumb mistakes in this combat system can be costly since combat is accomplished solely by moving to take advantage of the strengths and weaknesses of each character/enemy. It is hard to tell if the system of strengths/weaknesses/elements is rudimentary or just complex and not fully applied. The Devs seem to be aiming for a wide variety of playstyles with a complex and intuitive turn based combat system. I think they can do that, and will eventually. This whole game centeres around strategic combat encounters.2. Weapons and armor don't have much variety in function, despite many many different appearances. Some weapons have special properties, but most are standard in function with a different appearance. I prefer this to a game with progressive overpowering of items and player groups, but more variety of weapon/armor functions would be nice. Ex. A mace beats in a helm but does less damage than a sword of equal weight. Helms deflect swords for greatly reduced damage, and light armor or no armor may offer a slight dodge chance. That's about it for armor effects. Many more ways of making fights dynamic at the equipment level through unique abilities(rather than leveled items and such) is how I hope they improve this. Bows and other ranged weapons are not very useful yet, in that they create a more unrealiable team when it comes to combat, though they are not useless, just uninteresting.3. Grindy. Unfinished story, yes, but if you don't do story quests then all that is left is to fight and collect fighters at the moment. The characters level up over time, but why is currently unclear. It seems to make them stronger slowly, but so what? This is probably a mechanic not yet well developed. As the game is, I have no reason to care if the characters level up, and kind of hope that aspect of the game is removed for some alternative.Overall this is a whole lot of fun and laughs, and mentally stimulating to play. My 11 yr. old Nephew thinks it's funny, and I would consider it generally appropriate for modern kids. Needs a lot of work to add more than one dimension of play. I don't play ""collect them all"" games, so I hope Devs continue to focus on refining and expanding combat mechanics first and foremost. I hope this has been helpful.			"

								Behemoth, the people who brought us Alien Hominid, Castle Crashers, and Battleblock Theater. This is their latest game, and I already enjoy it. This game is a turn based strategy RPG, and it's a lot of fun. The mechanics are easy, the gameplay is fun and rewarding, and the art style and music is fantastic. There's also a lot of character customization, so you'll be able to make your fighters look really cool, or really goofy. Also, there's this recruit system that this game has that if you defeat all enemies but one, you can capture that last enemy. It's a good mechanic, and it allows the player more freedom and control on what they can have. There's actually a story to this game, but because it's in Early Access, only some of it is here. You'll finish what they have right now in rought 2 hours, maybe a little more or less depending on how fast you're playing. This game has a lot of grinding, and a lot of items, and it's also  open world, so you'll be able to explore and collect as much as you would want. Despite this game being in an Early Access state, I would still recommend anyone who has played Behemoth's games before, or people who like these kinds of games in general. I trust that this game will be in its fully released state soon because I trust Behemoth, and they've never failed to impress.			"

								I enjoyed the game, but for 15$ right now I would wait. This game kind of feels like a demo right now. The story is very short, and there are some side quests. I understand, its early access. The game does look very promising, and I think it can be a better game than it is already if there is more added. I did enjoy quite a bit of the things already though. Combat is simple (Which can be bad for some people, I personally feel like it maybe could use some more interaction,) if you enjoyed the previous games humor, you will enjoy this games humor, the sound track is great, the characters are ok, and there is co op campaign. This is all brought down by due to how short everything ends. (Granted it is only 2 players, if they would somehow manage 4 player, I would love this game.) (Last thing, I forgot to shut this down as I was leaving. Thats why I have 2 and a half more hours than I actually played.) If you have any response to this, dont just say this review isnt helpful and leave. Leave a comment on why you think Im wrong. (tl;dr) The game is good, but too short to be worth 15$ at the moment.Overall, I am hopeful. Mainly because this game was made by Behemoth. I know they make really good games and I am almost 100% sure this will be another good one. Just have to wait for awhile. I will change my review if it gets better later.			"

								I don't know much about Pit People, but I do know the plot for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure!In 1999 in the town of Morioh located in S-City, Josuke Higashikata is a popular boy in high school who becomes quick friends with one of his classmates, Koichi Hirose. When Josuke's nephew Jotaro Kujo (who's older than he is due to his father being his nephew's grandfather, hence the age difference) appears, Josuke is suddenly pulled into the world of the supernatural powers known as stands. One of DIO's henchmen has brought the Bow and Arrow to Morioh and someone has been using it on various people in the town creating Stand users—as discovered when one of them, the murderer Anjuro ""Angelo"" Katagiri, uses the power of his Stand Aqua Necklace to try and kill Josuke for interfering with his plans to rob a store and generally disturb the peace in Morioh earlier. Aqua Necklace manages to kill Josuke's grandfather, Ryohei Higashikata, in revenge for him being jailed by him. Josuke and Jotaro eventually capture him and, as a consequence of insulting Josuke's hair, ends up getting fused to the rock he was leaning on at the time, becoming a tourist attraction known as ""Angelo Rock"" in the process.

								Note: Please do not buy this game until it is fully released. (Or not, whatever. I liked it even though it had little content.)So Pit People is a RPG game about moving units to attack each other. Once a goal is achieved or all other units are dead, you win.The main story is very short, but there's nothing else to expect from early access. There are some fun sidequests and you can keep unlocking new characters, with 1000+ items to customize with.I'm very excited to see the full release of this game, good job Behemoth! :)			"

								Pros:1. Behemoth's art style.2. Behemoth's comedy style.3. Fun music, lore and loots.4. Casual gameplay and very easy to follow.5. Can Catch more people to join the crew like Pokemon.Cons:1. Gameplay a bit repetitive but since it's early access not much to do. They could improve more in the future I believe, like special superpower for each unique characters, more lore and make special loots.Pretty much that about it for now in my opinion can't judge the game too early it's early access but since it's Behemoth's game I know it's gonna be great because I have played Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theatre satisfied with both of them. I'm looking forward to see this game full version and see more features. Meanwhile, Here have some teeny tiny iced cream, I know you love them.			"

								So, far this is my favorite game of 2017. Behemoth has delivered with a fun comedic, and unique spin on strategy games. The story as of right now is short but, sweet. Combat is creative, and inuitive. Charcters are unique, and costemizable. I remember feeling the way I did when I got Civ V. The Behemoth has really pulled through on that One More Turn ordeal. Even though this is in early access this is a must buy for any Behemoth fan, and a must buy for any strategy fan. As if Posiedon himself put his hand out in friendship ,and they spat in his mouth!

								Okay so, let me say I don't hate this game. I've actually been looking forward to it since it was annouced, as I am a huge fan of everything Behemoth does along with one of my favorite actors/voice actors/people Stamper. However, this game really just isn't fun to me. Like, the combat itself is extremely weak and unsatisfying as nothing really feels like you're actually doing anything. You can't plan for any battle, you can't choose who you attack, weapons are often just reskins and stats don't really matter too much. I know no one really cares about my opinion, so I'll just be brief. I find it hilarious, like the portion that is done was really funny as Stamper always is. The humor is here as they are known to do, but gameplay wise it's the weakest game yet. I'm really hoping somehow they fix it since nothing really feels fun besides hearing Stamper make silly voices.			"

								Fantastic. This is perhaps the most addiciting combination of gameplay elements I've ever seen in a game. It's borrows roguelikes' ""but..but there's more loot out there""- feeling, there's a near infinite amount of strategies to discover, a vast varying world, cheesy and dry humor with Stamper as narrator and full online play.Works both casually as well for those willing to invest more time. We'll see this title booming really soon, I promise.			"

								This game can really get you addicted. I've played for 2.3 hours and did not realize it at all. The only thing is I wish there were more weapon stats, there are 5 weapons stats and the rest are just skins. Capturing monsters is a very cool concept as well. It's cutely drawn and well made, it'll definitely make you laugh.I have not ran into any bugs yet and the PVP/Multiplayer aspect of the game is great as you can play with one other person online and do quests together. I have no gripes about the game. Recommended!

								I like the concept, the narrator is great, and the story is funny in classic Behemoth style. Except I just kind of find it lacking in gameplay. I don't really like the simplistic battle style of just telling a character where to go and the game doing the rest for me. It's just too simplistic. I was kind of expecting a game more like Fire Emblem but found a more limited version of it. Overall, I'm going to just wait and see the development of the game and see if the gameplay improves at all. Otherwise, I'd rather steer clear of it for the moment.			"

								Soundtrack is AWESOME, as is narrator writing BUT gameplay and long term progression too vague and too random As a tactical ""rpg-lite"" the gameplay is ok, based on your group composition you subjugate and loot new team members and items to give you more options for more team compositions. As early access the story line is unfinished but the writing and 4th window breaking is funny. However there is little progression, and even early on i see a grinding mechanism which is completely random and arbitrary. As you play the game your characters supposedly level up but they do not become visibly stronger as numbers are not defined , the levels on the individual characters seem completely random and no measure for tactical planning is allowed for the player, for example my level 4 characters caught a level 25 mob. Did it suddenly mean all the random encounters scaled up? Did it not matter? who knows as no info is given. Random encounters are completely random as well, You have no idea of the difficulty or composition of the random encounters. my low level team was near wiped out when i first met pixies doing AOE fire damage and i had no clue the pixie was there as i could not click on the encounter to get a clue . all in all at this point i cannot recommend this game as RPG or a adventure rpg or a tactical game unless you are completely into PVP. Which i did not indulge as the frustrating randomness of single player mode was too annoying			"

If you are using a shiny pan, 375.Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.For the batter:.Make sure everything is at room temperature.Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.Release the sides of the springform.Eat.			"

								Its basically like simplified, childish chess - with a very loyal, review inflating fanbase. Loot is pretty much cosmetic only, the maps are simple and the concept has you moving characters to different squares and hoping they auto attack and crit - you dont control them other than movement.If you want a tactical turn based game, play Divinity. This is very casual, almost like an IOS game. Some will love it, its done very well - nice music, voice acting and art work but its just too shallow for me.Refunded it becaue I was expecting so much more based on the review score			"

								I wanted this game to be good, but there are a few very important things that makes it disappointing. You get a team, and it's a turn by turn game where you get your team to fight other teams. The only thing you can control during combat is the movement of your characters. This is important because you can't control who your characters attack. Everything is extremely tanky, therefore no strategic planning is involved. Also, there are over 1000 items but 99% of them are cosmetic. What this means is that there are basically no strategy involved in what items your characters should equip. Yes, there are some very minor strategic decisions but they won't yield any interesting gameplay.  "

I have no idea what is going on half the time, and it takes me forever to figure out what I'm actually doing. It's incredibly unintuitive and those areas really, really need to be simplified. As a fan of previous games (Castle Crashers, BattleBlock Theater) I have a bunch of mixed feelings and really hope they change the town area.			"

								I'm reviewing this game in it's current state, and so far, I've had alot of fun with Pit People. The humor is perfect, and the art is fantastic. There are so many different weapons and units to delve into and figure out; However, this is part of the problem. The game throws you in with a minimal tutorial and trying to figure out the game can be quite overwhelming.My first complaint is the way the team customization menu is set up. When trying to choose new swords or helmets for my characters, I often feel its very clunky and uninformative, and the lack of individual statistics for each piece of equipment, trying to figure out the balance of the game is hell. There is also no point in really equiping a sword over a mace because mace's can bash helmets. Swords cant and they both deal around the same damage.My second complaint is the different races and what they're good against and weak against. It simply gives symbols without telling me what exactly those symbols mean. I wish there was more direction in what these mean and more explanation in the Surival Journal. Traveling around the map seems like a mess because I see all these monuments that I just discovered, but it's just very confusing and nothing is truly recognizable. Unlike in Castle Crashers where there were different and recognizable districts with different enemies. Here, the map is just a cluster of different biomes clashed together in no recognizable structure and generic monuments that I cant really tell apart.Also, what even does leveling up do to my character other than refill their health?Sorry if this review seems like a mess, I wrote it quickly. Other than these complaints though, I have no big problems. I have loved all of behemoth's previous games and they are amazing. I trust they'll improve this game and make it even better than it is right now in Early Access.			"

The story is really short, yes i know they are gonna expand it later but as off now its not worth it.3. The only thing you do in this game is like ""Capture, continue, kill, capture, continue"" Like said it gets repetitive really quickly.Now onto the good parts. The positives!1. This game is really enjoyable if you have a few friends to play with!2. The system off the turn based and fightning can be rather fun!3. The game does give you a few hours of fun.And that's basically it, i will fill this up over time so hope this was decent! But to be honest as of the game is right now, i wouldn't recommend buying it.

It was working perfectly fine the very first time I booted it up and I was able to play a good couple hours of it. But when I tried to play the game a few days later the game was saying I could not access my save file. Than after the most recent update my antivirus is now blocking a file inside the games files. I also tried unistalling the game but the files still remain on my computer. Also I can't even access the games file folder to delete it because it says I don't have permission. So now the game is just sitting on my PC like a brick with no use just taking up space. I undertand bugs but this is something else honestly.			"

								The charm from past Behemoth games is gone.Yet another 'open world' game that makes you repeat the same tasks over and over with barely any story. Any story that's there is just pure random nonsense, which is funny to a degree but gets boring fast. As a massive lover of all things behemoth (purchased and beat their games multiple times on multiple consoles/PC), this one hugely let me down.The actual gameplay is fun until you realize there's no depth. There's no abilities or anything, every character/monster has 1 thing they do, and that's it. There's very little strategy, very little variety, very little story, and sadly, very little fun to be had here.			"

								Disclaimer:  I don't think this game is bad. I don't think this game is good. I think this game is OK and got too many positive reviews, which try to push nonsence that if devs made 2 good games all their games will be good. Also I felt like those reviews aren't helpful, so this is my attempt to write helpful review. Next, this is early access, and I think criticism will help devs to create better game. And finally dev said that he not promises to add new units. So here what I think:Good:+A lot of customization options+Music+Artstyle could be better, but I like it+Interesting recruiting mechanic, where you should kill everyone except your target and put him in cage.Bad:-You can't choose target for attacking. You just come in attack range and when turn ends your troops choose targets from those that they have in attack reach. In theory this is interesting, but in some places it just becomes annoying. For example on quest to kill Necroduke your troops will attack anyone except of Necroduke itself.-Next, it lacks tactic. Your troops can: attack, heal, summon allies and throw nets. I believe that's all. And you can't even chose target, you just move them and they act by themselves. -And to previous point, it lacks variety as whole. You can see all units in first 1-2 hours. It could be interesting pokemon-like game if it had more variety and dangerous monsters, but there like 18 monsters. And developer said that they won't promise to add new monsters.-And so it quickly becomes boring. Battles are mostly the same where you dance around trying to cover ranged units and healers.-I felt like battle result depends from party composition too much. And you can't see enemy party composition before actual battle.-It has difficulty settings, but no actual reward for playing on insane difficulty. I expected special hats, monsters or at least achievements. I get it, older games had no rewards for hard difficulty, but now I'm so spoiled that want rewards for playing harder difficulty than everyone.-No actual explanation what soldier stats mean, just some confusing graphs. Same for attack types and moves.-Level up just refills your HP. I haven't noticed anything else. So low level troops with fast levelling much better than useless veterans with long levelling.-Sometimes scenery blocks view, for example, again, castle of Necroduke has walls that won't let you see what happens in hexes behind them.Ugly:*Humour is not for everyone. I had a giggle in the beginning, but that's all. That's fine I guess, not everyone has same sence of humour.*Narrator is not that good. I found him not funny, just plain annoying. But again, this is subjective.Feel free to add your points in comments, but be constructive.			"

								The game so far is good.  I mean, really, so far the combat is fun. However...- This game's controls are ♥♥♥♥ing infuriating.  It was clearly made for consoles.  The responsiveness and way the mouse works in this game is just bonkers.- Related to controls: specifically, navigating the fighter inventory area is clumsy and cumbersome.- Related to controls: the whole game is built upon ""Left Mouse Button selects,  RMB cancels"".  It's just not user-friendly for PC.- The amount of feedback/information about stats, items, etc. is killing me.  The number of times I stared at the screen asking myself ""what does this mean?"" tells me that they did not get enough feedback on the useability/UX side. - During combat: the art style, colors, animations during the planning phase makes it really hard to see what you're doing.  I've made a number of mistakes moving my players around and stuff because the way they display the planning phase is confusing.  There needs to be more of a clear delineation between characters, and a better way to give you a ""high-level"" overview of the battle during this phase.- The size of everything is like 300% too big.  It was clearly made for a TV sitting 8 feet away from you rather than a monitor 2 feet away.TL;DR it feels like a bad port.  The way that everyting is presented to you on screen is clearly indicative of a console game and that really hurts the PC experience.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is interesting. . .an I wish I could say that is a good thing. While this game is Early Access, it is not riddled with bugs that create huge problems. I believe it is more of a feature skinny Early Access, and the way the game is, the coding should not be difficult, and a below average dev woul be able to create it without gamebreaking bugs, so that is not a big shock. To me, the game is very boring, too slow, and doesnt bring anything new to the tactics based RPG. I actually think it takes away a lot of things that make for a good tactical RPG.  The equipment diversiity is made in a way that they are only for looks. Getting new weapons and whatnot, just change what they look like, but all swords do the same thing, and all bows and so forth. I hate this, and really think it detracts from the replayability of a game like this. Games like Final Fantasy Tactics did this genre so well, and other games go and create something similar, remove some things, and change some things and add some things, but devs seem to constantly change the WRONG things, and make for a worse playing experience than what would otherwise be here.ALL that being said, this game is NOT bad, and is actually something that could be worth playing, if it were priced right. This is $5 game, when completed. Right now it should be on sale for $3 or $4, and never be more than $5 when done. Unfortunately devs don't know how to price games, and think their game is worth more than it is. Selling 1000 copies at $15, is far worse than selling 10000 copies at $5, and everything about this game screams under $10 game. Dev really needs to look at other games on Steam, and really decide how much this game should be priced at. Don't support this project at this price point, I beleive you will be wasting your money, and won't be happy with your purchase.			"

								Folks this game, in it's current state, does not deserve the mindless praise. I'd say its not worth the money quite yet.The combat is shallow because you only command movement each turn.The loot is shallow because items within the same category (skinny sword, medium sword, fat sword) are all the same stats.There aren't a large variety of enemies or possible pokemon allies (19?) which comprises everything you will see or fight in the game).One could argue the gear is what brings variety to enemies and allies but as I've said, the gear is largely cosmetic.Theres lovely art and lovely humor. Maps are (edit: feel) procedurally generated and change (edit: relocate you) every few outings. But the game is simply too shallow to warrant the money right now. Hopefully they have more units in the pipeline, and are going to change the stats of items.Right now: 5/10			"

								Pros: Tells an immersive and beautiful story about a one-eyed soul binder, a 17th centruy slave owner, a scrapped Adventure Time cupcake, and bootleg Mario and Peach as they travel the land in a murderous spree in an attempt to take revenge on the Monty Python and the Holy Grail's Black Knight's stunt doubles. This educational, point and click adventure also teaches children Japenese  and how to make friends by throwing nets at them and locking them in cages that clearly do not fit them.  Includes an all-knowing spotted equine that flies and a bear that suspiciously may or may not sound like  your favorite Youtuber. Cons:  You cannot marry units like in Fire Emblem.  0/10 Would make Pipistrella my waifu again   (But srsly buy this game. It's really fun)			"

								This game is pretty cool, I like the humor similar to their other games. The story seems like it will be really awesome, sadly I finished the entire early access story in less than an hour. I did play for a bit longer, but I feel like the early acess advertisement misled me a bit in assuming there was more of a story in place so far.Overall, I would say gameplay wise this will be a great game when it full releases, but I wouldn't bother until the full release. It is just too incomplete right now.Such is the risks of early access.			"

								This is purely a review based on release.The game itself is extremely well put together. It's a Behemoth game, after all. The humor is on point, the artstyle is extremely pleasing, the pure amount of character and party customization is almost overwhelming, and the combat system (which I at first thought was as convoluted as the Undertale path minigame) turned out to be pretty well understood.Sadly, this is also an Early Access game. And while I should not be expecting THAT much from an Early Access game directly on release, I find myself doing so anyways.You will almost always be outnumbered, outdamaged, and outplayed in every scenario ""3 skulls and above"". Now in another RPG this would be fine. But due to just how much damage and random chance (not just crits but location of hits, location of AoEs, who gets healed, etc.) there is, it can be extraordinarily frustrating to set up a team around a point. As there is no permadeath in the game, this is simply a setback and puts you back at the city to do it again. But the fact that most encounters are very focused on luck can be frustrating when you start taking longer routes.The game is also extremely lacking right now in main content if you don't want to either A. Explore and complete all the mini-quests, B. Complete your customization collection, or C. Fight your friends in the PvP arena. Now I know that the non-story portion is almost the complete focus of the game, but the thing I like most about Behemoth games is that I can run through the story (acquiring collectibles along the way) and basically play through everything. I don't have any incentive to go out and collect customizations (because most customizations are exactly the same stat-wise, with a select few being either elemental or slightly more powerful). I don't have any incentive to go out and capture more recruits (because this is just used to get more customizations and all characters of a class have the same stats). And while I played the single story mission (which you can clear in about 10 minutes) and enjoyed it, I do wish the focus of the game was a bit more linear as the open-world nature of the game let the monotony set in once I realized the above.This should be a game I enjoy, as ""turn-based hex-RPGs"" are a favorite of mine (Civ, Fire Emblem, etc.). But the freeform nature of it makes it it hard to recommend right now as anything more than a collectathon. If a friend has is, by all means take a swing. It doesn't take long to get caught up to another person gear-wise, and it's enjoyable for the time I spent on it. But if you're looking for an extreme amount of substance ala Battleblock or Castle Crashers, you won't find that here (yet).			"

Early Access Review
								This developer would:-	Delete Their own posts from Community Discussion topics. (witnessed by me and others in The particular thread)-	Set Their profile to private state, when being accused on review injection (witnessed by me and,  supposedly the guy who actually accused Them)-	Flag your review for being abusive and then send you a friend-request. (I’m not really into ♥♥♥♥♥slaps)-	Allegedly, remove the flag, after you would create a separate topic at the Steam Community Discussion-	To put it yet again.-	And engage you in ~ 1 hour bullfight, when They’re trying to post their response in the comment section, but some miserable author of review would delete them outright (My Spirits of alcohol reminded me, that They had 3 other takes previously, containing “let’s talk privately” explicitly, and I totally agree with them), until either Steam moderator action took an effect or They grew bore of it. Nyaaaah. Me won.-	Would either change the flag tag, or instantly reflag your review upon lifting (it was “Off-topic”, which suddenly became “Abusive” yet again in more than a week locked review)-	To be [not] continuedAnd now, Me start.Minnasan, ogenki desu ka? Your supper-popular reviewer Yuu-sama is back on the line! Rejo-o.. ah, mind it.So, I took up on a good advice and actually tried out the game. There was a good opportunity, because I’d gifted it to a friend who actually wanted it. Soooo~. It’s King Bounty. With customizeable characters instead of just stacks. I mean, the big part of the game is King’s Bounty rewinded on a 1.5 game hours-length map (yet, it’s EA, I know) . Pretty casual in comparison. No, absolutely casual in comparison. Even with 90’s original. What Pokemon are you talking about? I’ve never played it. But, you know, you can capture monsters in the latest KB games, and some of them a predefined on generation to join you anyway. There is no “Gonna catch them all” spirit? I guess it is. So, Pit People is just a casual 9€ TBS, like Adventure Manager and others with a sketchy mechanics and things.What about the other, even bigger part? It’s hum-or. And first things first - bleeeh. I can’t start to talk about it without that premise. It’s really sends me back to the phrase that began everything for this review: “It’s a Behemoth’s game!”. Jokes are passable, generally. But there are pits (in Pit People, yes, *ba dum-tss*). The closest example is Forest scene of Castle Crashers. They didn’t got rid of those funny feces detonations. Meanwhile, the man who anticipated this game and actually enjoyed it for 1.5hrs of the 1st act said, that the only thing bad in this game, currently, is “the degenerative sense of humor”. And for this part, he is right. But I would suggest there is a reason behind it’s presence. By the way, we never finished CC because of that.Stage change. With the review being locked, my life turned grey. I’ve got no wife, no kids, no warm touch from anyone, but General Vochka himself. That being said, I jumped into another abyss of my useless existence. Aaahh, ok, it was their discord server. I found here two moderator guys joking around about how 2 unicorns could create a Mobius and feces, more of them, of course (strongly reminded me this South Park’s episode, that I did not intend to watch; like the whole title). When I was left alone with one of them, I’ve started to provoke him (I wasn’t picky in the means, why should I?). Silenced, re-entering, watch him playing for a time, They came, me ban. Yes, I was kicked at the end, got yet another invite from Them and one more, too, which I’ve decided to took up. The other side was really irritated, plainly rude, so I’ve got no choice but to report it. Properly, through the ticket. I am an adult and strong-willed male, but there could have been woman, kid, or an elderly person in my place. And yesterday I got a response. This person would be restricted in their ability to communicate with other people through the Steam for some time. And I got 6 downvotes on my long-drown reviews this very Friday. It seems they are downvoting every.So, yes, my point is that some part of the “older” community, grown on the best pieces of Behemoth humor is acting, to put it mildly, strange. But yet, they got a special treatment, like “Sure, I’ll go and ban that digger”. This very part of community is expecting for Daniel to act in some generally known way (related to this very sense of humor). For example, They would delete Their own posts, setting Their profile to “Private” only to anger those, who would dare to doubt them. Childish? It is. But look at the beginning and the list what They already did.No, the man this stupid couldn’t possibly create games. I suspect, he do understand he can’t effectively fight some guy with “?” on avatar. It’s like fighting a faceless mob. And I am positive on that he knows it. But still, people expecting him to act in this way. Those very people he attracted with his first games, filled with iconic for the Behemoth sense of humor. Of course, it’s just my vision. But if you saw at least a bit of this whole process: wouldn’t you think it seems weird, if 7\10 of most useful reviews are “Behemoth game, so is good”? Wouldn’t you think it’s weird when some of the negative reviews got very ‘special’ attention? I guess, there is a reason for that.Said, Dan is a businessman. It’s just his model of advertising the games. He got reliable community core, which could beat him some of the tips, like write some positive reviews, for example. No, not injections. He didn’t pay them for that.And here we are: this game is in Early Access. It got a single playable act. Apparently, you can participate in the development with your ideas, but I suppose, some of the ‘closer’ people’s opinions would get priority over yours. If you hope that jokes in future acts would be more of “straight sense”, your expectations is likely to be futile.What’s left of this game? PvP? It’s casual TBS, any competitive one would beat it. No direct control on units? Dominions, Legion series is better by no means. Instant turns? Oh, boy, you made me remember this one from 2001 - Laser Squad Nemesis.The only reason to grab it is Co-Op. I guess, it’s a good reason. If you are able to withstand the “o-ha-ha” part. Or if you want to see a Casual TBS in your hands . Or you’ve already watched complete series of South Park.I was meant to compare this community with the one Klei’s got, but I’ve decided it would be malicious to compare 2 indie games by their “feel” (actually, I’ve asked them on occasion when their Barbie House is going to get build).No hard feelings, Dan. I’m not a developer and I can’t possibly judge you on the way you’re advertising your game. I know you’re going to lock this review, I’m going to see your waiting Tail in the comments soon (he’s such a coward in a real-time chat), but that is my opinion about your game. I’m not aiming to win this, I just wanted to understand the cause, the matter of why did it even start. By the way, I though you were panicking first, so this accusations of the guy, who likely laughed his guts off from the whole situation, must had been true. It seems like a total misunderstanding. I should thank those minions for letting me know. From now on, I’m going to go easy on my reviews (anyway, they are about to get downvoted to the Mariana Trench soon).I have to remove the original review, it would be there http://imgur.com/a/tDDri "

								Early Access Watcher Public Service AnnouncementGame: Pit PeopleUpdate Version: January 13th EA ReleaseDisclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer.Gameplay Footage: WARNING! This includes spoilers for the available story missions.


YouTube™ Video: Pit People - Early Access Watcher - 

			Views: 207		

			Disclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer. Also, some of the tracks had to be removed to keep this ad free. Please not there is music in the menu portions.		

I understand this is Early Access and the final product is not representative of the current state, but this PSA covers the state of the game as it is now. There are some things that stand out in a good way, but the content provided in terms of story and complexity is not worth the cost of the game at this time. Thankfully, this game will get made regardless of what happens, so this warning is just for those on the fence or looking for a single player experience over the multiplayer experience. Visuals and music are going to be amazing for some, off putting to others. If you played Castle Crashers or Battleblock Theater (I didn't, though I do own them), then the style will look familiar in terms of the shading and design. There is a massive amount of character customization in terms of weapons, shields and helmets, but armour isn't a factor yet. Music ranges from blasting techno to mild synth that I surprisingly found enjoyable. Voice acting is left to a few announcers and the narrator with the rest being incoherent gibberish that requires the use of subtitles to understand. For the setting and the bizarre nature of the world, it fits perfectly and adds to the zany dialog. The story is incredibly short right now, consisting of a couple of introductory quests that took me about an hour and a half to finish. Once it is over, the Pit (1-2 vs AI, 2 vs 2 players matches) and a collection of side-quests are all that lengthen the gameplay. This is unfortunate, mostly due to the narrator's amazing performance that was indeed the highlight of the game. He eats up the scenery with his voice over accompanied by some beautiful cutscenes and dialog that did get a chuckle in the back of my mind. It left me wanting more, which is why I was surprised by how little there was to the story considering the price tag. Gameplay is mechanically sound, but lacks depth in terms of character management and improvement. All stats are contributed by the characters level with weapons and armor filling in the rest. Swords are good for smaller foes, longer swords hit harder, maces are required to deal decent damage against heavy helmet wearers and the ranged weapons can deal splash damage or direct damage. Shields also range from small to huge, allowing for more projectiles to be blocked as the size increases. Weapons can also have special perks that can root characters to a spot, freeze opponents or stun targets. Otherworldly creatures also exist, providing attacks that can chain lighting across multiple targets, create minions after being hit or float to provide avoidance of land based traps. These creatures are mainly acquired through the process of recruitment (kill all but the creature, capture the creature in a cage) and add some life to a combat system boiled down to moving to a space and letting the character attack. You only choose the movement, leaving the attack to be determined by the position and hoping your character hits the guy you want if they are standing next to two enemies. It has gotten to the point that I let the computer handle combat for me while I just maneuver across the world map in search of new locations and enemies during my last hour of play. The best way to describe it would be if you simply moved units and used auto-attacks. From what I was reading up, this game has been in development for awhile and has a standing deal over on Xbox One Game Preview as well. While I commend the developer for providing a functional core, the lack of a longer story and minimalistic combat style make battles tedious after awhile. The party system (can have up to six slots with some creatures taking up two or more) at least provides countless creature/character combinations that helps keep the multiplayer fresh for those who will focus on the 2 vs 2 battles. For anyone looking for a decent single player experience, however, might want to wait for the story to expand further. For now, not recommendation is the best I can give it when comparing the price to the available main story content. This has been a EAW PSA.			"

								Never thought The Behemoth of all companies would pull an Early Access ""GOTCHA!"", but here we are.Sure, I saw the usual Early Access disclaimers, but I've been following this game for 3 years, I thought for sure I'd get 5-10 hours worth of my $15.NOPE. 3 Years of development has apparently allowed them to finally establish the fundamentals of Pit People, but the game has ZERO CONTENT. You've got your basic intro quest, and ONE STORY QUEST (combined these two things take less than a single hour). Aside from that, you've only got repeatable filler quests, and repeatable arena skirmishes.Don't get me wrong:-The dialogue and story is hilarious-The gameplay is excellent-The sound and visuals are The Behemoth at its absolute bestBut there's only a fart's worth of content so far. If you want to support the company (they WILL finish it eventually I'm sure, unlike other Early Access scams), go right ahead, but don't expect more than a tiny, tiny sneak peak at the game itself.

								The game is brilliant!ABOUT THE GAME AT THIS POINT:The mechanics of this game is very similar to the traditional ""tactics"" game, yet i hope it can still go deeper in the updates. The graphics are smooth and described good enough, and its hilarious.The music are so great i have to listen to them again on youtube.The gameplay: recruit and loots are shining imo, that makes exploring the world map is not boring at all! One thing i dont like about the item system is that there are too many weapons/helmets with the same stats (which makes them JUST different by the appearance).WHAT I THINK SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE:SHOULD have boss battles.SHOULD have more quest type other than just go to some point and win the fight there.SHOULD have more skills (only use 3 attacks all the game is not fun at all, should have a talent tree with at least 5 skill (one ultimate) for each character/recruit), this will adds more depth to the combat system.SHOULD adjust ranged attacks: it is fine right now, but can be improve imo. I think there should be only one range enemy with decent damage that rushs player to kill him rather than multiple archers dealing 1/2 dam (which is not threatening at all!)SHOULD continue the main quest, and make it a long and memorable journey.So far i can't join any pvp match, but the co.op against bot is really fun.Recommended this to anyone who up to fun strategy RPG game.

								Pit People is the love child of castle crashers, this turnbased sequal is infinite amounts of funThey allow a unique team building system where you can capture any opponent you face and add them to your team allowing for a ton of different combinations and builds, that to me is VERY appealing with the multiplayer aspect.I have the first 45min of gameplay down below =] Enjoy!

								This game is really quite good.  The humor is spot on, and the combat is very satisfying with its turn based structure and being unable to fully direct the characters other than to move,  whom they attack is up to them which has hosed me once in awhile. Though the main quest line is short  its fun to level up and capture more characters.If you liked Castle Crashers or BattleBlock Theatre then I would suggest picking this one up as well			"

								A game made by the people who made Castle Crashers and Battleblock theater, comes Pit PeoplePit people is a hexgonal turn-based strategy game, the twist here is that your units attack units on their own free-will, meaning that positioning is extremely important.The art-style is simple but incredibly effective, being extremely colorful, vibrant, and having everything and everyone popout, every item is different in terms of art design and every character is memorable.The gameplay is deceptively simple, but heavily rooted in complicated strategies, team compositions and even gear distribution, luckily, the team at Behemoth were able to make this game pretty easy to learn and play, but difficult to master.My main problem with the game are relatively simple ones, first, the inability to scroll out the map can be problematic sometimes, especially against a full team against a full team, another problem is that the gear that you obtain rarely differ against each other, I would like to have like very small differences, but differences none the less (I want my throwing straws to deal more damage than Yusef's default axes xD) Thirdly, some of the non-human party members are limited in their apperal, I would like that to be changed, it would be awesome to have a whole group of kobolds wearing hats and wielding chicken drums hehe.Besides that, I would reccomend this game for many people, Behemoth fans, hexagon-turn based Strategists, normal people to give this a try, despite it being an early access game, its well polished and no doubt will be absolutely amazing when it finally releases.

								Most complete early access game you'll play. So many unexpected fun features in this game, just very well designed. Online co-op works flawlessly. Best of all, the alien hominid/castle crashers humour is still there.The tutorial/tooltips are lacking/non-existent though, but most of this is already addressed in the first beta update.With all the mediocre indie games priced at $30 easily raking in money, a price tag for $15 for such a masterpiece makes it a must-get.

Because it includes all of that!In all seriousness, I don't love tile based stratagy games, but I absolutly adore this game. Even though it isn't complete, it is well polished and has great potential. The combat is simple enough to pick up, but deep enought to create complex stratagies. I haven't gotten too far into it, but so far I am hooked. Totally worth the $14.99!The only problem is that neither the narrarator (Stamper, I think his name is) or the writters for this game haven't gotten some sort of award.			"

								(It has been a while since I last picked it up, so there may be changes. I also suck at strategy, so...)I bought this while I was looking for a Fire Emblem fix, and I was not disappointed. Pit People is, at first glance, a hilarious little strategy game with a childish art style and a perfecltly arrogant narrator.Below the surface...It's a living hell. Unless you've been preparing for hours beforehand, prepare to fight to the last man in a fury of blood, rage, and Horatio's Blueberries. Nobody holds back, and if the shotgun butterflies don't kill you, the mortar unicorns will.I'm gonna put it simply: I have no idea what has happened during my entire time playing. All I know is that it was glorious.Final rating: 9/10, very difficult if you're a beginner. Co-op is very fun.			"

								""It’s difficult to actually place Pit People on a scale of recommendation. On the one hand, there’s a very solid foundation for a great game. On the other, that great game isn’t quite here yet. A huge point of contention is going to come down to whether or not you’re willing to pay for the frame of a game. What I will say is that I’ve played a lot of finalized products that don’t feel as complete as what The Behemoth has managed to output so far. There are far more pros than there are cons, even if that con is a huge one."" Read my full review: http://www.theyoungfolks.com/featured/99362/video-game-review-pit-people/ "

Early Access Review
								For an early access game I'm loving it so far.The commentary from the announcer and the conversations between the pit people actually had me laughing, not just a huff of air though my nose but actually laughing.The gameplay is simple yet fun, but I do think the characters can be a little buffed up when you get them around high levels. I have a team that are all around level 60 but they are still doing the same damage and taking the same damage from enemies I fought at level 1. Aside from the free health from leveling up there needs to be a little bif more of a reward there.The map is nice and open, with the idea of constanly changing the area you're in makes it feel some what fresh each time. The enemy placement is nice and diverse and there are enemies where you'd expect them to be, like robots in the techno zones and monsters in the gloomy areas. A few things could be explained the how the turbo effects the enemies and also shooting the sparkly ground gives you plenty of coins. I have yet to figure out what pushing all the buttons around the world map does but I'm working on that.The sound track so far is catchy, that's the best way to describe it. A few more tunes would be nice if those songs were given to specific battles. Like say you're fighting mainly humans you'd play X song, then if you go over to the undead area there would be a chance to play a uniqe undead song out of the main soundtrack for the rest of the world. But that's a personal idea.Another thing I would like to see is a little more interaction with the speaker, like a in combat modifier so if you're doing well he suddenly feels like you should die, special units the narator summons spawns on the enemy's team, like wise if you're losing. Just something more than just a voice to spice things up.Over all I really enjoy this game for what it is, and considering I can play this with a friend makes it that much better.			"

And once you start getting comfortable, you start seeing the strategy unfold as you pick your team and move around the field, testing different uit comps and synergies.

								Has the utmost potential, depending on how things are executed upon full release.Pros:-Hilariously chaotic-Pretty decent co-op-Awesome, if not slightly frustrating, combat-It's got William Stamper, what more do you want?Cons:-Units act of their own volition after you move them, causing problems with focusing single enemies-Driving in the overworld is borderline painful at the moment-Abusable mechanicsThe game is very fun, that much is certain. Sure, the story is far from complete, but the side-quest lines take a while and are balanced to your level (at least from my personal experience). Essentially, the game is Fire Emblem meets Pokemon meets The Behemoth. As prior stated, moving units is the extent of your turn, which makes strategizing both a breeze and maddening at once. Because the battles take place on hexes, if a single enemy unit has enemies on two opposite sides, you only have about a 33% chance of hitting them, as the other two enemies to either side will also be in range. This is both good and bad, as you can also exploit this strategy. The Pit is a gladiatorial arena, which has an ""Unfair"" game mode. It's three back to back fights with unit death carrying over between rounds. This at first seems like a fun challenge for late game, but as it turns out, it's a totally exploitable experience farm. The day the early access started, I was at the top of the leaderboard, not because I deserved it, but because I was grinding experience and in the process got unique loot that can only be acquired by placing well in The Pit. The game needs some polishing in some areas, but I was happy to take the dive, and The Behemoth delivers once again. On the funny scale:Battleblock Theatre > Pit People > Castle Crashers			"

								The first few minutes of this game says it all. Pit People is a hilarious game with great artwork, which is fun to play and does not take itself very seriously. It is very self aware while still delivering an, this far interesting story (I say this far since the Early Access does not contain much of the story, but the little it contains is great).The gameplay itself is great. It is a fun, casual strategy game. You do not have to be particularly skilled to enjoy it and play it, but you can still apply quite a bit of strategy into it if you are more competetive.The world map is fun and interesting, and it is great to see all the creative places that the developers have made on said map.You have loads of customisation for your characters which is also great. It is also worth to note that this is probably the first Behemoth game where playing with controller is not better than playing with mouse and keyboard. You can still play with controller if you prefer that, which is fantastic. It just means more options for the player.I am looking forward to see the finished product. However this game is definetly worth it buying already, even if it lacks story. It is fantastic and fun both gameplay wise and aestethically. Not only that, but Will Stamper shows once again that he is the best voice actor ever. I cannot get enough of his voice in this game.Get this game NOW!			"

Early Access Review
								This is a review from playing a fair amount in Early Acces. Note that my experience is from update 2/3 era so if you are reading this at a later time it might not be matching what the game currently is.The Feel:This is a perfect game for people that like silly things. There is weird humor and references going on all over the place. The one story mission and the few side missions that are available for play at the moment are really fun. There is also enough going on the world map to keep you busy.Gameplay:As this is a sort of tactical positioning game mixed with random elements, it does pretty much what it says on the box. You set up your team of silly fighters, you place them where you want them to go and chaos happens. This is not a bad thing. Even when I am defeated I can sigh with a smile. Just the sheer amount of weaponised silly items (giant banana, crazy hats, throwing a gun at someone called ""self defense"") just makes me laugh every time i see a new item. At the time of writing there are about a 1000 items to collect in the game to customize your fighters with, and every time I run into a new pack of fighters with new hats/weapons I get excited. The fact that you can only take the last standing opponent with you makes it so you have to choose which of the shiny new things you want NOW :).Regarding the price:Worth every penny. You buy it once, and then you have hours worth of gameplay, especially when you consider there is a great amount of ""gotta catch 'em all"" involved.Regarding replayability:In update 3 they added some daily tasks to do co-op with a buddy. Also you get an ""Emperor's order"" to give you some extra items the moment you complete a specific task. As these orders are infinite its a fine extra reward for stuff you'd be doing anyway. I think the biggest thing going for this game is definitely the collection of custom appearances and items that you can acquire. Any cons?:Like I said, it's still under developtment. I didn't notice anything that would interrupt the gameplay experience in terms of bugs or so. That being said I'd like to see less daily tournament points awarded for people using the auto battler (that's right, you can even play your own fights as a spectator, while the computer dukes it out). At the moment I believe the ratio in the unfair challenge is that  you get half points if auto battler was used during a fight. Since I use auto-battler a couple of times during the day for a few fights and still finished high up, I think the rate should be lower so that people that actually fight their own battles can feel more achievement. But then again I think this will be less of an issue when the player pool increases.Final thoughts?A great game for its price, especially when you are a completionist. As there is plenty of auto-save going on, it can also be played in short spans for when you only have a little time to relax. Everyone should have a 15 min. pit people break at work! "

								""It’s difficult to actually place Pit People on a scale of recommendation. On the one hand, there’s a very solid foundation for a great game. On the other, that great game isn’t quite here yet. A huge point of contention is going to come down to whether or not you’re willing to pay for the frame of a game. What I will say is that I’ve played a lot of finalized products that don’t feel as complete as what The Behemoth has managed to output so far. There are far more pros than there are cons, even if that con is a huge one."" Read my full review: http://www.theyoungfolks.com/featured/99362/video-game-review-pit-people/ "

Early Access Review
								I'll write this review from the point of view of a dedicated RTS and RTT games. I reckon the items and strategic elements in this game are many, and that allows for a wide array of tactics depending in your taste and personal strategy. For instance, there are not just shields, swords, maces or damage per se. There are currently 3 times of shields which work differently from each other, and somewhat realistically enough (i.e. The massive pavise like ones provide no protection in melee but great coverage from ranged damage). There is also the concept of pierce damage and blunt damage, accuracy, and light and heavy armour with related maluses. Apart from unit customisation and the related strategy, there are also different races you can pick from. So far I have seen apart from humans: spider like humanoids called spidaurs, robots, vampires in a half human giant bat form (vampires), hair trolls, cyclops, mushrooms (yes lol), small jawa like lads that come in 2 for each slot*, fairies, cupcakes, wraiths and zombies. I guess I missed some, and several might be added later. *Slots are what determines how many fighters you can have in your team. You start with 4 open slots and can unlock 2 more easily enough early in the game. Not all races take the same amount of slots. Cyclops and trolls take 2 slots each, the jawa like gnomes take 1 but come in a couple. Of course that means the unit taking more or less slots is proportionately stronger or weaker. As a player of Total War, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Age of Empire titles I can't whine about what the game says it is offering. I'm actually very satisfied of the diversity that they put into the game. The humour is very likeable, and so is the story. A more detailed review will come as the game is fully released. Overall for its price I would rated it less than 10/10.			"

								Pit People is a one of those 'Easy to play, hard to master' types. It's fast to finish your turn just a few clicks, that's right, there's no special type of attacks your charcters can use. It's more about type type of charcters and types of equipment that just leveling up.This game also features pvp, very fun and easy to start playing, there was not once i felt like i was under leveled or overleveled in pvp, but like i was outplayed or someone with more knowleage than me. You get rewarded with gold and points by completing these pvp (you can also play with the AI but you have to go though extra rounds) The points are your rank, there are three stages. Bronze, Siver and Gold. The higher the better the rewards are.Not going to give out spoliers but i'll say this game has pretty good comady with the story, but a bit short because the game is still in beta.The charcters you get are fun and different to use, like humans,  they can use different types of swords, clubs, bows and some throwable stuff. The Cyclops who can gaint weapeons, clubs and send people flying! There is even cupcakes, wraths and other scary and funny allys(or foes)I'll give this game a 7.5. Abit hard to get into and lacks story, but theres is so many laughs and adventures to be had in this game! Have Fun! "

								The Best game that is currently early access. Keep in mind that this is early access.9.5/10Pro:+ Will Stamper a.k.a Quibs from Battleblock theater is in it as the narrator.+ Funny Gameplay during the fights+ Lots of Enemy/ Ally types+ Great turn based system+ ""The Pit"" is a fun way to test out team compositions, it is basically an arena to fight in.+ Simple level system+ Funny way to recruit new allies, you throw a net on the lone enemy and you take him back to townCons:- Not much story, but that is because this is in ** early access. **- only a few weapons that look desirable - not that many healer types- limited inventory space in the wagon which is how you travel around the world map, the space is about 10, fills up fast- only customization options to characters are weapon, shield, and head. (We ned more gear customization, like shirts to get rid of that plain baige t-shirt)Both:+/- promotes grinding in ""the pit"" instead of the world due to small inventory space			"

								Now, we all have that ONE game we all love to play, this is mine. I have loved this game since the beta, put around 30 hours into it. I would recommend this game for anyone who wants a game to play with one other person, even though there are more enemies to defeat. Personally my favorite character would have to be the mascot, they're really helpful during fights because they allow you to gain more damage, to receive more experience to help you level up so you don't die. Back when castle crashers was originally made, 2008, I played it on my playstation 3. Now I know what you're all gonna say, ""you console pleb"" ""PC master race"". Well this was back 9 years ago, and I only had my father's laptop, a Lenovo Thinkpad. Anyways, I have loved all of the Behemoth games they have released, and played most of them on ps3 and pc. One thing I noticed though while playing this game today, was that when I ran into an enemy on the map, I shot a rocket at him, I was about to enter battle phase, but it took me out. I don't know if this was intended or not, but it's really helpful for sticky situations.			"

								It's in it's early stages so there isn't too much to say about it right now, but based off the content we have right now I can safely say its going to become amazing. Even though there are only two story missions availible right now, there are still tons of sidequests and misc. missions you can do in game. I love playing with friends and making the dumbest teams I can think up to mess around with (they have a recruitment feature you can use to pretty much make any enemy a member on your 5 person team). It's definitely worth the money right now and will only continue to get better, if you like rpgs and silly/stupid games, then definitely buy this. It wont disappoint.			"

								Just a little disclaimer, I was a beta tester for this game.Pros: + Amazing optimization and port+ Amazing controls+ Charming gameplay, artstyle, characters, and dialogue+ Behemoth's usual goofiness+ Battleblock Theatre reference hidden in the sound options+ Good price tag+ Innovative+ Satisfying and rewarding open world+ Doesnt take long to install+ Early Access game that feels like a full game+ Battleblock Theatre and Castle Crashers owners get bonus items+ It was made clear that Behemoth, just like every other game they make, spent so much time and effort making this game+ Sadistic, dark-humored narrator+ Actually requires a decent amount of skillNow, since I love Behemoth-made games so much, I hate doing this, but...Cons:- Lack of Optimization settingsOverall, there is nothing I can actually diss about this game. It's only an Early Access title, but feels like a full, completed game nevertheless. I wish more Early Access games, no, games in general were like this! Well done like always, Behemoth! I will continue to support you guys by buying your games! :D- 10000000000000000000/10 - "" OOPS, BUTTERFINGERS! "" >:D			"

								It's pretty damn good, If I do say so myself. So far, as the time I'm writing this review (Jan 24, 2017) I'd say theres about 3, maybe 4 hours of the actual story complete, but yet there's so much polish to what they have so far. I've been a fan of The Behemoth since Castle Crashers, and it was probably my favorite game, until Pit People came out. Although the game is still in early access, there are so many other things to do, and just going around capturing the many creatures is pretty fun. I highly recommend this game to any fan of The Behemoth, or just anyone in general.			"

								This is my first review, and this game deserves it! Ok, if your reading this and debating to buy this game, I have a couple things to tell you that will explain the beauty of this game.  First off, if you have ever seen Battleblock Theater, or Castle Crashers, you know that this should be a funny game, and it is. This game has some very good humor.Gameplay:This game plays like Fire Emblem, but much more fun. I'm not that good at Fire Emblem (Im terrible at it) When I was going to buy this game, I was debating on if it was worth it because of the gameplay, and it was. I enjoy playing this and can feel myself improving! The gameplay is polished and clean. There are side quests and the main story line. Sence this is early access, the story line isn't complete yet, but there are 1000s of sidequests while you wait for the game to update!~SUMMERY~Pit People® is worth buying. If your a fan of the Fire Emblem series and love the humor in Battleblock Theater or Castle Crashers, this is perfect for you. If your like me and isn't the best at this type of gameplay, give it a try, If you don't enjoy it, you can get a refund, but I strongly recommend trying to get to the part where you have a full team. Then you can experience the beauty of this game. 9/10			"

Early Access Review
								Well, let's begin, shall we?So, to start off, the fact that it's a Behemoth game does bring multiple hopes and anticipations, no doubt. But it also ensures that this game, even in Early Access, has some bars to reach, or at least start showing the work it's wanting to make to get there. It's an interesting situation, with high potential, but high needs and desires.Which is why, after the first hour of the game, I can honestly tell you that the promise it shows is magnificent, and the game itself so far is quite enjoyable. Between the artstyle coming together quite well with this sort of genre and gameplay, giving the game a life and enjoyability that's present even when wandering the plains of the game, to the gameplay being simple enough to pick up after the initial tutorial, yet intricate enough to ensure it isn't a ""Click to win"" situation.Of course, it does have a few issues. In the beginning, there wasn't a large amount of explanation as to how certain gear works and what some of those stats change, or increase or decrease the chance thereof, and will little explanation as to the nature of whether or not weapons were simply reskins, or have their own stats. I found myself struggling through this sort of issue in the beginning, but had it settle out quite well when you find drops that do infact have stats of their own, albeit rather small and specific, but nonetheless. So while it DOES try to enlighten the player through the tips given while traversing, I found the character loadout designing to be a bit of a beast to understand at first, but as above stated, this is easily remedied with a bit of time in the game. Just a slight warning for anyone who may be turned off because of such.Ultimately, I'd recommend the game. While it is a bit lacking in content outside of the story (this being in Early Access, that should be obvious), I do feel that it brings enough entertainment and interest in it's state right now, even if you don't find an interest in the online/offline multiplayer. And with the Pit, the playability does infact come in greater and greater amounts.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been incredibly hyped for this game to release since the trailer. Behemoth the developer does amazing work and their games are some of my favorites of all time. Customization is endless with over 1000 different items to collect to pimp out your team. Lots of different classes and diversity. Difficulty is meh, it seems to not be very hard so i reccomend actually going into insane mode ASAP. CO-OP is awesome so if you have friends GET THIS. The humor in this game is like all their other games, immature and hilarious. Anything from poop jokes to funny fraises this game is definitatly a great choice for younger and older audiances who love that kind of stuff. Voice acting is probably at its best in this game above all of their previous games, the narrator is just amazing. Campaign is pretty short for an early access game but it has plenty of incredibly fun and unique side-quests that all feel different. I've got about 10 hours on XB1 and 3 hours on PC. If you have a console i reccomend getting it on that, it's just simply better in my opinion. The PvP is good but can be annoying to find a game, that also is valid with CO-OP. I wish there was a gamechat so you could maybe talk to the person you're fighting with or against. With 15$ you'll get on average 15 hours-20 hours before it becomes kind of a numb loot grind if you're trying to get all the customizables. There is one aspect I have not treaded and that is the 3v1 unfair mode which seems fun. I tried it in the beta and boy did it kick my pooper until it was bruised and bloody, not much has changed since the beta besides more side-quests and better connection. For early access I would give it a solid 9/10 because the campaign's length, low difficulty setting, and lack of gamechat.I tried to be un-biased as possible in this review, so don't take anything with a grain of salt!

Early Access Review
								Highly recommended, especially for fans of The Behemoth.At the time of this review the game is in early access and only contains about 1-2 hours of campaign, but there is much more to do after you've finished what's been released so far.Pit People is an easily accessible, turn-based, tactical/strategy game. In the campaign you start out with a small party of weird-o heroes who traverse an open world searching for quests, loot, revenge, and fighters. As you progress you are able to capture enemies and collect gear to add to your armory, giving you the chance to fine tune your party into a ruthless quad-killing machine.After completing what's available of the main story line you and your party are given free reign of the world. As you grab more fighters and gear you're encouraged to put them to the test in the pit where your party is pitted against ""unfair AI"" or other players online.The campaign and side quests are brimming with moxie. This whole game is just full of it, even the environment dances to the upbeat soundtrack.PROS:-Local and online CO-OP-Online multiplayer VS-Fantastic hex turn-based combat-AI brawling-Easy to access, difficult to master-HIlarious-RPG-ish elements that get the ""ooo! numbers going up!"" part of your brain tingling-Lots of stuff to collect-Lots of stuff to explore-Insane difficult mode-Ability to refuse space-bear's commands and not dieCONS:-It's in early access, but some minor UI issues.-At this point in time the campaign is very short, but you're getting it for cheap and there is so much more to do than the campaign.In conclusion:If you love Behemoth games and want to play it now, get it, it's worth it and in a completely playable state. If you don't like the idea of a short campaign maybe purchase it now at the lowered price and leave it in your backlog until the whole game is released.			"

Early Access Review
								Yes.I already loved the style, humor and battle gameplay of this game, but the ""capture new recruits"" mechanic of the game sealed the deal for me. The game can be played almost entirely with a regular mouse and this is a huge plus for me. You do have to tweak the controls a bit though and I would have prefered if the mouse 3 button could be used to end the turn by default (instead of just space) but this could still change of course if there is enough demand for it. It's still a little rough around the edges (eg. menu control feels a bit clunky to me with mouse) but this is to be expected for an early access title and is subject to change. Still, it already plays like a finished product and the fact that things will still improve is very, very promising.Overall I think Pit People is a really fun game with loads of more potential. I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid of early access.			"

								Been looking frward to Pit People for a while and so far have not been disappointed despite it's current EA status. I've mainly been playing co-op with a friend and honestly it's been a blast!I don't want to give too many spoilers, however the narrator explanations are some of the most entertaining voice acting I've heard in a long time and drips with Behemoth humour.Can't comment a whole lot on the single player experience but with a friend it's fun to have the ability to yell ""save my cupcake!!"" and have it actually be of intrinsic value to the combat at hand.So to conclude; If you enjoyed the humour of Castle Crashers, Battleblock Theater etc and have a penchant for turn based strategy games, and definitely so if you have a friend that shares these things, give this one a go and you too can be overly protective of confectionary.

								For me personally this might be Behemoth's best game so far. Granted they've only had 4 games, Alien Hominid, Castle Crashers, Battleblock Theater, and now Pit People. The humor is like those games but at its best. The narrator brings so much to the game surprisingly. The art style is the typical Behemoth artstyle and looks great as usual. Now, this is Early Access as of this review and the main story is not complete. It'll take you only about an hour an a half, maybe 2, to complete. However it takes a lot of different gameplay mechanics from other games that greatly increase the game's life outside of the story. The combat is like Fire Emblem or Xcom (more like Fire Emblem) where it's turnbased strategy, a sort of rock-paper-scissors mechanic of maces good against helmets, etc. Similar to many classic JRPG's there is a world map to roam and explore, where you can encounter many different types of enemy parties. Like Darkest Dungeon and Xcom, there is a base and like Darkest Dungeon, you have a choice of different, random missions that you can buy provisions for before setting out on the mission. And lastly, like Pokemon, you can capture and collect enemies and use them in your party. Now, many of these mechanics are like those of some Rogue-likes however this is not a rogue-like. If a character dies, they go back to town instead of perma-death. Along the early access path it would be nice to see a hardcore mode with permadeath in it. So far it is a great game and fifteen bucks is more than worth it.			"

								This game isn't finished yet, but I absolutely love this game to bits. This Pokèmon-like turn-based game has characters that are very unique, from a giant bear in space with star nipples that crashed into Earth to a cupcake that was once an army officer. The characters have a huge amount of customizable features and even limited customizations from other Behemoth games (I got a Hatty Hattington head from BattleBlock Theater). And to top it all off, we have the icing on the cake that we call Will Stamper. I definitely recommend this game.			"

								Im going to start with, Im super biased with behemoth games, I personally love their games, and I normally don't like turn-based games, but this game made me enjoy it. But it doesn't come perfect, and since its in early release, there are some bugs, and glitches. I was using a logitech controller, and when I went into my house to select a new sexy hat I got, the button indicators (those big green A's and the Big Red B's) were flashing around from Ps4 controls, to xbox and back and forth. I switched to my xbox 360 controller and everythin was good. Still even with that tiny problem I encountered, for a early access game, its pretty well done.

Early Access Review
								Yes.I already loved the style, humor and battle gameplay of this game, but the ""capture new recruits"" mechanic of the game sealed the deal for me. The game can be played almost entirely with a regular mouse and this is a huge plus for me. You do have to tweak the controls a bit though and I would have prefered if the mouse 3 button could be used to end the turn by default (instead of just space) but this could still change of course if there is enough demand for it. It's still a little rough around the edges (eg. menu control feels a bit clunky to me with mouse) but this is to be expected for an early access title and is subject to change. Still, it already plays like a finished product and the fact that things will still improve is very, very promising.Overall I think Pit People is a really fun game with loads of more potential. I recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid of early access.			"

								Another gem from the behemoth! This time, it's a turn-based RPG. You can recruit enimies, fight in an area, continue on with the story, complete quests, and so much more! Without saying much, I'll just say that it's worth a try. It's a pretty solid game considering it's in early access. Just... Don't expect anything serious. I mean, it's the Behemoth, what else would you expect? :P			"

Early Access Review
								I'll write this review from the point of view of a dedicated RTS and RTT games. I reckon the items and strategic elements in this game are many, and that allows for a wide array of tactics depending in your taste and personal strategy. For instance, there are not just shields, swords, maces or damage per se. There are currently 3 times of shields which work differently from each other, and somewhat realistically enough (i.e. The massive pavise like ones provide no protection in melee but great coverage from ranged damage). There is also the concept of pierce damage and blunt damage, accuracy, and light and heavy armour with related maluses. Apart from unit customisation and the related strategy, there are also different races you can pick from. So far I have seen apart from humans: spider like humanoids called spidaurs, robots, vampires in a half human giant bat form (vampires), hair trolls, cyclops, mushrooms (yes lol), small jawa like lads that come in 2 for each slot*, fairies, cupcakes, wraiths and zombies. I guess I missed some, and several might be added later. *Slots are what determines how many fighters you can have in your team. You start with 4 open slots and can unlock 2 more easily enough early in the game. Not all races take the same amount of slots. Cyclops and trolls take 2 slots each, the jawa like gnomes take 1 but come in a couple. Of course that means the unit taking more or less slots is proportionately stronger or weaker. As a player of Total War, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Age of Empire titles I can't whine about what the game says it is offering. I'm actually very satisfied of the diversity that they put into the game. The humour is very likeable, and so is the story. A more detailed review will come as the game is fully released. Overall for its price I would rated it less than 10/10.			"

								Been loving the game so much so far. I love the game. Some things that I think would make the gamplay better are:- Add some upgrades for your caravan (Permanent speed upgrade, faster reload, a spray that attracts and repels monsters, larger caravan to be able to store more items)- Need more late game items or things that you can buy (Call in the bear to bring you home, xp booster)- I would also love to see a monster tracker, something to locate certain monsters- I love the way when you collect coins the sound goes higher, but it would be cool if there was a bonus for getting a bunch of coins in a row. Maybe double coins for 30 secs or something like that- Customizable tournament against AI and alone- A quest to find a bunch of pieces, and it ends up creating a portal that brings you to a 1 time dimension ( doesn't have to be 1 time use, maybe you need to charge it everytime) and has lots of monsters and/or loot, but has very difficult monsters- Random events that can go on in your world (Monster Frenzy, Monster Horde, Gold Rush, Raining Somthing)- Random traps that you can fall in and bring you to a cavern with lots of monsters- Random healing/reviving fountains around the map- A way to explore the map and reveal locations and then create a mapI know this game is in Early Access, but it has a lot of potential and I love how it is going so far. I've made it to the top 10 in the tournament (I know I'll lose it soon). I wasn't sure where to add this so I just made it a review. If you guys are taking recommendations, sorry for posting this. Hope you guys read this and maybe add some things!Thanks for spending 5 minutes of your day reading this and hope you have a good rest of your day! "

								PRO: The first 10 hours are GREAT. I loved it.Lots of fun. Unique writing, entertaining, fun to learn the mechanics. CONS: After the first 10 hours, things start to feel repetitive and grindy.You are battling for rep and to unlock cosmetic changes to your characters.Every once in awhile you might unlock something that makes your character stronger.OBSERVATIONS: The cosmetic content unlocks, purchasing quests, and posting REP for all to see feel like necessary add-ons to keep people returning to the game once the original content and new discovery feeling wears off. I haven't tried out the multiplayer, but its not a draw for me. Although I love the game , Behemoth, and I'm happy to support them with my purchase, my 9 year old who LOVES all of the other Behemoth games doesn't even want to try the game out. I fear they missed the biggest consumer age group that drives their sales with this game. Here's hoping they are working on Castle Crashers 2 or Battle Block Theater 2 because this title might cause a huge problem for the studio if they don't come up with some way to draw in the younger players.I don't feel drawn to play the game repeatedly like I was with Castle Crashers or Battle Block Theater. Most of the replay value of those games were the easter eggs, leveling, and my son pushing me to play with him. The fact that he doesn't want to play this game at all means it won't get much use, which bothers me because I REALLY want this studio to succeed. "

You battle humans and creatures in a tactical system. Collect gear and weapons, and capture said creatures to fight for you in later battles. If you have some money to spare, buy the game. It will keep you occupied for hours. The developers actually listen to the fanbase, and on top of all of this: There's an actual fun PvP and CO-OP system. What can you say? Well, The Behemoth delivered a fantastic CO-OP, PvP, online game once again!			"

								Im going to start with, Im super biased with behemoth games, I personally love their games, and I normally don't like turn-based games, but this game made me enjoy it. But it doesn't come perfect, and since its in early release, there are some bugs, and glitches. I was using a logitech controller, and when I went into my house to select a new sexy hat I got, the button indicators (those big green A's and the Big Red B's) were flashing around from Ps4 controls, to xbox and back and forth. I switched to my xbox 360 controller and everythin was good. Still even with that tiny problem I encountered, for a early access game, its pretty well done.

And once you start getting comfortable, you start seeing the strategy unfold as you pick your team and move around the field, testing different uit comps and synergies.

Pit People is a turn based game on hexagons... and I was kinda worried aswell when i first saw the hexagon because I thought it would ruin the game but when I started playing it, I was in love. The game is still in early access so the game isnt fully complete, however the game is still so fun. I beat the story already so I just started to get the achievements, level up all my guys, and try to get an awesome team. Anyways this game is amazing and the price is good for what you get, you should definitly get the game! <3 to Behemeth.			"

Early Access Review
								Without a doubt, this is one of the best RPGs I've played in a long while – the art and animation is hilarious and distinctive, the combat is simple but incredibly addictive, the writing is absolutely brilliant, and the music is just really damn funky. To top it all off, it's got a hilarious narrator in the form of StamperTV as a giant space bear, who I think has done some great voice-over in other Behemoth games. There are just so many little details crammed in, like the rainbow unicorn creatures leaving a poo trail as they drag their arses along the ground, to the cord of the giant space phone that you use for multiplayer co-op trailing off into space on the world map, to the fact that the giant space bear actually picks up the whole hub city and moves it to a completely different world map at random now and then just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. Yes, none of that will make sense until you play it. Please do.Worth noting is the fact that, as an early-access game, the actual main story is barely there, but Behemoth made up for this by packing in a goldmine of delightfully random side-quests that should keep you going for around 10-20 hours, more if you go all-out on finding all the hidden secrets and recruiting all the potential characters.All in all, if they can make me adore an early-access game this much, then I await the finished product with fear and awe.

								What I've seen so far is great. The game is really well made.Pit people is an turn based strategy game with a world map that seems to be randomly generated.You recruit people to your crew and fight battles with them. You find items, gold and all the usual things to get more powerful and then find even more stuff.For me this formula works and I'm fine with it. I've seen the same ideas used a lot in the past though in Pit people they've made it feel somewhat new.What makes this game great is the gameplay, the graphics, the music. Frankly it couldn't be better. I absolutely love the funky characters and the edgy music.The only bad thing I've found so far is the UI that's downright confusing.			"

								I'll write this review from the point of view of a dedicated RTS and RTT games. I reckon the items and strategic elements in this game are many, and that allows for a wide array of tactics depending in your taste and personal strategy. For instance, there are not just shields, swords, maces or damage per se. There are currently 3 times of shields which work differently from each other, and somewhat realistically enough (i.e. The massive pavise like ones provide no protection in melee but great coverage from ranged damage). There is also the concept of pierce damage and blunt damage, accuracy, and light and heavy armour with related maluses. Apart from unit customisation and the related strategy, there are also different races you can pick from. So far I have seen apart from humans: spider like humanoids called spidaurs, robots, vampires in a half human giant bat form (vampires), hair trolls, cyclops, mushrooms (yes lol), small jawa like lads that come in 2 for each slot*, fairies, cupcakes, wraiths and zombies. I guess I missed some, and several might be added later. *Slots are what determines how many fighters you can have in your team. You start with 4 open slots and can unlock 2 more easily enough early in the game. Not all races take the same amount of slots. Cyclops and trolls take 2 slots each, the jawa like gnomes take 1 but come in a couple. Of course that means the unit taking more or less slots is proportionately stronger or weaker. As a player of Total War, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Age of Empire titles I can't whine about what the game says it is offering. I'm actually very satisfied of the diversity that they put into the game. The humour is very likeable, and so is the story. A more detailed review will come as the game is fully released. Overall for its price I would rated it less than 10/10.			"

								Been loving the game so much so far. I love the game. Some things that I think would make the gamplay better are:- Add some upgrades for your caravan (Permanent speed upgrade, faster reload, a spray that attracts and repels monsters, larger caravan to be able to store more items)- Need more late game items or things that you can buy (Call in the bear to bring you home, xp booster)- I would also love to see a monster tracker, something to locate certain monsters- I love the way when you collect coins the sound goes higher, but it would be cool if there was a bonus for getting a bunch of coins in a row. Maybe double coins for 30 secs or something like that- Customizable tournament against AI and alone- A quest to find a bunch of pieces, and it ends up creating a portal that brings you to a 1 time dimension ( doesn't have to be 1 time use, maybe you need to charge it everytime) and has lots of monsters and/or loot, but has very difficult monsters- Random events that can go on in your world (Monster Frenzy, Monster Horde, Gold Rush, Raining Somthing)- Random traps that you can fall in and bring you to a cavern with lots of monsters- Random healing/reviving fountains around the map- A way to explore the map and reveal locations and then create a mapI know this game is in Early Access, but it has a lot of potential and I love how it is going so far. I've made it to the top 10 in the tournament (I know I'll lose it soon). I wasn't sure where to add this so I just made it a review. If you guys are taking recommendations, sorry for posting this. Hope you guys read this and maybe add some things!Thanks for spending 5 minutes of your day reading this and hope you have a good rest of your day! "

The story is a bit lacking at this moment and, i see a lot of people giving it a negative review for this reason, but this is an early access game more will be added to the story likely over the next few months so this is no reason not to recommend this. That being said if you were expecting it to already be complete you will likely be dissapointed, but rest easy knowing that you will get a more full experience eventually.			"

								Pit People is an amazing, sarcastic turned based strategy game from the creators of Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theater. Quirky characters, hilarious dialogue, and the game play itself will keep you entertained for hours on end. Plus, the amount of characters you can recruit in game and the countless ways you can style them through in game items is endless. The fights are challenging enough to ensure you are properly building teams to suit your play style, but easy enough where you aren't fleeing each match out of frustration or fear.Pit People is a must - and I am excited to see it come out of Early Access in the future!The only 'critiques' is that some of the abilities in game aren't always tutorialized (how to drop poop to find your way home, using the gun on the wagon, various other in game abilities that you just kind of 'learn' over time), and another concern with co-op. In co-op mode, it makes it difficult for both players to choose their actions at the same time as the map auto zooms or allows your mouse to zoom to other locations. This has resulted in my co-op buddies and I just taking turns, and once they confirm their strategy then I make my moves and end the turn. There should be the ability to zoom out the map entirely.

								Those maniacs at The Behemoth have done it again! Using their signature style of whimsically stupid Newgrounds-like animation, they've created an enthralling narrative about a blueberry farmer living in the post-apocalypse created by the aftermath of BattleBlock Theater and the four-armed sociopathic bear deity that wants nothing more than to royally screw with him and his friends!It's also worth mentioning that this is the greatest turn-based strategy game I've ever played! Never before have I been so taken aback by commiting bucket-head genocide in grid-based fashion as I have with this game!It's more-than-likely also worth mentioning that this is the weirdest turn-based strategy game I've ever played! Never before have I been so taken aback by watching a cupcake feed itself to death to heal a team of bandits that it doesn't even like!			"

								I don't write many reviews, because I really don't have the time or desire to be a part-time games journalist (for free).  But, this is one of the most objectively FUN games I've played in a long time.  Combat is a blast, the narrator is great and interjects at just the right time to add flavor to a kill (""That's fair.....I guess.""), and there are so many combinations to make battlegroups out of.  While the loot varies mostly as cosmetic alterations of core types, you still get a feeling that you're constantly winning something.  The locations and character names are hilarious, and I've already gotten a warning from my wife that I have to make sure my son isn't around when I'm playing (apparently she doesn't want him saying ""Rumptrumpet"" at school).I'm not great at adding funny things to reviews, but I'd give this game a solid 10/10, would recommend friends buy it again.

								I may have only played this game for 2.5 hours, but this game is extremely addicting.If you enjoy strategic, action role-playing games with friends, then this game would be perfect for you.If you enjoy local co-op games, this game is amazing with another person, it is next to impossible for this game to become boring with a friend.The story is hilarious, and you can even battle with other people online, which is an amazing feature.The voice acting by Stamper is, as always, ridiculously funny.The style of animation makes the game 10x more interesting.I can never skip a cutscene, literally all cutscenes are funny and amazing.Allthough the camera angles can get wonky, I give this game a 10/10 "

								Pit People is without a single doubt the best tactics RPG I have played in a long time. The game has all sorts of content and there will actually be more of it since it is in Early Access at the time of this review. The multiplayer is one of the most balanced of today's games and the sounds and music is top notchThe game is not without it's flaws. Because units are programmed to have minds of their own, they sometime attack certain enemies when they're suppose to attack other high-priority targets. Also, some quests have at least 3x the number of enemy untis as your army of up to six units, which creates unnecessary chaos.Overall, I highly recommend getting Pit People. It has the makings of a potential GotY candidate.			"

Fast-paced Turn-based Fun Place!What's this? The Behemoth, the creators of my favorite beat-em-up and one of my favorite platformers, made a turn-based game? Sign me up!I'm a fan of turn-based games with RPG elements: the Fallout games by Interplay, Wasteland, Fire Emblem, the works. Seeing this game annouced, I was a little skeptical. Specifically, about the co-op features. Many turn-based games with co-op have each player move individually. But I'll be beaten down with a rubber hose filled with frozen custard if The Behemoth didn't make it work.I can easily compare the gameplay to Fire Emblem, but boiled down to what's important. No faffing about with the weapon triangle for Pit People! Bigger weapons do more damage but weigh more. Archers aren't effective at close range. Maces work better on armored foes. Ultimately, the secret to success is how you position your soldiers on the field. Different squads can mesh together in different ways, allowing for interesting stratigies that work for you.The humor is nothing new if you've played Behemoth's previous, with the glorious glorious voice of Stamper, the narrator in Battleblock Theatre, making a return as the narrator. This time around he's made out to be super sarcastic and passive-aggressive towards the protagonists. It's truly a joy to behold the dialouge. But as they say, the devil's in the details. Pit People has a lot of tiny details that make it much more enjoyable. For example, each unit type has a special entry corralating to them. And the entries are just an absolute joy.This game is a-okay in my book!			"

Early Access Review
								Just what you'd expect from The Behemoth. This game is amazing! Despite it being early access and in reality there is very little to it right now, I've had a lot of fun with it.IF YOU BUY THIS EARLY, DO KNOW THAT THERE IS ONLY THE GENERAL SET OF TUTORIAL QUESTS AND WHAT FEELS LIKE ONLY 1 REAL STORY QUEST. Most of my time playing has been spent just grinding out battles in order to level up my team, otherwise there really isn't much else to do other than the Unfair Pit and repeatable bonus missions. The Unfair Pit seems quite fun, but even with a full team of above level 20's I barely made it past round 1 and it could also be noted that I'm probably not amazing at the game anyway. As far as random encounters go, I feel like it would be nice to see even more variety in some of the enemies. There are a few different races you encounter throughout the game, but the only difference between characters of the same race are there helmets mostly and even then it really isn't all that crazy. Each race of character has their own style of attacking and special attributes, and there are actually quite a few different races, but after playing for awhile I would either get a lack of variety in the enemies I was facing or cool races just wouldn't show up at all. This game is early access so I wasn't expecting it to be all together or anywhere near a complete game. I've had a lot of fun with the game so far, but until its full releases I don't think I'll be playing too much now. I absolutely recommend getting this game now while it's cheaper though. It is an insane amount of fun and it's only in early access so it can only get better from here.			"

I've been a fan of The Behemoth since Castle Crashers, and it was probably my favorite game, until Pit People came out. Although the game is still in early access, there are so many other things to do, and just going around capturing the many creatures is pretty fun. I highly recommend this game to any fan of The Behemoth, or just anyone in general.			"

Everything about this game seems polished to me and I have yet to encounter any bugs.so far the gameplay seems to closley relate to the Fire Emblem games  in the way that you can position and level up each unit. of course this a Behmoth game so the comedy and art style are simmilar to past instalments such as Castle Crashers and Battle Block Theater. I'm in love with this game and i can not wait till further updates to the game.  "

I think the characters and weapons are funny as hell and it really feels complete. However, because it's still early access there's barely any story so I'm hoping that comes soon. Even without the story the game can still be played a lot, there's a ton of quests and items to get. If you still have your doubts It's a behemoth game, of course you should buy it, every game they made I've spent countless hours on already. INSTA BUY!			"

Product received for free
Early Access Review
								So a friend of mine wanted to play a game together with me, and having exhausted many options already he caught sight of Pit People while Strippin was playing it.  Excited he picked it up and chucked me a free copy, and then we tackled the game at the same time.To put it simply as the game stands now I definitely recommend it.  When it's a finished product I can only expect it to be significantly more fulfilling than the current rendition, which is already a good time to be had.  Now for a bit more detail...First and foremost this game is in Early Access and as of this review it has very little story missions to progress through.  There are plentiful sidequests on the maps, and a few side missions attached to the Quest Board in town, but Story Missions?  Almost none.  So if you're looking for the full game...wait a bit?Technically speaking this game is solid.  I've had zero crashes and almost no glitches to speak of.  I'm currently running Update 1(Beta) and that hasn't even generated any instability.  All in all a good bunch of programming.That isn't to say that the game is without bugs.  I've seen a few others complain about some that have popped up here and there. However...Behemoth seems to actually pay attention to the players.  I've seen an actual attempt by the staff to try and help those who are having problems with the game.  That's quite refreshing compared to what feels like cold, mechanical assistance from most bigger named and bigger budgeted companies.So the game is pretty good overall in terms of stability.  But how is it as a GAME?It's a turn-based strategy game with a plethora of various units and equipments for said units.  Each type of unit you can use has a weakness you can exploit, but you won't always face off against what you might want to which means you need flexibility in your loadout and playstyle.In terms of actual difficulty you'll find it to be sitting close to that sweet spot.  You can beat the opponents but they can get quite hard to handle if you're not paying attention.  My favorite thing, however, is that even if you're against something that is designed to beat you you won't automatically lose.  This isn't Rock/Paper/Scissors, and so weaknesses don't cripple you so much as merely hurt you.If you like turn-based stategy games you'll probably get a kick out of this.  If you hate them because they're too slow Pit People has a slightly faster pace than you might expect, so maybe check a video of a fight from the game.  If you simply hate strategy games even then this game might interest you due to the humor and art style.Also, yes, the music is awesome.			"

								I'm excited to see the limited amount of content grow. Behemoth has always done a great job putting together unique games with their own sense of humor and style. As of early access, they still deliever with their signature style. The art of Dan Paladin is ever present. Simple, humorous, delightful. There were a few times the art was pixelated but I'm sure that'll be fixed. Some of it (art, map, UI) feels a bit overly busy. As far as content, UI, and fighting system, alot needs to be worked on. The fighting system is simple but shallow and there's two story missions along with a few side quests. I imagine over the next year (in which Behemoth works towards release) mechanics and story will be built upon. So if you're buying it now, know you're only going to get a few hours of enjoyment at first. But if you believe the track record of the Behemoth team and their wonderfully unique spirit, it's worth to get the game now and support the team!			"

The Behemoth have made a fantastic game that hasn't even left Early Access yet. I personally like the Capture system and level of customization the game's characters are offered. But the game is not without its flaws. The camera feels like it zooms in too much at times, mostly during battle. An option to place the camera at a set viewpoint would be appreciated. But, as this is in Early Access, I can excuse it. 9.75/10			"

I've had a lot of fun with the game so far, but until its full releases I don't think I'll be playing too much now. I absolutely recommend getting this game now while it's cheaper though. It is an insane amount of fun and it's only in early access so it can only get better from here.			"

								Another great game by the Behemoth. The main mission is short (because it's early access), but that's made up by replayable missions and extra missions you can find throughout the world. The character customization is great and I definitely enjoy the collecting aspect. Overall a great game.			"

								Just what you'd expect from The Behemoth. This game is amazing! Despite it being early access and in reality there is very little to it right now, I've had a lot of fun with it.IF YOU BUY THIS EARLY, DO KNOW THAT THERE IS ONLY THE GENERAL SET OF TUTORIAL QUESTS AND WHAT FEELS LIKE ONLY 1 REAL STORY QUEST. Most of my time playing has been spent just grinding out battles in order to level up my team, otherwise there really isn't much else to do other than the Unfair Pit and repeatable bonus missions. The Unfair Pit seems quite fun, but even with a full team of above level 20's I barely made it past round 1 and it could also be noted that I'm probably not amazing at the game anyway. As far as random encounters go, I feel like it would be nice to see even more variety in some of the enemies. There are a few different races you encounter throughout the game, but the only difference between characters of the same race are there helmets mostly and even then it really isn't all that crazy. Each race of character has their own style of attacking and special attributes, and there are actually quite a few different races, but after playing for awhile I would either get a lack of variety in the enemies I was facing or cool races just wouldn't show up at all. This game is early access so I wasn't expecting it to be all together or anywhere near a complete game.

								I don't write many reviews, because I really don't have the time or desire to be a part-time games journalist (for free).  But, this is one of the most objectively FUN games I've played in a long time.  Combat is a blast, the narrator is great and interjects at just the right time to add flavor to a kill (""That's fair.....I guess.""), and there are so many combinations to make battlegroups out of.  While the loot varies mostly as cosmetic alterations of core types, you still get a feeling that you're constantly winning something.  The locations and character names are hilarious, and I've already gotten a warning from my wife that I have to make sure my son isn't around when I'm playing (apparently she doesn't want him saying ""Rumptrumpet"" at school).I'm not great at adding funny things to reviews, but I'd give this game a solid 10/10, would recommend friends buy it again.

Yet since its a early access game it still feels like a lot of content is missing, but hoping the developers will add more soon.This game though does have enough content to keep you entertained and playing for hours.Short answer is just buy it. 15$ doesnt hurt anybody and this is a great fun game to pass the time,Note: havent seen or have any bugs or crashes in the game yet.

								I generally don't enjoy strategy games. I'm bad at them and can never figure out how to improve. Still I bought this game because I like Behemoth and it looked fun. What surprised me the most going into this game was how much fun you can have even playing single-player. Since I'm awful at strategy games this is something I enjoyed a lot to mess around with. Catching new gladiators Pokemon style and playing dress up with equipment is more fun than I ever thought it would be.I strongly recommend this game to people who usually are not fan of strategy games but feel like giving one a go once in awhile. There's a lot of fun to be had in this game.			"

If you like The Behemoth than you'll like this but if you're really on edge wait a while until more content is added because it will just want to lusting for more.p			"

You can capture creatures and collect loot out in the overworld, but also watch out for this pillars with a red button on them (they turn green after you touch them), they might do something. The best Behemoth game ever created. I'm sure the finished product will be even better.			"

								Highly recommended, especially for fans of The Behemoth.At the time of this review the game is in early access and only contains about 1-2 hours of campaign, but there is much more to do after you've finished what's been released so far.Pit People is an easily accessible, turn-based, tactical/strategy game. In the campaign you start out with a small party of weird-o heroes who traverse an open world searching for quests, loot, revenge, and fighters. As you progress you are able to capture enemies and collect gear to add to your armory, giving you the chance to fine tune your party into a ruthless quad-killing machine.After completing what's available of the main story line you and your party are given free reign of the world. As you grab more fighters and gear you're encouraged to put them to the test in the pit where your party is pitted against ""unfair AI"" or other players online.The campaign and side quests are brimming with moxie. This whole game is just full of it, even the environment dances to the upbeat soundtrack.PROS:-Local and online CO-OP-Online multiplayer VS-Fantastic hex turn-based combat-AI brawling-Easy to access, difficult to master-HIlarious-RPG-ish elements that get the ""ooo! numbers going up!"" part of your brain tingling-Lots of stuff to collect-Lots of stuff to explore-Insane difficult mode-Ability to refuse space-bear's commands and not dieCONS:-It's in early access, but some minor UI issues.-At this point in time the campaign is very short, but you're getting it for cheap and there is so much more to do than the campaign.In conclusion:If you love Behemoth games and want to play it now, get it, it's worth it and in a completely playable state. If you don't like the idea of a short campaign maybe purchase it now at the lowered price and leave it in your backlog until the whole game is released.			"

								A game made by the people who made Castle Crashers and Battleblock theater, comes Pit PeoplePit people is a hexgonal turn-based strategy game, the twist here is that your units attack units on their own free-will, meaning that positioning is extremely important.The art-style is simple but incredibly effective, being extremely colorful, vibrant, and having everything and everyone popout, every item is different in terms of art design and every character is memorable.The gameplay is deceptively simple, but heavily rooted in complicated strategies, team compositions and even gear distribution, luckily, the team at Behemoth were able to make this game pretty easy to learn and play, but difficult to master.My main problem with the game are relatively simple ones, first, the inability to scroll out the map can be problematic sometimes, especially against a full team against a full team, another problem is that the gear that you obtain rarely differ against each other, I would like to have like very small differences, but differences none the less (I want my throwing straws to deal more damage than Yusef's default axes xD) Thirdly, some of the non-human party members are limited in their apperal, I would like that to be changed, it would be awesome to have a whole group of kobolds wearing hats and wielding chicken drums hehe.Besides that, I would reccomend this game for many people, Behemoth fans, hexagon-turn based Strategists, normal people to give this a try, despite it being an early access game, its well polished and no doubt will be absolutely amazing when it finally releases.

								PRO: The first 10 hours are GREAT. I loved it.Lots of fun. Unique writing, entertaining, fun to learn the mechanics. CONS: After the first 10 hours, things start to feel repetitive and grindy.You are battling for rep and to unlock cosmetic changes to your characters.Every once in awhile you might unlock something that makes your character stronger.OBSERVATIONS: The cosmetic content unlocks, purchasing quests, and posting REP for all to see feel like necessary add-ons to keep people returning to the game once the original content and new discovery feeling wears off. I haven't tried out the multiplayer, but its not a draw for me. Although I love the game , Behemoth, and I'm happy to support them with my purchase, my 9 year old who LOVES all of the other Behemoth games doesn't even want to try the game out. I fear they missed the biggest consumer age group that drives their sales with this game. Here's hoping they are working on Castle Crashers 2 or Battle Block Theater 2 because this title might cause a huge problem for the studio if they don't come up with some way to draw in the younger players.I don't feel drawn to play the game repeatedly like I was with Castle Crashers or Battle Block Theater. Most of the replay value of those games were the easter eggs, leveling, and my son pushing me to play with him. The fact that he doesn't want to play this game at all means it won't get much use, which bothers me because I REALLY want this studio to succeed. "

								Fantastic game. A simple mechanic with great tactical depth, but the real selling point is the aesthetic and the humour. Pit Peoples art and audio are beautiful. The Narrator in the early story missions sold it for me. The main story is quite short at this point, but it makes up for it with quality in writing and execution. Don't let that put you off though. Theres plenty of humerous sidequests and collectibles to keep you busy.			"

								This game is fantastic. It's amazing, totally great. The first thing you'll witness as you start the game is the amazing music it caress your moist ears with, after that you'll be thrown into a world built on the core of top notch humour. You battle humans and creatures in a tactical system. Collect gear and weapons, and capture said creatures to fight for you in later battles. If you have some money to spare, buy the game. It will keep you occupied for hours. The developers actually listen to the fanbase, and on top of all of this: There's an actual fun PvP and CO-OP system. What can you say? Well, The Behemoth delivered a fantastic CO-OP, PvP, online game once again!			"

								I absolutely love this game, and I will always recommend Behemoth games.This is a turn based strategy game, as you may know.You may also know that this is in Early Access, so I will keep that in mind when I state my opinion.Pros:-The game is very fun, even in its early development days.-This game is comedic and fun, as all the Behemoth games are.-This game is a great breath of fresh air; its hard to find a good game with a fighting style similar to a turn based hex game.-Get similar to Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theatre out of your head; this is only similar in art and graphics.-So far, I have found no bugs whatsoever, which is amazing, considering this is in Early Access.Cons:-Some of the menus are unintuitive and hard to browse through, such as the character accessory and selection menus in the house at the city. The menus are also a bit confusing at times. This is my biggest annoyance.-I'm typing this while in game, and I have no idea how to save unless it saves automatically.-Fighting can become a nuisance at times with the battling strategies. Theres no real guide to show you what everything does or reminders, you just kinda have to remember everything.-The online system is a bit wonky and needs tweaking.There aren't many cons, but the cons listed really Bees my Movie. And if it all came down to it, yes. Yes you should buy this game. Immediately. It is so much fun beyond belief.			"

Fast-paced Turn-based Fun Place!What's this? The Behemoth, the creators of my favorite beat-em-up and one of my favorite platformers, made a turn-based game? Sign me up!I'm a fan of turn-based games with RPG elements: the Fallout games by Interplay, Wasteland, Fire Emblem, the works. Seeing this game annouced, I was a little skeptical. Specifically, about the co-op features. Many turn-based games with co-op have each player move individually. But I'll be beaten down with a rubber hose filled with frozen custard if The Behemoth didn't make it work.I can easily compare the gameplay to Fire Emblem, but boiled down to what's important. No faffing about with the weapon triangle for Pit People! Bigger weapons do more damage but weigh more. Archers aren't effective at close range. Maces work better on armored foes. Ultimately, the secret to success is how you position your soldiers on the field. Different squads can mesh together in different ways, allowing for interesting stratigies that work for you.The humor is nothing new if you've played Behemoth's previous, with the glorious glorious voice of Stamper, the narrator in Battleblock Theatre, making a return as the narrator. This time around he's made out to be super sarcastic and passive-aggressive towards the protagonists. It's truly a joy to behold the dialouge. But as they say, the devil's in the details. Pit People has a lot of tiny details that make it much more enjoyable. For example, each unit type has a special entry corralating to them. And the entries are just an absolute joy.This game is a-okay in my book!			"

								Amazing turn based gameplay, character build variety and customization, and a large variety of species to catch and use to create different team comps to use in missions and pvp. The comedic style in this game has made me laugh more than I ever have at any game. For an early access game, it's already worth much more to me than $15. The in game market could use some work, but that's the only negative thing i've found so far. I really hope this game gets the player base it deserves.			"

Early Access Review
								The Behemoth is back!I've been a huge fan of this studio since Newgrounds, have played everything they have developed up to this point, and I have to say that Pit People is turning out to be one of the best efforts they have ever made. Castle Crashers was amazing for unlocks and playing through multiple times to find all of the nuances and secrets lying underneath, but after 30-40 hours you have done and seen most of what the game has to offer. Pit People is so different in that aspect, as there are literally 1,000+ items to unlock, a multitude of different characters and species to ""recruit"", and a billion reasons to sink your time into this game.As Early Access, the game gives you a very limited view of what is in store for the main story experience, but it vastly makes up for this with an addictive but accessible PVP and super-hard Co-Op pit mode. Not to mention the huge open world that seems to have a lot to discover, and plenty of creatures to add to your team as mentioned before.There are a few noticable and jarring UI problems with this game. For one, a lot of the stat management and overviews for characters are incredibly subtle. At first, I had no idea that leveling your recruits mattered. There's no representation of your stats growing or what the growth per individual species would be. You'll especially notice this once you recruit a Mascot species type, as their attack damage on the stats page reads a huge number above all other species, but they merely buff other characters and don't do the damage stated on their page. There needs to be more ways to differenciate between the different Clops or Humans you recruit, as well as stat comparison to someone you're wanting to swap in on your team before taking on PvP or the World Map. The UI is also very difficult to manage with a mouse + keyboard. I have been playing most of this game with the Steam Controller, and I find that method of play to be a lot more enjoyable. Playing on my laptop with a mouse and keyboard, or even my main PC, was a challenge. There's no visual feedback when you're nearing the edge of the screen in the main hub for bulding selections other than a ""click your mouse"" prompt, and you usually find yourself running between buildings often trying to make a simple selection. There are plenty of other examples of the UI being incredibly clunky and vague, like the Quest Selection page before you depart to the world. I had to take a few moments to grasp what they wanted me to do.I've put a good amount of hours into this game so far, and I cannot wait to see what they bring to the table with it. Definitely one of the better Early Access titles I have ever played. I see this game having such potential for updates, maybe little DLC packs for new character stories or mission packs. Hell, maybe even release these quarterly for free. I can also see a potential competitive scene emerging from this game once all the balancing has been ironed out, and most of the gameplay has been tweaked a bit.I will update this review when the game goes live, but I would highly recommend you buy this if you are on the fence about it. I would say 80% of the game is there, and what is included is well worth the $15 asking price.To the Pits!			"

								positives- story and narration fantastic and really funny- combat satisfying and well fleshed out- challenging enough that you don't just walk through it- really active developer who listens to the community for feedback- lots of different species/class types- plenty of customisation (over 1000 items)- Local multiplayer (finally a game has this)- really good co-op online multiplayer- no bugs or technical issues (so far)- music refreshing and there is enough for it not to become repetitivenegatives- early access is a tainted word as there so many games that have never left it and therefore (although i have hope) i fear this game may possibly befall the fate of so many others and never leave- main story really short so far (january 2017) however there are many quests- slight imbalance between classes/species (this only annoys me due to a multiplayer PvP mode)- I personally do not particularlly like the UI In conclusion this game is a must have and (although others may disagree) there is enough content currently and the developer will add more as the early access development continues.

Early Access Review
								This is an amazing game right now, but there are some major areas that could use improvment.This review will only be listing the flaws, but rest assured, it earns that positive rating.-No Zoom in or outThis is vital to nearly all SRPGS, being able to zoom out to see most, if not all of the battle field at all times. This allows for the best and most tactical disicions possible, and give the player all the info they need without hassle.In this game, your constantly looking through bonoculars magnetically taped to your forehead by Stamper with no way of taking them off because of that metal plate you goit in your head.Seriosuly, why did you think that was a good idea?-Not many Varried objectivesMost maps boil down to ""Kill the enemy"". While this is a fine, morally Upstanding goal, it can get a tad boring at times. The few defend and seiges maps work greatat showing the strengths and weaknesses of each race, class, unit, and otherwise.However, when the Maps are almost entirly ""Kill these guys"", it makes some units undeniably better then others, such as Fredrick.Speaking of which...-Fredrick is too PowerfulI though I was done with him when I was finshed with Awakening for the 7th time.I though I had found a game without a ludicrusly Overpowered unit.I was wrong.Fredrick the Cyclops, with his long flowing Magenta hair, Tiny turtle shell sheild, and Nucular Bomb Club, was far too powerful for the rest of my units too keep up. Even taking up two slots wasn't enough to stop this deminsiopn hopping monstrosity. His two move seemd like a reasonable nerf.HA.That was only so the enemies could pickl a god and pray one last time before their inevitable demise.The only map he ever struggled with was the Lumberjack one, and that's 'cuse he hate's lumberjacks and long distances.Nothing could stand up to him, not even other cyclopses.When the undead came crawling, he put them back in the grave. He wasn't afraid to kil. Again and again.It didn't matter that he took damage from his bomb.It didn't even mater that we lacked a healer for most of the game.Fredrick could not be killed.Fredrick could not be stopped.Fredrick was a force of nature.And it wasn't enough he was that strong, he was ALWAYS the one talking too. He was the leader of this rag tag group he called a team. Sure, his ego was about as through the roof as his strength, but he had twice as much bite for every bark you'd even THINK he had.But, as amazing as he is, all good things must end. Fredrick is too overpowered. I'd be happy to see him nerfed, in exchange for seeing him more in the story, with his FLowing purple, deep, muscly voice and suprisingly sensable values.-The terrain sometimes black the veiw of the unitsDespite how massive Fredick is even compared to other cyclopses, there were times where the terrain even obscured HIM. Just making the terrain a unit is standing behind less opaque would solve this issue immediately.-The healers don't heal enough'nuff said. You need two to make them even think about being useful, and even then, that's a slot that could be used to bring ANOTHER cyclops to use with Fredrick.-More unique weaponsI want more weapons that DO things.I love re-skins as much as the next guy, but it can make it hard to tell what some enemies are capable of, and that can SUCK. Besides, it would make getting a new weapon exciting rathen then ""Oh, what's this reskin?""-Sopfia SucksI understand that the ""Capture"" unit shouldn't be a godess. But COME ON, she is SO WEAK compared to everyone else. If she had visable utility outside of capturing, like maybe some abilities to help with defend of seige maps, that might make her useful. But, since every map is ""Kil, Kill, KILL"" she's an active detriment. Besides, once you capture Fredrick, there is no need to capture anyone else, so she becomes useless.-Status effects SuckTheres no point to avaoiding them because they suck so much.-More unique charactersI like how Gluten got his own side quest. I want more units like him, who get some soft of quest to go along with them.I would say restrict the quests so you HAVE to have them in your party, though. For story reasons.-Show more of the other main characters in the storyHoratio and Pimpstella are suprisingly engaging characters, but I felt myself wondering during some of these scenes ""Where's Yslove? Where's Sofia? Where's Glutan? Where's Fredrick?""These are all characters introduced in the main story, but never get any appearences in the main story, and rarely appear in sidequests (Aside from Yslove). Even if they are not present, they should have at least a little more of an impact.-PVP's kinda crapWhen your losing, there's not many ways to ""Win"". Though, this is more of an SRPG problem then just this game, so that's why it's last.-Tell us what our team is strong and weak aginst when we build itThis is more of a request, but I want to see what our team is most effective against and what their weakest to, both Map-wise and Enemy wise. I want to see the game itself acknowledge Fredrick is overpowered. Those purple locks just make him too good.All in all, great game, but I clearly see why it's in early acess.I understand Fredrick must be nerfed, But I'd prefer it done in more clever ways, and to see him intereact more with the story.Good luck on your game development, Gentlemen, And I shall be off!Fredrick, Pull our cart away!

								Watched the closed beta of this game and i instantly fell in love with Pit People. Having high expectations due to the other games of Behemoth and i wasn't disappointed at all. The game currently at the time of me writing this (Jan 18th) is about 2-3 missions long but after you are free to roam and side quests. This game has a lot of potential and im glad I will be able to watch it grow.Do i recommend this game? Of bloody course.			"

								Behemoth is one of the few Devs I would ever consider buying an early access game from. Seriously, these guys are awesome, and so are their games. I've laughed a lot so far, i love the combat, the simple yet compelling strategy, and the party system. ""Recruiting"" lol. Buy it, 100% worth it.			"

								I have been playing The Behemoth games since Alien Hominid first came out...  And i have to say, they have kept the amazing game design since Alien Hominid. Pit People is a turn based game on hexagons... and I was kinda worried aswell when i first saw the hexagon because I thought it would ruin the game but when I started playing it, I was in love. The game is still in early access so the game isnt fully complete, however the game is still so fun. I beat the story already so I just started to get the achievements, level up all my guys, and try to get an awesome team. Anyways this game is amazing and the price is good for what you get, you should definitly get the game! <3 to Behemeth.			"

								Hilarious and fun.  It's a more violent, slightly depraved Pokemon.  There's only the tutorial segment and a single story mission as of this review, but htere are multiple sidequests and an astonishing number of in-world 'bonus quests' to see and do.  I'm at 10 hours played the day after I bought it.  I still want to play it.  8 of those hours were myself and a co-op buddy just wandering around, essentially grinding.  We never noticed - the soundtrack, enemies, names, and just good gameplay held our attention.Overall, I can't recommend this game enough.  The only points against it would be the lack of hard numbers or detailed tooltips on some status effects.  I'd like to know my chance to stun, what exactly a buff increases or a debuff decreases.  I learned that the debuff decreases a target's defense, accuracy, and damage.  I don't know by how much, and I only know what I do from a loading screen tip several hours into the game.It's still one of the best turn-based strategy games made; doubly so if you have a friend to play with.  Show me the numbers to sate my desire for detail and it'll go from 9.5 to 10/10.			"

								This is an inspirational story about a cyclops named Chlorophyllius.One day in the pit, a band of gladiators were in a battle against the unfair enemies. At round 1, 3 of them died. The 2 remaining, Benedict and Chlorophyllius, were placed against almost a dozen opponents. They killed Benedict, and the only one left standing was Chlorophyllius. He then went to avenge his companion, charging into the crowd.Despite the fact that he was extremely outnumbered, Chlorophyllius fought back with all his might and defeated the horde. That's when round 3 started. He knew he had to do this completely alone, and stepped forward. Chlorophyllius fought with all his might, blow after blow, kill after kill.After the dust cleared, there was only 1 gladiator standing.Chlorophyllius.He had prevailed. He didn't know how it happened, but still. He did it.I, however, know how he won.He never gave up.Be like Chlorophyllius and go the extra mile for the greater good.			"

								I wasn't sure what to expect, I'm a huge fan of Castle Crashers & Battleblock Theater, but I'm not a fan of turn based games. This however, is a different story, I love this game, even in early access, it feels EXTRMELEY polished and is a joy to play, both solo and with a friend.There's tons of hilarious items to use, tons of Behemoth humor that I love, and tons of detail to the maps/arenas. As for the gameplay, it feels arcade-y, without losing a smidge of any strategic elements, which is very hard to do. Then there's the 'hub' where they have an Arena, Online, Item Shop, Character/Group Customization, which of course, is dislayed in a humerous style (I wont spoil). The map roaming is perfect for this game, lots of content, lots of things to fight, plenty of quests and side quests to do, none of which are filler. Props to The Behemoth for creating another awesome, masterfully crafted game that I need to recommend!			"

								Absolute marvel! Now, I may be a bit bias since I've been playing Behemoth games when I was about 5 or so, but this game really is good. The comedy never ceases, the gameplay is really cool, although sometimes it can be aggravating to see your team get destroyed completely. For this just being an Early Access, I HIGHLY reccomend buying it now, maybe not just for the game, but for the discounted price! 15 dollars for this is worth it!			"

Early Access Review
								Like all Behemoth's games, Pit People is very polished and it brings something interesting (and funny) to the table. If you have played Castle Crashers or BattleBlock Theater, there are a lot of familiar things you will encounter - art style, humor and the narrator to mention a few.Pit People does not necessarily innovate something new. Rather, it combines mechanics from many popular games and ends up creating quite an interesting result. You will feel the presence of XCOM, Fire Emblem, Skulls of the Shogun or damn, even Pokemon. Most of the time games mixing that many ideas would end up being bad. This is not the case with Pit People - it feels truly original.The combat is plain simple but vast collection of different unit types and items make this game quite strategical. There are endless amount of combos to test and new interesting characters to find.Lastly, I wouldn't be too worried about the Early Access tag on this game. Sure, most of the main story is missing (you can only complete about 5% of it) but there is still a lot to do in this version. There are multiple plot driven side quests to do, units to catch and other players to crush (in online mode). Highly recommend.			"

								Those maniacs at The Behemoth have done it again! Using their signature style of whimsically stupid Newgrounds-like animation, they've created an enthralling narrative about a blueberry farmer living in the post-apocalypse created by the aftermath of BattleBlock Theater and the four-armed sociopathic bear deity that wants nothing more than to royally screw with him and his friends!It's also worth mentioning that this is the greatest turn-based strategy game I've ever played! Never before have I been so taken aback by commiting bucket-head genocide in grid-based fashion as I have with this game!It's more-than-likely also worth mentioning that this is the weirdest turn-based strategy game I've ever played! Never before have I been so taken aback by watching a cupcake feed itself to death to heal a team of bandits that it doesn't even like!			"

								I've been playing this game in hotseat with a friend and we both love it. It's got a faster tempo than we anticipated and that makes it very engaging. We used the mouse/keyboard and a Steam Controller which worked out great. I'd say the only thing I really disliked were that the player one and two color schemes in battles are far to similar. It gets confusing and chaotic. I'd like a switch from yellow to another accent color on one of the teams.			"

The Behemoth Keeps ImpressingThe Early Access title scared me a bit, I've been let down with other Early Access titles.However, The Behemoth seem able to even get Early Access down right. The game has good content, classic to the dev's unique personality and humor, and the game is a blast to play. I admit I wish there was more to the main story at present, but I also have faith in these developers that more quality content is to be expected.For now, the strategy element is engaging while maintaining a casual, zany atmosphere. The game is hilarious and fun to play, obviously very similar to Castle Crashers and the previous titles as far as animation and artistic design goes. The game plays well, keeping up the pace while still paying respects to turn based strategy. The customization options for fighters are plenty entertaining, and playing co-op and versus with friends is fantastic.I'm going to keep playing this game more than enough time to warrant fifteen bucks.Highly recommended.

								Early Access done Just Right...++Online matchmaking 2v2 arena pvp(hats off for pulling this off)+Crisp menu navigation(EXCEPT: the character armory is still buggy)+A nice taste of the main story mode.+Pokemon-ish recruiting (feelsgoodman)+The Behemoth humour.-Character armory navigation- no way to sell items not that i found at least in the little time i had on the game.-Feels like everyone's tanking way too much.(+++altho on the other had this makes pvp much less random, and strategy/position based which is very good +++)This early access is the money worth for any Behemoth fan!

Early Access Review
								I'm excited to see the limited amount of content grow. Behemoth has always done a great job putting together unique games with their own sense of humor and style. As of early access, they still deliever with their signature style. The art of Dan Paladin is ever present. Simple, humorous, delightful. There were a few times the art was pixelated but I'm sure that'll be fixed. Some of it (art, map, UI) feels a bit overly busy. As far as content, UI, and fighting system, alot needs to be worked on. The fighting system is simple but shallow and there's two story missions along with a few side quests. I imagine over the next year (in which Behemoth works towards release) mechanics and story will be built upon. So if you're buying it now, know you're only going to get a few hours of enjoyment at first. But if you believe the track record of the Behemoth team and their wonderfully unique spirit, it's worth to get the game now and support the team!			"

								Best story and comedy that Behemoth has made to date. This game is definitely one to keep your eye on, I think the best is yet to come. When I first purchased this game I had a few doubts, but I put in 4 hours right off the bat because I was hooked. The story is a tad short but there is SO MUCH that this game holds. The collectibles itself are what keeps me returning! It's a Behemoth game, prepare for funnies, poop jokes and weirdly demented characters.			"

								Behemoth is back once again with this sexy turn base game!Because this is early access, not everything is in this game. Hours of gameplay to complete the early access story and all side quests will probably take about like 8-10 hours, tons of items and hilarious dialouge. Being a Behemoth game, it has unique artstyle. Like a loser once said ""I like the concept of this BUT..."" Well that loser isn't here to say anything bad about it so take my word and BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!			"

								You know I wasn't going to write a review for this game untill it cam out of Early Access but god damn is this game fun! I've just finished the main story and to be honest I can't wait for the future parts of story mode to come out. The artstyle is great with lots of detail put into every part of the map (the bouncing houses are my favourites). The battle system works really well too. At first I thought it was going to be chaotc nd confusing like a turn based castle crashers but this game actually made me put a lot of stagety into each turn. You see one of my party members is a unicorn which in this game is a motar tower. Each turn I have to move into a place where it hits the enemy but also so it doesn't it my other team members. Oh and the healing, oh the healing. The healing in this game workss really well. Basically your healers in this game are some strangely sexy cupcakes that take damage when they heal you since it is feeding its body to you. However my cupcake has never died because like I said this game brought out the strategist in me so my cupcake was always in the safest place. Once again the classic Behemouth humour is in this game which is always welcome and Stamper returns to voice the best video game villain of 2017 so far. I highly recommend this game to everyone especially fans of fire emblem and other turn based strategy games. Just like teeny tiny iced creams, I know you'll love it. ;)			"

								its only still in development, but its one of those rare few that won me over on charm alone.as always, the narration from this group is spot on, voice acting and voices in general are top notch and fittingfairly simple graphically but it suits the genre and style well its an enviroment full of life with rich detailed characters strewn about the world.gameplay is pretty straight forward, move about the world to complete quests and battle/recruit foes use the money you've gathered to buy equipment styles and other useful things.but heres what sold me on this. ONLINE CO-OP. for really good titles it seems like a rare commodity, its either a Massive multiplayer game or any form of multi is competetive, but just like castle crashers this game delivers the ability most people want to see for the single player campaign, to bring a buddy. weather it'll be taken beyond a 2 player team beyond vs. mode would be interesting to see.all in all for its price, and the humor to be shared by this title, 15$ is far worth whats in store for the future.may frilly billy be with you.

								Pit People is a fantastic game for anyone. I would recommend this for a person who likes Funny Well made RTS's . Though it is still in early access there are still holes in the map like stores or maps that you cant enter. But that shouldnt turn you away from the awesome and funny action sequences.Pros :-Very fun co-op-Very competitive players-Fun to kill things and level up-Still isnt completed So more is on the way-Doesn't hold Your hand-Really Great Animation-Fun little Easter EggsCons :-Cant customize the torso of characters (That'd be pretty cool)-No Teal-Not much variety when it comes to enemies-Cant have more than 2 players In one game (that could be a lot more fun with 4 player co-op)There is basically no other cons to list cause of how great this game is.So If you want to play locally or find some friends online its basically for you.

Early Access Review
								Recently bought this game after seeing a few Youtubers playing, I was not dissapointed. Although, it is currently in early access if you do the side stuff there is enough content to justify buying it and it's reduced for early access buyers. I usually don't play many turn based stratergy games, but this one is has quite a quick pace and good mechanics. I really appreciate the style, jokes and genral qwerkyness of the game. The game is quite easy to pick up and has good local multiplayer. My main issues are that when different chracters have buffs you can't find out what they are. For example in the equip menu buffs have icons, but they aren't very self explanatory. If when you put your highligted them you'd get a little box of text which told you what the buff did that would be good. Also, with the Lady Legless quest I didn't have Yosef on my team and entered the quest, this then wouldn't allow me to finish the battle as she wouldn't die. When I had Yosef on my team it worked due to story reasons, prehaps if the quest didn't start without Yosef this could be fixed. The addition of ranked online battles in the pit would also be appreciated, however I'm mostly nit picking now. I really like this game and strongly recomend it.			"

								This is a review for an Early Access Game. Opinions herein are subject to change upon advancements in the games development. This review will be updated as each new patch rolls out for the game.Pit People.. Pit People.. This game is absolutely bonkers, and I adore it so for such. Whilst the storyline is nowhere near finished (Early Access) there are a plethora of missions and so on to embark on, as well as countless enemies to ""Recruit"" (Kidnap) into your party. My current party is a Hairball which regenerates health per turn, and hits for massive damage, a cupcake which heals my party members by slowly killing itself, your typical knightly party member but with an Elvis haircut, a Unicorn that fires exploding rainbow artillery horns, and a recruitment person. Party diversity is key.Pros:- Fantastic Soundtrack, which I've listened to outside of the game for hours.- Easy to understand movement system, as well as targetting.- Diverse enemies available to be recruited. From Mushrooms that fart on you and flip you off, to frogs that explode.- Hilarious questlines, which take an hour or so to complete if focused on completing the entire quest line.- Difficulty scaling is quite fair, with the ability to set the difficulty to ""Insane"" at any point.- Easily organized co-op, as well as split screen co-op using Mouse+KB and a controller.- Humorous ""language"" spoken by the characters within the game.- Exploration where you can ignore any/all enemies if you like.Cons:- Minor Framerate issues whilst exploring (Though, once more as stated above, it is an Early Access title, and this is subject to change).- Rather boring equipment system, where each weapon is generally cosmetic depending on their grouping.- Lack of Micromanagement aside from moving characters to an area, without the ability to designate specific targets, though this is most likely intentional.Overall: I'd rate the game an 8, however relatively close to being a 9. It lacks polish, as it is an Early Access game, however I am extremely excited to see what the future holds in regards to this game.			"

								Fantastic game. A simple mechanic with great tactical depth, but the real selling point is the aesthetic and the humour. Pit Peoples art and audio are beautiful. The Narrator in the early story missions sold it for me. The main story is quite short at this point, but it makes up for it with quality in writing and execution. Don't let that put you off though. Theres plenty of humerous sidequests and collectibles to keep you busy.			"

								The Behemoth is back this time dipping their toes into the turn based strategy genre and might I add they have done a great job so far with the humour and most importantly the gameplay. I strongly recommend this game to others and I can't wait for the full release. Also Horay for stamper narrating again!			"

whoops, BUTTERFINGERSBehemoth's stab at a turn-based strategy game is certainly worth a shot, but not without a handful of issues that aren't what you'd expect in EA. So far in my playthrough, the game itself is bug-free and performs without any hitches, much to Behemoth's credit as a respectable developer. However, the controls in menus are just a step above abysmal, clearly being designed to be navigated with a controller. Selections stick and feel imprecise, and at times I feel a need to be extra cautious should I accidentally sell or buy something I don't intend to. The gameplay handles well enough, but when panning the camera via WASD or arrow key the scroll speed is sluggish, and input icons switch to Xbox inputs for whatever reason.Gameplay itself is deceptively deep, with an easy learning curve and intuitive mechanics leading into a variety of new weapon variants, effects and troop selections once you get a handle on the basics. However, issues again arise in the menus, with visual cues for stats and weapon status effect icons being at best a vague suggestion on how they work. I shouldn't have to play 20 questions worth of guesswork to figure out what exactly something does or how it's implemented, and a lack of a clear-cut glossary or tooltips only serve to frustrate when introduced to what up to that point was a very intuitive and enjoyable experience. Experimenting with different combinations is fun, but not as fun as it could be when I'm left wondering things such as ""can I do anything to unfreeze friendly units, or do I have to wait out the effect?""The story and atmosphere is enjoyable, with the antagonistic narrator that I personally find much more entertaining than Battleblock Theatre, and an experience more in line with what we've seen in the past with Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid. Behemoth's simple, charming signature style works to the game's benefit, with the game boasting a variety of weapons, enemies and recruitable troops that I've only begun to scratch the surface of.I have yet to touch the MP, but I'll probably write about it later on. Who knows.Overall a very solid early access title, but not without some glaring issues that I hope to see resolved in the future.spacebear blood got in my eye christ help me / 10			"

								Personally, I was never a big fan of turn based RPG's, until now. The humour of Behemoth is as good as ever in this game. Everything seems to be really balanced and this game is great for that. The game makes it so if you are with or without a friend, there will be a challenge that isn't too hard either way. The leveling system of Castle Crashers is there, which I appreciate, and the names are hands down the best thing.Hard Nipples, my best warrior. 10/10 Can't wait for more story.			"

 Pit People is another great turn-based charming strategy game on Steam. I didn't finish the main story line yet because I don't usually do that during Early Access phase or I wouldn't play the main story after its full release. But despite that, I've finished necessary main quests to enjoy the game's full aspect and some few sub-quests.STORY So having played only intro missions, so far the story is funny yet very random! So far, I have no desire to finish the main story during early access phase, I cannot say much about it at this moment. Sub-quests are also great as situations often go hilariously unexpected. So far people are saying main story is quite short so I hope main story becomes longer than it is and maybe more sub-quests!GAMEPLAY There are huge customization options in Pit People. Every units can fit into different roles depending on which weapons, shields and helmet you desire to put them on. As you explore the overworld, there are different unit types you can ""recruit"" by capturing them like Pokemon. Many of these units carry different avatars of item types, so capturing them becomes addictive. Although there are currently 19 types of units in this game, I wish for more types of units to capture.Having to level them up during progression makes your units personally attached. Unlike XCOM, there is no permadeath so it's okay for them to die. Permadeath would be another good addition if there will be a sandbox mode. As turn-based strategy game, the positioning is extremely important. Unlike other games, you only command your units to move in specific positions while they will do anything on their own to their possible attackable enemies. But don't worry, they will do their best to win the battle. The overworld is huge! There are 125 POIs you can explore and features many different biomes to sink your foot in. While it's very fun to explore these places, I wish for randomized sandbox mode, which would increase higher replayability in exploring, randomized quests.Overworld is procedurally randomized, so hopefully there will be more than 125 POIs on full release as I am already reaching near 100% Co-op campaign and pvp are great options to enjoy with friends and strangers over Internet. These make perfect reason why capturing units outside of the city is more enjoyable. Seriously, Pit People needs more interesting unit types to ""recruit""! There are many different things to try like Insane mode, the pit with AI vs Players and etc which increases replayability.AESTHETICSArt style is very consistent across Behemoth games. Having played their older games back in Newgrounds, they still retains that funny and funky art style. Avatars for each units are usually random and hilarious, having 1357 of them are excellent! Only thing I would point out is that some vector graphics are pixelated when zoomed in, maybe this should be eradicated when leaving Early Access. Excellent sound design, love the vicious narrator, overall very good!OVERALLEven though this is early access title, it's well polished, very fun, highly replayable. Pokemon aspect truly shines as well as team-building aspect of this game. The game is very well balanced and it is the wonderful game to collect in your collection!			"

								Pit People is a one of those 'Easy to play, hard to master' types. It's fast to finish your turn just a few clicks, that's right, there's no special type of attacks your charcters can use. It's more about type type of charcters and types of equipment that just leveling up.This game also features pvp, very fun and easy to start playing, there was not once i felt like i was under leveled or overleveled in pvp, but like i was outplayed or someone with more knowleage than me. You get rewarded with gold and points by completing these pvp (you can also play with the AI but you have to go though extra rounds) The points are your rank, there are three stages. Bronze, Siver and Gold. The higher the better the rewards are.Not going to give out spoliers but i'll say this game has pretty good comady with the story, but a bit short because the game is still in beta.The charcters you get are fun and different to use, like humans,  they can use different types of swords, clubs, bows and some throwable stuff. The Cyclops who can gaint weapeons, clubs and send people flying! There is even cupcakes, wraths and other scary and funny allys(or foes)I'll give this game a 7.5. Abit hard to get into and lacks story, but theres is so many laughs and adventures to be had in this game! Have Fun! "

								If you want a chess like strategy game that has a natural feeling of progression along with weight for losing and joy for getting that lucky hit, then this game is for you. It has a booming soundtrack, with colorful graphics and they both play along side each other very well, if the style is for you. Weapons and armor are both neat and enjoyable to collect from random enemies and quests. Quests are also fun, and out in the world map the side quests that exist are repeatable after a move for extra gold and loot.Probably, the best part about this game, aside from the developers just being neat people from newgrounds, is the lack of pressure from doing ""wrong stuff"". Want to play the game, sure it's single player, don't have internet, don't worry. Want to fight a random troll momma and lose possibly, don't worry you just get sent back to town if you die with full hp so you can try again. Don't want to login to get ""daily rewards"" don't have to, they don't exist.This game reminds me of a game that came out back in the N64 or PS1-2 era. You want to play the game, sure, play it, no pressure or incentives other than a good game. Want to play with your friends, sure go for it. It's a game that wants to be played, it's not a ""triple A"" game that wants to show you how to use a god dam store to purchase microtransactions.A good game like this only comes around every blue moon when you have developers who want to make a game that is legit fun.+1 Devs.			"

								Yet again the Behemoth have made a fantastic game in which you could easily spend so many hours into. Pit people is an amazing turn based strategy game with amazing gameplay and so much customization, it has the same feel that castle crashers and battle block theater had with its whacky cartoon violence. Also like the Behemoths previous games Pit people (a strategy game) can be quite fast paced which isnt a change to gameplay at all. I highly recommend this game because even though it is currently a early access title it still does alot of amazing things.			"

								Amazing turn based gameplay, character build variety and customization, and a large variety of species to catch and use to create different team comps to use in missions and pvp. The comedic style in this game has made me laugh more than I ever have at any game. For an early access game, it's already worth much more to me than $15. The in game market could use some work, but that's the only negative thing i've found so far. I really hope this game gets the player base it deserves.			"

Fast-paced Turn-based Fun Place!What's this? The Behemoth, the creators of my favorite beat-em-up and one of my favorite platformers, made a turn-based game? Sign me up!I'm a fan of turn-based games with RPG elements: the Fallout games by Interplay, Wasteland, Fire Emblem, the works. Seeing this game annouced, I was a little skeptical. Specifically, about the co-op features. Many turn-based games with co-op have each player move individually. But I'll be beaten down with a rubber hose filled with frozen custard if The Behemoth didn't make it work.I can easily compare the gameplay to Fire Emblem, but boiled down to what's important. No faffing about with the weapon triangle for Pit People! Bigger weapons do more damage but weigh more. Archers aren't effective at close range. Maces work better on armored foes. Ultimately, the secret to success is how you position your soldiers on the field. Different squads can mesh together in different ways, allowing for interesting stratigies that work for you.The humor is nothing new if you've played Behemoth's previous, with the glorious glorious voice of Stamper, the narrator in Battleblock Theatre, making a return as the narrator. This time around he's made out to be super sarcastic and passive-aggressive towards the protagonists. It's truly a joy to behold the dialouge. But as they say, the devil's in the details. Pit People has a lot of tiny details that make it much more enjoyable. For example, each unit type has a special entry corralating to them. And the entries are just an absolute joy.This game is a-okay in my book!			"

You can capture creatures and collect loot out in the overworld, but also watch out for this pillars with a red button on them (they turn green after you touch them), they might do something. The best Behemoth game ever created. I'm sure the finished product will be even better.			"

								Let met start by saying I reccomend this game. The laughs itself is worth the $15. The behemoth always makes pretty good games, and I've known about several of the people involved in this game back in their Newgrounds days over a decade ago. But, I do believe this game has some issues - not counting the incomplete story campaign, which is mentioned in-game by the developers as a work in progress. At the time of writing this, it will only last you about an hour if you try to complete it quickly. But the game also generates random encounters with rewards and ratcheting difficulty, as well as co-op and multiplayer vs.The good:- The game is funny. Really funny.- The strategy is easy to pick up and accessible. - Play with a friend!- Turn-based strategy without the premadeath and nessescary save-scumming that *cough* X-Com still seems to have a hard time getting rid of.- A high degree of customization and collectibles seems to provide a lot of replay value.- A giant world with tons of sidequests and rewards.The bad:- This game has a wierd habit of making the world full of color and life, but making the characters washed out and a little bland. For a capture-the-pokemon style of collection and recruitment, it's weird that most of the combatants are stark white humans in off-white clothes.- The strategy is flat, without elevation, without a variety of terrain bonuses or a huge variety in abilities or defences. Most fights turn into bottlenecking and musical hexes.- Health bars are so huge that often the fights turn into attrition slugfests.			"

Early Access Review
								READ THIS IN YOUR WILL STAMPER VOICEI remember playing castle crasher back in 2010 and absolutely loving each and every bit of it, even going as far as to complete the game many times using the Dance Dance Revolution dance pad or Guitar Hero 2 controllers for hours on end,... Then I found out about alien hominid, and I absolutely loved that too (even though it was hard as all hell). When Battle Block theatre was announced I couldn't wait (but I had some how managed). Bought it the day it game out and enjoyed the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that game, the reason I didn't buy it on steam was that I managed to unlock nearly head for the prisoner. The second I found out about game number four (now Pit People) I♥♥♥♥♥♥bricks. I had just played through games like XCOM and Fire emblem (WaifuWars:Awakening) and really started to like the turn based strategy genre so I felt like fate had delivered the dream game. Little did I know that this dream game would also be early access. Mow lets get into the pros and cons (so far).PROS+The signiture Behemoth artstyle, the very reason I love the brush tool in Adobe Flash (By the time I typed Flash it   crashed)+Wonderful soundtrack I walready wish I could buy.+Lots of customization.+Instead of moving units one by one they all move at once.+A unique system of instead targetting an any, a charater will instead attack one enemy withen thier range prioritizing  melee attacks over ranged attacks.+A simple armor system.+The randomly generated enemies and names (as far as I know though the character types and positions do not change   for scenarios which is awesome)+The ""class/races"" as far as I can tell play pretty differently and uniquely. I couldn't imainge what game would have a   cupcake that mutilates itself to heal others, though its probably hidden somewhere in some DnD story.+The humor. I'm always one for a good fart joke, but when voiced by Will Stamper, I love a good fart joke,+Will stamper is the one voice that isn't in the parody of simish that the characters speak in. I love it.CONS-No name customization, though I do like the random names I wanna name a party after a few friends and I then place   bets on who dies in what order in the pit.-The game explains how to play it, but not how the character building works which you kinda just learn on your own.-Catchin- errr ""recruiting"" a unit always seems to give me two stars instead of three after each battle, but it makes sense   considering Will Stamper praises you for as murdering as many people in a turn as you can.-Never seem to get a toon gold, but not too much of a con unless you really want to buy a 7K gold unit.-Not enough content... yet.For dedicated Behemoth fans you should buy this after reading this, it has a fairly short download time too so you won't die from getting hyped. For people who have played a Behemoth game I would wait a week or so then check on the updates.For people who are interested in this you should wait a month, then check on the updates.If Dan Palidan and Tom Fulp are reading this, thank you for work and time. I really hope you enjoy your work as much as I do. I really hope you guys flesh this game out. You already have 1,300+ ITEMS, each one unique and quirky! I don't know how you manage to do it but you guys really buckle some pants when it comes down to making video games. Keep at it!			"

								It's great but not perfectCons:-Too many bullet sponges(especially in the story mission)It's not even hard to beat them it's just they Every  enemy soak tons of damage-barely any explaination of weeekness and strength against enemy's-Equipiment menu feels sloppy, a lot of time in confused what to do,- there should be a before and after graph for equipment-Controller support like for steam controllers and PS4 would be nice-A capture enemy off guard system would be nice-tutorial for stats, feel to overwhelm, and this is the guy who played fire emblem fates (conquest) on lunatic classic mode- moving hexs back in forth feels to clunky-to next gen graphics, need to tone down a bit ( really  appreciate  the crt mode)-shows health of people after moving them, it's very hard for a cupcake to do it's job if it can't see the health of there fellow team mates-very shallow enemy's and alliesWho and Why I recommend it:To everybody really but espically to people who like tatical role playing gamesI recommend it because it's amazing turn based grid combat and funny yet cruel dialogue, a thing you would expect from a behemoth game.

								Like other Behemoth offerings, Pit People is both extremely fun and a hilarious gut-busting experience. Even for early access there is already plenty of content and thousands of customization options. The combat has quite a bit of depth and the numerous options allow players to create the perfect strategy they have in mind.  Like Battleblock Theater before it, Stamper returns as a narrator but with a more sinister twist and other background characters with humorous Sim's-like gibberish.			"

								Without a doubt, this is one of the best RPGs I've played in a long while – the art and animation is hilarious and distinctive, the combat is simple but incredibly addictive, the writing is absolutely brilliant, and the music is just really damn funky. To top it all off, it's got a hilarious narrator in the form of StamperTV as a giant space bear, who I think has done some great voice-over in other Behemoth games. There are just so many little details crammed in, like the rainbow unicorn creatures leaving a poo trail as they drag their arses along the ground, to the cord of the giant space phone that you use for multiplayer co-op trailing off into space on the world map, to the fact that the giant space bear actually picks up the whole hub city and moves it to a completely different world map at random now and then just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. Yes, none of that will make sense until you play it. Please do.Worth noting is the fact that, as an early-access game, the actual main story is barely there, but Behemoth made up for this by packing in a goldmine of delightfully random side-quests that should keep you going for around 10-20 hours, more if you go all-out on finding all the hidden secrets and recruiting all the potential characters.All in all, if they can make me adore an early-access game this much, then I await the finished product with fear and awe.

								Even though i finished the quest line so far (cant wait till they add more!) I can tell Im gonna have a good 10s of hours messing around in this sort of sandbox game. Plus the Narrator is god damn hilarious, if you laugh at Behemoth's trailers you will laugh at this.Another reason this game is god damn amazing is in the first hour of playing I got a unicorn which  shoots its horn as a artillery shell.10/10 - wish this  had a pokedex like thing implemented for all the species.

								Pit People is everything you love about Behemoth Games and it's not even close to done yet. Sure there are some bugs and silly things that happen but overall this game has great quest, great fighting mechanics, and just an overall arching theme of silliness. I play this on local coop with my girlfriend and we've already had 10+ hours of fun in it. I recommend this game without hesitation.			"

								Ok so this is another game by the Behemoth and it is amazing I'm a huge fan of Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater so obviosly I would want to play Pit People. I started playing and was already thrown into classic Behemoth Humor, the art style in this game is the same as CC and BBT which is really good cause I really like the Behemoth's art style in games. I HIGHLY recommend you get this game it is still in early access at the time I am typing this but there is already lots to do and I haven't come across any bugs or glitches yet. The story is not complete yet but this game is pretty long so you will have plenty to do. This is a srategy game and thats pretty diffrent from BBT which was a platformer and CC which was just pretty much a combat game with sword fighting. It is open world and running into enemies will start a fight like in most RPG's so yeah if you don't want to fight don't run into them cause there is no fleeing feature. Also when in the open world map make sure not to get lost cause I couldn't find the main town for about 15 minutes due to the fact the world is so big with no arrows or signs or whatever telling you where it is so don't get lost like I did.

								This game is awesome. It is possibly the best game I have ever played, even in early access! The downsides are that there aren't many story mode things to do just yet, so we'll have to wait for more main missions. And the fps when I had first bought the game, but the Behemoth managed to fix it in a day. I was impressed. It is still very fun. I just do not reccomend buying it right now. But if you want to, please do.Also I need the OST for this game to be released! It is incredible!			"

								Recently bought this game after seeing a few Youtubers playing, I was not dissapointed. Although, it is currently in early access if you do the side stuff there is enough content to justify buying it and it's reduced for early access buyers. I usually don't play many turn based stratergy games, but this one is has quite a quick pace and good mechanics. I really appreciate the style, jokes and genral qwerkyness of the game. The game is quite easy to pick up and has good local multiplayer. My main issues are that when different chracters have buffs you can't find out what they are. For example in the equip menu buffs have icons, but they aren't very self explanatory. If when you put your highligted them you'd get a little box of text which told you what the buff did that would be good. Also, with the Lady Legless quest I didn't have Yosef on my team and entered the quest, this then wouldn't allow me to finish the battle as she wouldn't die. When I had Yosef on my team it worked due to story reasons, prehaps if the quest didn't start without Yosef this could be fixed. The addition of ranked online battles in the pit would also be appreciated, however I'm mostly nit picking now. I really like this game and strongly recomend it.			"

								Pit people is a must buy for people who are fans of Behemoth's games. But if your still concerned, the game is in early access, which is a suprise once you get into the game beause I didn't find any bugs. But the game can be beat in about an hr and 30 mins but they are adding more story in later patches. There are about 20 differnt types of enemies, hopefully they will add more. But the story we do have now, is funny and interesting. I dont like to saw this but the game is really....really slow. when you play the game you will say im wrong but im talking about the fights. which can take a long time because a lot of the enemies run away from you and make your job harder. I like how you can catch enemies and put them on your team. If i had to pick what game it is most like I would say Xcom and a bit of pokemon and I havent played a game where you you can go out in the world and chose who you fight. the only thing I can think of is South Park:The stick of Truth canada area of the game with the bears and snakes etc. so finally I would give this game at the moment 7.5/10 I will come back and change this review when I see big changes to anything I have wrote, so as i said before if your a fan you shoud buy it. But if your bit unsure I would still get. Because when the game is down you will not regret it. This Behemoth not a random indie person. They will finsh it, and it will be great.			"

								This game is fantastic. It's amazing, totally great. The first thing you'll witness as you start the game is the amazing music it caress your moist ears with, after that you'll be thrown into a world built on the core of top notch humour. You battle humans and creatures in a tactical system. Collect gear and weapons, and capture said creatures to fight for you in later battles. If you have some money to spare, buy the game. It will keep you occupied for hours. The developers actually listen to the fanbase, and on top of all of this: There's an actual fun PvP and CO-OP system. What can you say? Well, The Behemoth delivered a fantastic CO-OP, PvP, online game once again!			"

								The Best game that is currently early access. Keep in mind that this is early access.9.5/10Pro:+ Will Stamper a.k.a Quibs from Battleblock theater is in it as the narrator.+ Funny Gameplay during the fights+ Lots of Enemy/ Ally types+ Great turn based system+ ""The Pit"" is a fun way to test out team compositions, it is basically an arena to fight in.+ Simple level system+ Funny way to recruit new allies, you throw a net on the lone enemy and you take him back to townCons:- Not much story, but that is because this is in ** early access. **- only a few weapons that look desirable - not that many healer types- limited inventory space in the wagon which is how you travel around the world map, the space is about 10, fills up fast- only customization options to characters are weapon, shield, and head. (We ned more gear customization, like shirts to get rid of that plain baige t-shirt)Both:+/- promotes grinding in ""the pit"" instead of the world due to small inventory space			"

								Pretty simple game to play and at the same time complex, specially if you play insane mode. Fun to play with friends and other people online. Even if early access.			"

								This game is SO good. Stamps did an amazing job with the voice acting, and the Soundtrack is amazing aswell. Gameplay gets really caotic sometimes and can get confusing, but still really fun.			"

								I would definetely recommend this game,Pros:The combat system was cool, with a hexagonagal theme.The side quests, and how oblitatorigally stupid they are.I really like the custiomization Feature.The pit, and the reward system.The recruiting system.Cons:To be honest, the game was perfect, I don't see anything wrong with it.(Except of course that darn terrible music in the 'Hub' that you have to replace) "
