												I already just started and it clearly was made for an IOS or Android and not for a person that uses the average PC.The options are simple, no real configuration settings and manual combat is not really good with a mouse, let alone a trackball mouse or a keyboard, so you're kind of stuck with the very boring auto-combat system just so you don't do anything stupid.If you ever considered buying this, just buy it on your mobile device. playing this on the PC is just...No.Just. No.Edited for additional info: before you say that maybe it was intended with playing a controller, all a controller can apparently do is turn the ship and use the afterburner. Maybe jump as well. It doesn't work when you're inside a station where it requires something to press its buttions. You NEED a mouse or a touchscreen monitor to play effectively or at all.The map in the game is very...simplistic. That's the kindest description I can give it. Last I saw, it was as if it was drawn with bright red and green crayons.If you ask why you need the mouse for manual combat, well there's the fact that there's a button for the unguided lasers that you must click once for it to auto-fire. That's right, auto-fire. Which drains your energy bar that also supplies power to your shields and auto-repair systems if you get damaged, which by the way, can have thresholds on how much you can heal and such. If not for the tutorial repair, I would have been dead already in my first fight.You also need the mouse to turn efficently at the same time as doing it by keyboard is kind of slow and unresponsive and it feels awkward holding a controller with one hand and a mouse in the other to do it. Think about that. No way to effectively dodge in combat normally, if there was any ability to dodge at all let alone aim the manual auto-fire unguided laser, so you must use the auto-combat system to get things done.Auto combat? It's where you first target an enemy ship, click on a button twice that makes it automatically use whatever turrents and missles you have so you watch and do nothing as either you or the enemy ship dies. You may have to then manually change the enemy and turn it back on again.Either the developers are pulling a bad prank with shoving the IOS/Android in here as I deleted the game and re-download the game to check and the size was 556MB (Not something that required 2GB of harddrive space that was listed) or this is the real thing.Seriously, This is not a good choice to buy, let alone try to play at the moment. Until they fix such things, I can't seriously recommend playing this if you enjoy the space genre. I'll hopefully check back in a month or two, but by then I'll probably play some other game worth my time and effort in.			"

												This is a prime example of how internet game mob ganged up on an indie developer and killed a perfectly good game with bad review. Developer went broke and couldn't update get enough money to support the game and leave a lot of bugs left for the game and more people write bad reviews... Bad reviews lead to bad sales and even less chance of developer fix bugs and fix game.The first thing you need to know is. This game was released on the same day as elite dangerous. Since both are space shooter/trader RPG game. A lot confused soul brought this game think its elite dangerous. They feel quite cheated. Most of the review for this game are made less than 1 hour of game playtime. They are left by players that brought the wrong game, left bad review then brought refunded the game. Since the 2 man developer team couldn’t make any decent sale at all with such bad review ranking this game and its few bugs (some game breaking) were not fixed that lead to further bad reviews.This is a space simulator RPG about your main character being stripped of name/memory and future to put in stasis for a crime of mass genocide. Main character woke up many years later and became a legend in the history book to try to get back his memory and find out what happened.The star map, system, planet, space stations and ships are done quite well with quite common skill set which you can improve your character vastly. You also get to use 2 wingman at a time to support your character. There is a trading system that is probably the easiest in all the space game I played so far. There is a faction system that you need to improve your relationship to +0.50 (roughly 5 F-class quest or 10 D-Class quest). Once you reach +0.50 you can learn their alliance skill to improve your character. The alliance skill range from license to use nasty hades class capital ship. (The best I found in game) or the corporation skill which you can remotely control other ships you buy/find to do mining/trading/shopping for you. A lot of the skill bring open quite interesting content/ability to help you greatly. The music/sound effect are recently well done. The battle music is quite good to my ear actually.The graphic is really nice for a 2 man indie title. Not quite on the level as galaxy on fire 2. But still quite good.Well, main flaw of this game are bugs.1.	During story line 14. When the big ship crushed. I am stuck on crushed screen. I can still hear my ship shooting in the background but there are no way for me to proceed to the last few story step of the game.(see my screenshot).2.	Corrupt save file. This only happened to me once. When some of the storyline quest are done. Your game is auto saved. IF you die before going to a station to make a manual save or trigger another auto save. That auto save from finishing space based quest can sometime be corrupted. 3.	Control stuck. Happened to me twice and I had to alt-tab and do a hard close and restart the game. Sometime in combat near station. Your ship gets stuck and everything frozen. I can shoot and etc but I cannot turn to face my enemy. I can bring up the command circle. But I cannot land or pick new destination to jump.4.	Energy drain + jump o different station/gate will cause crush when distance reach around 0.3au. One of your wingman use an energy vampire based ship. (My favorite wingman). She sometime start an energy drain beam on enemy ship. When that happens, I always had to stop jump process and kill those enemy first. IF I don’t and start the jump. The game will be frozen mid jump.5.	There are also some graphics glitch. Like you can literally go inside a space station and it won’t collide with your ship, and you can jump though planets or stars instead of going around them when you do inner system jump.6.	There are also once or twice when I accept that kill 3 ship mission from the bar. When I jump into the station location the jump process won’t stop and I am stuck in hyper space. Since I cannot land or jump to another station I had to hard exit game and reload.6/10 I really do enjoyed this game. The story had a lot twist too. I will give a thumb up to this game and hoping developer will one day find the money and time to fix the bugs of this game and make this game great.			"

												I'm quite a junkie for space trading sims, and there might be even a decent game buried somewhere in here, but the controls and the user interface completely kills everything.I don't mind dated graphics or poor sound effects or else, but the absolute mess that is the UI just drives me away... the tutorial is not that great, and God forbid you miss a hint about a button since the icons are incomprehensible and there's no tooltip in-game whatsoever; the so callded ""manual"", at the moment, is something of a joke so you won't find much help there either.i'm sorry, but the first thing that comes to my mind when trying to play this game is ""Battlecruiser 3000AD once again""... granted, it might not be that buggy, but it has the exact same feeling of complete clunkyness			"

												This game is defintly easier to understand then Elite Dangerous, i am still a bit lost but i have managed to move around and sell and buy goods.Money is defintly not a problem as pirates are constantly after you, when i first went to another station i got stuck there for a while because pirates kept poping up one after the other, i had to redock several times before i finally could leave and before i knew it, i was pretty wealthy and so i bought a better ship for 100k.Did some mining and fought pirates, now i almost got 500k.I am still learning the game, wish it was a little easier in explaining what does what as the only thing i understand about combat is how to fire my laser at the momment lol.As for graphics i see no issues with it, tho the options are a bit lacking its defintly a game i would recommend.

												I just bought this the other day and haven't played much yet. Controls take a bit of a learning curve, it reminds me a bit of Eve Online. Seems to be a solid game open-world space game. I definitely don't see reason for all the negatives.The one thing that bothers me is the pirates seem to be endless and without any real rhyme or reason to their appearing. Even in core sectors I get random pirates showing up on my butt while trying to do stuff like cargo runs or mining. And every mission I inevitably have random pirates show up. But this is a thing I've encountered in a lot of games like this, so while I find it a bit annoying it seems to be the norm.I don't see myself playing it past the storylines much, but it's providing good entertainment so far. I recommend it if you can catch it on sale. It's available for Android and IOS too (I have the PC version, so I can't comment on the quality of those).			"

												This game is definitely underrated.+ Great open world gameplay with lots of sidequests & stuff to do + Many customization possibilities (which actually make a difference) for Ships + Really nice soundtrack- Controls take some time to get used to- Translations are bad			"

												Not a bad game.  It's been out for years and finally arrived on steam.  It's a shame Elite moved their release date up to match this game....not sure why they'd have done that.Not as pretty of some of the newer games but a solid story and enjoyable gameplay.People will have to ignore the majority of reviews though.  The majority were posted by people who didn't take 5 seconds to get the facts.  For example they think this game was developed after Elite when the fact is Dangerous was released with that name over a year before Elite was even in the 'Being thought of stage'  But fanboys never look at facts.  No this isn't a Elite Dangerous cloan, nor is it an attempt to market off that game...in fact if you only went by the true facts then it's the other way around...if you base your findings using the same scale as most of the other reviewers.Now more about the game.  You can in fact fly planetside which is nice, the devs have talked about adding new planetside content later.  Controls are simple but at times a little painful and I wish combat allowed a more hands on approach.I'm still playing the game and I'll edit my review to add more information as I get deeper into it.  But I felt the need to call out the majority of negative reviewers that only posted because they have no real idea what they are walking about.------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after a few more hours.  I'll admit I enjoy a more first person view but RTS type games can be fun.  I will say that there are things the Dev could have done to make this a little easier.  The game can be a pain during the first hour or so until you really get into the controls.  I also think the 'Tutorial' is a tad slow.  Usable and it works but the pace is a little slower than I'd like.  Also I've learned that the game leans on automatic for the most part.  You will not find yourself driving the fights that much, mostly clicking on one of the 'Automatic' options and just watching.  While that's normal for a true RTS this isn't that and it tends to make things too easy.  Would like a better challange.			"

												I like the premise of the game and the graphics. What I don't like are the controls that on the one hand don't offer enogh options and on the another hand are too complicated or confusing. While the game's tutorial tries to show you around (and quite well succeeds in that even, I enjoyed it), it didn't manage to teach me how to fly the ship. And since none of the many buttons have hover text, I wasn't able to learn by myself. If the memory load (player's, not computer's) could be lessened, I would like the game much more and probably would even continue it.			"

												This is a great game folks, and trust me, I play all the spacey games. This game has nothing to do with Elite: Dangerous, and actually first came out years ago before coming to Steam via Greenlight. Take a look at my video to see how the game plays, and give the game a chance. It's a lot of fun.

												When you like fast action and direct controls, don't buy it! Just don't.Following may be a bit sarcastic: Hit button on hud to start laser firing. Hit button again to let it stop firing. You wanted to fire weapons with mouse? Nah, clicking on hud it is. Changing controls on startup (10 positions mybe) differs from VIEWING controls in menue (30 Positions) in game. Customisation is as overated as making, what the others do. Mouse over information? Why? The hud has 30+ icons hidden in several sub menus and unique and mostly new logos which mostly don't look like the actual function, so there is no need to have a mouseover.I almost died in first mission due the controls, only the repair of the instructor ship saved my live during the 10 minutes, where i tried to understand, why my weapon does not fire, why i view my ship from a distance of 5 kilometers (wrong cam) and why the control sheme deviates from expectation and entered things. The controls alone kill the fun of this game. @Devs: Try to make, what other do, instead of atempting to develope a whole new revolutionary control sheme.			"

												This is a game that requires a future build to complete and yet I find it quite entertaining and a challenge.  Those who have made a negative review may not be considering this and the fact only two people are working on it.  You should give this a chance, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  The music is good.The different beam and pulse weapon graphics are beautiful.  The ship is third person view.  You can gain perks through playing the game by doing jobs for the various companies.  You can even start with a perk at the beginning of the game.  You are given a subtle training lesson in the form of sudden battles which you are aided by your rescuer, thus also gaining some credits and XP to spend.  After that you can do what you want with the few objectives to help you on your way, including getting your own and first wingman.You can choose your own direction in earning credits & XP even Piracy, or be a Merc. including Bounty Hunting, or trading or as an explorer of the Ancients.  The universe is your oyster, be its doom or saviour, its your choice.  Before I forget, you can make your ship better or buy a better one and make it what you want to suit your playing choice.  There is much to do, space battles to fight, credits & XP to earn and a purpose to fulfill with your own mysterious AI to help you.  Enjoy Discoveries and so on.			"

												I am sorry for a previous review a while back, I was just angry at myself for not reading the names. This time my review will be honest. I absolutely would recomend this game to anyone, The controls are certainly a learning curve for me but It is a fun game nonetheless (not sure if one word) it is a great game. My favorite being the humor in this game, it has me laughing to myself almost everytime. Fighting honestly is not easy but it is fun and innovative, for me at least. I do not blame them for the same name, i do not believe that the creators puposely did this to get money, as Elite:Dangerous was not public knowledgeat the time of them starting the creation of this game. Once again i am sincerely sorry for my previous review. Thanks for the great game. "

												Well yes on close inspection I should have looked for Elite flag. Still it would be nice if it had been made clearer in the discription somehow. Very unfortunate that they have same games. i don';t know if it's a cash grab, or an honest mistake between two companies. What I do know is teh contropls are not very good, the training/learning segment is horrid and confiusing as hell, and they are without a doubt benefiting on teh confusion of name. I would never have purchased this otherwise and I am not alone. Heck if it was still a semi decent game I might stick with it.....but the controls are horrid. Also they are not allowing refunds since it was before refund policy.......			"

												Haven't played it for too long, but from what i can tell, its and OK game. The negative reviews are coming just from idiots who thought this was Elite: Dangerous. I thought it would of been pretty obvious its a different game, since you will never see that game on steam for 20 bucks...and don't you think they would put their highly renouned ""Elite"" trademark into the game title??Leaving a positive review to even out the playing field.
