												Hexcells uses similar logical reasoning skills to Minesweeper, but without the timed aspect. Great puzzle game but way too short.			"

												This is what Minesweeper should have been. Basically, this game is six-sided Minesweeper, but with the guessing element completely removed. You never have to guess a single time in any of the puzzles, and you will always have enough information available to you to make the next move. It's a game of pure logic and deduction, and one that will truly test your skills in the later levels. My only complaint is that the game is pretty short, but there is also Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite to play.Highly recommended if you even remotely enjoyed Minesweeper.			"

												This is probably the best puzzle game I have ever played.  The music and sound effects are spot-on fantastic, the puzzles are lovingly and painstakingly crafted, and the difficulty progression is just perfect from one puzzle to the next.The mechanics are similar to Minesweeper and if you find yourself clicking the wrong mouse button (like me), you can change the button configuration from the Input tab of the configuration menu when you first start the game.I have now bought this game twice at full price (I bought again when released on Steam) and I don't regret it in the slightest.  This game is worth well more than the $3 asking price.			"

												Great puzzle game. As others have mentioned, its minesweeper, with some added gameplay elements. Relaxing music, no time limit, and a very zen like vibe going thru-out. Acheivement hunters, its an easy 100%. Took me 2 hours. Only drawback is its short, so try to find it on sale.			"

												Really enjoyable casual puzzle game; challenging without being frustrating, although seasoned puzzle enthusiasts might consider it to be a bit too easy. Common complaint is that it is short, but for the price I still see this as a good value title. There are around 30 logic puzzles, still offering several hours of challenges to exercise your mind. Concept is most like the classic Minesweeper that was included with Windows OS back in the day. You need to use logic to determine if there is a 'number' or 'vacant' hex in the adjacent cell from the already revealed hexes.The simple designs, grows in complexity as you progress through larger levels with new rules being added & for the purists there is also the challenge of completing each puzzle without any mistakes. Graphics are bright yet clean & basic, but suitable to the game. Sounds are relaxing & controls are easy (just left & right mouse buttons).Other than the exceptional LYNE, this is one of the best puzzlers I have played in recent years & look forward to trying out the sequels (which I am told are a much harder challenge too!).If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												Hexcells is the illegitimate love child of Minesweeper and Picross. Using a series of number clues, you must logically remove and mark hexagons in order to fill out the pattern hidden underneath. If you've played either of the two before mentioned games this will be entirely intuitive, with numbers within a hexagon corresponding to the number of blue tiles (ie. mines) surrounding said hexagon, and the numbers on top of a column signally the number of blue tiles within it (with a few special signals providing additional info).What Hexcells adds over vanilla Minesweeper is the more puzzle oriented design of its levels, each being individually designed to test your skills of deduction with cleverly disguised patterns that are often far more obvious than they first appear. Solving them is abundantly satisfying, and makes it rather hard to go back to the randomly generated boards of its spiritual predecessor.But this is also the cause of my biggest complaint, that being the times when logic is thrown out the window and you are all but forced to guess in order to move forward. This is frustrating because you're allowed but one mistake before forfeiting your perfect rating, essentially requiring you to memorize patterns and replay levels or cheat and use screenshots of the completed puzzle to go back and perfect the stage. It's odd that a game essentially designed to entirely do away with the use of luck to solve puzzles falls into such a disappointing pitfall, but I can only assume it was an oversight by the developer as for the majority of the game it's entirely possible to intelligently complete stages, which I suppose is why these moments of guesswork stand out so strongly.Although it just barley misses the mark, the overwhelming opinion I took away from Hexcells is that of a strong new logic puzzle that has the potential to perfect itself in future iterations, and may one day sit beside the likes of Picross and Sudoku. If you have any appreciation for the games I've compared it to, I wouldn't hesitate to check Hexcells out. It's budget priced so you've got very little to lose, and may find yourself similarly enamored by what at first seemed but a cheap knockoff.			"

												I usually satisfy myself with mindless clicking at things that move, clubbing zombies and “flamethrowing” aliens enough to make a batter-happy Flintstone giddy. After a while the repetitive slashing and gouging puts a strain on my steadily numbing mind and I need a break. Brainiac games like Hexcells provides that pause from the world of action titles that many gamers find soothing from time to time. The minimalistic interface calms you to the core like entering your hotel room, the first day of your sunny beach-filled holiday. Easy-peasy controls and rules, as most strategic puzzle games tend to excel in, are explained through directions (though for Level 1 I felt the couple of trial plays planted in the beginning of each rule change, would have sufficed). I’ve seen plenty of reviews exclaiming it as comfortably easy to finish, which isn’t quite true as new rules are added regularly and consistently starting at Level 11. This lessens repertoire and makes Hexcells highly entertaining for a puzzle game of its kind. It calls for the elimination and deduction tools we have honed through countless hours of playing games such as Sudoku and Minesweeper. There is no timer so in a sense is closer to a Sudoku that’s pleasing to the eye. Hexcells adds the “chic” that Sudoku lacks and the logicality which Minesweeper is deficient in through functions which allow no room for the guessing games and visuality to match. No function is lacking or overdone in Hexcells. As Goldilocks would say, “It’s just right.” It is one of the most accessible and convenient game I have ever played. The UI looks fantastic for touch screens and as I’ve been marooned on my laptop for a few months, it’s always heaven to play low spec games that won’t freeze mid-play and still provide high quality content to keep me amused for consecutive hours. It is also a great game for a few minutes here and there as an easy to start, continue and leave at any time type game that doesn’t bore. For example, the widely loved classic, Peggle will have me dozing off in a few minutes flat although it’s a sweet little thing. The intermediate level starts around Lv. 18-19 and I started finding it mind boggling beginning at Lv. 22. After that point some are comparatively easier than others which didn’t reflect the actual order or the levels. Thank goodness because the couple of easier levels here and there let me hang on to my sanity! Most of the reviews I’ve read stated plenty of appreciation towards the needlessness of guessing the answers. There is 0% need to speculate and everything must be calculated if you want to play the game to its maximum. Keep in mind that if you mess up once you’ll end up with the obvious answer which means it’s extremely easy to use trial and error to pick through the games effortlessly. This sucks all the fun out of it so I suggest you aim for 100% accuracy each time you play or try and forget the hex you just wrongly clicked and move on to something else so you won’t end up getting everything easy. Another tip I have is to try playing it as fast as your mind will think and fingers will click because the music sounds better that way. It has one of those almost interactive tracks so that what and how you click will determine a different sound that in turns melds into the original score underneath it. In all honestly, the aspect the feature I enjoyed the least was the music in Hexcells as it is repetitive and some parts sound like an orchestra of mobile phones with annoying, monotonous ringtones. (Note: I understand that there was only so much the developer could do and it wasn't that bad, I'm just used to better soundtracks is all. ;D) Which is why I eventually turned down the volume and even then I still couldn’t quite stand it. It wasn’t the relaxed ambience I was hoping for but it wasn’t as noticeable when playing at a faster pace (clicking hexes in acceleration) for reasons already noted above. A better example would be Duet, the strategic arcade game by Kumobius (iOS/Android). The music is directed via the player’s fingertips as they go through the puzzles and it is scored in a way that’s surprisingly meditative for a game of somewhat high difficulty. The fluidity of a game’s soundtrack influences a massive portion of its play mood in any genre. Other than that, I’m interested in buying the other two as well for a rainy day and hope the background music is a tad better than the first one.  "

Game SeriesHexcells is the first game of its' series.Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're minimalistic. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. GameplayThere is no difficulty mode option that's assigned. But each of the puzzles has their own difficult.Hexcells is closely similar to mine sweeper game. So the objective is rather simple to figure out which cells to make blue and which cells to make black.There are total of three slots with six world that has twenty-four puzzles to solve. The first world for each of the three slots are automatically unlocked. Completing one world will unlocked the next one. All of these puzzles can be replayed after the first go around. Please do note that the puzzles in the other two slots are the same as the ones in the first slot.There's no time limit in this game. Allowing the individual take as much time that they want to solve each of the puzzles.There six achievements for this game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.MiscellaneousFinal thoughts, it's an neat game to play and enjoy. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.Reviews for the games in this series:HexcellsHexcells PlusHexcells Infinite "

												Hexcells is one of the best logical puzzle games on Steam. It has a nice clean look and has a no-nonsense approach... it gets you right into the puzzling and teaches you how to play with a very unintrusive ""tutorial"". Every puzzle can be beaten without hints, and the harder levels will really test your lateral thinking skills. For that matter, I can't think of any game on Steam that test your lateral thinking more than Hexcells, with the exception of the sequels which include more approaches to solving puzzles.You cannot go wrong with the Hexcells games if you want some quality logical puzzlers.P.S. If you really like Minesweeper and have played it for more than a few hours you're going to want to switch the keybinds in Hexcells since they are the opposite of Minesweeper (left click by default marks ""mines"" and right click clears safe spots). Never understood that, I guess the developer never actually played Minesweeper			"

												It's similar to MineSweeper with one major difference: The placing of mines goes along with the LEFT mouse click and the numbers with the RIGHT; that was very confusing for me at the beginning, because I am used to that MineSweeper controls. Another difference is the additional parameters like numbers at the columns and a few other; but you better find out yourself. :DHowever, you get used to it very soon and might only do some misclicks occasionally.I am through the game with all achievements in 87 minutes. So I guess, it is a game for a nice afternoon/evening after work or maybe at the weekend (but it might go even faster at the weekend when your brain is relaxed).It was very fun and not really hard if you focus, so I can recommend this game.

												I'm something of a Picross nut, having played and near-beaten most of Nintendo's Picross games. When I saw Hexcells on the Steam New Releases section, I was quite happy; I have always thought these kinds of logic puzzles were better on a platform with a mouse. A few bucks later (thanks to Steam trading card sales - this game doesn't give out cards, btw), I had Hexcells in my library.The actual logic of Hexcells is not difficult to grasp. If you've played Minesweeper or Picross 3D, you'll be right at home. You'll be following numbers inside of hexes, with symbols indicating whether the surrounding blue hexes will be consecutive or split, and later you will find numbers on rows or columns as well, with similar symbols. These symbols are, admittedly, not as easy to remember as I'd like (a problem that even Picross 3D had). I've made a few mistakes in puzzles because I misread the symbol in a given hex. In a related note, it's also somewhat easy to forget which mouse button performs which function, causing stupid mistakes that get recorded in your level score. Hexcells does not have a time limit of any kind, so you are essentially free to brute-force your way through a puzzle if you so desire, but making mistakes reduces how many hexes you receive as a reward for that level, and Steam Achievement nuts will probably want to avoid doing that if possible, as there is an achievement awarded for getting a perfect score on every level.Presentationally speaking, Hexcells is simple and pleasing. The visuals are extremely minimalist (hexagons, and only hexagons); the only visual effects you'll be seeing are the tiny animations for shading or breaking hexes. The music is electronic ambience, in the style of Solar Fields (i.e. Mirror's Edge or Capsized), with the added effect that in-game sound effects are played on rhythm, a la Lumines or Rez. If I could complain about the presentation in any area, though, Hexcells does not provide a color-blind option (though I am not color-blind, I am unsure if the game's use of blue and orange would cause problems for those who are), and the low-contrast nature of the backgrounds makes the ""Menu"" button difficult to find.I am pleased to report that Hexcells performs admirably on both Windows and Linux, owing to its nature as a Unity game. I would presume that Macintosh support is also good, as a result. Both of my test machines (no slouches, admittedly) ran the game with no obvious slowdowns or graphical glitches. I'd wager most machines made in the last half-decade will work just fine; I suppose netbooks may be feasible as well, but as I do not have access to one right now, I cannot say for certain, so Your Mileage May Vary.About the biggest complaint I have about Hexcells, though, is that there are just not enough puzzles. Hexcells offers 6 ""worlds,"" with five puzzles each, and the last puzzle essentially acting as a credits reel. I finished the game in a little over an hour, though I have not achieved Perfect on every puzzle just yet.All that said, though, at $3 or less, Hexcells is certainly not a waste of your money. I'd like to see more logic-puzzle games like this on Steam.			"

												Hexcells presents a spin on the classic Minesweeper formula, but Hexcells quickly surpasses the iconic Windows game. While Minesweeper offered little in the way of guideance, Hexcells is brilliantly designed. Sharing elements of Picross, each puzzle can be logically solved with zero blind guessing. The ambient tones are a treat, and the zen atmosphere the game manufactures is well done and marries well with the elegant visual polish. The experience is short. Most players can finish the game and complete all achievements in 2-3 hours. Those wishing for more can buy the Hexcells Plus expansion, and hopefully, we can look forward to more expansions down the road.			"

In Short - A couple weeks ago I had a couple £ in my Steam wallet and was not sure what to buy. A friend pointed me to a small puzzle game called Hexcells. I was sceptical, but after buying & downloading it, I am glad I took the plunge. Not dissimilar to the old Windows game Minesweeper, Hexcells is a little Indie game created by a man by the name of Matthew Brown. There are two other Hexcells games, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite.  In Depth - It is not easy to explain Hexcells' concept in a review; you mainly learn as you go on. Through the later levels, you are taught extra rules and slowly the puzzles increase in difficulty. If you enjoy logical puzzles, you'll have a blast with Hexcells. No aspect of this game requires luck or guessing, every puzzle can be solved using your mind. Too easy for you? Keep going, the later puzzles are not only giant but also pretty darn hard. Of course, multiple people have created guides showing what to do in each if you want to cheat your way through, but that takes the fun out of it! In all, Hexcells is a calming puzzle experience that is perfect when you just want to chill out.  PROs and CONs - PROs -  A simple concept that gets expanded and twisted in later levels. The soundtrack is ambient and calming.  Enough levels to give you a decent amount of game time for the money spent.CONs -  A few times in which the gameplay gets repetitive. There is a little too much time between new mechanics being shown. Very little instruction when the game starts. I had literally no clue what I was doing at first. It took me a while... Not very simple to pick up and play. You have to relearn all the symbols the game teaches you once. Something that could be fixed with an 'instructions' section of the menu or even titlescreen. Finally There are tons of Indie puzzle games on Steam. Some succeed. Some fail. Some are absolutely horrible. Some are actually great. And Hexcells absolutely nails it. I love nearly everything about Hexcells. Thank you, Matthew Brown for making such a chill puzzle game that really hits the spot when I'm bored. Enjoy this review? Did it help you choose whether to buy the game or not?Join my group, Cipher's Take On for more reviews, and share your own too!~ _BillCipher   "

Hexcells could be considered a spiritual successor to the classic game Minesweeper.  Your goal is to determine which of the hexagonal cells on each grid should be marked blue, and which should be eliminated from the game, using the various clues given to you for each puzzle.Unlike that classic, however, there is always a way to logically determine how to solve the puzzles in Hexcells without making a mistake.  This sets it apart from games which use trial and error as a mechanic; while there is nothing wrong with trial and error, it's nice to see game that is designed thoughtfully enough to allow each level to be solved the first time without making a mistake for the observant.Hexcells falls into that category of games which are easy to pick up and play, but difficult to master.  Controlling the game could not be simpler; you need only use the mouse to confirm or erase cells and to navigate menus.  The overall design aesthetic is pleasing both visually and aurally, with nice ambient music accompanying each section of the game.  The music can easily be muted if you prefer, however.  There is also no pressure; you can take as long as you need to solve a particular puzzle, and it's easy to back out if you need to take a break.  All puzzles can be retried, and you can preview later stages as you unlock them through successful completion of the early stages.  The only possible criticism, as I have seen pointed out in reviews on-line, is that you can't determine which puzzles still need to be perfected once you've cleared many of them, unless you write them down or something.  Once a stage is cleared, its symbol in the puzzle index is marked blue, without any discerning marks to distinguish those you have perfected from those in which you made a mistake.Hexcells is not a short game, but it's primary downfall is that once you've played through a few times, the replay value goes down.  It's almost like the Portal series; once you have that initial moment of wonder and discovery as you solve each level, it wears off.  You can't have those moments of discovery ever again as you have basically figured out everything there is to learn after so long.But that doesn't mean you shouldn't give this game a try, and the price is right.  The puzzle design is very thoughtful; it's clear a lot of work went into each one to make sure that players can perfect them all.  This is the type of design that appeals to me.  Even if I make a mistake, I know I can come back later and re-examine the puzzle for the correct solution.  Unlocking all six achievements is absolutely possible time and practice, adding an additional layer of accomplishment.  If you like puzzle games, give Hexcells a try!8.0 / 10If you need some extra help with this game, check out my newly-published guide to Hexcells:

												One of the best puzzle games I've played.  It's a bit like minesweeper but without the frustration of logically impossible puzzles, and it's honestly much more fun and interesting.  It's simple to understand the basic rules/tricks but levels can definitely be tricky. Luckily there is always a logical next step based on the clues you get such as ""there is 2 blues touching this hexagon"" or ""there are 3 blues in this column and they are all touching each other"". The clues get more subtle as you go on, and by the end you need to combine multiple clues and always be considering what clues have now become relevant with your latest move.There's not a huge amount of puzzles, but the quality of them is good and the solutions/levels are nicely varied.  It's already a low price and in the sale it usually drops by a good margin, so it's definitely value for money whenever you decide to pick it up.			"

												If you had one of the older Microsoft Windows versions, than you might remember the game Minesweeper. You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.The Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.playing Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to ""calculate"" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.Later versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance. Start with the normal game and get infected, this game is addictive and you should consider buying the complete pack right from start.10/10 I think I've seen more hexagons than a beekeeper did "

												First things first: this game doesn't really have any replay value, and you will probably 100% it within 1.5 hours.That being said, this is a really good set of logic puzzles, drawing elements from both Minesweeper and Picross. Each puzzle is well-crafted, and there's a nice, smooth difficulty curve (with the last set being really satisfying to solve). The interface is simple and clean, and the visuals combined with the music and sound effects form a relaxing, aesthetically pleasing experience; it avoids being dull while also allowing you to focus on solving the puzzles.While it's disappointingly short, it's also appropriately priced (especially on sale, I bought it for one [1] American dollar). Definitely, 100% worth checking out if you like logic puzzles.			"

												I finished the whole thing and all of its thirty-ish levels in one day because it was that fun.  I'm exhausted.Hexcells is a logic puzzle that's similar to other number games like Minesweeper and Picross, as you use processes of elimination and deduction to fill in patterns of tiles.  The distinction here is that since the tiles are hexagons, they're not restricted by square grids, and most puzzles look like abstract shapes or very loosely defined objects.  Black-background hexes have numbers on them from 0-6, indicating how many of the gold tiles around them can be clicked to turn blue, which counts toward stage completion.Those hexes are a mixed blessing--finding all of them is the whole point of the game (though you do have to mark every single tile, whether you believe it to be a blue ""hit"" or a black ""guide""), but unless you know how many blue tiles are in a given area, these don't often give any information on the tiles around them.  The numbers themselves eventually adopt additional characteristics that give you more information on how to complete a stage, but it's well worth remembering that making a decision about one tile necessarily is effectively making a decision about all of the tiles next to it as well.  Levels are divided up into groups and sometimes able to be completed out of order, and completing each level perfectly will often mean you unlock the next set even without fully having to finish the previous one.The game is easy to learn, with simple controls and all of the rules explained as you need them, and there are no hectic time limits to worry about.  (I don't know if there's a way to save during levels.)  You'll probably build up enough stress just by trying to finish levels without making mistakes, as difficulty ramps up quickly and there's no quick way to restart stages, that I know of, without exiting back out to the level-select menu.  This may serve the purpose of discouraging cheating, though.  It would be nice to be able to turn the music on and off during a level, but the little 'bloop' sounds the tiles make when clicked go really well with the gentle soundtrack, so much so that you might not notice them at first.You can make guesses about what tiles are where, but it's much more satisfying to finish a stage or even a small section of one because you understood the rules than because you happened to get lucky.  The game doesn't need reflexes, but it expects and encourages patience and discipline (try not to scream if you misclick toward the end of a level you've been chipping away at for half an hour), all for the cost of a small meal.

												Deduction and puzzle game lover, here's a perfect game series for you!Hexcells is the first one of the series. In Hexcells the game area consists of hexes, each having zero to six neighbours. Hex is either blue or black with a number. Mechanics familiar from Mine Sweeper (MS), the number states how many blue hexes are next to the black hex. Your job is to reveal for all hexes whether they are blue or black.Unlike in traditional MS, everything can be deduced - guessing is not required at all if you know what you are doing. The controls are similar to MS, with left- and right-clicking determining whether you think the hex is blue or black one. Also, in case of a mistake you don't need to start at the beginning, though if you do more than one mistake, you have to start again if you want a ""perfect"" score (and ultimately an achievement).The learning curve is very smooth, the challenge rising gently towards later, larger puzzles. As you get further, new mechanics are introduced, with similarities to nonograms/hanjies: a number will state that a column or a diagonal will have certain number of blue hexes. There are two special cases to this that either say that all blue hexes will be interconnected or that they must have a break in-between. All mechanics naturally introduce new ways to think and deduce through the puzzles.Music is ambience like ""glowing crystals"", and when you make right moves there's a distinct ""ding!"" sound echo that adds fluidly to the ambience.All the 36 puzzles are well-designed and fairly interesting. This is also its biggest drawback: there is little replay value after beating all the puzzles, a task that takes just a couple of hours. The other drawback is the lack of a save feature (for single puzzles; game obviously remembers if you have beat a puzzle before), so you have to complete each puzzle fully or either leave the game running or start the level again later. If these features are a bottleneck for you, both of them are introduced in Hexcells Infinite, the third part of the series.If you're left craving for more, Hexcells Plus is the de-facto sequel. You should really play Hexcells first and only then go to Plus though, for the sequel is way more challenging and introduces all the mechanics from early on and even adds one new one. Hexcells Infinite is a good alternative to both: it has its own puzzles and all the mechanics and features from Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, but the challenge curve starts from easy like Hexcells and goes to difficult like Plus. In that respect it's more stand-alone than Plus sequel.All three are nevertheless good puzzle games. As for challenge, Hexcells is the easiest one and therefore the natural place to start. Also, it's a fairly cheap investment.			"

												Hexcells is a good way to kill time (about an hour's worth). The background music is very mellow so you know it can be relaxing. The game itself is quite easy but you do get a good amount of puzzles so it's not bad for the price. I recommend playing it in short intervals. 4/5If you found it too easy or too short then try the plus version.			"

												Nice game as an introduction to the series. I wish there were more puzzles at this difficulty. This game is easy and very short. Completed to 100% in less than 5 hours while tired and not thinking as fast as I would while fully awake. I think most will find the price is a bit high for the amount of content. Many say that the game mechanics are similar to minesweeper crossed with Picross (nonogram puzzles) on a hex grid. I would say instead of standard picross mechanics it is closer to the mechanics used in Picross 3D which are actually somewhat different than standard nonogram puzzles. At the end of each level, you are awarded with a certain amount of progress hexes which are used to unlock more levels. The amount of progress hexes earned depend on the difficulty of the level and the amount of mistakes you have made during the level. There is no way of knowing how many progress hexes there are for a specific level or, if you missed any in prior runs, how many are still left to earn. This is only indicated at the end of a level and can not be checked on again without completing the level once more. Note that Hexcells Plus has a much higher difficulty than this game and not just more puzzles at a similar difficulty. If you found this game too easy or think you may be ready to try to take on more challenging levels, go try that. Don't be fooled by how easy the first few levels are on Hexcells Plus. By level 12 you've already exceeded the difficulty of this game. If you've played Hexcells Plus, my advice is to not bother with this game unless you found that the difficulty curve was too steep and are looking for more simple levels to better get used to the basics of the mechanics.

												Hexcells is a fairly simple game, much of it employing a combination of mechanics from minesweeper and nonograms (Picross) on a non standard 2D grid. It is a logic game were rules of the levels are defined by numbered brackets (minesweeper style) that give information on whether nearby brackets are false or true. This is sometimes mixed in with column markers that do the same, but for a column (picross style). To deepen the gameplay a bit more, you are sometimes also presented with special rules beside the numbers which frankly, in my humble opinion, make minesweeper look like a joke. It feels like the kind of game you'd see in the crossword puzzle section in a digital newspaper of the future.It's all good fun, really. Perfectly balanced, not hard nor easy. If any of these aforementioned games interest you, give this a try. For the low price point the developers are asking, you owe it to yourself to play this. Took me a good two and a half hours to get to 100%.			"

												Even though I beat the whole game with only 1.6 hours, I felt this game as one the most intriguing puzzle game I've ever played. It's a bit like Minesweeper on Windows which many people may be familiar with, but it's much more complex than that since more innovative rules and level diversity have been added.The only shortcoming is too short for sure, and also if there's a  setting for level edit that players could share their own maps and challenge others, that would be wonderful.I personally enjoy Hexcells a lot as a puzzle game lover, and would like to recommend to those who think their brains need some Intellectual challenges.Hexcells[7/10]			"

												If you know Minesweeper well, you are familiar with playing Hexcells, because Hexcells is Minesweeper  in hexagonal! That means the hidden patterns are in hexagons and you have max. 6 possible neighbors to mark.Hexcells is amazing. There's a chillout soundtrack and you can run it in window mode or fullscreen. What it makes more challenging is that in higher levels the number of counting pattern cells in a line is viewed next to a cell. You can make horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines visible by clicking on these numers. You will need it to solve practible unsolvable mazes.Conclusion: It makes so much fun. This game is a musthave for every puzzle game freak! A few hours of Joy!			"

												I really enjoyed my time with Hexcells, it's a simple but very challenging puzzle game that can keep you entertained for hours. It's often refered to as a twist on the old game called Minesweeper, and in a sense it is fairly similar, but more challenging and definitely much more satisfying to play with it's ambient theme and elegant graphics style.The rules are simple enough to understand after the first few puzzles, with some more rules and features being introduced as you progress. Clear the orange hexes to reveal the patterns underneath, numbers indicate the amount of surrounded hexes that are part of the pattern. Complete each of the puzzles making as few mistakes as possible so that you can progress through to the next set.  There isn't much more to say about this game other than the fact that it is brilliant. Hexcells is one of the best puzzle games I have played in recent years and I am really glad that I picked it up in the Steam Sale to give it a try, for such a cheap price, it's more than worth it. Would definitely recommend this to any puzzle fans of any age.			"

												Hexcells is essentially an overall enhancement of Minesweeper. Where Minesweeper has mines, you have blue hexagons. Where Minesweeper has randomly generated puzzles that sometimes force you to guess, Hexcells has predesigned puzzles that always give you enough information to solve it without ever needing to guess. (Although sometimes it may feel otherwise.)Why go for Hexcells over Minesweeper when there's a limited set of puzzles? Hexcells' puzzles are incredibly well designed, starting simple and adding new mechanics as you move along. Beyond just telling you how many hexes nearby are blue, you get information on if they're all connected or not. Vertical or diagonal columns get similar treatment. Sometimes blue hexes have numbers in them, telling you how many blue hexes are in the surrounding area.Eventually, you have to combine these hints in creative ways to determine where the blue hexes are—or where they aren't. When you're finally able to combine them all to work your way to completion, it provides a level of satisfaction that Minesweeper just can't compete with.The only real downside to Hexcells is that it's pretty short—an acceptable downside, considering the price. Thankfully, Hexcells Plus (more puzzles) and Hexcells Infinite (more puzzles, a random puzzle generator, and player-created levels) are available, and getting the complete pack is incredibly affordable (and highly recommended), especially on sale.

Hexcells is a minimalistic logic puzzle very similar to classic Minesweeper. You need to find blue cells and numbers show you how many of them are nearby. What makes Hexcells better than Minesweeper? For one, there is no instadeath. If you make a mistake, you just keep going. Most importantly with a little bit (and sometimes with a lot) of thinking you can figure out where each blue cell is located. Unlike minesweeper where sooner or later you come to a point when you have to close your eyes and guess randomly. Music is very nice and the game itself is relaxing. The first game is short and puzzles are easy to crack. It took me ~3 hours to perfect all 36 levels. It helps to learn mechanics of the game but it won’t last long. I recommend buying Hexcells Complete Pack (Hexcells, Hexcells Infinite, Hexcells Plus) because you will definitely want more.			"

												This is a very good puzzle game.  It's certainly short, but the rules are very straightforward and make it so that at no time is it necessary to take a wild guess on where to go next.  There is always some way to figure it out logically, even if you have to look at it from a different angle or use your mind in a way that the game didn't bother to spell out for you.  I appreciate that all of the mechanics you need to understand are demonstrated in a simple tutorial level.  I really love how simplistic the design is as it streamlines what in other games could be bogged down and drawn out tutorials.  The different mechanics and rules that come up in the game adds more depth and possibilities for the puzzles, and does become more difficult towards the end of the game.  This is how Minesweeper should play, without the aspect of luck being necessary.  I'm looking forward to playing the next installment of this game.			"

												Puzzle games are easy to come by these days. Unfortunately, for every Tetris or Panel de Pon out there, sometimes you can get a puzzle game that feels like it's cheating you by not giving you all the hints you need to solve the puzzle or worse, requires you to guess your way through puzzles leaving them to sheer luck.Hexcells is not that game.It starts simple, as most puzzle games do with a number on a hexagon that tells you how many hexagons are directly adjacent to that one. From there, the game builds on its rules, adding layers of complexity at a nearly perfect pace. The puzzles in this game and its two sequels are truly fun and challenging to solve in a way that only the best puzzle games are, leading to what really makes the game special :Hexcells makes YOU feel smart. You start to see patterns and infer more information than is just presented to you plainly on the screen. Your brain naturally takes over and starts to work within the rules provided in the game in a way that really makes you feel like you've accomplished something when you complete a puzzle with no mistakes. Every puzzle in this game can be solved through logic, no guesssing required.Absolutely recommended as a great way to keep your mind in shape.			"

												This is one of those games that screams ""why didn't I think of that?"". At its core it may look like hexagonal minesweeper, but that is just the most visible aspect. You see, as a puzzle game, minesweeper has quite some randomness and, at times, guesswork. Hexcells manages to maintain and even improve the depth of that game while removing the randomness element. Every level is solvable, but at times, it introduces extra information about the columns or the adjacent blocks. But as you can guess, the trick to properly SOLVE the puzzle (meaning: reducing all guesses) is to combine the bits of data you have to come to clear knowledge on whether a block is a ""bomb"" (okay, ""part of the pattern"") or not.I haven't played plus or infinite yet, but it's not hard to see why other reviewers treat these games and this one as a single game. It's because it is. And to be frank: the only reason the developer gets away with it is because even the single parts are easily worth the small asking price (3 bucks? You can just as well call these games stand-alone DLC). So even with this warning, this is a very easy thumbs up. :-)			"

												This is a nice little puzzle game.  It will remind you a bit of the classic minesweeper game on Windows with some additional ways to calculate moves.  Overall, it was a short, fun diversion that you can complete within a few hours.			"

												This is a lovely logic game that I would describe as a mix between Minesweeper and Picross, but, thankfully, with none of the ""guessing"" that's needed in the former. It's presented very nicely with spare but pretty visuals, an ambient soundtrack, and little touches like your actions creating different sounds (so if you solve the puzzle quickly enough, it sounds like you make little songs). It's not very long or very hard (it took me ~100 minutes to finish with 99% hexes--my only mistakes being when I accidently clicked the wrong button), but it's sweet while it lasts :)			"

												Hexcells is a fun if very short logic puzzler.  The objective is to reveal the number of blue hexes in each puzzle level.  There are only thirty or so puzzles to beat and the game can be completed in a few hours.  Early levels are relatively easy to complete but as you can imagine the last few are pretty complex to overcome without making a mistake.  Each level begins with some hexes providing some initial clues as to where the first blue hexes may be found.  Numbered hexes reveal the number of possible adjoining blue hexes.  Additional elements such as connected or unconnected chains, blues in a row providing additional clues.  Together with these assisting functions the player must use their powers of deduction to complete each puzzle without making a mistake.  Though each puzzle is entirely solvable, trial and error is possible though making a mistake with affect a ""perfect"" completion. If you arent a whizz with logic or deduction then you will become frustrated on these harder levels.  The fun though is completing each puzzle entirely through deduction rather than through trial and error.I thought it was very enjoyable though personally I preferred LYNE.			"

												I'm loving this one.  Pure logic puzzles.  To oversimplify, the game is like 6-sided Minesweeper without the random elements, with elements of Sudoku entering the later levels.  Every puzzle can be solved without guessing.  There's a clear difficulty progression through the levels.  Low stress too, since if you get one wrong, the board doesn't blow up - you just increment an error counter.The ONLY thing wrong is the lack of a random level generator.  Once you beat the included levels, you're done.  But looking at the value (time/money), it's still a great deal.  (And the follow-on game, Hexcells Plus, is also cheap and just as excellent, with slightly higher difficulty.)Very highly recommended.			"

												A modern classic of a puzzle game let down only by short length, and lack of a level generator or level editor/workshop support. A fantastic advertisement for Hexcells Plus, and Matthew Brown's games in general.When this started, I was thinking (as apparently everyone else does) ""updated Minesweeper, with better music and graphics.""As more gameplay mechanics were introduced, I stopped thinking about minesweeper - this is something mch, much more intelligent and much, much more involving. It's still a game where you're deducing the position of tiles that should be left-clicked and ones that should be right-clicked, but the ways you determine which are which change as the game progresses, allowing for some intricate and elegant puzzle solving.The new gameplay elements represent both a challenge and a tool, meaning the game feels incredibly well-balanced - you're unlikely to ever throw your hands up because something became too complicated. Rules are added as if the entire game were a complete tutorial, to the point that in the later stages, you notice the position of something at a different angle to before, and you instantly understand what this means.All new rules are introduced with a mini-tutorial puzzle so you get the chance to try them out on the small stage before moving on to a larger-scale puzzle. You can restart and replay levels, which is great if you're like me and have the kind of fingers that left-click when you wanted them to right-click. I think I had one level where I made the same one mistake 5 times, just through being cackhanded... and it's not like I've never played any Portal game, so the blame is squarely at my feet for any frustration I experienced there. That's a nice thing about this puzzle game - it's very friendly, very calming. I complained only at myself (for having stupid fingers, or for making a dumb move), never, ever at the game.The game looks beautiful - cool colors, minimalist layout - my only gripe is that the menu text looked a bit washed out on my screen - it took a while to be able to see the 'Quit' text - for example - and the music is excellent, accompanied by ambient chimes that play in tune with the music - if you wanted to you could turn the solving of a level into a pretty pleasing musical performance with a little practice.Achievements are slightly bugged, in that you'll only get them (or at least I only did) the next time you start the game and continue your last save slot. And that's where the game has its biggest letdown - as I understand it, it only has 6 worlds. Not getting the achievements the first time through, made me think that perhaps each world was made up of 6 sets of puzzles, and that the numbers on the homescreen represented the first 3 worlds. Not so. I've unlocked the final world just now, and my game is registering around 2.2 hours played - and that includes leaving the game running for at least half an hour while I did something else.There's probably 2 hours of gameplay for most people in this, which you may feel is not enough to justify whatever price is being charged. I got this via the Bundlestars Indie Capsule 2, so at most it was around $5 (if I ignored all the other games in that bundle), and I feel that was definitely worth the price. To sum up - Hexcells is a game that seems at once familiar and modern, is challenging without being frustrating, looks good, sounds good, is good value for money, and is a satisfying gameplay experience that leaves you wanting more of the same. Get it. It is good.			"

												Do you like Minesweeper? How about Sudoku? Do you like logic and deduction puzzles involving numbers? Then let me introduce you to Hexcells. It’s a short and reasonably priced game that will give your brain some much needed exercise involving a bunch of “Aha!” moments.It starts off like Minesweeper, but then gradually adds more and more layers of complexity. The gameplay involves deducing whether the hexes need to be saved or destroyed. Black hexes contain numbers that you can use to determine if there are blue hexes (the ones you mark/save). For example, if you have a 0 hex, then 0 hexes around it need to be saved while a 3 hex means 3 hexes must be saved. You do that for a while until the game starts throwing symbols and numbers on the outside at you. A 2 at the top of a column means there are two hexes to save in that column. A -2- in a hex means that there are two hexes to save that cannot be adjacent to each other. The trailer is good about showing the gameplay. Not a single puzzle relies on guesswork. It’s all about your brain processing the information so that you don’t make mistakes. My playtime reflects the time it took me to have 0 mistakes on all the puzzles.If number logic puzzles are your thing, then Hexcells really is a good choice of game that’ll last you a couple days. "

												Hexcells is an excellent game, I just made the mistake of playing the sequel first.Hexcells, as the name implies, is all about hexagonal cells. Using logic you need to determine which of the orange hexes are blue underneath. You do this by using Minesweeper-like logic where a non-blue hex will tell you how many adjacent hexes are blue.All the puzzles are completely logical and do not require guess work, which is a critical part of any good puzzle game.As you progress through the 6 words some extra tricks are introduced that make the puzzles more complicated and more fun (for people who have already played Plus, everything you've seen there except the numbered blue hexes and the ?-hexes).Should you get this game?Generally: yes.If you've already played Plus: As long as you don't expect to be challenged.If you can only afford one of the Hexcells games: Maybe get Plus instead.

												I was very happy to discover this game via my Steam Queue. Having spent a great many hours playing minesweeper back in the days, it was great to discover a game that fulfilled all the enjoyment minesweeper offered, but without the frustration of having to randomly guess (and possibly die) to complete the puzzle.Pros- Good puzzle game requiring some thought to solve the harder levels- Making mistakes isn't a problem - you can keep going and complete level- 1 'free' mistake every puzzle - you get full amount of hexcells which is good when you accidentally click left instead of right!- All levels are completely solvable without guessing (seriously, anyone posting otherwise just hasn't figured out the puzzle - they're all solvable through pure logic, no guesswork required)- Relaxing music, which is even interactive with each click.- Has sequels to give you more puzzles to play once you finish!Cons- Short, I finished with 100% in under 3 hrs. However, you can pick it up as part of the Hexcells package with the two sequels for cheap, which gives you plenty of game play.- Left-click/right-click can sometimes mix you up, so you click the wrong button. Can cause frustration when you're trying to get 100% if you're the type of person who hates doing puzzles over again.- Addictive - not really a con, but once I started, I couldn't stop....Recommended!

												I'm a fan of Minesweeper and the game is really fascinating.. for me.At first, the author(s) changed gameplay in a very interesting way. It's not about hexes. They changed numbers (bomb-number in Minesweeper) and they mean in some cases a bit differ. As a result, you need use familiar logic, but differently.The second gameplay feature is that designer(s) made fixed levels which are created by hand. It sounds strange for classic Minesweeper, but here it's amazing. The author(s) made up tricky and interesting levels. You can pass all of them without single step on bomb, but you need to think and the answers make you feel great.Achievement hunters will be delighted to get to know the game. You can easily get all of achievements in three games, and they cost little money (specially with discount).If you want to play or check it, I recommend to buy ""Infinite"" version. The most trickiest and interesting levels are there, and there is inifinite game and you can endlessly relax and enjoy it, as much as you like.			"

												Excellent mini game to keep the old dying brain cells alive.The concept is super simple. The UI is so subtle and minimalistic. Sound and music fits right in with the slickness of it all. It's so well done.The puzzles increase in difficulty as you progress. Every time a new concept is introduced, it is explained with a single sentence. No need for lengthy tutorials here. Also, every puzzle can be solved by logic alone. You don't have to guess.Eventually you will get to a level where you just sit and stare at the screen, desperately trying to find an opening. When you finally find that opening, you can't help but feel a little cool. You make a couple of moves, only to get stuck again. That's when you realize there is more to the logic than what meets the eye. You learn to think outside the boxes.. or hexes, if you will. When you perfect a level that otherwise seemed impossible to do, you feel like a genius.Any game that makes me feel like a genius deserves a big thumbs up.			"

												As soon as I started playing this charming puzzle game I fell in love. Hexcells is basically a mix between Minesweeper and Picross which works shockingly well. My favorite part about these puzzles is that they're all designed to be solved logically. Even though it might seem like it at times, you're actually never required to guess. The sound in this game is amazing too: Unlocking cells is incredibly satisfying because the resulting sound syncs with the great ambient music.The only downside is that it's short and only gets remotely challenging towards the end, but the sequel Hexcells plus ramps up the difficulty enormously and you can get both bundled cheaply. The third game I have yet to play, but apparently it allows for user created and randomized puzzles (that are still 100% logically solvable).If you get any enjoyment at all from puzzle games, get this ASAP.

												A very short puzzle game which increases in difficulty the more levels you unlock and play. Graphics: 10/10It shows itself in a minimalistic way with almost only 5 colours present at the screen at the same time. With this, it achieves a simple yet deceiving look. Storyline: 1/10It has NONE at all. Just do the puzzles and finish the game. No story to be seen here.Sound: 10/10The soundtrack is really ambient. You would hardly notice it due to the fact that you are concentrating so hard to complete the puzzle. But if you take the time to listen to it, it sounds very good, even for a £2 puzzle game. I am impressed by this. Gameplay: 10/10If you’ve played Minesweeper before, this uses the same concept, but it is a lot more forgiving and a lot more relaxing as it doesn’t put you in pressure. Other than that, it has a smooth gameplay with absolutely no lag whatsoever. Price: 10/10At only £1.99, this game is totally worth the price. It even comes in a bundle with 2 other games if you’re interested in getting those as well. (You save money if you get that). If not, you can wait until it goes on sale and get it for a VERY cheap price.			"

												It's not a bad little puzzle game, but you get far more for free from Simon Tatham's puzzle collection:http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/There's nothing in the collection that's a direct clone of Hexcells, but playing games from the collection will spark similar enjoyment as Hexcells. Hexcells will only last you a few hours, but Simon Tatham's puzzles will accumulate to days worth of play time.			"

												I highly recommend this game, especially at it's current holiday on-sale price of $1.01. It's like minesweeper and picross had a baby, and it's more elegant and well-made than either one. It will give you those enjoyable ah-ha moments where the solution reveals itself before your eyes and you can't believe you didn't see it before. It took me 3.4 hours to get perfect scores on every puzzle in this game, so it's also a bonus if you want to get 100% achievements on a game for once in your life. If this description sounds good to you, do yourself a favor and buy Hexcells Plus and Infinite, too. They add more and harder puzzles. Play it!			"

												This is the first of a trilogy of Hexcell games, and you should definitely play this one before attempting the others.  It sets the foundation for the remainder of the trilogy.The way I'd describe Hexcells is that it's a brainy love child of Minesweeper and Sudoku.  The puzzles are all solvable, despite how frustrated you might originally get when attempting them.  There is a nice endorphin rush when you realize you've figured out which cell to click on next because you made a second-level deduction that isn't immediately obvious.  However, the first time you play you'll probably just accept that you made a mistake and keep going.  When you're done, you'll want to do it all over again, but trying for the ""Perfectionist"" achievement (no mistakes).  Even if you do make a mistake, you can simply start the level over again to try it mistake-free.Hexcells probably has about 2-3 hours of game play in it, but you might come back to try again for that achievement...I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys logic puzzles or spatial puzzles.  When you are done, you'll immediately want to pick up the next game in the series (Hexcells Plus).			"

												I found this in my Humble Bundle library after looking for games that I never redeemed. Thank goodness I found this one. If you're into mathematical puzzle games, this is probably one of the best ones you can get. The difficulty curve is damn near perfect, and the mechanics and methods of solving puzzles gradually reveal themselves (aside from basic instructions such as what some numbers and symbols mean) in a manner that feels like a natural progression based off what you know. My only complaint is that this game alone is too short; if you're left feeling incomplete, which you probably will if you enjoy the game, the Plus and Infinite expansions are absolutely essential for increased difficulty and nifty new mechanics. Highly recommended.			"

												What can I say about Hexcells? After watching a video NerdCubed did on Hexcells, I decided to pick it up, seeing as it was on sale for £0.67, and I wasn't disappointed. This game is essentially Minesweeper meets Sudoku. From time to time, you have to carefully use elements of both games to complete each puzzle. Honestly, if you have a head for puzzles, this game isn't going to last you very long (for me, just under 3 hours), but for £0.67, you can't ask for too much. Overall, a great puzzle game.			"

												Hexcells is like one of those Sudoku books you pick up in the airport: it completely enthralls you when you need it to, but once you're done there's absolutely no reason to revisit it.  If you like Sudoku, this is definitely a puzzle game that you will enjoy. Mechanically, it feels somewhat like Minesweeper, except that no guessing is ever needed--every puzzle can be solved logically.  I felt the first Hexcells game was maybe a little too easy, but Hexcells Plus was a great follow-up that left me feeling thoroughly satisfied.			"

												A very interesting and fun puzzle game that reminds a lot of minesweeper with a hexagonal grid (and probably a few other logic-based games). There are more rules, meaning that there is potential for much harder puzzles than minesweeper can offer, but since there are no randomly generated levels, the amount of time you'll spend on this game is minimal. Said potential is not reached, so the game is never really challenging, which does nothing to increase the length. (I had no problems completing all the puzzles in around 1.6 hours, so you could easily play through it in one sitting.) Still, there is one huge advantage: guessing is never required. Guessing is the one thing I really hate in minesweeper - of which I am a big fan, regardless - and to play a similar game without it simply feels wonderful.I find that the sounds fit the game nicely; they feel calm and soothing and play short melodies as you click the tiles. This, along with the focus on number of errors rather than time spent (I'm looking at you, minesweeper clock), makes the game feel very relaxing, despite it being a puzzler.Pros:+ No guessing+ Nice, relaxing soundsCons:- Too short- Too easy- No randomly generated levelsIf you like minesweeper (and/or similar games) this game is definitely worth the purchase. If not, I'd recommend you to try it anyway, since the game is quite cheap. For those who fancy something more difficult (and thus longer), Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite increase the difficulty by several notches, fixing the first two cons mentioned above. (As you might also guess, the last one also has randomly generated levels, although they are significantly easier than the rest of the game.) In that case, this one might serve as a short introduction to the concept.			"

												I adore Hexcells. In all honesty, the game isn't that difficult. There are a few tricky spots, but mostly the puzzles are rather easy. For me it's about 90 minutes of gameplay to totally max it out and get a perfect on every level.But it's 90 minutes I enjoyed. The puzzle mechanics are fun, the music is lovely, the graphics are great. It all comes together very nicely.Cheaper than a movie ticket, and good replay value -- the puzzles are still fun to go back and do again. (This is actually my second playthrough, as I completed the game once before prior to its Steam release.) If you ever enjoyed Minesweeper, give this a go.I do hope there's a second puzzle pack released at some point, I'd love to play some more new levels!EDIT: Apparently, there is also a Hexcells Plus which has different content in it. It is a much harder version of the game, so I'd still like a second puzzle pack with more regular Hexcells puzzles!			"

A Change in OpinionThis is an edit, and below I have preserved my original review because most of what I say is still valid. Since I wrote the original review, I have ended up purchasing Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite, and in light of those two sequels, I decided I really ought to change my recommendation of the original game from not recommended to recommended. It may be too easy, but it's a great introduction to the concept and more than worth getting if you go for the Hexcells bundle.The following is my original review:At the Time of WritingGame: HexcellsPrice: $3.29*Genre: PuzzleTime Played: <2 hoursPersonal Enjoyment Rating: ☺☺☺☻☻(out of 5)GeneralAlthough on the whole, I really enjoyed this game, there really isn't enough of it, and certainly not for $3 when it only amused me for a little under 2 hours. I am a logic puzzle fan, and I found the puzzles to be too few and too simple. They were only just barely starting to get interesting when the game ended. At the time of writing this review, the steam achievements are somewhat broken. Closing the game and opening it again will trigger the achievements. However this meant that during my one game session, I was lulled into a false sense of security that I was only in world 1 because no achievement for unlocking world 2 had popped up. This made the end of the game very abrupt because I thought there were going to be another 5 worlds yet!Now, I know that there is an expansion to this called Hexcells Plus. Despite how much I enjoy the concept, I feel that charging another $3 for those extra puzzles is a bit rich. I didn't enjoy the first game enough to warrant purchasing the next pack when I can buy an entire book of Japanese logic puzzles for about the same (which takes a lot longer to complete, are harder, and don't require a computer to do).In all fairness, if you wanted to give this a shot, it was very very enjoyable whilst it lasted. Although the tutorial levels seemed to take up half of the entire game, they were paced almost perfectly. So whilst I might ultimately (and regretfully) be giving this a thumbs down, my reason for doing so is not due to the concept or the quality of the game, but rather the lack of quantity and difficulty considering the pricing. Perhaps this would be an excellent game for someone who is new to logic puzzles, or for amusing a brainy child.GameplayThe concept of the game is very interesting and has great potential. I feel it is best described as a cross between Minesweeper and Hanjie**. Whilst there are cells that you can think of as being ""mines"" making a mistake doesn't mean you instantly lose the level, it just counts as a mistake. In addition, depending on how the numbers are presented, some ""mines"" are consecutive, and others must not be consecutive.ControlsA simple mouse game, left click and right click are used. I found the designations counter-intuitive and made many silly mistakes because I clicked the wrong button. After finishing the game, and reopening it I discovered that you can rebind the two actions (mark a cell & uncover a cell) in the configuration screen that pops up before the game itself opens. However, this was really too late and it makes no sense why such a basic option is not accessible inside of the game in a prominent location (even if it were as simple as switching what the mouse buttons do).StorylineNo storyline, doesn't need one.SoundRelaxing gentle zen echoie noises. Also, when you click a cell you get nice tinkling chime-like noises. I don't know why that makes it more satisfying to click on cells, but it does!GraphicsVery crisp, clean, and clear. The numbers are reasonably large. Some puzzles form an interesting overall image or pattern, but that really isn't a necessity in my opinion. I'd rather have some hard puzzles. But overall, the puzzles come across as well designed.Pros+ crisp clean graphics whose job is to be functional+ simple controls to grasp+ more interesting concept than random old MinesweeperCons- expensive for what it is- not enough puzzles- puzzles are too simple/easy- switching the mouse button actions is hidden outside the gameHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.Rothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot comFootnotes*The prices I give are in CDN because that's what I see.

												I got this when it was out on Desura, and I thoroughly enjoyed it then. It's a very mellow, zen game which is easy to pick up, and the rules of play are introduced slowly enough that you're not overwhelmed by them. Each puzzle has a completely logical progression all the way to the finish (unlike Minesweeper, which it's similar to in terms of basic gameplay).Only real complaint is that there aren't more puzzles, or a random puzzle generator to give it some more replayability. For those that want more, there's Hexcells Plus with some new puzzles, and Hexcells Infinite as well.			"

												Fun Puzzle game, I recommend it.For all but two or three levels I was able to complete it without guessing at all. Which was the point of the game, each next step is there waiting to be discovered.I had to guess on levels 5-4 and 6-2, but only once each.Two things I'd like to see. First: please make it easy to figure out which levels have perfect score, and which ones don't... I'm at 99% done and it bugs me!Second: please put Level 5-4 inside the level, instead of Level 24 for example. It would be so much easier to keep track of where I'm at like that.Overall Rating 4/5			"

												For $3, you may be hesitant to buy this game, because it looks like Minesweeper.  It's a lot more than that, though, and it has some nice, relaxing tunes.  The game is a little too short, so I would not recommend buying it at full price.  However, it's part of a few bundles, and it will be on sale every now and then.  Good game for a buck; pushing it at $3.			"

												Hexcells is really a fantastic game and value for logic puzzle fans.  The game is similar to Minesweeper with a few changes.  First, one mistake doesn't end the game, (and in fact a single mistake still gives ""full"" score.   Second the grid is made out of hexagons rather than squares.  Instead of the eight neighboring blocks, there's the 6 neighboring grid squares. Third, there's a number of different solving techniques and clues.  Whether it be connected numbers, disconnected numbers, or just hints about rows. Finally the game is based on perfectly solvable grids, rather than random (and potentially unsolvable) puzzles.   The game contains 36 levels, and they range in difficulty, but they're all quite well done. There's two sequels that are more difficult, for someone who's looking for a real challenge, but as a introduction to the game, Hexcells does a fantastic job, and at a realistic price. (I would recommend all three games)			"

												Hexcells is a polished modern variation on the old Microsoft Minesweeper game. Although it is much gentler, rather than game-ending bombs the player is identifying certain hexes. If a mistake is made then it is just recorded and the game continues. There is no timer or time limit, nor any way of scoring other than the number of mistakes made. The puzzles are hand-designed (no randomness) and provide a couple of hours of thought to perfect with mix of basic logic and memory (as the puzzles do not change if restarted). It is a nicely polished game with clean graphical style and nicely responsive music. It has no replayability, but it is cheap and well made. Definitely worth picking up in a sale or bundle, as I will be doing with its sequels.

												Hexcells is a minesweeper with 0% luck and 100% guess, hexagons instead of squares and (far) better graphics. The rules are quickly and efficiently explained, leaving you to focus on solving the puzzles.As the first of the Hexcells serie, it has (almost) all the refinements of the two latter games but severly lack in length due to a low level of difficulty. It took me less than three hours to finish the whole game and collect all the achievements, and at this point there was no reason for me to replay it.Still, this game is worth playing but I would recommend to buy it as part of the Hexcells pack and/or on sales.

												I played through this whole thing in one sitting today (around 3 hours).  I always thought Minesweeper was a better game than it was given credit for, and Hexcells improves on Minesweeper in pretty much every way.  There is no guessing in Hexcells, everything is completely 100% solvable.  There are also some interesting new mechanics at play, like seeing the ""mine"" count for certain rows or columns, or getting information beyond just a number, like whether all the adjacent mines are touching each other or not.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this, and I'm looking forward to trying out the other Hexcells games soon.Side note-- the function of the left and right click are swapped from how they are in Minesweeper.  If you have played a decent amount of Minesweeper, do yourself a huge favor and swap the Hexcells controls before you start playing.  I didn't, and it screwed with me more than I'd care to admit.

												The whole Hexcells series are really great puzzle games. The blame is totally on you for any mistakes you may make. They give you all the tools to figure out each puzzle if you can figure out the logic. The learning curve for figuring out that logic is spot on. Ideally play through the series straight, as the second and third game do start with more complicated puzzles and slightly new variations sooner. The feel as you go through a puzzle is likewise great. Occasionally you may get stuck for a solid length of time. The payoff is well worth it though. When you figure out a new bit, you get a solid rush as you suddenly can tick through another dozen cells with the new information provided.Only two small complaints for the whole series. There is no separate toggle for the music and sound effects. Fortunately the music track is quiet enough that you can play something else over it and mostly not notice it. The music is nice and mellow if you want that, but not really the most engaging when you are stuck at the same spot for a long while. I went with the Classical Complete Works station from Pandora and it suited the mood quite well.Second, the puzzles towards the end get quite long and there is no means to save mid puzzle that I could find. I assume this was so that you couldn't cheese your way to perfection. I would prefer the game at least give you the option to save in the middle if you were quitting and have the save auto-delete when you continue to prevent that. They did implement this in Infinite though. 5/5			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)I recommend that you buy the Hexcells Complete Pack with all 3 games - that's why this review text is identical for all 3.It's a great puzzle game series that strongly reminds of Microsoft Minesweeper, but not only is the grid hexagonal (meaning 3 instead of 2 axes), the games even go well beyond mere neighbor-field estimation.The levels eventually get very hard, and the procedural mode in ""Hexcells Infinite"" that exists in addition to the hand-crafted levels all three games have is a bit too chaotic (and hard) for my personal taste - well, it's procedural, its levels are not nicely designed and organized like the other levels.Anyway, since I wanted more of the easier puzzles and especially of the feature that numbers at the grid's periphery say something about the grid's content, I made a (very crappy) puzzler[dreamspace-president.com] in a few hours after finishing the Hexcells games that helps a bit with those needs.Hey, Matthew Brown, if you ever make a game like this again, I'm very likely to buy it, and I bet there's a bunch of people out there who think alike.For those who like this kind of puzzle game, I can't recommend the Hexcells games enough.

												It isn't all that bad. Think of it as the love child of picross and mine sweeper, except that child grew up to be a bit simple and shallow. So although it looked ok as a young adult and some some people kind of fancied it, ultimately it is a one night stand kind of person and not a real candidate for a long term relationship.So you can have sex with this game for a couple of hours, but it is never going to be ""good sex"". You'd probably be best just firing one off in the bathroom to be honest. But if it is already in your house and you have nobody better to call on? Yeah why not, sure.Just be careful because the mechanic of marking each cell is a little fiddly and you will frequently make silly mistakes. You will get used to it, but it is a bit of a distraction when a proven method for ""flagging"" a cell is available (rather than committing to it). It holds the game back a little, but otherwise it does the job. "

												Hexcells is a clever puzzle game. It's very similar to Minesweeper, but with hexagons. I played the game on Linux and it worked flawlessly. I didn't encounter a single bug.The first few puzzles are easy and a bit boring, but they build up to the great ones at the end. To make things more interesting, I exited out of a puzzle every time I made a mistake and did not allow myself to guess, even though I had partially completed the puzzle before. It was frustrating, but it made the experience of finishing the game more satisfying.I'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes games like Minesweeper or Sudoku and anyone wants to exercise their puzzle solving abilities a bit.

												Traditional Rating - 93/100Recommendation - Minesweeper fans rejoice!!Remember the free old Windows game Minesweeper? Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"" whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing?WELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue. Hexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess.The levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying.Speaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it.The Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite.It's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun.I highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.Scratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!

Use the numbers on the hexes to determine which of the surrounding hexes are part of the pattern, rinse and repeat. Then the game throws in new ideas such as consecutive and nonadjacent hexes that force you to reconsider how you approach the problem. The last few puzzles are real mind-teasers! The best part is that there's NO GUESSING INVOLVED. You can logic your way through every puzzle in this game. It's simple enough to get you hooked, but challenging enough to keep you invested.

(Might be quicker for you eggheads out there -- I'm no whiz at puzzle games). The last few puzzles are challenging, but very do-able and entertaining throughout. Highly recommended.BTW, if you like this game, do check out its two sequels, ""Hexcells Plus"" and ""Hexcells Infinite."" Both feature slightly more difficult puzzles than does this one, making this essentially a warm-up for those two (though it's still capable of standing on its own).			"

												They should rename this game ""The Science of Deduction"".Slow, deliberate deduction makes for the most satisfying puzzles because, unlike with most puzzles, the answer isn't found in guessing the designers intentions through trial and error. The answer comes solely from your ability to apply elementary logic. That's not to suggest this game is lacking in challenge. As it progresses, the elements of logic coalesce into molecules and you'll routinely need to retain and apply handfuls of algebraic deductions just to make a single correct move. If Sherlock Holmes played any one game, it'd be this one. I can't think of a game short of a Baldur's-Gate-2-caliber genre-definer that I would recommend more. The pleasure of gradually breaking through each puzzle is exquisite.P.S. If you intend to look up hints/solutions like some (read: many) of the forum dwellers, simply give up on life instead.			"

												Hexcells is a simple logic puzzle game. While it starts off very easy, it later on can get a bit more complicated, often taking me a while to ""see"" some clue I was missing.I've had this on my library for a long time, and only recently have I decided to play it, after Kami.This is more up my alley. The game can be very formulaic, perhaps, as there's never the need to ""guess"" any move. If you observe the board carefully, you'll have everything you need to make the next correct move. Initially, I didn't think it was that good, most levels being rather short and obvious. Thankfully, things got more complicated, levels bigger, and the game proved very satisfactory!It's very similar to minesweeper, although there's no losing. You won't touch a bomb and restart. Instead, you'll have +1 mistake, that later affects how many gems you get, for completionists' sake.The game also has various sets of puzzles, introducing a new mechanic between each one, keeping things interesting, without overwhelming the player with everything at once.Puzzle-wise, it's alright. I enjoyed it, but it's nothing mind blowing, in my opinion.What makes it stand out, for me, is the audio design. It's amazing! It's very minimalist, but it works really well!With most puzzle games, I just have my own music on... in the case o Hexcells, it felt rather out of place. There's an ambient track constantly playing in the background, but your actions in the game produce sound-effects in sync with the background track and create a great sense of ""atmosphere"", even in a puzzle game!It's something I rarely see in videogames that aren't music related. They tend to ignore how sound and music is important, so Hexcells is a breath of fresh air, to me!For that reason, above all else, I'll recommend this game. Looking at the developer's games, it seems indeed that sound always plays an important role, so I'll definitely be looking out for me! Elegant is a good word to describe it, I'd say.			"

												Of all the Hexcells games, this probably my favorite. It just felt more functional but, eh I'm weird. Basically your playing a game that's Stratego and Minesweeper's step child. It can be interesting and a lot of fun, but there's always that one spot where you're not sure if it should be blue or black.Pros:-Simpliciticaly complex :3-Easy perfect game-Nice in game soundsCons:-Some puzzles will have one spot left up to chanceOverall, I'd give it a 8/10.

												This game is pretty (both in terms of its clean visuals and ambient soundtrack), fun, and offers zen-like satisfaction, but if you're into puzzle games I very much recommend buying it as part of the complete pack. This, the first game in the trilogy, is little more than a glorified tutorial, and only has one or two levels that pose any real challenge - I got 100% in three hours. Maybe you'd buy this game to find out if you want the other two, but spoiler: you do. The other two are where the meat of the game lives.I'm going to recommend this, but with a caveat: I highly recommend this if you consider the whole trilogy as one game (it is very reasonably priced as ""one game""), but I don't really recommend this title in isolation.

												This series is criminally overlooked.If you enjoy games like sudoku, you will thoroughly enjoy Hexcells. While a naive comparison, the game plays similarly to a very advanced Minesweeper. By the second act, though, you'll have discovered the futility of that comparison; this game is on an entirely different level and has an elegance in the solutions that random Minesweeper puzzles cannot ever hope to achieve.The soundtrack is quite relaxing. It's really fun when you get on a ""roll"" of solving the puzzle, too, because you generate little ditties as a reward.The entire Hexcells series contains puzzles that are among the greatest I've ever solved. I highly recommend the entire collection, and also very strongly recommend that you start with this one. Don't worry if you breeze through this installment; I put a little over three hours into this one and Plus took me over 15. All of the concepts you'll need to beat the series are introduced here, too, so there are no surprises down the road -- it's almost like a tutorial.Definitely worth your purchase.			"

HexcellsPROsWhat I like about Hexcells is, that you never have to guess... there is always at least one fact that lets you be sure your next move is correct. Still, it is difficult enough to keep you engaged. The music is nice and relaxing. For me this title was the perfect filler for in between appointments and to come down in the evening.CONsIt can be very very short (I guess less than one hour) if you rush through it and make a lot of mistakes (which help reveal the right solutions). I took it serious and tried to find all the solutions myself to get all the achievements which took me about three hours. But cost-benefit-wise it was totally worth it, it cost me about 1€ and now that I got to know it I'd gladly pay more for the next one (in fact, I already bought the sequel).CONCLUSIONMore please!

												Hexcells is a singleplayer puzzle game, in the vein of Minesweeper, except using a hexagonal grid. Tiles will contian numbers, which indicates the number of tiles which they border which need to be flagged - you mark those tiles, and logically work to clear the board. In later levels, there are other rules which apply (totals for columns, requiring the markers to be contiguous or explicitly non-contiguous, etc).Hexcells is a rather easy game - I was able to complete it in roughly an hour and a half without difficulty. Hexcells Plus, another game by the same developer, takes what was started in this game and makes it into a much harder, more complete experience. If you're looking for a nice, simple puzzler that's similar to Minesweeper? Sure, this game will scratch that itch. It's not difficult, though. If you're looking for more of a challenge? Feel free to take a pass and go straight for Hexcells Plus.			"

												I was expecting this game to be a minesweeper rip-off, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it's not. The basic mechanic is the same. Use the numbers on the hexes to determine which of the surrounding hexes are part of the pattern, rinse and repeat. Then the game throws in new ideas such as consecutive and nonadjacent hexes that force you to reconsider how you approach the problem. The last few puzzles are real mind-teasers! The best part is that there's NO GUESSING INVOLVED. You can logic your way through every puzzle in this game. It's simple enough to get you hooked, but challenging enough to keep you invested. Too bad it's so short!			"

												They should rename this game ""The Science of Deduction"".Slow, deliberate deduction makes for the most satisfying puzzles because, unlike with most puzzles, the answer isn't found in guessing the designers intentions through trial and error. The answer comes solely from your ability to apply elementary logic. That's not to suggest this game is lacking in challenge. As it progresses, the elements of logic coalesce into molecules and you'll routinely need to retain and apply handfuls of algebraic deductions just to make a single correct move. If Sherlock Holmes played any one game, it'd be this one. I can't think of a game short of a Baldur's-Gate-2-caliber genre-definer that I would recommend more. The pleasure of gradually breaking through each puzzle is exquisite.P.S. If you intend to look up hints/solutions like some (read: many) of the forum dwellers, simply give up on life instead.			"

Posted: May 9, 2016
												Hexcells is a logic puzzle, similar in some ways to minesweeper or pic-a-pix/gridders/nonograms/macross/whatever other name you use for those games - you have to figure out which parts of the board are blue versus yellow, using logic based on numbers inside the cells (referring to how many blue cells touch it) and numbers on the outside of the cells (referring to how many blue cells are in that column). Then some numbers are marked to let you know if the blue cells have to be all continuous or have at least one space in them.It's a fun game, but very short.  The puzzles increase in difficulty at a decent rate, never getting either boring or too frustrating.  But I was left wanting more puzzles.  (Fortunately, there are two other games.)  The music is terrific, and surprisingly relaxing.  Sometimes the chimes when marking a hex got on my nerves, but most of the time they were enjoyable.Overall, it's a great little game, but the length means it's not worth the full price, in my opinion.  I tend to require about 2 hours worth of enjoyable playtime per dollar spent to feel like I got my money's worth, and if I'd bought this at full price, it wouldn't have reached that.  If you can get it for 40-50% off, however, I think it's definitely worth picking up, or if you have less harsh criteria for money spent (or do puzzles a bit slower).  I haven't yet played the sequels, though I picked those up, too - I understand the third one has a puzzle generator with thousands of possible boards, which would take care of the shortness issue.One other minor critique - one of the achievements is to finish every level with a perfect score, but I could find no indication in the level menu of which levels had finished with a mistake.  (I may have been missing it, of course.)  If you don't care about Steam achievements, it's no issue, but if you do, I suggest immediately replaying a level if you make a mistake.Since I've seen a lot of reviewers do personal scales, and it's helped me a lot to decide what to buy, I put my own here. I give Hexcells a 4 out of 5. Additionally, I usually only give a thumbs up if I got at least two hours of enjoyment out of it for every dollar I spent, and this game did that. (It wouldn't have if I hadn't bought it on discount, however.)5: Amazing game, easily worth the full price.4: Good game, solid addition to the genre, might want to wait for a discount.3: Pretty entertaining game, but some issues. Buy at a discount unless you love the genre.2: More cons than pros, a lot of issues. Only buy with a strong discount, and only if the game truly sounds like something you'd enjoy.1: Don't get this game unless it's free. Even then, consider spending your time playing something decent.			"

												This game is simply great. If you are one of those cool people who pass their idle time on their PC by playing the classic minesweeper game, Hexcells takes that to a whole new level. Things I like about the game:+ I bought all the three games (not costly at all) and it is absolutely fun.+ The levels are totally solvable by logic and you wont face a guessing situation like you would in classic minesweeper game. This requires a lot more logical reasoning than minesweeper and I really loved it.+ This game has its own ambient music (which some of you may like).+ The display is clean and the game gives proper introduction on every new rule as they appear. + The game runs equally smoothly on Linux, Windows and Mac. So I am able to play on different machines at work, or home.+ Very small installation size, Downloads the game in a new machine instantly.+ This game even has steam achievements.Things I did not like about the game:- No profile synchronization among devices. Everytime you install this in a new machine, you have to start from the beginning.- Music could be a bit more mild, I did not like short length repeatative music, had it turned off within first few levels.- Levels do not change, you can make mistakes and repeat the level with 0 mistake. Although if you challenge yourself honestly, this is not much of a problem (In the Infinity version, there are random levels though).- I am not sure about the scoring system. How making mistake affects your score and if there is any relation with time etc.- Short gameplay duration (this wont take you very long to complete, but I personally wont mind replaying).So far, I like the game and would recommend to anyone who is into these type of tiny games.

												Nice and easy puzzle game. No guessing needed, which was exactly what I hated on minesweeper. Easy controls as well, just 2 buttons needed and a pointing device.The music is fairly nice for a puzzling game, not distracting at all but if you tend to try to finish the game in one haul (like I did) it gets a bit too spacy after a while.

												Logic puzzle game, similar to minesweeper but without the need to guess any moves.I really enjoyed playing through Hexcells while short. Every puzzle (30 to complete) in it is fully solvable using logic, no guessing is required. It gradually introduces you to different clues as it increases in difficulty as you progress through the levels.It is forgiving there is not punishment to making mistakes or guessing other than being unable to “perfect” the level which is completing it with a limited amount of mistakes, which is also the only real reason to reply levels. One negative is that puzzles can’t be saved mid game, so you lose progress when you exit.Even though it can be quite quick to get through the 30 available puzzles I still recommend Hexcells as; one on sale it is very cheap, and two it’s a good starting point to ease you into the series. I had no technical issues with Hexcells. "

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Hexcells, Plus and Infinite. Cheesing in the Cells.Genre: Minimalist Casual Atmospheric Number PuzzlersDeveloped & Published by: Matthew BrownPlatform: Windows, Mac and LinuxBusiness Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review about the entire Hexcells Series on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsHexcells is a minimalist puzzle game that I like to think of as a combination of Minesweeper and Sudoku. A comparison that has probably been made elsewhere. Every level is basically the same. You’re presented with a variable number of cells with a number in the top right corner telling you how many blue cells there are in the puzzle. The challenge is figuring out which cells are blue and which are numbers. If you guess incorrectly, it’s counted as a mistake that will affect how many points you get at the end of a level. The numbers on or adjacent to cells are telling you how many blue cells are connected to them. It’s up to the player to figure out the pattern by examining the numbers. In general terms, if there are two unknown cells connected to a cell that has the number “2” on it, they’re both blue cells. There are several different mechanics used to confuse the player and make them logic out the solution. Upon completing a level, you’ll be rewarded with points that are used to unlock additional groups of levels. As such, this does requires you to complete most of the puzzles with a minimal amount of mistakes in order to progress forward. Hexcells, the Original’s FeaturesThe original Hexcells contains 30 puzzles and is the easiest of the three games. I would recommend playing this first just to get a feel of what each title will expect of you. However, it’s not required as each entry does a good job of explaining itself and gradually introduces you to the various mechanics.  My Main Issue With HexcellsHere’s the problem I have with the entire Hexcells series. It’s a pretty good puzzle experience, if you play it how it’s intended to be played. However, I feel that they have a problematic design flaw: all of the puzzles can be cheesily completed. If you’re stuck at a certain sequence, you can just click through the rest of the puzzle making as many mistakes as you like. (I had some puzzles at 50-60 mistakes). What about the points you would get from a near perfect completion? Well, once you nearly finish the puzzle, take a screenshot and then instantly replay the level with your own personal guide. It’s possible to win all three games this way without much effort on your part. PC Settings & Audio/VideoIt’s a minimalist game so there really aren’t many settings to change. Since its running on the Unity engine, the Unity launcher menu pops up when you start the game every time. It allows you to change resolutions and turn fullscreen on/off. The graphics quality is set to beautiful and can’t be changed. However, I was able to play this on a basic, five year old laptop running Linux Mint and there was absolutely no trouble running it. Alternative keys can be changed here as well. Hexcells Infinite was the only game of the three that allows you to swap the left and right mouse button functions.  Final ThoughtsOverall, I think the Hexcells series is a decently executed puzzle idea with plenty of content. I take issue with the lack of anti-cheat but it's not enough to make it an anti-recommendation. (Thanks to a friend for making a case to change my mind on this). It’s a fun logic number puzzle series. And I did play the three games how it was intended too, with a few exceptions. I had quite a bit of fun deducing the my way through the levels and had several “aha!” moments despite it’s more casual nature. Additionally, it maintains a mellow and atmospheric experience that I can appreciate. While there is the less honorable part of myself thinking “you can just easily ‘cheat’ this game and not spend hours on it”, that doesn't disqualify it from being a decent puzzle game. So, if you can avoid cheating yourself, get the Hexcells series. But if you can’t restrain yourself from looking up help on even the slightest bit of challenge, I probably wouldn't get it. Otherwise, that's my thoughts on this series. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												A compelling puzzlegame, as an obvious big brother of Minesweeper.ContentMany puzzles await your solving. Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?Hexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.Sound & MusicShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.GraphicsDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.WeakpointsSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.Concluding ThoughtsGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard. Don't worry, if you are the enthusiastic puzzle type of gamer, you will get used to loving this game!			"

In Hexcells I believe you can complete every level with deduction only, even if it is pretty puzzling towards the end.

												Hexcells proves that puzzle games don't need to be extremely complex to thoroughly enjoy.Now if you've ever played Minesweeper then right away you'll realise the basic premise is the same in both games. You click on a hexagon and it'll reveal a number and that number is how many 'mines' are around that specific hexagon, sound familiar? What Hexcells adds onto the original Minesweeper experience is a more puzzle oriented design to its levels, with each progressively testing your knowledge of new mechanics that get introduced throughout the worlds. That beind said each level in a world has a set amount of 'mines' in predefined locations, some puzzles might take you multiple tries to first realise the pattern but once you do it's abundantly satisfying when you finally solve it.This game has a very minimalistic approach to both its audio and graphics; there isn't much to complain about because it gets the job done. Simple hexagon shapes with an electronic ambience in the style of Solar Fields, with the added bonus of the game's audio playing in rhythm to your actions.Honestly my biggest complaint with this game is that there aren't enough puzzles, if you're like me than it'll leave you with that feeling of ""I want more!"". Thankfully though this game is really cheap, I'd highly recommend a purchase to anyone interested in either puzzles or games like Minesweeper/Sudoku/Picross.			"

												This game has elements from Sudoku and Minesweeper, but the introduction of new mechanics like ""the 2 patterns can't be adjacent"" or  ""the 2 patters have to adjacent"" , in conjugation with the hex-based tiles make something that resembles none of those. While playing i never felt like i was playing Sudoku or Minesweeper, i felt like i was playing something new. And i think that's the real strength of the game - the individual elements of the game may not be unique, but the combination of them makes it truly unique.I recommend the game on the basis of its originality, and also i find the puzzles very enjoyable to solve.The game has 30 puzzles, some are shorter than others, but none is really long. When i completed the game Steam claims i spent 5 hours, but a lot of this time i was alt-tabbed, so in reality took me like 2 hours to beat the puzzles. For some, the short duration might be a problem, it was not for me. If you look for more puzzles, you can also buy Hexcells Plus (more puzzles) and Infinite (more puzzles, and the possibility of generating an infinite amount of them.I read some negative reviews claiming that the game is also too easy, and i can't really argue with that. For me it was a decent challenge. But that's maybe because i'm not very good at this kind of puzzles even though i enjoy doing them. "

												Hexcells is a mix of minesweeper and Kakuro. The advantage to actual minesweeper is that the levels are pre-designed to make sure its NEVER a 50/50 chance and always logical. Pre-designed levels also means its really really short though, I played multiple levels twice and still it says 1.7 hours for me. There is also no need to play twice, no achievements not granted or mines exploding when you make a mistake, the mistake counter just goes up. which bothered be enough to perfionist myself to 100% completion. This btw also has the nice side effect of adding another perfectly completed game to your profile, since getting all the achievement is really really easy. The mechanics are introduced one after another. This means there is no overload with rules, this also means that the game only really gets hard towards the end once ALL comes together. All together a nice albeit short puzzle game that I can recomend to anyone who is a fan of minesweeper and kakuro and to those who just like puzlle games, particularly when on sale.EDIT: I mentioned Kakuro quite often, perhaps I should clarifiy that no you dont add numbers to get the crossum in the end. The numbers on the side only tell you how many blue fields are in a line and how they are connected. I figured that this was the next best thing though, thats whats cool about this game there is no perfect comparison out there. Still totally sticking to my minesweeper comparison though.			"

												Minesweeper feels like a cheap clone of this. Great puzzle game with nice atmospheric music. My one complaint so far is that the game let me be dumb and skip the first puzzle, which explains the controls. So yeah, don't skip 1-1 thinking it will be boring.			"

												A fun and challenging logical puzzle game similar to MineSweeper.Using the numbers to work out which tiles to mark.The big difference between Hexcells and Minesweeper is that you never need to guess at any point, there's always a way to work out where to click.Also, numbers can be shown on the outside of the grid and show a different symbol with the number to tell you how the tiles you need to mark are laid out.The only issue I have with this is that it's really short and there's no replay value in it.If you wish to save a bit of money then I suggest only buying HexCells Infinite which contains the same as this but also has a random level generator for.. infinite.. replayability.

												This game has elements from Sudoku and Minesweeper, but the introduction of new mechanics like ""the 2 patterns can't be adjacent"" or  ""the 2 patters have to adjacent"" , in conjugation with the hex-based tiles make something that resembles none of those. While playing i never felt like i was playing Sudoku or Minesweeper, i felt like i was playing something new. And i think that's the real strength of the game - the individual elements of the game may not be unique, but the combination of them makes it truly unique.I recommend the game on the basis of its originality, and also i find the puzzles very enjoyable to solve.The game has 30 puzzles, some are shorter than others, but none is really long. When i completed the game Steam claims i spent 5 hours, but a lot of this time i was alt-tabbed, so in reality took me like 2 hours to beat the puzzles. For some, the short duration might be a problem, it was not for me. If you look for more puzzles, you can also buy Hexcells Plus (more puzzles) and Infinite (more puzzles, and the possibility of generating an infinite amount of them.I read some negative reviews claiming that the game is also too easy, and i can't really argue with that. For me it was a decent challenge. But that's maybe because i'm not very good at this kind of puzzles even though i enjoy doing them. "

												Absolutely fantastic puzzle game - if you like Sudoku etc you will love this! It builds new mechanics into the same style and very similar layouts of the first game, Hexcells (which is also excellent). I found it very much tougher myself, but not in a bad way at all. I was also more inclined to play each level from the start until I had just 1 or 0 mistakes (both count as a 'perfect clearance of the level'- which I think is fair enough considering how easy it is to press the wrong mouse button by mistake if not 100% focused!). In contrast much of the first game and for some of this it was such an effort getting to the end that I didn't check carefully enough sometimes, and if it was just a stupid oversight rather than wrong logic I would take a screenshot to quickly get back to my previous progress. Really great game that will have you tearing your hair out at times until you work out the obvious!			"

												I was expecting a puzzle game of casual difficulty--something to pass the time while I chatted with friends--and that is what I found, but I failed to predict how complex and interesting could be without an intimidating difficulty curve. What I certainly did not expect was the beautiful soundtrack.  Words alone are not enough to describe this.  Every tile you touch adds a pleasant echo of a note to the tranquil melodies singing you to sleep as you progress.  It's the most soothing and relaxing puzzle game I have ever played, each step as rewarding as suspenseful in mild strokes.  Not only that, but the level design is brilliant.  Start from multiple points and work your way through your own way, depending on which clues you find first.You will especially love it if you have ever played a Picross game.  I highly recommend Hexcells and I shame myself for having taken so long to try it.  I have not been so tickled by puzzles like these since my old subscription to Games Magazine in the 90s.Edit:  One small issue I should mention.  I could find no volume option other than to mute and the game was initially too loud for me.  If you're playing on Windows, right-click your volume on the taskbar and use the Volume Mixer, and this is easily remedied.			"

												Imagine Minesweeper, except it puts you in a Zen state. So, like, the exact opposite of Minesweeper. I don't know about you guys, but Minesweeper makes me want to poop my pants. And unlike that last sentence, this game is pretty beautiful. There's just 30 levels, which is totally fine for that $3 price, but I can't help but think this game concept has the potential for many more levels. Infinite possibilities, really. It would be truly, truly awesome if this game had Steam Workshop support. Nevertheless, this game is damn good. At first I thought ""I've played Minesweeper, why should I care about this game?"" Well, I have somehow found myself in possession of this game, and I have now played it, and I am glad to say that I was stupid for thinking that. If you like puzzles even a little bit, I strongly recommend this game for stretching those brain muscles while also being strangely therapeutic and filling you with a sense of wonder.			"

												Hexcells is a game about logic puzzels much in the vein of Minesweeper. Thankfully it gradually introduces more interesting game mechanics. But sadly it never goes beyond the tutorial stage and it isn't as upfront about teaching you the specifics of each mechanic as I'd like it to be. As a seasoned player of Minesweeper and logic puzzels in general it took me less than 2 hours to complete this game without ever making a single mistake. There is little replayability.The design is clean and appealing (if a little bright), the sounds are neat and create an interesting atmosphere. I've never encountered a bug, error or crash.If you pick this game up as part of the trilogy compilation it is a decent introducton to the series and you won't regret your purchase as the later parts offer much more gameplay and are well worth their money. I cannot recommend picking up the first part as a stand-alone and definitely not at full price.			"

												Hexcells is a logic puzzle game with a really simple concept: fill in all of the hexes on the screen. You do this by looking at the clues already given to you in the form of numbers and arrangements. For example, if you have a hex that has a number 2 inside it, that means 2 of the neighboring hexes will be blank blue ones and the rest will be other numbered ones. As you go through the different combinations and solve more of the puzzle, more clues and patterns will become apparent to you, until you're able to fill up everything.The strategy is simple and intuitive, with easy to understand instructions whenever a new rule is added, so you never feel like you don't know what you're doing. It's very satisfying when you solve a super complicated puzzle and see how it all fits together like an equation. There were a couple of times when I felt like I wasn't given as many clues as was necessary and just had to guess, which is annoying, but these times were few and might have been simply my own incompetence.The graphic scheme is obviously very bare-bones but it's very visually eye-catching, in my opinion, which is nice. There are only a couple of music tracks but they're very serene and help get you into the mood while you're puzzle solving.Overall I think Hexcells is a pretty good game, challenging but not frustrating, and one that will give you a good 3-6 hours of play-time, and for that price it's definitely worth it. If you're a puzzle fan, I urge you to check it out.			"

												Hexcells is a logic/puzzle game. One can describe it as an enriched version of the standard Minesweeper, but in a hexagonal grid.The game is nice (the ambient music as well), but too short for my tastes: It only has ~30 fixed puzzles and it took me about two hours to finish, without much difficulty. I got this for 1€ in a flash sales so it was OK, in terms of the figure-of-merit: 1€ cost per 1hour of play. But, I strongly suggest you skip this game (and the sequel called ""Hexcells Plus"") and directly jump into the third and final game,""Hexcells Infinite"", instead. Infinite has a number of fixed puzzles as well as a random puzzle generator to keep you playing forever.			"

												A heximal (base 6) version of Minesweeper, with added math and no randomness. In other words, a fine take on the genre but ultimately, a waste of your precious leisure time and your computer's capabilities. It's a phone game, a distraction while you wait, something you play on the train.I don't know, maybe there are people who play Steam games on their phones but I can't. Just ask yourself this if you aren't convinced: do you want to spend 4 bucks and spend a couple of hours playing a FINE game of Minesweeper? Hexcells makes for a good logic puzzler, it's just... underwhelming. Heck, at least Minesweeper's levels are randomly generated; there's always a new experience for when you're bored. Once you're through with this game, there's no further value.			"

												I really don't understand the appeal. In this game, like minesweeper, you have to find the 'mines' with the number of adjacent mines of one tile. The difference are that few levels of Hexcell aren't randomly generated and more complex mechanics are introduced as you go on. The first problem I have with this game is that it does not let you fail. Rather than failing a level for hitting a 'mine', it only count your mistake. It sound like a good thing, but it simply inadvertently spoils the game. I admit that I don't know what could be done to fix this, but nevertheless its the equivalent to trying to solve a math problem with the answer in front of you. You might do your best not to look, you still end up figuring something that you wouldn't have normally.The second problem is related to the few inconsistencies of the game. It's a minor issue, but sometimes, it seems that the game take liberties with its own rules (or simply doesn't set them). For example;Two mines in a row of four tiles are said to be next to each other? Turn out that 'next to each other' still count when the row is separated by a huge white space.   symbols like '--' indicate that mines aren't next to each other? It only mean that at least one mine is not connected to the others.etc.Like a said, this is a minor issue, but combined with a very short unpunishing game, it doesn't leave you anything worthwhile. I can't recommend this game when other interesting puzzle games are available for the same price.			"

												The Hexcells series can be looked at as a modernized version of the classic Minesweeper. The simplistic design allows the player to focus purely on the puzzle. The contrast between the hexes are clearly visible thanks to the usage of bright yellow and blue colors. The sound design in the game is as serene as it's sublime. Again, the focus of the player is directed to the gameplay and not on the ambient sounds, which do somewhat calm the mind. Of course, the goal of the game is to complete the puzzles with as less mistakes as possible.Very close to coffee break puzzling perfection. You can spend anywhere from ten minutes to a lifetime playing and still feel like your brain is being tested. Highly recommended if you liked Minesweeper. Basically, Hexcells is what Minesweeper should have been.			"

												A very successful evolution of the classic ""minesweeper""--Darwin would be proud.There is very little need to ""guess"" as to spot selections, puzzles evolve/progress with new options/features at a very sound pace. There is significant variety in puzzles and this keeps the game enjoyable and fresh through the initial playthrough. However, Hexcells is NOT proceduarlly generated. As such, once you have played through the title you will need to shelve it for an extended period in order to have any viable replay value.Although I own the other two installments in this franchise I have yet to play them. I hope that they, or a future 4th installment, will have some procedural generation options to afford a significant boost to replay value.Overall, a fun, albeit very short, title which is well worth your money--especially if found on sale.

PROS:+ satisfying gameplay+ really nice UI & menu+ relaxing soundtrackCONS:- rather short (29+1 levels)- sometimes in the late levels you have to guess what a tile contains- could use a restart level optionComment:An okay game that makes you think more and more as the levels progress. Overall it is a good ""time waster"" when you have a couple of minutes to play. Sometimes in the late levels you have to guess what a tile contains because while you could pinpoint it based on blue tiles left it is really hard to do with many tiles and no way of highlighting tiles you THINK could be blue. I do recommend this to anyone who likes logic games. Also worth mentioning are two sequels, all three games can be bought in a nice bundle.			"

												Great little puzzle game. It's basically minesweeper with nice soothing music. There's not a whole lot to say here. It's has 6 stages with 5-6 puzzles each. There's a slight increase in difficulty as you progress--the puzzles get larger and start using diagonals for example--but it's not a very steep incline. It's a short game at less than 2 hours to complete but definitely replayable and worth the $3 price tag.			"

												If you like puzzle games id say this one is a must buy. Its like some sort of minesweeper with hexagons that also includes some new mechnics to this type of games. Buy the game if u have a chance but keep in mind that it doesnt have much gameplay time besides 2/3hours. If you are looking for a game that gives you hours and hours of entertainment dont buy this one. However if you are looking for a new gaming experience you should check this one out. If you can id sugest grabbing the complete hexcells bundle wich makes some of the game Cons disappear.Pros:-New mechanics to this type os genre without geting too out of the type.-Cheap-Fun and relaxing while it lastsCons:-Small and easy to beat. -No costumization besides the base game-No real music to help getting a better atmosphere.-Unexpected and bad ending... Got really disapointed with the way the game finished. "

												Inspired by minesweeper I was pretty hopeful given all of the positive reviews. In playing it, I was pretty underwhelmed. What I loved in minesweeper when I was younger was the sense of victory when you finally cleared a game. You'd have this whole hard level to get through, you'd start small, the tension would rise as you get further and further, and eventually you win and feel great. In Hexcells there was no sense of victory. You play a level, you screw up a couple times, and then you finish it and move to the next one.I'll probably play a bit more. Maybe I will like it as the levels get more interesting, as it is though I was not overly impressed. As it is, if you want a calm puzzle game then it's probably worth it. If you want a modern day minesweeper I would not recommend it.			"

												Hexcells is similar to Minesweeper and Picross in that you need to clear a grid and identify which pieces are colored and which aren't. But unlike Minesweeper there is no guesswork, no random element. Instead the player is given a small bit of information from the start and using that, the player can think and deduce where the colored pieces are. It turns what used to be a game of chance into something more akin to Sudoku. It's a game that makes you think and is a joy to play. Unfortunately the game is a bit short, but for only $3 it will hardly break your wallet. Definately a must play!			"

Think of it as a game similar to Minesweeper, but instead of needing to make guesses every once in a while regarding the position of ""good"" hexes, you always have the information available to make the right call. Purchase Hexcells Plus as well if you enjoy the base game. Can't recommend it enough if you're a fan of puzzle games.			"

												This is essentially Minesweeper with hexagons instead of squares, opening up extra sets of rules. If you like puzzle games and/or Minesweeper, you'll enjoy Hexcells. Unlike Minesweeper, the levels are pre-designed, so you have a finite number of puzzles which means you'll really only get 2-4 hours of entertainment out of it. It's only $3 and there is a standalone expansion with 36 extra levels. Worth getting on sale or in a bundle.			"

												Clever little puzzle game. The gameplay is pretty intuitive and the nice ambient music and sound effects add to the experience. The graphics are pretty sparse, but they get the job done. I would say the closest game to this would be minesweeper funnily enough. It actually has many similarities with that game, but it has unique level layouts instead of a square of increasing sizes. I wouldn't say it is hard per se, it just takes patience to see what moves you can make without making any mistakes. I got it in a bundle so I payed barely anything, but at $3 full price, you can't really go wrong. At only a couple hours in length and lacking any random levels or a map editor, the replay value will fall off significantly after completion. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, but I doubt I will revisit it anytime soon. If this goes on sale, it would most definitely be worth taking a look at.			"

												It IS an abstract puzzle, like minesweeper or sudoku or something like that, and it has a nice atmospheric sound and visuals to go along with it, but that's all it really is, honestly. It feels really insubstantial. Simply adding more levels isn't what I want, either. Nor is adding more mechanics. I just think it's hard to make an abstract puzzle game feel as fun as some of the other games out there. It took me 2-3 hours to 100% and I didn't really end it feeling like I was glad I played it. Plus, the music loop starts to get annoying after awhile. It's too short, plays too often, and isn't mixed in with other tracks. And the core gameplay loop is pretty much just - reveal the obvious stuff, then hunt around for the next thing you can reveal. That's not that fun to me compared to what you do in other games. It's not the lack of action or anything - I'm fine with slow-paced, turn-based, or other puzzle games. It's just the lack of problem solving - this game is all deduction and very little intuition. I like working with and experimenting with a hard problem and going over it in my head and trying different avenues of solutions and trying to come up with observations and rules and constraints that I can use to simplify the problem. You can find that core gameplay loop in lots of excellent puzzle games, but you won't find it here.If you like minesweeper or sudoku you should definitely give this a try. Otherwise, even if you're a huge fan of puzzle games like me, I'd probably avoid this. You're not going to find that problem-solving engagement and stimulation here, unlike what you'd find in lots of other puzzle games. There's no experimenting, discovery, or anything like that. It's just ""oh here's the next spot for which I can prove its contents"" and ""hmm, where's the next one?"".As a counterexample, an abstract puzzle game I DID enjoy was Splice (you might argue that it's not TRULY abstract since it uses a sort of biological metaphor, but I think of it as one). That game has plenty of that ""problem solving high"" you get as you experiment and observe and work through a complex problem.			"

												Hexcells is basically a collection of puzzles, the kinds of which are a dime a dozen in GAMES magazine or Dell's puzzle magazines.This particular kind starts like hexagonal minsweeper, then adds new kinds of clues that aren't unlike Picross. The visuals are minimal, but pleasing and the ambient music mixes well with the sounds generated by your progression towards the solutions.The BIG problem is that it's way too short and easy. None of the 29 puzzles presented any kind of challenge to me, and we all know that I'm no Puzzle got (Remember my Spacechem debacle). I was really taken aback when I discovered the ""1"", ""2"", ""3"" entries in the menu didn't bring me to different puzzles but were just save slots. I couldn't believe it was that short. The puzzles may be handcrafted, ensuring that there never is need for guessing, but they aren't all that elegant for it. Not only are the puzzles easy, but they also contain way too many redundant clues.Another minor problem is that, by default, the mouse buttons used to open a cell or indicate it's part of the pattern are reversed from Minesweeper, which caused a couple of mistakes from my part.Now, I've already begun playing the sequel, Hexcells Plus and the puzzles there aere much more challenging, which is a good thing.Anyone with a certain level of puzzle exprience should probably skip this one and go straight to Hexcells Plus.

												I don't understand why this game is rated overwhelmingly positive. It's extremely easy. In fact, the only level that presented any challenge was the next to last level. During the other 29 levels you can easily figure out which cells to break and which to mark. That one level that is a challenge is only a challenge in the sense that it is tedious. Since you can't figure out which cells to mark based on any clues given you have to guess.In other words, the whole premise of the game is flawed. The game is painfully easy except one level which plays exactly like minesweeper. The puzzles are either too easy or require blind guessing, neither of which are fun to me. I got 3 levels into the sequel before quitting. If I wanted to play minesweeper, I'd play minesweeper.			"

												Hexcells is a nice simple little puzzle game, with the same relaxing gameplay as Minesweeper, and, it was entertaining for a while. I got the bundle on sale so it cost less than a candy bar, which is a good price for the 4 hours of fun I got out of it.However there are a couple gameplay aspects that I don’t like, and one game braking issue that has ruined the Hexcells for me, thus I can’t recommend it.I am going to compare Hexcells to Minesweeper in this review, I understand that it is not suppose to be the same game, but they are the only two games in this genre that I have experience with.First, lets look at the parts I like.Pros:The music is peaceful, and the sound effects fit in nicely.The game looks clean and modern.Unlike minesweeper, it is not stressful to click on tiles. (Though, this does have the effect of making it a little less satisfying when you complete the puzzle correctly.)I like the extra tile options {3} for three connected tiles, -2- for two disconnected tiles, and the numbers on the outside of the grid for tiles in that row or column.I like the fact that there is no timer, so I don’t feel rushed. (I hate puzzle games that make you rush)I also like that the levels are not too hard to unlock.Unfortunately that is as far as the pros go for me.Cons:Unlike minesweeper, it counts a mistake if you flag a number tile! This is frustrating, especially when there is no “think about it” flag.  It may help if tiles that have their conditions met grey out, even if I have to do this manually, it would help I think.There is not a “replay” button on screen.  This only became a problem when I started really trying to get perfect scores, which was pretty quickly.I could not swap the mouse buttons.  I don’t know why, but I couldn’t get the mouse buttons to register as “keys.” By default the flag and destroy buttons are opposite Minesweeper, which really really messed up my clicking!  And, because flagging counted as a mistake I couldn’t even have one safe button!  In the end, I had to use keyboard keys and even though it’s not so bad, the entire thing was really frustrating.And here is the game braking issue! There is a really really easy way to cheat!  It is so easy that once you know it is there, you can’t help but use it to your advantage, even if only accidentally!Please, if you enjoy this puzzle game, and don’t know about this yet, don’t read below.  YOU CAN SEE BEHIND YELLOW TILES!!!  As you mouse over yellow covered tiles they wiggle a little, and the yellow is just that, a cover, the tile is already there!  If the cover moves far enough you can see the tile color behind it, whether it is blue or black! Even if you don’t actively try to peek, just moving the mouse around like normal will give you glimpses.  This completely broke the game for me because what is the point of spending time working out hard tiles when I can just mouse over them a bunch to see if my guess is right!!! "

												Hexcells is a puzzle game that feels like a sort of combination between minesweeper and picross.  Puzzles are pre-made, can all be solved without guessing and combine the hint systems of minesweeper and picross, along with the hexagon twist.  The concept works very well and I found the game quite enjoyable, but it is unfortunately quite short.  There are 6 groups of puzzles, 30 in total, that gradually introduce new concepts and become more difficult.  I was able to finish all of them without any mistakes in just over an hour, though I'm generally faster than most with these type of games.It's a fun puzzle game and you can't really go wrong with the price.  I've been told Hexcells Plus is much more difficult so it should be a great continuation for those who can solve these puzzles quickly.			"

												So simple,A bit like a mix of Minesweeper and Sudoku: the gameplay is like minesweeper, where you have to find out what is behind the hidden hexagons, only using knowledge of the already revealed hexagons, and you have to work your way through fixed map.The theoretical aspect is more like sudoku, you have to nominate the different possible variations and then play them through in your head. Often you will have those moments where you after 5 min of dispair, suddenly find a magical solution, and that feels rather rewarding.Great puzzle game 7.6/10 "

												This game plays very much like Minesweeper, as in every hexagon tells you how many of surrounding tiles you have to ""find"". There is a fixed number of increasingly difficult puzzles but once you got the hang of it, net one is really challanging. According to Steam, I completed the game (with all achievements) within 3 h -- including the time I let it run over family dinner.A big downside is the lack of a random level generator, which is the reason I cannot give this game a full recommendation -- even though I find it generally more enjoyable than the Windows counterpart (and its Linux clones.)

												Excellent puzzle game. The influences of minesweeper and picross are very obvious but the mixture of the two is very well balanced! The graphic presentation is flawless and the ambient background music enhances the experience in an amazing way. I had a lot of fun figuring the puzzles out.My only complaint would be that I had finished all puzzles in a little more than an hour. So content could have been better but Hexcells is really just an introductory product. For all Hexcells lovers there's Hexcells Plus with tons of more elaborate puzzles. And the combined prize of around 5 € is unbeatable!!!			"

However, I heard that is fixed in Hexcells Infinite, which I am playing after I beat Hexcells Plus.Honestly, 5 of these marks come from the music alone. I could listen to it for hours and hours, especially since the music is added to when you click a tile. Then the gameplay itself is amazing, with 30 puzzles, it's a great way to spend an afternoon.

												This is one of those games that make me regret the fact that Valve only allows a positive or a negative opinion, and not a neutral one.This game is admittedly brilliant. An extremely addictive combination of Minesweeper and Picross, with pretty visuals and a nice ambient soundtrack that reacts to your moves. I loved every minute of playing this game. Why the negative review then? Because it's really effing short. There are 36 puzzles, but they are easy enough that you can finish the game (and I don't mean ""finish"" as in ""reach the last puzzle"". I mean ""finish"" as in ""beat all puzzles perfectly and get 100% of the achievements"") fast enough to refund it, and the replay value is nonexistent. It feels like a demo/tutorial for the later Hexcells games.Overall, I'd recommend to only buy it if the Hexcells Complete Bundle is on sale. It'll teach you how to play the later games with a much gentler learning curve. On it's own, and at the full price, this game is simply not worth it.			"

												Fantastic Puzzle Game!It's kind of similar to Minesweeper, BUT, while Minesweeper always requires some guessing, some trial and error, this game is 100% logical. There is a clear solution to every level which can be solved without guessing even once. In that sense, it's similar to Sudoku, but simpler.It took me about 2 hours to finish it, which really isn't much, but the experience was pretty cool. It was literally an LOGICAL ♥♥♥♥♥♥, that's how nice it feels when you see how your logical conclusions actually turn out to be true.So, yeah, good game. Try it out :)			"

Of course, if you guess wrong you have to start over if you want a perfect score. I guess this extends the playtime of the game because you have to do the levels over again until you can do it by memorization.

												From what I've tried, Hexcells is a more elaborate version of Minesweeper. I've finished Squarecells from the same developer, and this game shares the same issues with the scoring system. It docks a star (out of 3) each time you make a mistake. So 1) you now know the correct answer and 2) you're penalised for misclicking. I found this really frustrating, especially without a '?' flag.

Ambient music is looped well and (for me) didn't get annoying.Like someone else said, it's basically six-sided minesweeper, but much more fun and interactive.9/10 I want more puzzles!			"

												It's Minesweeper + Sudoku/Picross, except harder than both, with super calming ambient music. What's more to like? Oh yeah, the sequel, Hexcells Plus. Get that too! In fact, do what I didn't do, and buy the three-pack. ~30-35 hours of gameplay in there, or more, depending on how fast you are at these things and how little you cheat.Only bad part, IMO, is that you can fail your way to success. IMO the game should have a retry button appear immediately, even if it thinks the ""soft mistake"" is a feature and not a bug. Being able to see the results of my mistake is enough of a problem, without having it sitting there on the screen, etching into my brain. The mechanics and time spent crafting the puzzles was amazing enough to make this only a minor quibble, though.			"

												Overall a great game that gives you a few hours of thinking.Maybe a bit too easy, I solved the 5 first levels around one hour of gameplay. The last level was a bit more challenging, mostly due to the fact that you can't see what puzzles you need to re-play to get the last missing points to unlock each level. But I do recommend this game!On the down side: You can't see how many misses you have per puzzle. This makes it hard to know what puzzles needs a re-play to collect the last achievement. There is no time mode to solve a puzzle as quickly as possible.I just discovered that there are also two expansions with additional 39 level each...			"

												when I saw this game's store page, its overwhelmingly positive reviews and its nice pictures; I thought to myself: its gonna be a very clever mind teasing mathematics puzzle game. but in reallity its just another MINESWEEPER CLONE!!!the developer changed the minesweeper's squares to hexagons then adds a litte clever sound design to it and finally a beautiful and simple visuals has been added to the game as spice and made the Hexcells.Pros:+ All Levels are Designed by Level designer, so you won't need chance to ending a level (unlike minesweeper), but you need attention and thinking.+ You can make mistakes in levels and it isn't instant death+ adds some new and cool elements to minesweeper gameplay+ wonderful sound and visual designs+ No time limit, so it's like relax mode of minesweeperCons:- very low replay value (unlike Minesweeper)- there aren't many levels to play and levels are short (I completed the game under 90 mins and refunded it through steam)- after all tryings to changing Minesweeper into something completely new; this game feels like a Minesweeper that isn't free to play!!! :(			"

												Hexcells is, on the most basic level, a more sophisticated version of Minesweeper. You are given a layout of golden hex tiles, possibly with one or more of them already highlighted or flipped. Flipped tiles have numbers on them, and also labels indicating whether or not adjacent tiles which should be highlighted are continuous or non-continuous (or no designator at all). There are also row and column labels which allow you to see how many tiles need to be highlighted in any given row or column.Each puzzle mixes these up in a unique way to push you to solve it.Thinking about this game as a more sophisticated version of minesweeper is, I think, fairly ideal, because that is more or less what it is, and the function it serves. It is something to throw away a bit of time on, not sit down and play continuously.But even then, you’re not looking at it taking all that long to complete; the whole game takes less than two and a half hours to solve, and that’s assuming you’re trying to get a perfect score on every stage.It is about as fun as Minesweeper is, and I’d basically consider it filling that role in your game library.My advice? Pass. It isn’t a bad puzzle game, but it isn’t anything remarkable either. If you did get it as part of a bundle or something, it isn’t a terrible thing to install and just screw around with when you’d mess around with solitaire or minesweeper or whatever, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to buy this.

In addition with 'stars' you get for finishing levels without mistakes, which are needed to open the following levels, the game makes you to retry levels in order to get more 'stars'.

												Hexcells, a Frankenstein combination of Minesweeper and Nikoli puzzle games, fails to impress on any level. The concept behind this game is not even remotely interesting and the puzzles presented here are laughably trivial. I completed the game while skipping as much of the early levels as possible, which frankly are an insult to anyone's intelligence. It is said that the other games in the bundle are harder, but the core idea of this puzzle is not worth exploring to begin with. If this were a free Flash app, I still wouldn't play it.1/10 - Save yourself the money and the disappointment.			"

For some odd reason they sell it by parts, although this part can be perfected easily within less than 2 hours, And I doubt that the ""complete pack"" has 9$ worth of puzzles. That's too bad because I've actually enjoyed these couple hours a lot. It's a very engaging, pleasant and moderately challenging.I'll also comment that the game is somewhat flawed on the guidance part which at times is not clear enough for no good reason, resulting with user mistakes.Rather than that it's a great game.

												This is a fun program to use.I would not call it a game. I would not call it a puzzle game. To cut it short, I would not call it a video game.My point can be summarized as the following:If my experience from a 'game' does not decrease with printing out a screenshot and try to solve it on the table with a pen, what is the point of purchasing a videogame for the mentioned experience? There are billions of good puzzle newspapers, magazines which are much cheaper (per puzzle basis), and most of those even includes more than one type of puzzles. What I am talking about? There is no save in the middle of a mission. So if u are bored with a specific puzzle, you must start from anew. Paper and pen solution is better in this case. There is no undo for moves. While it is a good exercise for mistakes and incentivize perfecting things, sometimes I just misclick and got a correct filling. Since I am a bit obsessive about doing things without any hints, I really try hard to ignore that extra hint in the aftermath of the mistake. Again. Pen and paper approach is still nicer. Ok, not pen, but a pencil would do the job. Music is not outstanding, it is not even a music, just ambience sound, mostly I muted the game and opened some music of my own. Pen and paper approach is not worse in this aspect as well. It has no options, no metagame, no seeing how long your other friends took for solving some different puzzle. It has no occulus rift support :)So again, pen and paper approach is not inferior.To summarize my point, I am not declaring this program is not fun to use. It is. It is a good mixture of minesweeper and griddlers, and especially as a fan of griddlers I enjoyed my time solving the puzzles. But I would also enjoy my time with solving them from a newspaper. While I mostly enjoy minimalistic setups in puzzle games, this one was too extreme in that. I really cant point out what is the difference between this program (I am insisting on not calling it a game) and a published puzzle thingy except it lets u know when u did a mistake instantly. Since puzzles are much easier in this compared to Hexcells plus, having no save feature is not that devastating in this first title. It still is annoying though.Needs much polish before I can call it a game. Since all of the puzzles have a unique solution, I dont think we need a programmed thing for this kind of puzzle even. TLDR: Did I enjoy using this program? Yes. But I also enjoy my time solving some sudokus, or griddlers online, and this one does not stand out that much from some best voted griddlers in https://www.griddlers.net. So I dont think paying for this is well legitimized, especially after considering its short gameplay time.PS: Some of my points are taken care of in Hexcells Infinite, by saving feature, a few options, and infinite puzzles thingy. But since those changes are not retroactive, they are not relevant reviewing of this game.PS2: Most of the ones who check out for hubs of older games are fans of it. That is why, a negative review for an old game will most likely be heavily downvoted, since the ones did not like the concept already will not wander around that much. So, take possible downvotes with a pint of salt.			"

												Not much to say, really. It's a minesweeper-ish puzzle, with more information so you never have to just guess. It's never complicated; if II'm not mistaken I rarely had to mentally play through a combination of two close hints to see where the possible solutions intersect to reveal a hex that has the same state in all possible solutions -- for most cases, it's just a simple going through the patterns.Nonetheless, it's a decent little game. No replay value or anything like that since the levels are NOT randomly generated, and it's not going to take all that much time either, but it does what it sets out to do. If you can deal with just playing through this once in a rather short time, go for it. Avoid making guesses, you're just spoiling the experience for yourself.A ""recommendation"" might be a bit too strong, but I can't really vote ""No"" for a game that does what it wants to do, and does it well enough. Consider it a weak recommendation. "

												Probaby best described as minecraft on a hex grid. It has nice variations with are progressively introduced, its well presented and overall its a pretty satisfying puzzle game. It is however extremely short - the base game contains 30 puzzles, most of which take only a couple of minutes to complete and there are no random levels in the base game. I needed to re-play older puzzles but found this relatively uninteresting as I already half-remembered the solution from before. I only replayed puzzles enough to unlock the last few levels.I think its unfortunate that additional levels and ""infinite mode"" have been released as expansions, as this leaves the base game really lacking content.

												Logic Puzzles.  ProsThe idea is fantastic.  The game is easy to learn, In fact, it's a LOT like minesweeper without actually being minesweeper.  It's much better in my opinion.  The graphics are minimalist, which emphasize the clean logic of the game.  The music is calm and relaxing.ConsIt's short.  I finished all the puzzles in 2.5 hours.The logic only goes so far.  For a casual gamer this is probably a plus.  You don't have to derive clues from more than 2 orders.  But a few of the later puzzles will make you do a lot of 2nd order deductions.But just when it was getting really, really good..it ended *pouty face*Not much for replay value.  You can play the puzzles again.  But you should probably let the game accumulate some dust and come back to it in a year, then it will probably be fun all over again.SummaryIt's fun.

												Hexcells is very similar to the Mine Sweeper game you find in any version of Windows, but with a little twist. The idea of the puzzles are very simple. The first half of the puzzles are not that difficult. But the second half does test you a little. Relatively it is a short game but fun.There are points in the puzzles where you will need to take time to think very carefully or just simply take a guess. It does get frustrating in the last couple of stages were the puzzles get bigger. Specially if you are after the achievements.The graphics are simple and styled well for this game.The music and sound is very good and compliments the game well. However after long play it does get a little repetitive and you may want to switch the music off.I do recommend this game however it does have a short play through value. I picked this little game up in a midweek madness deal.			"

												Highly recommend this game. The levels are designed in such a way that you never have to guess; what makes it better is that there are usually multiple avenues towards solving each given level. If you're finding it too difficult to solve one area of (solvable, but tricky) hexes, it's often the case that you can make progress in a separate area before returning with a little more information. I would have liked to see some more content, but it was cool how the game kept with the hexagon theme. 6 worlds with 6 levels each. (Though admittedly, a few of the levels were filler / instructional, and didn't pose as much of a challenge.) I wonder if an optional timed mode would be a good idea. On the one hand, it would be nice to come back to the levels in a few months and see how fast I solve them second time around, but on the other hand, the pressure might take away from the uncluttered minimalist feel of the game. Overall, thorougly enjoyed Hexcells & Hexcells Plus and would definitely recommend as a stimulating challenge.			"

												Loved the addon Hexcells Plus, so I bought this original game without hesitation. Completed and perfected it in one sitting, so you can look at achievement timestamps to see how fast I was at each achievement. Complete run took me 88 minutes and I beg for more.This is a great take on Minesweeper but without that random element that you may occasionally get in Minesweeper where you just have to guess and hope you're lucky. Levels in Hexcells can always be solved with simple math.			"

												A fun little puzzle game, not unlike Minesweeper with a hex grid except that you get enough information in unique ways that if you put it together you never have to guess. The fun in the game is in deducing what must be true given the information you have to clear each puzzle grid and learning the patterns of reasoning you need, while being treated to relaxing ambient music which brings out your patient contemplative side. It's short and sweet, and you'll clear it just a couple hours.			"

The puzzles are fairly easy and as such you should be able to full clear the game in 2-2.5hrs.I suggest buying Hexcells Plus as well, it contains more puzzles that are both larger and more difficult than the first game and will take 7-8hrs to complete 100%.

												It's basically minesweeper with better graphics and some new code types that add a lot more variables to the ""mine sweeping"" process, except there is no random factor here. The lack of a random mode really makes this game incomplete, and shows kind of a lack of programing skills from the developers, or perhaps just laziness, if you consider that the game seems to be over very quickly (you'll finish it in about 2 hours or less with a perfect score), with not much of a replay factor. At least most of the levels are well built.Even though I just kinda trashed the game, it's actually good. I got it on a summer sale and I don't reccomend buying it at full frice. I also haven't played the ""Hexcells Plus"", which should have been built into the original game, or at the very least sold as a DLC for a fraction of the retail price, instead it costs the same as the original.I'd give it a 6/10, mostly for the clean design and the creativity of taking an old classic and taking it to the next level.It could have had maybe a 7 or 8 score if it had a random mode, and even more if it was longer, or if it had at least ANY discount on the PLUS version, while having bought the original.If you want an actual GREAT puzzle game in the mean while, truly worth your money, then try ""Lyne"".

												It's more or less like complex minesweeper. (or maybe sodoku, my original comparison. That depends on the complexity of the levels though). I find this game to be a great way to pass the time. It's very calming and a great brain teaser. The music can be soothing, and there is something satisfying about chaining a few cells in tune with the music. There are a few times where I found one or two levels to be somewhat impossible with trial and error. And often it can become a game of memorizing since each playthrough is the same as the last. Reguardless completing the game to 100% can be something of an achievment. Plus, if you worry that the fun ends there fear not! There is hexcell plus!			"

												A very elegant minesweeper logic game with no guessing involved.   The graphics, music and fonts have a very clean and refined feel.  The puzzles are interesting and challenging without being frustrating.  There are variations in clues, such as numbers outside of columns that give the  total number of pattern matches in that column and indicated whether the pattern matches are contiguous or broken.  The early puzzles are very relaxing.  The later ones sometimes require a bit of care and there were a few points where I spent 5 minutes not able to see what I was missing but, as a person who claims no great brilliance, I never felt out of my depth and the game never made me feel stupid. If this type of game holds any appeal for you then it is well worth the small price to play something  more sophisticated than your standard minesweeper freebie included with your OS.			"

												Logic Puzzles.  ProsThe idea is fantastic.  The game is easy to learn, In fact, it's a LOT like minesweeper without actually being minesweeper.  It's much better in my opinion.  The graphics are minimalist, which emphasize the clean logic of the game.  The music is calm and relaxing.ConsIt's short.  I finished all the puzzles in 2.5 hours.The logic only goes so far.  For a casual gamer this is probably a plus.  You don't have to derive clues from more than 2 orders.  But a few of the later puzzles will make you do a lot of 2nd order deductions.But just when it was getting really, really good..it ended *pouty face*Not much for replay value.  You can play the puzzles again.  But you should probably let the game accumulate some dust and come back to it in a year, then it will probably be fun all over again.SummaryIt's fun. I really like it, but it's just so short!			"

												I don't typically throw the term art around when refering to games, but this one deserves the title more over. The simplistic atmosphere and exceptional soundtracks creates a calm atmosphere while playing. The feeling the game creates helps to think when solving the tasks presented. This twist on the classic minesweeper takes a little getting used to at first, but quickly teachers you most of what you'll need to know.Despite the legnth being a little shorter than desired, my only real complaint is the tutorial system. This worked fine until World 3, which after I had no idea how to play and found myself guessing far too often. If either the devs or an individual were to put out a bit more in-depth tutorial or guide on those final mechanics, the game would be much more enjoyable.			"

												AMAZING!!! Ok this game isn't like as high intensity as a fps or cod yet can be as fun. You start off learning that you can change hexagons blue or black with a number in the center, simple enough right? Just wait. It starts off easy yet the farther you go, even from world one to two you learn things that help you like where the blues will be, but those wont save you. I have completed this game before doing this so I could write an honest reeve about it. To be honest it didn't take long (1 day) and if you aren't an achievement hunter this is fine but since I saw there were only 7 I decided to give it a go. I have 6 at the moment and the last one loused me ""Perfection"" this is where you complete every level with 0 mistakes. This is where it gets intense holding your breath every click hoping that it is the Wright one, and to not add one to your mistakes counter. Then you miscalls and start to flip it was the last one on the 6-3 level and I wasn't paying attention... I I threw my mouse against the far wall and watched it shatter. Five stars best game			"

												A different league of puzzle game. Saw this as part of a bundle... ended up playing it far more than the game I'd actually wanted from the bundle in the first place.The game is really snappy and responsive, looks great and comes with some fairly challenging puzzles as the combinations of rules get more complex in the later stages. I blitzed through this in about an hour and a half (without referring to any guides of course!), before going back to finish off 3 puzzles I hadn't got perfect on the first time round.Got straight onto Hexcells Plus after that!Would recommend very highly for any puzzle game fan, quite sudoku-esque. The logical steps and patterns you utilise, especially in combination for the later levels, are fairly rewarding as you start to see yourself picking up speed when encountering similar situations on other levels. The difficulty of Hexcells isn't too bad and even if you can't do a Sudoku to save your life, you will be able to get through this without having to look up a guide if you persevere! :)			"

There's a nice sense of accomplishment when you solve a puzzle that stumps you for a while.  I've heard it compared to Minesweeper but what's nice about Hexcells is that you never have to guess. You can absolutely figure it out, but you might have to look at all the clues carefully first.  It's not a long game.  I've played it all the way through twice and put in five hours.  But it's a nice diversion. Also, it's incredibly easy to grab all the achievements and score a perfect game if you're into that.			"

												Imagine Picross meets Minesweeper.The puzzle mechanics are built in such a way that there is zero percent guesswork and relies on the player's understanding of the rules, deducing patterns based on the hints given. New rules are introduced at a comfortable rate and solving each puzzle certainly feels rewarding.The game consists of a fixed set of puzzles which take around 2-4 hours to fully complete but not much lies in terms of replayability unless you're going for a no-miss completion. Bear in mind that the puzzles are still identical on replay. Still, the game is pretty cheap and worth a play if you've obtained it off an indie game bundle earlier.This gets a 3 out of 3			"

												Really nice, weird blend between Minesweeper and Sudoku-ish games. The first two ""worlds"" seem really simple and minesweeperish, but once they introduce rows, columns, and brackets, you find yourself thinking more like you would when playing Sudoku (re-checking rows, etc). If you like puzzle games, this is a solid couple of playsessions of puzzling. Hexcells Plus also seems like a winner; it seems to reward you for being good at the first game.			"

												I absolutely adore this game.  The basic idea is Picross/Nonograms + Minesweeper on a Hex grid.  If you like either of the forementioned games, please do yourself a favor and pick this up.  The learning curve is wonderfully laid out and it seems as though most of the game is slowly moving you towards the final few puzzles where it puts everything you've learned to work.  The ambient music and minimalist design makes this game soothing to play, even when it is taxing on your mind.  The controls are simple and flawless, just using the left and right mouse click as in the classic Minesweeper game.  It is rare for an experience so simple to be this enjoyable.  I can't wait to play Hexcells Plus to see if they add either more to the already great puzzle system they have put into place, or if it is just more of the endgame style puzzles to be wonderfully entertained by.  Again, if you like Picross and Minesweeper, even things like Sudoku or other logic games, do yourself a favor and toss the few bucks it is asking.  You'll get a few hours of fun out of it and definitely not be disappointed.			"

												Hexcells is a great puzzle game. While the game borrows elements from picross and Minesweeper, I find Hexcells to be an improvement on both. Unlike Minesweeper, every puzzle is completely solvable based on the available clues - no frustrating leaps of faith required unless you are stumped. The game becomes more rewarding with each new puzzle as new strategies are needed and solutions go from obvious to head-scratchers. The final sets require a variety of styles of deductive reasoning to solve the cleverly designed puzzles without errors.The puzzles themselves are fantastic and engaging, but the ambiance is what should make this a must-buy for fans of any genre. Each click helps weave together a living soundtrack that connects you with each puzzle. The aesthetics put you into the perfect ""flow"" mentality and add immensely to the overall experience. If you're a puzzle fan, don't hesitate to pick this up, and don't be surprised when you return to send a few copies to your friends and family.			"

Hexcells has been aptly described as a modern version of Minesweeper. There are several key differences, however: Minesweeper randomly generates its levels, while each level in Hexcells was created by hand. This gives it the advantage that every level is solvable using pure logic, no need for guessing. Hexcells is also more lenient when it comes to making mistakes: it counts how many mistakes you make, but they do not result in a game over. Instead, you must solve each level with a minimum of mistakes in order to earn a perfect score.Creating each level by hand also has the disadvantage of limiting the game to a finite number of levels. There are so few in fact that it only took me two hours to complete every level with no mistakes. Because of this I would not recommend spending more than $2 on it.			"

												This is an easy recommendation to make! YES!Hexcells is a puzzle game that's sort of like Minesweeper, but with more unique twists (many more rulings to make it a bit more complex). It's a frustrating game in the sense that you feel that you should be able to solve it, and making mistakes disappoints you more than you'd think (especially if you're after the Achievements - but even then, it keeps count how many mistakes you've made so far and displays it for the whole level, which stings). At some point, you'll likely get frustrated when you dont know what move to make - but you know that (and I can confirm that) there is always a 'legal' or 'smart' move (meaning it's assured correct; no need to have to guess to proceed). For those after the Achievements, this is a (relatively) quick game to go for - four hours and a bit for me to complete, counting restarts when mistakes are made (but I'm a puzzle afficionado so I might have ate through it a bit faster than average) and a noteworthy detail is that you dont feel like you're achievement hunting (as in doing obscure actions for the achievement) so much as just playing the game to its full.At this price? It's an easy buy - but getting it on sale, more especially on the complete pack? The game is more than worth the price!As an aside, even if the levels are the same, there is replayability in that the field is just so expansive and keeping track of all the minute details is near impossible.Get this game! The developers did a really good job with it! "

												I bought Hexcells on sale because it was $1.01, and the gameplay looked like precisely the sort of thing I would enjoy as a fan of both Minesweeper and Betrapped!The preview images and videos tell you all you need to know about how to play the game. The rules are simple, and the premise is a fresh take on the Minesweeper gameplay with another layer of complexity for those of us who like a bit more challenge in our logic puzzles.I was not disappointed. But, had I paid full price, I would have found the shortness of the game (I completed it with perfection in 70 minutes) and the static nature of the puzzles to be offputting.Ultimately, I can't recommend this game at full price unless you are a major fan of the genre, but at the sale price, it's a buck well spent. Hopefully the upcoming Hexcells Infinite will offer a more extended play opportunity.Pros - Clear in-game instructions. Excellent concept and implementation. Pleasant ambiant music.Cons - A finite number of puzzles. No 'free play' mode or randomized puzzles, so no replay value. A bit on the short side.			"

The set of rules is varied enough that deductions are interesting but not overwhelming.The puzzles don't really get more difficult, just more complex. This is not the kind of game where you get stuck, you just might need patience to sift through the clues to find the next usable one.The puzzles are very good but never reach the full complexity afforded by the rules.

												Rather easy if you are experienced with minesweeper. The Hex grid makes a lot of advanced logic deductions used in normal minesweeper impossible, which means that the puzzles' difficulty is severely limited. Took me about 1 hour to 100% the game.			"

												Hexcells is Minesweeper if Minesweeper used hexagons instead of squares and had minor aspirations towards being Sudoku. Probably the biggest differences between Minesweeper and Hexcells are that Hexcells starts with a number of tiles uncovered so that you don't have to make the initial random clicks to get onto the board; Hexcells doesn't fail you outright for making a mistake or two; and Hexcell only comes with a limited number of set levels rather than randomly generating them.It's a basic time waster that only takes a couple of hours or so to complete. I only really purchased it because it was on sale and even then I'm not sure that I couldn't have done better... I haven't played the sequels, but if your looking for a flashier version of Minesweeper it might be better to give them a try rather than picking up this version.			"

												Shoutout to my friend Cat Bug for gifting me this game!First Impression:Download was quick, took less than a minute. The cover photo is a beautiful minimalistic design, font was consistent throughout on the menu.Gameplay:The game does give you instructions on what some things mean from time to time, and guides you throughout the game when you reach something new. Overall, this is a point and click game, no keyboard needed.Artwork:Gorgeous. It’s uniform throughout, there are no random changes. It’s no da Vinci, but it’s still very well done. If I absolutely HAD to complain, I’d say that the patterns on the levels aren’t the prettiest, but this game is a puzzle game, not an art game.Music/sound:Nothing caught my attention, but everything was constant throughout.Storyline:Not applicable to this game. Just advance through all 6 levels!End Impression:I loved this game so much that I played and completed it in 3 hours. I also loved it to the point where I had to complete each level perfectly, no mistakes allowed.Parting Words:If you love minesweeper, get this game. The complete pack (3 games in one) is on sale for $2.69 until June 22, and in my opinion very much worth.

												First, a warning: the menu screen of the game lists three ""slots"": Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 3. These are not different parts of the game! I didn't figure it out at first so I finished the game three times without knowing it... Nowhere is stated that the 3 ""slots"" are identical. Bad design!Other than that, well... This game is a lot similar to the absolute Microsoft classic, Minesweeper. Only cooler (and combined with the Japanese game of Kakuro). Main difference is that you almost never have to guess anything (mayber never, but it seems I didn't get all the hints). Which means you solve the puzzles like a math problem, using only logic. it feels great, but it also makes the game really easy. The game is also super short (don't let my playtime fool you, I actually left it running for a whole afternoon while I was out running errands) and contains only 30 puzzles; out of these 30, about 4 are actually challenging — there is more tutorial levels in the game than actual puzzles.And one last thing, the music sounds nice at first but quickly becomes annoying, and you can't deactivate it while in game (again, bad design).Bottom line: I had fun for about 20-30 min and thought the idea behind Hexcells was great, but the game is too easy and way too short for me to recommend it. It would have been free, I would have said go and play it! But I don't think it's worth 2,99 €. It's just like... a draft. I was enticed by the concept though so I'm gonna try Hexcells Plus and see if it is better. See you there.			"

And if you don't usually play puzzle games, this can be a good introduction, with a simple control scheme and only minor penalities for not being perfect every single time.

												This game is a glorious nightmare. It's very similar to Minesweeper, with a slight resemblance to Soduku. I just wish there was a way to mark cells you're working on but aren't yet sure about. You can do this in Minesweeper and Soduku. In Hexcells, you have to do everything mentally or get out some paper. In the later levels, when you're working through all the possibilities for where the active cells are, it's hard to keep track of in your head.			"

Hexcells is basically the same as Minesweeper, but each level you could sort out the pattern logically unlike in Minesweeper you sometimes need to try your luck. But also due to this reason the level of Hexcells is limited (but fun enough for these 40+ levels) however Minesweeper generated every game randomly and, less logically. 10/10.

												Hexcells is a puzzle game not unlike minesweeper. Not to say that this is a rip-off, but the game does fall into that puzzle genre, so those who like cleaning up the fields based on surrounding information of placement of ""mines"" will dig this game as well.The main difference from minesweeper in your Windows is that slots are hexes and that the puzzles are pre-made, not randomly generated. And while hex form doesn't make much of difference, it's the fact that puzzles are pre-made that makes this game THE thing. Those of you who enjoy playing Mines sure remember the times when the randomly generated field would give you a situation that you simply can't solve logically, only by guessing (dang corners!). Not in this game. All 30 puzzles are cleverly crafted to make sure that there is always enough of information at any moment for the next step. It's great to know that there is always a way to proceed, you just have to recheck everything and figure out the patterns.Well, it would have been great, but Hexcell 1 is mostly a tutorial title in series. out of 6 worlds, 5 of them introduce new elements, ways of thinking and are easy to beat. Real challenge comes only in final world puzzles, that is 4 pieces plus 1 bonus. If you plan to get only one Hexcells, then you should go for Plus or Infinite, which (re)introduce elements quick enough and then it's pure challenging field cleaning.I also don't approve the game letting player to just click on everything on the field. While the game punishes it by giving less points, that you need to proceed to the next worlds (and for perfect achievement), the puzzles don't change when and you can just remember the placement of blue fields and redo it perfectly, in a cheap way. Just don't do it. For your own enjoyment. Ok?Art is minimalistical. Artistical minimalism. Minimalism artistico. Usual spacey ambient soundtrack. Doesn't take away attention. Some may like it. I only like music that can also be heard in the trailer and that's about it.So, people who like minesweeper puzzles should pick this one along with whole Hexcells bundle. Otherwise, if you want only one such game, then go with other Hexcells titles.			"

												Excellent little puzzle game. A little short - but it's the first of a series and priced accordingly so it's okay. Easy to draw parallels to minesweeper and the very basics are no doubt similar but this game very quickly gets tricks and an identity of its own. Cleverly constructed puzzles and terrific ambient audio.The game doesn't really have a fail state and some may not like that, perfecting the game only gets you an achivement and you don't get punished otherwise for doing wrong. Personally this is a good thing as I prefer these kind of games when they can be done at your own pace. Excellent for playing in short bursts (I was doing laundry a lot of the time) or longer sessions with your own music in the background.Highly recommend this game. And supposedly the sequels are even better! Can't wait.			"

												Well I managed to complete the whole game within 4 hours, but that's actualy not a bad thing. This game gives you a new puzzle experience which is indeed influenced by the original minesweeper game, but still different at many aspects. The only sad thing is that a lot of puzzles look like tutorial puzzles, you can easily solve them within a minute. The good puzzles show up at the end, those can be very difficult but extremely challenging! You should definately give this game a try, I bought the Hexcells collection (Which includes all the 3 games) in sale for only €2,70, but it's also worth the full price in my opinion. If you want to spare some money, but the Hexcells Infite game which includes infinite puzzles which are way more difficult too!+ Whole new puzzle experience+ Some puzzles can be difficult+ Good tutorialpuzzles included+ Cheap- Puzzle doesn't save when you quit- Overall difficulty is too low- Small playing timeOverall I give it a 7.0/10, it's worth a try and includes some whole new puzzle mechanics. If you want a more difficult game than I suggest you should purchase the Hexcells Infinite game.			"

												Puzzle games that take a familiar mechanic and add a simple set of twists can definitely go one way or the other: really good, or horribly bad. Occasionally, I buy one on a whim and am granted with a brilliant experience, as I was with Lyne. This has happened not just once again, but three times with Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite. For the sake of brevity, what follows covers all three, but the TLDR is that if you like puzzle games, buy Hexcells.Graphics 9/10Visuals are always big with me, and these games are beautiful with simple, clean imagery and colours. But this beauty has function: the orange, blue and charcoal colour scheme means you know very clearly what each cell is. The small animations when you hover over or click on a cell are nicely done as well. While it's not perfect, I have only very minor issues with particular aspects of each iteration of Hexcells; so small I won't even mention. But if you're a fan of minimalist design, this is a great example.Audio 9/10The minimalism here continues, with more variety however. Although I generally turn off music in games, I did take the time to sample it in all three iterations of Hexcells. I'm a fan of ambient electronic, and found it very fitting. Combined with the visuals, it made me think of games like flOw. The samples used when clicking on cells continue the minimalist electronic theme, with some levels using piano-type sounds while others sounded more like raindrops or wee bells. With that said, after having to redo some levels again and again, I turned off the sound completely. And speaking of level design …Gameplay 10/10Have you played Minesweeper? This game is to Minesweeper, what DOOM was to Wolfenstein. The basic gameplay was very similar, but suddently there is more depth, more challenges, more variety. And while I liked Minesweeper back when I first got Windows 95, I found it too repetitive. Hexcells however, introduces enough new mechanics, not to mention board design, that I could play this game continually.Replayability 9/10In fact, that's part of what Hexcells Infinite is about, with a level generator built in that uses a random seed to create as many levels as you wish to play. Though the pedant in me wants to say: an 8 digit, whole integer seed won't give me infinite levels, but that is such a tiny quibble. ;) Still, overall, with dozens of levels pre-built in each of the three versions of Hexcells, and the near-infinite custom levels in one version, there is plenty of replayability.Overall 9/10If you like puzzle games, buy Hexcells. If you have a friend who likes puzzle games, buy Hexcells for him/her. As of this writing, you can get all three versions for $9.99CDN, and at that price, it's a good deal. If you can snag it on sale, even better. Add on the fact that it works on Windows, Mac and Linux, and there's really no good reason not to support a developer like this. My only hope is they can follow it up with another game that is as brilliant.			"

												I love this game. Hexcells takes the classic game of Minesweeper and pushes it to a whole new level. Instead of squares, you get hexagons - this sounds more difficult, and some of the levels are pretty challenging, but it was a great improvement. There's no guessing, either; you're always given just enough information to complete the level with zero mistakes. You can listen to the ambient, relaxing music as you test your brain with these 36 levels.Not only are there numbers on the hexes, but once you get far enough there are also line headers (numbers above rows or beside columns) as well as counters on some of the blue tiles that tell you how many blue hexes are within the highlighted area. I think this game is unique, intuitive and overall very satisfactory. I got it on sale for less than a dollar, but I would have purchased it at full price. It's worth it.If you're looking to test your puzzle solving skills, this game (and the entire series) is something to try out.			"

												I used to be a fan of Minesweeper on windows but as the time pass by and so many blockbuster games to play, I never thought I'd draw finger on Minesweeper again until-I find this game. Hexcells is basically the same as Minesweeper, but each level you could sort out the pattern logically unlike in Minesweeper you sometimes need to try your luck. But also due to this reason the level of Hexcells is limited (but fun enough for these 40+ levels) however Minesweeper generated every game randomly and, less logically. 10/10. Great game for someone nostalgic like me lol.			"

If you enjoy puzzle games at all, I would recommend this game.  I just wish it would have lasted longer.			"

												Definitely an enjoyable game for a few hours, as it easily gets your brain firing to try and beat each level without making a mistake. On its own, Hexcells is a very short game (about 3-5 hours). With only 30 levels to play through, it is not the type of game you will get much replayability out of either, as the puzzles don't shift or change.If you find this type of game up your alley, pick up the other two games (Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite) as well.

												This is a highly enjoyable spiritual successor to Minesweeper, however it does have some puzzles that are simply not possible to solve without guessing. All the levels are pre-made (no random puzzle generator is present in this release), so this issue can be circumvented by memorising the levels until an inevitable perfect completion of the puzzle.Because of this, Hexcells is not a classic, but a very enjoyable spin on this style of puzzle game. 4 hexagons out of 5 (or 5 out of 5 if you memorised this review).

Just the puzzle and relaxing background music, where each move adds notes to the music. The set of rules is varied enough that deductions are interesting but not overwhelming.The puzzles don't really get more difficult, just more complex. This is not the kind of game where you get stuck, you just might need patience to sift through the clues to find the next usable one.The puzzles are very good but never reach the full complexity afforded by the rules.

												80 minutes to get 98%. Recommended for fans of Minesweeper/Picross, at the price that you feel is appropriate for about 1.5 hours of play.I have a fair amount of experience with Minesweeper and Picross-style puzzles, so this felt straightforward and fun. Hexcells ends up using the same logic you'd use for those games. All puzzles are 100% prove-able; there's no forced guessing between multiple spaces. I didn't notice anywhere that I had to string together much ""if this, then this, then this, no that won't work""...no giant cascading logic messes. Comfortable and casual all the way through.Some cautions: -- Unlike some similar games, you aren't marking tiles in a toggle-able way. That is, once you left- or right-click on a tile, it will immediately be shown to be correct or incorrect (which costs you a mistake). -- To me, the default left and right click felt backwards. I restarted the game and swapped them in the pre-game settings window with no problem. -- I played through almost the entire game in a windowed smaller resolution. Puzzle 29 did not fit entirely in the window, and I couldn't find any way to scroll or scale so I could see the whole puzzle. I had to exit back out and start again with non-windowed 1080p, since I figured that would be safe for all puzzles. -- The level select screen does not seem to indicate which puzzles you used a ""mistake"" on, so it looks like it would be annoying to go back and figure that out after the fact. I'd recommend that you immediately retry puzzles if you're aiming for the (very obtainable) perfect achievement, or at least write down which puzzles you'd need to retry later.Don't get me wrong, these cautions are all very minor. I enjoyed this quick game.			"

												Nothing prepared me for what this game has done to me. I was looking for a puzzle game and came across Hexcell as one of Steam’s recommendations. “For two bucks and some change, I’ll give it a shot,” I thought. The game lulled me into relaxation by introducing concepts in easy to understand tutorials and basic puzzles. Then it added another layer of complexity, then another, and another. After finally completing one of the later puzzles without making any errors, I realized that I was not just playing a game. I was being trained on how to thing rationally and methodically using geometric and mathematical principles in ways that were light years beyond anything I had ever encountered before. At times, the game has taunted me, frustrated me, and even seemed to take a delight in watching me click on the wrong hex after getting three quarters through a map. Yet, I always go back for more. My cheap, cute, and spontaneous purchase has become an addiction. There is no other word for it. I have had to uninstall this game so that I would not be tempted by its siren call.If you are looking for an excellent puzzle game, you need not search any more.  "

												Hexcells makes you feel like a god damn genius every time you complete a level without making a mistake! Hexcells is an amazing logic puzzle game, part minesweeper, part sudoku. Simultaneously challenging and relaxing (with a lovely ambient soundtrack). Brilliant game worth every penny. Why don't you already own it? :D			"

												Do you enjoy sudoku? How about minesweeper? Do you want something that is both highly challenging and enormous fun, while at the same time being very relaxing?Play Hexcells. It leaves thse other games in the dust, and you'll find yourself bending over backwards to get the perfect score on every level.The first Hexcells is very short, probably only two to three hours if you're quick or determined, but it's a fun little game and it works as a great primer for Hexcells Plus, although you don't really need to play the first to understand the second (or Infinite!), but you may wish to buy it al the same, because it intrduces new concepts gradually, and you'll be able to learn the little tricks you need to succeed.And besides, how will you get the perfectionist achievement if you don't own the game?

												It's more or less like complex minesweeper. (or maybe sodoku, my original comparison. That depends on the complexity of the levels though). I find this game to be a great way to pass the time. It's very calming and a great brain teaser. The music can be soothing, and there is something satisfying about chaining a few cells in tune with the music. There are a few times where I found one or two levels to be somewhat impossible with trial and error. And often it can become a game of memorizing since each playthrough is the same as the last. Reguardless completing the game to 100% can be something of an achievment. Plus, if you worry that the fun ends there fear not! There is hexcell plus!			"

												Hexcells = Minesweeper + Picross + Hexes. Really great, innovative little game.+ Challenges in puzzles ramping up near the end. Though may not be as hard as other puzzle games+ Varieties add up to the challenges.+ Beautiful, soothing soundtracks. Great for studying. Might open this game only for the soundtrack :)+ Resonancing sounds while clicking the hexes.+ Good sense of reward when completing a level.+ Nice and simple interface.+ No guessing or trial and errors in playing. Every puzzle are well polished and ensure that there is always a way to clear it without guessing.+ Casual, relaxing and full of thinking game. No stressing about the time limit nor mistakes limit.- Game is way too short (Original).- Hoped that there is a replay button while in the puzzle.- Easy to 100%.- More rewards please, I love rewards in little games :3.In short, a great little time waster for those who are bored, seeking new games to play.

												Hexcells is a delightful little puzzle game, a bit like minesweeper but much more interesting and well-built. Unlike Minesweeper, you never need to guess in Hexcells - using the hints provided at the beginning of the level, you can work your way to a completed field using logic alone. If you're a fan of sudoku or Minesweeper, I can guarantee you'll enjoy this game.As the first game in the series, it lacks a bit of the polish of later entries (saving partially completed puzzles isn't added until the third installment) and it's a little to easy to get to the end (I got perfect on all stages in less than four hours taking my time), but it serves as a great introduction to the much more challenging later games. I reccomend picking up all three games on sale as I did - the difficulty scales is such a way that it feels like playing through one larger game.Overall, a really refreshing, if somewhat easy, puzzle game. Grab the sequels if you want more polish and challenge.			"

												I bought this short but sweet game when it was on sale for 50 cents. I didn't expect much, so it was a pleasant surprise to find a true logic game.Though Hexcells borrows elements from several different puzzle games, I was most reminded of nonograms, also known as Picross or Hanjie, which I've solved hundreds of by hand and in video games. As with nonograms, the game's beauty lies in the fact that the rules are are simple and it is purely logic-based (instead of relying on gimmicks or time-limits). That means that even in the later puzzles, which can be a bit challenging, you never have to resort to guess-work and anyone can solve them easily with enough focus and time.It's true the game was far too short (you can get 100% completion in a few hours), but now that I've tried it I would recommend it even at full price, though of course preferably wait for a sale. Apparently, the third installment has a random puzzle generator, which soundss like exactly the kind of thing this kind of game needs, but I will have to try it to see. Regardless, this game has proven the concept amazingly well and given my brains a few solid hours of work to do for the price of a cup of coffee.			"

												80 minutes to get 98%. Recommended for fans of Minesweeper/Picross, at the price that you feel is appropriate for about 1.5 hours of play.I have a fair amount of experience with Minesweeper and Picross-style puzzles, so this felt straightforward and fun. Hexcells ends up using the same logic you'd use for those games. All puzzles are 100% prove-able; there's no forced guessing between multiple spaces. I didn't notice anywhere that I had to string together much ""if this, then this, then this, no that won't work""...no giant cascading logic messes. Comfortable and casual all the way through.Some cautions: -- Unlike some similar games, you aren't marking tiles in a toggle-able way. That is, once you left- or right-click on a tile, it will immediately be shown to be correct or incorrect (which costs you a mistake). -- To me, the default left and right click felt backwards. I restarted the game and swapped them in the pre-game settings window with no problem. -- I played through almost the entire game in a windowed smaller resolution. Puzzle 29 did not fit entirely in the window, and I couldn't find any way to scroll or scale so I could see the whole puzzle. I had to exit back out and start again with non-windowed 1080p, since I figured that would be safe for all puzzles. -- The level select screen does not seem to indicate which puzzles you used a ""mistake"" on, so it looks like it would be annoying to go back and figure that out after the fact. I'd recommend that you immediately retry puzzles if you're aiming for the (very obtainable) perfect achievement, or at least write down which puzzles you'd need to retry later.Don't get me wrong, these cautions are all very minor. I enjoyed this quick game.			"

												I picked up the complete pack for around $3. This was a fantastic buy - The game is similar to Minesweeper except the board is segmented, hexagonal, and all levels are made to prevent the annoying guessing mechanic of Minesweeper. The levels also have additional information that really requires you to think, but the game at the same time is very intuitive and doesn't require the use of a guide at all. The feeling when you solve an entire part of the board with one discovery is fantastic. I don't usually grab puzzle games on steam, but I'm glad that I got this one. It is very short, but in a Portal sort of way where it is also sweet. It is roughly 2-3 hours of gameplay, but infinite adds in custom levels too which can expand upon your play if you can't stay away. Overall, I would definitely recommend buying this game if you can grab the complete pack on sale.			"

As another review said, it really reminds me of Picross, which is one of my favorite puzzle games, just a shame is it Nintendo exclusive, if you know you like that, then Hexcells is for you. Only complaint is that it is a 1 - 2 hour puzzle game, which is expanded with two other games, which are also highly recommended. On sale for a couple of pounds, definitely worth adding to your collection.			"

												TL;DR - minesweeper, short, needs polishing, nice for 1$This puzzle game is basically ""minesweeper"" in hex form. Yes, there are some additions. Yes, the levels have ""shapes"". But it's basically ""minesweeper"".It's not too hard - took me just over an hour to finish. It's kind of fun for those who like this sort of thing.However, it's not polished enough:- The controls are confusing (right-click ""opens"" the cell, left click sets the ""mine"" - the opposite of minesweeper) so that most of the mistakes I made were from mixing up the buttons- whenever you move the mouse over a hex, it ""reacts"" similar to a wrong click. That is very confusing when you play ""fast"", as you get the ""you did wrong"" feedback all the time making you hesitate- The ""extra"" information (""the mines are all adjacent"" for example) are often unnecessary (meaning you could have solved the puzzle even without it)- - best example for this is the appearance of {5} in a cell - meaning ""five neighbors have mines, all adjacent to each other"". This is silly, as it's the ONLY way to put five neighbor mines in a hex grid!- - but there are other examples of this information just serving nothing help at all. I would expect puzzles with this sort of ""extra information"" that doesn't always appear to be unsolvable without it. This isn't the case here.- You can't easily fine the levels you didn't finish ""perfectly"" if you want to try and redo them.So that's it. I payed 1$ for the game, and it's OK for that price. I wouldn't pay more, nor would I recommend anyone else pay more.			"

												I bought the game at full price, and I expected a lot of it when I viewed NerdCubed's Video about it, and it sure held up with my expectations. It's my first ever real puzzle game I've ever bought on Steam, and I might have to say that it's my most favorite puzzle game I've ever played (Including all the 'less-puzzle' ones I own). The Gameplay is somewhat easy to learn.  At a certain point in the game they don't tell you anything about an introduction of a new mechanic and they just throw you into the cold water expecting you to figure it out....well they have done that at the right moment where you were kind of expecting that.  The music is probably the best thing about this game, along side with the gameplay of course. The music sounds as if it's synced by the way you're playing, which is amazing, and the calmness it gives you is amazing. Even better, no time limit, so you can take your time listening to the music and have a great time. The only negative part about this game is the length, it's quite short, I finished the game in about 3Hours and it took me another 1Hour to get a Complete 100% Game, but there is a 'cheap' addition to the game for this issue. If you're on the lookout for a fun and calm puzzle game, pick this one up.			"

YouTube™ Video: Indie Mon: Hexcells 

			Views: 16		

			Kick back for a relaxing puzzle game called Hexcells today. Well relaxing in the Sudoku sense. Hexcells puts you in charge of what hexagons need to be changed, or not.		

Yesterday I had a headache, and was searching for a game that I could play to get my mind off of it. I wanted something without action, and I wanted to listen to some of my own relaxing music. I knew a puzzle game would be a perfect fit, and that's how I came across Hexcells. So I put on my music, and got right to the relaxing world of math.Hexcells is a game where a bunch of hexagons come together, and you must figure out if the orange hexagons are blue, or a number. Sound simple sure, but how does one figure out this crazy math! Each puzzle starts off showing some numbered hexagons. This number is equal to the amount of blue hexagons that are touching it. So if it says four that means four blue hexagons are touching, and if it says zero then that means no blue ones are touching.Let's stay with the zero example for a little bit. So if it says zero then you'll want to right click all the hexagons that are touching it. This gives you more options to play around with as it opens up more of the playing field. For another example lets move on to if the hexagon says one. Since this one already is touching a blue hexagon then you can right click on all the other hexagons touching this hexagon with the number one.Hexcells was a great way to just kick back, and play a mindless game that actually requires some brainpower. Think of it like a Sudoku, or word search puzzle. You're using your brain, but it's not something you have to concentrate too hard on.As Hexcells carried on it added more rules to it. One for example was having numbers at the top, or sides of the puzzle. When you see this number that's telling you how many blue hexagons are in that row. There's more to the world of Hexcells, but that's for you to find out about.It took me a little over two hours to beat Hexcells, and I was kind of sad it was over so soon. I want more puzzles! I really enjoyed my time figuring out these puzzles, and think if you're a fan of Sudoku puzzles, or puzzles in general you'll enjoy Hexcells. Worth the price of $2.99, and worth your time.			"

												Peaceful, logical, and satisfying.It brings in the very few info-symbols at an excellent pace, that gives you plenty of time to adjust to the new ones. It's just a very pleasant puzzle-to-puzzle progression.There is always all of the information available to puzzle out what your next step should be. I know that some of the other reviews said that they had to guess sometimes, but I suspect that they just couldn't figure out that point in the puzzle. If you get stuck, just set it aside for a while, and come back to it later with fresh eyes.  :)At less than $1 during the Summer Sale, Hexcells is one of the best values on Steam for a money-to-quality ratio. I recommend it. "

												As any review can tell you, this starts out as Minesweeper on hexagons. Later levels introduce interesting twists, like rules about adjacency and totals for columns of hexes. Puzzles range from trivial in the beginning to vast and complex in the end.My only real complaint is that the game is short; it's just 30 levels, and much of that is spent ramping up through puzzles that hew to the easy side. All in all I spent just 100 minutes clearing Hexcells. Still, for just 90 cents I do feel like I got good value for this purchase.			"

												This game took me 6 hours to complete to 100%; there's a lot of game for your money here. Hexcells takes only a few seconds to learn, but hours to master, and new features are added throughout - including the game telling you how many blue cells there are in each column or row. At first, this seems like a gift that makes the game that little bit easier, but this ends up tricking you, and you make mistakes that could have been avoided were you paying attention to the rest of the game. This is only one of the brilliant new ideas that Hexcells brings to the classic Minesweeper gameplay, aside from this game's gorgeous, quirky and unique shape and finish. All in all, this game is well worth buying, whether you're not a big puzzle game player or love them to pieces. Even if you hate Minesweeper, like I did, then buy this game for a better, longer and more fun puzzling experience.			"

It is not just a hexagonal minesweeper.It is more in ways you at first might not think.TL;DR: New take on the classic minesweeper, however no randomly generated levels. Still definitely worth the money.Good things: Very interesting concept Simple and clean interface Challenging puzzlesLess good things: Limited amount of puzzlesReview:What got me to buy this game was that it reminded me about minesweeper, but with a new and fresh look to it. Seeing my friend play the game asured me that the game was worth the money.The game is good, plays well with an nice interface. The puzzles are hard but solveable, which is something I personally like. Now the mechanics of the game is where the game shines, with ""unexpected"" mechanics which once mastered will lead you to victory.			"

What is Hexcells?Hexcells is a puzzle game that looks rather like Minesweeper. Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.After completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time. Although similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.Why I recommend the gameHexcells is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.The 30 puzzles themselves are interesting and there are enough additions in terms of new rules/clues during the course of a playthrough to keep them fresh and interesting. I just wish there were more.However, this does not mean that the game is without flaws. For instance, it is not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use. Furthermore, the puzzles tend to be on the easy side, for me anyways.My biggest problem with the game is that there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.All that being said, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and would recommend it as the pros outweigh the cons for me. I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try.			"

												A lovely little logic game.  With hexagons.Hexcells is a beautifully designed game with a simple aim: uncover all the hexagons, which are either blue or grey.  It's kind of like minesweeper, with some elements of sudoku mixed in.  Add that to a minimalistic design and soothing soundtrack, and you have a great game that’s just a lot of fun.  It’s not too long or difficult, but getting a perfect (0 or 1 mistake) on every level did provide some challenge for me.  (total time for completion: little under 5 hours for all achievements)  Great game to pass the time when you’re not wanting anything too fast-paced.  Only critique: Kinda wish that this game had more replay value, since once you’re done with it, it’s over.  No more to do.  But then again, that tends to be the case with games of this style.Overall rating: 8/10			"

												Hexcells is one of the best puzzle game experiences I've had.It starts off with a simple Minesweeper-like premise. After a few levels, the game begins its brilliance by adding new types of clues beyond ""three of the surrounding hexes are empty,"" turning the game into something resembling a nonogram-like puzzle (the kind of puzzle featured in Nintendo's Picross games). These mechanics are backed up by excellent puzzle design and an ambient soundtrack that keeps players relaxed and focused as they work their way through the puzzles.The only serious flaw in the game is that there isn't any replay value. There is still quite a bit of skill in repeating the large puzzles without making a mistake, but gradually players will remember the patterns and can cheat by learning from previous mistakes. Smaller puzzles also suffer as they can become simple exercises in trial and error.Yet that flaw is a minor complaint. Anyone who enjoys logic-based puzzles should give this one a go. After finishing it, check out Hexcells Plus for an even greater challenge or Hexcells Infinite for an endless amount of content.			"

												Many reviews say this is similar to minesweeper, so I was slightly hesistant to buy this game since I hated minesweeper.  This game is very logical and fair.  It is addicting and a lot of fun, simple to learn, but complex to master.  The price is good as the game is short allowing new players to try it without a large monitary commitment.  Great game all around.			"

												An interesting, fun and original puzzle game. Every aspect of the game is well-polished. It does, however, appear to be quite short and simple (although I havent played through all of it yet) so I would recommend getting it in a deal.			"

												Hexcells is a great spin on minesweeper and logic puzzles that manages to be utterly compelling. In some cases you may play puzzle games to be challenged, and while you will certainly find that here, the ambient soundtrack and sound effects allow relaxing gameplay. The downside is the short amount of levels - 36. Half of those you will breeze through learning the game, and the most taxing puzzles you can steamroll if you are not dedicated to making any mistakes whatsoever. If you are, it's likely to last 2 or 3 hours, perhaps more if you are not familliar with logic puzzles, but the very low price conterbalances that issue for this different take on the puzzle games.I'ts more compelling than minesweeper, its less frustrating than minesweeper, it's better than minesweeper. PROS: Great mix of relaxing ambience and challengeFreindly difficulty curveMinesweeper without the 'red wire, blue wire' moments.Cons:Little content. 8/10 "

												This game is worth playing if you like puzzles. Its basically minesweeper but with a bit more rule introduces with a gradual progression (and a quickly increasing difficulty curve), I'm pretty certain the goal of the puzzles is to logically figure out how to solve each one without any guessing and when I played like that each puzzle I beat felt like a major achievment to complete (although I had to spend hours to solve the harder puzzles.) It can also be played with occasional mistakes, but after a certain amount it will not allow you to progress.  I disliked the presence of a reset for the map and would have to leave it and find it again to restart with became annoying and after completing all the puzzle there is nothing left to do so the replay value is low (although for me I found that trying to do the puzzles again was still challenging). Its worth playing if you have the patience :P.			"

												I love the multidirectionality of Hexcells: solving a single cell can affect three lines of cells, as well as the set of surrounding cells. At first, it felt much like a hexagonal version of Minesweeper. When the lines were added, I was reminded of nonograms / paint-by-numbers puzzles. Then, as the puzzles continued, my mind became so occupied with the intersecting logic that I stopped trying to compare it to other games at all. It may be worth skipping this and going directly to Hexcells Plus. First, if you get easily addicted to logic puzzles, Hexcells Plus will keep you thinking for much, much longer. Second, Hexcells Plus' difficulty ramps up slowly and consistently, never adding more than a few techniques at a time. The puzzle difficulty from the original Hexcells increases smoothly at first, but jumps dramatically in the second half. It's a great challenge, but also changes the rhythm of play.			"

												I don't typically throw the term art around when refering to games, but this one deserves the title more over. The simplistic atmosphere and exceptional soundtracks creates a calm atmosphere while playing. The feeling the game creates helps to think when solving the tasks presented. This twist on the classic minesweeper takes a little getting used to at first, but quickly teachers you most of what you'll need to know.Despite the legnth being a little shorter than desired, my only real complaint is the tutorial system. This worked fine until World 3, which after I had no idea how to play and found myself guessing far too often. If either the devs or an individual were to put out a bit more in-depth tutorial or guide on those final mechanics, the game would be much more enjoyable.			"

												This is an amazing puzzle game with some nice brain-teasing puzzles, beautiful simplicity, and amazing music. It combines different elements form games like minesweeper and sodoku, and can be beat without having to do any guessing. Just put that noggin to work and enjoy. The only issue I have with this game is that it's a little bit short. It would be awesome with a level editor/creator of some kind, but the game is relatively cheap at the moment. I would suggest buying the 2 pack bundle to get both games together. Another option is buying it off of the Capsule 2 Bundle currently available on Bundle Stars for about $4.			"

												This game is about 2 parts Minesweeper, 1 part logic puzzles.    It really takes the concept that makes Minesweeper fun, but removes the trial and error aspect.  Every puzzle in the trilogy can be completely solved by logical deduction.  Once you do a full completion(perfectionist acheivement) there is not much replayability,but it is a very cheap game, and the first installment will give you at least 2-3 hours of play depending on how fast you are at solving.The first 4 worlds are relatively easy, but they help introduce and solidify the concepts of the game before it really starts to challenge you.I absolutely recommend this game if you are a longtime fan of either game type; it blends the two together very well!

												Hexcells is a good puzzle game that is essentially a variation of the classic minesweeper. However, don't let this put you off as all the puzzles in this game were specifically designed so that every tile can be deduced and that you are left with no 50:50 chances. Early on, I thought taht this game was going to be a walk in the park however as I progressed through the game I came to discover that it wouldn't stay as easy as I first predicted for long; having interesting additions to gameplay helping make this game harder and overall more fulfilling. But, the game doesn't last as there are only a handful of levels, with the earlier ones taking less than 5 minutes each to the latter ones occasionally taking a surplus of 30 minutes to complete perfectly. Despite this, I would still highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games that make you think, especially considering its cheap price tag. 8/10			"

												AMAZING!!! Ok this game isn't like as high intensity as a fps or cod yet can be as fun. You start off learning that you can change hexagons blue or black with a number in the center, simple enough right? Just wait. It starts off easy yet the farther you go, even from world one to two you learn things that help you like where the blues will be, but those wont save you. I have completed this game before doing this so I could write an honest reeve about it. To be honest it didn't take long (1 day) and if you aren't an achievement hunter this is fine but since I saw there were only 7 I decided to give it a go. I have 6 at the moment and the last one loused me ""Perfection"" this is where you complete every level with 0 mistakes. This is where it gets intense holding your breath every click hoping that it is the Wright one, and to not add one to your mistakes counter. Then you miscalls and start to flip it was the last one on the 6-3 level and I wasn't paying attention... I I threw my mouse against the far wall and watched it shatter. Five stars best game			"

												A different league of puzzle game. Saw this as part of a bundle... ended up playing it far more than the game I'd actually wanted from the bundle in the first place.The game is really snappy and responsive, looks great and comes with some fairly challenging puzzles as the combinations of rules get more complex in the later stages. I blitzed through this in about an hour and a half (without referring to any guides of course!), before going back to finish off 3 puzzles I hadn't got perfect on the first time round.Got straight onto Hexcells Plus after that!Would recommend very highly for any puzzle game fan, quite sudoku-esque. The logical steps and patterns you utilise, especially in combination for the later levels, are fairly rewarding as you start to see yourself picking up speed when encountering similar situations on other levels. The difficulty of Hexcells isn't too bad and even if you can't do a Sudoku to save your life, you will be able to get through this without having to look up a guide if you persevere! :)			"

												Deceptively sleek and simple, yet beautifully intricate and complex. The apparent similarities to Minesweeper are rather superficial as Hexcells expands much farther into logical depth. This is one of the most charming and satisfying (PC) puzzle games I've played and it is especially well priced. The only real negative is that the game is way too short, and even combined with the more advanced ""expansion"" (Hexcells+), most players will quickly be hungry for more content. Fortunately, the puzzles retain an incredible amount of replayability despite not being randomly generated.Overall highly recommended, even for those who don't typically play puzzle games.			"

It can feel a bit short and introductory, but pick it up with Hexcells Plus (and Hexcells Infinite) and it's an excellent combination.			"

												I love the multidirectionality of Hexcells: solving a single cell can affect three lines of cells, as well as the set of surrounding cells. At first, it felt much like a hexagonal version of Minesweeper. When the lines were added, I was reminded of nonograms / paint-by-numbers puzzles. Then, as the puzzles continued, my mind became so occupied with the intersecting logic that I stopped trying to compare it to other games at all. It may be worth skipping this and going directly to Hexcells Plus. First, if you get easily addicted to logic puzzles, Hexcells Plus will keep you thinking for much, much longer. Second, Hexcells Plus' difficulty ramps up slowly and consistently, never adding more than a few techniques at a time. The puzzle difficulty from the original Hexcells increases smoothly at first, but jumps dramatically in the second half. It's a great challenge, but also changes the rhythm of play.			"

												Some compare Hexcells to Minesweeper, but it is not quite the same.  With Minesweeper, winning fells like the luck of the draw rather than a logic exercise.  Luck adds a certain flair to other types of games, but with puzzle games like this, it does not do the game any favors.  Fortunately, Hexcells does not make the player rely on luck to complete puzzles.Hexcells forces you to use reason and logic to solve a puzzle.  The goal of each puzzle is to clear the orange hexagons to reveal a certain pattern.  The numbers in each cell indicate how many surrounding cells are part of the pattern (this is where the similarity to Minesweeper comes in).  As you progress, new elements are added.  These elements are reminsicent of Picross.  There is a number above the column that indicates how many cells in that column are part of the ultimate pattern.  There are also numbers in brackets that tell you how many cells are connected.  The puzzles also get larger.This is a relaxing puzzle game that is definitely worth the time if you enjoy logic puzzles.  It took me about 4.5 hours to complete 30 puzzles.			"

												It's more or less like complex minesweeper. (or maybe sodoku, my original comparison. That depends on the complexity of the levels though). I find this game to be a great way to pass the time. It's very calming and a great brain teaser. The music can be soothing, and there is something satisfying about chaining a few cells in tune with the music. There are a few times where I found one or two levels to be somewhat impossible with trial and error. And often it can become a game of memorizing since each playthrough is the same as the last. Reguardless completing the game to 100% can be something of an achievment. Plus, if you worry that the fun ends there fear not! There is hexcell plus!			"

												If you like abstract puzzle games, I definitely recommend this game.It's basically minesweeper, but in a hex grid and with a few extra rules to make it more complex. It starts off really easy but becomes considerably more interesting later on. It's also quite forgiving as it just counts your mistakes instead of blowing up the board, so you won't lose ten minutes of thinking on a misclick. It's designed to make you think but not feel on edge.The visuals are nice and seem just right for the game. I quite like the soundtrack but if you don't you can just turn it off.			"

												I got Hexcells Plus as part of a bundle, and after playing the first few levels I immediately purchased Hexcells so that I could play them in order. I didn't expect to enjoy these games as much as I did. The games are a mix of Minesweeper and Sodoku, plus a few extra twists.This game ran very well on my netbook at 1024x600 resolution (CPU: 1GHz dual-core AMD C-50), so I think that virtually any computer will be able to hande this game. If you are contemplating buying this game then you might as well get the Hexcells Bundle with both games (especially if you are proficient at logic puzzles). The difficulty curve in the second game starts exactly where the first game ended.All the levels can be completed without having to resort to guessing, although sometimes you wont believe this. But even when you are unable to determine (for example) which two cells contain the mine, knowing that it is either one or the other may give you enough of a clue to clear a third cell. It is very satisfying when you eventually figure out the puzzle.The only real con that I found to this game was that despite the harder levels taking some time to complete, there is a great sense of wanting to play just one more level when you do manage to finish it. This can be lead to some very late nights!Finally, a tip. If you are used to playing Minesweeper, you might like to swap the left & right mouse button actions in the configuration screen so that the right mouse button flags a cell as a blue cell (or a mine in Minesweeper parlance). I kept making mistakes all the time until I did this.			"

												I bought this short but sweet game when it was on sale for 50 cents. I didn't expect much, so it was a pleasant surprise to find a true logic game.Though Hexcells borrows elements from several different puzzle games, I was most reminded of nonograms, also known as Picross or Hanjie, which I've solved hundreds of by hand and in video games. As with nonograms, the game's beauty lies in the fact that the rules are are simple and it is purely logic-based (instead of relying on gimmicks or time-limits). That means that even in the later puzzles, which can be a bit challenging, you never have to resort to guess-work and anyone can solve them easily with enough focus and time.It's true the game was far too short (you can get 100% completion in a few hours), but now that I've tried it I would recommend it even at full price, though of course preferably wait for a sale. Apparently, the third installment has a random puzzle generator, which soundss like exactly the kind of thing this kind of game needs, but I will have to try it to see. Regardless, this game has proven the concept amazingly well and given my brains a few solid hours of work to do for the price of a cup of coffee.			"

												AMAZING!!! Ok this game isn't like as high intensity as a fps or cod yet can be as fun. You start off learning that you can change hexagons blue or black with a number in the center, simple enough right? Just wait. It starts off easy yet the farther you go, even from world one to two you learn things that help you like where the blues will be, but those wont save you. I have completed this game before doing this so I could write an honest reeve about it. To be honest it didn't take long (1 day) and if you aren't an achievement hunter this is fine but since I saw there were only 7 I decided to give it a go. I have 6 at the moment and the last one loused me ""Perfection"" this is where you complete every level with 0 mistakes. This is where it gets intense holding your breath every click hoping that it is the Wright one, and to not add one to your mistakes counter. Then you miscalls and start to flip it was the last one on the 6-3 level and I wasn't paying attention... I I threw my mouse against the far wall and watched it shatter. Five stars best game			"

												I don't typically throw the term art around when refering to games, but this one deserves the title more over. The simplistic atmosphere and exceptional soundtracks creates a calm atmosphere while playing. The feeling the game creates helps to think when solving the tasks presented. This twist on the classic minesweeper takes a little getting used to at first, but quickly teachers you most of what you'll need to know.Despite the legnth being a little shorter than desired, my only real complaint is the tutorial system. This worked fine until World 3, which after I had no idea how to play and found myself guessing far too often. If either the devs or an individual were to put out a bit more in-depth tutorial or guide on those final mechanics, the game would be much more enjoyable.			"

You can absolutely figure it out, but you might have to look at all the clues carefully first.  It's not a long game.  I've played it all the way through twice and put in five hours.

												Hexcells is a great spin on minesweeper and logic puzzles that manages to be utterly compelling. In some cases you may play puzzle games to be challenged, and while you will certainly find that here, the ambient soundtrack and sound effects allow relaxing gameplay. The downside is the short amount of levels - 36. Half of those you will breeze through learning the game, and the most taxing puzzles you can steamroll if you are not dedicated to making any mistakes whatsoever. If you are, it's likely to last 2 or 3 hours, perhaps more if you are not familliar with logic puzzles, but the very low price conterbalances that issue for this different take on the puzzle games.I'ts more compelling than minesweeper, its less frustrating than minesweeper, it's better than minesweeper. PROS: Great mix of relaxing ambience and challengeFreindly difficulty curveMinesweeper without the 'red wire, blue wire' moments.Cons:Little content. 8/10 "

What is Hexcells?Hexcells is a puzzle game that looks rather like Minesweeper. Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.After completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time. Although similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.Why I recommend the gameHexcells is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.The 30 puzzles themselves are interesting and there are enough additions in terms of new rules/clues during the course of a playthrough to keep them fresh and interesting. I just wish there were more.However, this does not mean that the game is without flaws. For instance, it is not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use. Furthermore, the puzzles tend to be on the easy side, for me anyways.My biggest problem with the game is that there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.All that being said, I've had a lot of fun playing this game and would recommend it as the pros outweigh the cons for me. I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try.			"

Hexcells is Minesweeper with Hexagons instead of squares that gives you some hints like Picross to finish the levels by combining the hints. Even though the game only gives you around 1-2 hours of playtime and there is no endless / RNG mode I can still recommend you to grab it, especially if it's on sale.			"

YouTube™ Video: Indie Mon: Hexcells 

			Views: 16		

			Kick back for a relaxing puzzle game called Hexcells today. Well relaxing in the Sudoku sense. Hexcells puts you in charge of what hexagons need to be changed, or not.		

Yesterday I had a headache, and was searching for a game that I could play to get my mind off of it. I wanted something without action, and I wanted to listen to some of my own relaxing music. I knew a puzzle game would be a perfect fit, and that's how I came across Hexcells. So I put on my music, and got right to the relaxing world of math.Hexcells is a game where a bunch of hexagons come together, and you must figure out if the orange hexagons are blue, or a number. Sound simple sure, but how does one figure out this crazy math! Each puzzle starts off showing some numbered hexagons. This number is equal to the amount of blue hexagons that are touching it. So if it says four that means four blue hexagons are touching, and if it says zero then that means no blue ones are touching.Let's stay with the zero example for a little bit. So if it says zero then you'll want to right click all the hexagons that are touching it. This gives you more options to play around with as it opens up more of the playing field. For another example lets move on to if the hexagon says one. Since this one already is touching a blue hexagon then you can right click on all the other hexagons touching this hexagon with the number one.Hexcells was a great way to just kick back, and play a mindless game that actually requires some brainpower. Think of it like a Sudoku, or word search puzzle. You're using your brain, but it's not something you have to concentrate too hard on.As Hexcells carried on it added more rules to it. One for example was having numbers at the top, or sides of the puzzle. When you see this number that's telling you how many blue hexagons are in that row. There's more to the world of Hexcells, but that's for you to find out about.It took me a little over two hours to beat Hexcells, and I was kind of sad it was over so soon. I want more puzzles! I really enjoyed my time figuring out these puzzles, and think if you're a fan of Sudoku puzzles, or puzzles in general you'll enjoy Hexcells. Worth the price of $2.99, and worth your time.			"

												Hexcells really feels like a combination of minesweeper and, to some extent, suduku. With no timed element, it allows it to be a bit more complex than minesweeper could be. I thought it was going to be entertaining for a few minutes, and so I was surprised when over 2 hours had passed.			"

												This game is too funny. If you are a youtuber or livestreamer, this game is amazing to pass the time when you are looking for a Ranked Match on League of Legends or something. Like Super Hexagon, it doesn't require so much time, you can stop whenever you like, it is just a way to fill in the time when you have it. For example, you die during Call of Duty, waiting for respawn? Play Hexcells, that is practically it. It is a great game for your brain as it tests how quick and accurate you are.			"

												Many reviews say this is similar to minesweeper, so I was slightly hesistant to buy this game since I hated minesweeper.  This game is very logical and fair.  It is addicting and a lot of fun, simple to learn, but complex to master.  The price is good as the game is short allowing new players to try it without a large monitary commitment.  Great game all around.			"

Quote:Let go your earthly tether. Enter the Hexcells. Empty and become the mines. Empty and become mine.Discovered:Improve your logic and extend your patience as you purge through cells of impurities.Intro:This game is a relaxing Zen romp through exquisitely designed mine fields that that test your logic and patience  as new rules to the game are added, which in turn evolve your way of thought while bringing you to a whole new spiritual level of enlightenment.Good/Bad:It’s basically minesweeper with many interesting twists. You click to clear out an area and you click to tag a mine. The numbers tell you if there are any adjacent mines and other numbers, if positioned in a different way or has brackets or etc., tell you entirely different clues. It proves to be very challenging at the end but it’s not like you haven’t been groomed for it the entire time you’ve been playing. You can cheat by simply taking a photo of the finished product and restarting, but you wouldn’t want to because it’s so much more rewarding when you figure out the puzzles with your own “AHA!” moments.Summary:Hexcells provides casual enjoyment especially for newcomers and minesweeper novices while engaging the mind with soothing frequencies of sound.Rating:Hexagon out of HexagonWorth: Buy it at full price because you love minesweeper!Last Thoughts: Enter the void; become a guru; buy the game!

												The best way I can think of to describe Hexcells is not as a puzzle game, but as a ""meditation game"" and a sort of mental massage.The gameplay follows on from Minesweeper, you start with the same rules, identifying blue hexes by the non-blue hexes telling you the number of adjacent blues.  But new mechanics are introduced which pushes it toward the realm of Sudoku.  I never found it frustrating or confounding, because the rules are simple enough that you only have to look for the next step, not make crazy leaps of logic.  Also, while you don't get a full score for making several mistakes, each mistake you make at the same time serves as a hint and moves you closer to the solution (a nice parallel with positivity in real life!)So the gameplay requires you to be active and logical mentally, but not so much that you can't relax or have to get stressed.  And the rest of the game with its simple visuals and procedural ambient soundtrack works to make one of the most relaxing experiences I've seen in games.  The puzzles and music are in a nice area between idleness and frustrating which lets you slip easily into a meditative state while playing.I highly recommend this game, especially if you turn off the TV, turn the lights down a bit, kick up your feet, turn on a humidifier, lay a damp washcloth on your forehead, and just completely relax while playing.  For anyone dealing with excessive levels of stress or anxiety, this game could be outright therapeutic!			"

												This is a very fun puzzle game, a cross between Minesweeper and Picross/Nonograms. It has great relaxing music an visuals, and the puzzles themselves are designed to be fun and relaxing. There's a fair amount of levels, and Hexcells Plus adds a large amount too. And while I haven't played it yet(in my Library though), Hexcells Infinite, which is the third game in the series, apparently has a random puzzle generator, which would be freaking incredible. This game is a steal at this price, and I'd definitely recommend this to puzzle fans, and especially Minesweeper/Picross/Nonogram fans.			"

												Hexcells is a minimalist puzzle game like no other. It has the feel of minesweeper, with a few crucial differences that make it much better: there is no guessing—every move is logically motivated; there are no bombs, leading to a mellower, more serene experience; and each level is amazingly handcrafted to test your skills. This game is the first in a trilogy—it is the easiest of the three, but no less worthy for that.			"

Quick Breakdown: A fun puzzle game with similarities to Minesweeper, where you must determine which cells are filled with blue hexes, and which are vacant.Length: 2-3 hoursScore: 6/10Full Review: Hexcells a simple puzzle game, its closest companion would be Minesweeper, except it’s a bit more involved than that (also a lot better, and you’re not timed). The way the game works is you have a… let’s call it a board, filled with hexagons, which we’ll call cells. You need to determine which cells are occupied with a blue hexagon, and which ones are vacant (which will be grey). The vacant cells will also have a number inside them, indicating how many adjacent cells are occupied. You simply left click a cell to mark it as occupied, and right click a cell to mark it as vacant. If you’re correct, the cell will change accordingly. If you’re wrong, it’ll shake and mark you as getting making a mistake (more on this in a moment).As you progress through the game, the puzzles will get more complicated, and additional ways to indicate whether or not a cell is occupied are introduced.  Sometimes numbers will be encased in curly brackets, indicating that all the occupied cells adjacent to the vacant cell are touching each other.  Where-as a number that has a hyphen on each side means that at least one of the adjacent occupied cells is not touching the other adjacent occupied cells. (Note for clarity: When I say the cells are touching each other, I don’t mean ALL the cells are touching ALL the other cells, but that they are connected like a line curved around the vacant cell. For the hyphenated numbers, some of the cells may be touching each other, but there is at least one break in the group. There may be two groups of two touching cells for example).Numbers will also appear at the top of columns, or even at a diagonal, indicating how many occupied cells are in that row or column (reminding me ever so slightly of Picross). This numbers also will use the same additional mechanics as the vacant cells, with the curly braces and hyphens indicating if the cells are all connected, or have a break in them. The later stages will require you to use these different numbers in tandem to solve the puzzle.Now, even in the later stages of the game, Hexcells never gets too difficult. It’s a fairly easy game, and you’ll be able to complete it in 2-3 hours without much trouble. After that, you’re done, there’s not much replay value (unless you try to perfect every level, which you might do just playing through it anyway).The levels in Hexcells are divided up into 6 worlds. Each world consists of a couple of stages (4-6 stages, with a total of 26 stages). When you complete a level you are awarded blue hexes towards a total score of them. By earning enough of these blue hexes you unlock the next world. The number of blue hexes awarded for completing a stage varies depending on its difficulty, and you will be awarded less blue hexes the more mistakes you make in a level. (Don’t worry, you can redo levels do earn the blue hexes you missed).The music in the game is fairly calm and simple, it’s not anything particularly note-worthy, but it fits with the relaxed feel of the game. (Both the game and the music are overall rather relaxing).As for criticisms, they’re two main things I feel this game lacks. 1). There’s no option to save a level mid-way through, so that you can leave the game and return to it later. My work around for this was to take a screen cap if I had to stop playing for some reason, and then just redo my stage progress from there. 2). It’d be nice if there was a way to map out a potential solution (similar to Picross’ overlay feature), so that you can indicate which cells you think may contain blue hexes, and which you think may be vacant without selecting them. Though, this is less needed in this Hexcells game than it is in later ones where you must figure out how large swathes of a level work together to determine if a cell has a blue hex or not.So if you’re into puzzle games, then consider picking up the Hexcells pack when it goes on sale (often you can get all 3 games for less than $3). If you already have the first Hexcells game and want more, Hexcells Plus is basically the hard mode for this game, and Hexcells infinite will also provide you with more puzzles to play. If you only want one Hexcells game, go for Infinite, it has some improvements over the other two, and a random level generator, so it’ll offer more play time, (see my review for Hexcells Infinite for more details on that). Whichever route you opt for, it’s a fun puzzle game.			"

Most important point:Buy the complete pack. The original game can be finished 100% (including perfect results) in 2 hours. The standalone addons Plus and Infinite deliver more puzzles and a much bigger challenge.It didn't take long for me to fall in love with this game. I used to play minesweeper a lot so this type of game was right up my alley - but it still managed to surprise me in many ways, like with the fact that every correct click adds a single note, creating a melody on the fly as you play. Great atmosphere.One last thing: everyone who says that there are situations where you basically have to flip a coin is completely wrong. This is nothing like the default windows minesweeper has been since windows 95. There are no chance situations, you can 100% figure out every situation, it's just hard to do sometimes.The only downside to this game (that I see) is that there's no save function mid-game. Especially in the addons there are a few puzzles that can take quite some time to complete.			"

												Simple but challenging puzzle game! The best part of this game is that there is no need for guessing. All levels can be completed with logic thinking. There is always enough information available to make your next move. The more you advance, the less obvious the next moves are going to be, so it eventually it will be hard. And I must say that the music is really good, it gives an important touch for the likeability of this game. One minor thing that I would add to this game is that there is no quick restart button. While it isn't something to be really bothered with, it would be nice if you could press 'R' so the level gets restarted. Now you need to go to the menu and select that level again. Not really that important, since most of the levels you do not make any mistakes.			"

												Hexcells is a minimalistic puzzle game in which one has to decide if orange hexes are either grey or blue ones with the help of several hints.~ The puzzles slowly become more complicated with more clues to look at over the time. All three games (Hexcells, Hexcells Infinite and Hexcells Plus) have different mechanics added to the original in the beginning.~ The game is extremely relaxing. There is no ""Game Over"" screen and no timer. You can solve the puzzles at your own pace with calm music in the background and fitting melodic sound effects.I highly recommend trying to solve the puzzles slowly without making any mistakes for the most enjoyable experience!~ Every single puzzle of the three Hexcells games is entirely solvable with logical thinking and without the need to guess during any of them.~ Hexcells Infinite offers an additional mode in which you can generate puzzles with random seed codes.Without doubt one of the most polished puzzle games I've seen, and even though I dislike Minesweeper, I love this game to bits.Highly recommended.

Several times I was convinced that a particular puzzle would come down to guessing. I was wrong. There's always a way.I'm especially impressed with the random puzzle generator in the last game. They're not as ingenius as the hand-crafted ones, but I won't have to wait for that 4th game that will never come. Still haven't run into an unsolvable puzzle.I nominated this for a Steam Award in the ""makes you think"" category. Just reiterating: this is good.			"

												This is a nice variation on minesweeper, hex shaped and creative ways to tell which ones are good cells vs bad cells.  Makes you think more than minesweeper does to understand the logic behind it.Pro'sGood Music to listen to while you play.Clues are always there if you think them through.Con'sEasy to forget left or right click causing stupid mistakes.

												This game is a glorious nightmare. It's very similar to Minesweeper, with a slight resemblance to Soduku. I just wish there was a way to mark cells you're working on but aren't yet sure about. You can do this in Minesweeper and Soduku. In Hexcells, you have to do everything mentally or get out some paper. In the later levels, when you're working through all the possibilities for where the active cells are, it's hard to keep track of in your head.			"

												Hexcells is a minimalistic puzzle game in which one has to decide if orange hexes are either grey or blue ones with the help of several hints.~ The puzzles slowly become more complicated with more clues to look at over the time. All three games (Hexcells, Hexcells Infinite and Hexcells Plus) have different mechanics added to the original in the beginning.~ The game is extremely relaxing. There is no ""Game Over"" screen and no timer. You can solve the puzzles at your own pace with calm music in the background and fitting melodic sound effects.I highly recommend trying to solve the puzzles slowly without making any mistakes for the most enjoyable experience!~ Every single puzzle of the three Hexcells games is entirely solvable with logical thinking and without the need to guess during any of them.~ Hexcells Infinite offers an additional mode in which you can generate puzzles with random seed codes.Without doubt one of the most polished puzzle games I've seen, and even though I dislike Minesweeper, I love this game to bits.Highly recommended.

												Delightful little puzzle game that stretches your cortex just enough to make you work but never so tough to make your focus snap or resign yourself to guesswork.  The levels are a soothing palette (especially compared to Minesweeper!) and the gentle chiming ambient soundtrack is a perfect fit; highly recommended to anyone with a few hours to concentrate and try something different.  Mac specific notes - a few quirks in the game were noted: screen size was wonky when pulling up the Steam overlay in game whether played windowed or not, and the music would disconnect randomly when I attempted to plug in or select headphones as a listening option under my System Preferences (on iMac).  Nothing that impeded actual gameplay, but somewhat irritating hiccups nonetheless.And it took me a while to nail it down, but the music sounds wonderfully akin to FAX Records' early works!  That is just about the highest praise I can offer a game's soundtrack, btw.			"

												An enjoyable puzzle game, for about 2 hours, if you play quickly. Then you decide to perfect every level... You accidentally right-click instead of left-click and almost punch a hole through your monitor. Realizing that it is all your own fault, you try again. After making the same mistake four times, you decide that it might be smart to slow down for a few minutes and concentrate purely on which mouse-button to click.I enjoyed the game until the penultimate level. That level is pure BS and you will not get a perfect on it the first, I almost guarantee it. It took me about 30 minutes to finally perfect that level, some accidental wrong-mouse-button-clicking may have taken place... but nonetheless an enjoyable experience overall. I would recommend this game for people who want to kill a couple of hours. It is a decent, somewhat repetitive puzzle-game. You either mark the hexagon, or clear it to see numbers underneath. Simple as that. I bought all three of the games (Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite) on sale. I expect the others to be similar to this one, with new features and quirks. I don't know if it is worth full-price, but for US$3 or whatever your currency may be, it is a decent purchase.			"

												It's short but entertaining. The concept is similar to minesweeper, though I found myself mixing up the left & right click as a result. If you can train yourself to right click on numbered cells & left click on objective cells instead of the other way around, it's fun while it lasts.			"

												Hexcells and its sequels are absolutely essential to anyone that loves logic puzzle games like Picross and Sudoku. Contrary to the belief of the occasional negative (bad) reviewer, there is ALWAYS a logical way to proceed, without any guesswork. It often requires that you change the way you think about solving the puzzles, as following the same rules will only take you so far. Particularly, when it gets to the point that you have to start systematically eliminating cells as possible answers one at a time, or weighing your options based on the number of blue cells remaining, I can see why certain players would simply give up and call it impossible. It's not; I promise. Keep at it, or try to find a spoiler free hint to give you an idea of how to think through it rather than just giving you the answers.			"

												Got this game as a part of ""Hexcells Complete Pack"" on an impuls purchase. The reviews were very positive, the description interesting and the price for all three games was under 3 EUR, so I decided to try it. The game lived up to the expectations it created. There was nothing that would disappoint me.The game itself resembles ""Minesweeper"", but in a more creative way. This is the first game of the series and is the shortest and easiest. The actual challenge begins with the next game. At the moment of writing this review I have 16.9 hrs on record and I've played the game twice, so there is some reply value. Maybe in future I'll reply it once again. Definately recomend buying this game if you like logical puzzle games.			"

												80 minutes to get 98%. Recommended for fans of Minesweeper/Picross, at the price that you feel is appropriate for about 1.5 hours of play.I have a fair amount of experience with Minesweeper and Picross-style puzzles, so this felt straightforward and fun. Hexcells ends up using the same logic you'd use for those games. All puzzles are 100% prove-able; there's no forced guessing between multiple spaces. I didn't notice anywhere that I had to string together much ""if this, then this, then this, no that won't work""...no giant cascading logic messes. Comfortable and casual all the way through.Some cautions: -- Unlike some similar games, you aren't marking tiles in a toggle-able way. That is, once you left- or right-click on a tile, it will immediately be shown to be correct or incorrect (which costs you a mistake). -- To me, the default left and right click felt backwards. I restarted the game and swapped them in the pre-game settings window with no problem. -- I played through almost the entire game in a windowed smaller resolution. Puzzle 29 did not fit entirely in the window, and I couldn't find any way to scroll or scale so I could see the whole puzzle. I had to exit back out and start again with non-windowed 1080p, since I figured that would be safe for all puzzles. -- The level select screen does not seem to indicate which puzzles you used a ""mistake"" on, so it looks like it would be annoying to go back and figure that out after the fact. I'd recommend that you immediately retry puzzles if you're aiming for the (very obtainable) perfect achievement, or at least write down which puzzles you'd need to retry later.Don't get me wrong, these cautions are all very minor. I enjoyed this quick game.			"

Once you've finished all the levels, there's nothing left. Also the mines don't change location, so you can redo the levels over until you get a perfect score. I've revisted it a couple times, but really it only took a couple hours to go through all the levels. My time says more, but mainly that's due to the game running while doing chores, and such.			"

												This game is a nice mix of sudoku and minesweeper. The puzzles get increasingly harder as you progress through the game and it is very satisfying when you perfect at level quickly. I highly recommend all of the Hexcells games, but if you are to buy only one get Hexcells Infinite. That one adds some mechanics on top of the ones presented in this game, and best of all includes a random puzzle generator for when you complete the game for added hours of fun.			"

												Hexcells is a nice puzzle game, reminds you of Minesweeper. However, this version is just a simple teaser of what comes later. Some of the puzzles are good, but when you face the ultimate question - should I buy this game? I would recommend not to do so, buy Hexcells Infinite instead. It is true that this version contains different puzzles, but they are quite simple and the real challenge (and level generator) come in the Infinite version (on that note, certainly skip Hexcells Plus).

												Really fun puzzle game. It's easy to pick up - the concept is basically a hexagonal minesweeper, with some really clever and well done additions (eg number of blue hexes in a radius, in a column, diagonal). The difficulty curve is well done so picking up the concepts is pretty easy and you never feel totally flummoxed by a puzzle suddenly. The aesthetics and music are very pleasant and relaxing. Only negative is it can kind of suck to misclick and lose your perfect score, although you're given 1 error before it starts affecting things. The other games in the series are excellent too, although they get a lot harder than this one.			"

												How to play Hexcells? It's easy.All you need is to sit in a comfortable chair and start doing simple math. Counting, counting and counting.But if you really want to try this game now. Don't buy this version. Purchasing its sequel Hexcells Infinite is a way better decision. Because the later one has a puzzle generator that can give you tons of new puzzles to play.Link to Hexcells Infinite:This game is basically an alternative to Minesweeper. Changing the shape of hidden block from Square to Hexagon doesn't make this game any special. Both games give you very similar gameplay experience.However, Hexcells makes the game a lot easier by giving you a lot of hints. I didn't have any difficulty to finish this game very quick. So, I have to say that the game is not that challenging comparing with Minesweeper.But still is a decent game and deserve your attention.			"

I like that the puzzles make you think and the music/ambiance is pretty relaxing. My only gripe is that World 6 is far and away the hardest puzzles and it's only at this point that the game becomes challenging. By the time you get through it, you've beat the game. Great proof of concept for puzzles, and I am looking forward to playing the other Hexcells games sometime.7/10			"

Hexcells has been aptly described as a modern version of Minesweeper. There are several key differences, however: Minesweeper randomly generates its levels, while each level in Hexcells was created by hand. This gives it the advantage that every level is solvable using pure logic, no need for guessing. Hexcells is also more lenient when it comes to making mistakes: it counts how many mistakes you make, but they do not result in a game over. Instead, you must solve each level with a minimum of mistakes in order to earn a perfect score.Creating each level by hand also has the disadvantage of limiting the game to a finite number of levels. There are so few in fact that it only took me two hours to complete every level with no mistakes. Because of this I would not recommend spending more than $2 on it.			"

As another review said, it really reminds me of Picross, which is one of my favorite puzzle games, just a shame is it Nintendo exclusive, if you know you like that, then Hexcells is for you. Only complaint is that it is a 1 - 2 hour puzzle game, which is expanded with two other games, which are also highly recommended. On sale for a couple of pounds, definitely worth adding to your collection.			"

												Evokes the feel of Minesweeper (especially the mental exercises you had to go through if you liked to clear a Minesweeper board without actually marking any of the mines). Also leverages mental exercises akin to those used to solve Sudoku puzzles. A fun set of levels, though rather short and easy to breeze through. Replayability would be greatly improved if there was an option to generate random puzzles. Sorry, you're stuck with the ones they give you.			"

												I picked up the complete pack for around $3. This was a fantastic buy - The game is similar to Minesweeper except the board is segmented, hexagonal, and all levels are made to prevent the annoying guessing mechanic of Minesweeper. The levels also have additional information that really requires you to think, but the game at the same time is very intuitive and doesn't require the use of a guide at all. The feeling when you solve an entire part of the board with one discovery is fantastic. I don't usually grab puzzle games on steam, but I'm glad that I got this one. It is very short, but in a Portal sort of way where it is also sweet. It is roughly 2-3 hours of gameplay, but infinite adds in custom levels too which can expand upon your play if you can't stay away. Overall, I would definitely recommend buying this game if you can grab the complete pack on sale.			"

												In a nutshell: Like a hex-based Minesweeper, with some extra twists that add some Sudoku-esqe logic, meaning that, unlike Minesweeper, you aren't forced into making blind-guess clicks. There's always a 'thread' to pull to further unravel the puzzle; you just haven't spotted it yet. Also comes with a nice, mellow soundtrack to help you chill, while you look for that 'thread'.Do note the mouse buttons are essentially reversed from standard Minesweeper controls, by default, but can be remapped fairly easily from the opening menu.

Overall highly recommended. I'm on to the next installment of Hexcells.P.S.

												Picked this up on a whim while browsing the Top Sellers list and found myself completely addicted to it!The puzzles start off simple, gradually introducing new concepts as you progress through the levels. You will find yourself restarting levels just to get the perfect score on them. Soundtrack is quite pleasant and calming to listen to.			"

												Clever puzzle game that is a mix of Minesweeper and Sudoku.Many of the puzzles in this first entry are simple and serve to introduce mechanics and new ways to think about scenarios, but none of them are overly challenging.Visual and sound design are very simple and ambient, but do a good job of setting a mood and conveying all necessary information.

												Hexcells is a challenging logic game, a bit like Minesweeper on a hexagonal grid, but with some cool twists that make it much more interesting and challenging. For one thing, every puzzle can be solved by logic (although some of them really test those skills). The hex grid and the types of clues used make this a unique game.Pros: A good difficulty level (for me). Quite challenging. Cons: A little short in terms of content. It only took me about 8 hours from start to finish.Recommendation: For those who like logic games, if the price is right, I strongly recommend it.			"

It's kind of like Minesweeper, but it has added elements that make it way better.One thing I appreciate is that there is no guesswork or random clicking needed. You should be able to solve each puzzle with the clues provided.			"

												I think this is, quite literally, the perfect puzzle game. It has a learning curve smoother than any other and just the right amount of difficulty to keep you thinking the entire time, but not roadblocking you. While it can look too simple with a very limited ruleset, it pushes the mechanics to their limit. If you're familiar with logic puzzles, it MIGHT be too easy for you, but I found it to be so much more satisfying than any other puzzle game I've played. Minesweeper is similar, but it's lucked based, and this game can be completed doing zero guesses, since it's all pure logic. Games like kami on steam can be fun, but it's too easy to guess the solution than to really think and problem solve using logic, and often similar games will just pile on more rules and gimmicks, but not Hexcells. This game is beautiful in its simplciity.			"

												Pros: Minesweeper Clone but actually fun, not random. Can logically progress through levels and every additional ""clue"" is well explained, albeit hard to master.Levels 4-5-6 take a bit more time to figure out, making the challenge of a ""perfect"" score fun.Music is actually soothing and helps focus attention instead of distractionCons: Needs 100 more levels. I was able to finish the game in 2.5 hours.Would be nice if the Dev's could develop an algorythm to generate beginner/expert/master random maps for the pureenjoyment of it, but so far, once you are done... you are done. I definately recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exercizing the brain. It is well made. Just wish there was more of it. :)			"

												It's a hexagonal minesweeper with an advanced array of complications that force the player to think way too hard. There are hexagons in my dreams. My eyesight has deteriorated so heavily from focusing on the cells that I can no longer see the full spectrum of visible light, only orange and blue. My skin has broken out into a hexagonal rash so I'm starting to look like a walking 5 Gum commercial. My brain has rewired itself only to scan in hexagonal zones. My fingers no longer have purpose in everyday life, their sole function is to mark and uncover what lies beneath.I love it.6/6			"

It provides simplistic, peaceful and relaxing music and graphics. A great game to play when you have a tough decision to settle.  Verdict Must buy, but consider the price.It's a great game, don't get me wrong. But for the price that it is compared to the gameplay you get out.

It's not a competition for the fastest thinker, it's a self challenge.Even so, the game is too short, you can easily finish it in 1 or 2 hours. I think it would be better if challenges were randomly generated by some algorithm, but it's ok for the price.			"

												Love this game. If you like minesweeper at all, this is like if minesweeper was actually a good game*. Handcrafted levels, so you never have to guess which element is a ""part of the pattern""(mine) and which one is ""not""(safe). Every move can be calculated. Super relaxing ambient noise and very challenging. If you buy this and want a harder challenge, Hexcells Plus is also fantastic. If you've seen the trailer above and it looks like something you might like, you will. If it doesn't, you probably won't.*I actually like minesweeper too			"

												Short but a nice bit of puzzle fun. Simple Minesweeper meets Pattern kind of logical puzzle. Later levels are very enjoyable.The game is very short. No replayability. The levels that are there, however, feel rewarding, fresh and enjoyable, despite the low difficulty. The game works as its own tutorial by introducing new elements step by step per level. It ends shortly after discovering all puzzle elements. It feels like there should have been 5 more puzzles.Technical side is a bit flawed in that the cursor keeps flickering and the framerate is consistently low even though there's basically nothing on screen.Ambient music and sounds are very good. Clicking cells emits a sound fitting the harmony of the ambient background track. Everything feels like music and that's beautiful.Graphics are decent for a puzzle game with simple design. Unfortunately, poor framerate and cursor flickering. Seriously, this needs optimizing as it gnaws on the game experience.Recommended if you're looking for a round of chill puzzles and don't mind the stuttering. I played this game via a friend's shared library.			"

												Hexcells is an excellent puzzle game with mechanics very similar to Minesweeper. Your goal is to discover fields where the 'bombs' are and correctly mark them by eliminating empty ones. They are represented by numbers which show how many bombs there are in adjacent cells. Additional rules are introduced in later levels such as number of bombs in whole column and that they must be either adjacent to one another or separate from each other.Game has 30 levels which will take you between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete. Warm recommendation for purchasing Hexcells Complete Pack which contains all 3 games from this series.			"

												Delightful little puzzle game that stretches your cortex just enough to make you work but never so tough to make your focus snap or resign yourself to guesswork.  The levels are a soothing palette (especially compared to Minesweeper!) and the gentle chiming ambient soundtrack is a perfect fit; highly recommended to anyone with a few hours to concentrate and try something different.  Mac specific notes - a few quirks in the game were noted: screen size was wonky when pulling up the Steam overlay in game whether played windowed or not, and the music would disconnect randomly when I attempted to plug in or select headphones as a listening option under my System Preferences (on iMac).  Nothing that impeded actual gameplay, but somewhat irritating hiccups nonetheless.And it took me a while to nail it down, but the music sounds wonderfully akin to FAX Records' early works!  That is just about the highest praise I can offer a game's soundtrack, btw.			"

												This game and its sequels are marketed as puzzle games, but the puzzle within them are usually quite easy. Don't be fooled by the ""you have to guess"" club, you can solve all of them without guessing (or remembering solutions from your previous run throughs) but it takes a hunt sometimes to find the number you have left to complete. This is where most of the real difficulty lies in the game.Saying that, the big blue thumb next to my review implies that this is not a bad thing. The games are well programmed, oddly compelling, and aside from the potential for misclicks (which is always on the user, not the game) well paced, with a soundtrack that works, but is ignorable, I can't honestly not recommend it if you are into this sort of thing.

												Short but a nice bit of puzzle fun. Simple Minesweeper meets Pattern kind of logical puzzle. Later levels are very enjoyable.The game is very short. No replayability. The levels that are there, however, feel rewarding, fresh and enjoyable, despite the low difficulty. The game works as its own tutorial by introducing new elements step by step per level. It ends shortly after discovering all puzzle elements. It feels like there should have been 5 more puzzles.Technical side is a bit flawed in that the cursor keeps flickering and the framerate is consistently low even though there's basically nothing on screen.Ambient music and sounds are very good. Clicking cells emits a sound fitting the harmony of the ambient background track. Everything feels like music and that's beautiful.Graphics are decent for a puzzle game with simple design. Unfortunately, poor framerate and cursor flickering. Seriously, this needs optimizing as it gnaws on the game experience.Recommended if you're looking for a round of chill puzzles and don't mind the stuttering. I played this game via a friend's shared library.			"

												Hexcells is an excellent puzzle game with mechanics very similar to Minesweeper. Your goal is to discover fields where the 'bombs' are and correctly mark them by eliminating empty ones. They are represented by numbers which show how many bombs there are in adjacent cells. Additional rules are introduced in later levels such as number of bombs in whole column and that they must be either adjacent to one another or separate from each other.Game has 30 levels which will take you between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete. Warm recommendation for purchasing Hexcells Complete Pack which contains all 3 games from this series.			"

												A lovely little logic game.  With hexagons.Hexcells is a beautifully designed game with a simple aim: uncover all the hexagons, which are either blue or grey.  It's kind of like minesweeper, with some elements of sudoku mixed in.  Add that to a minimalistic design and soothing soundtrack, and you have a great game that’s just a lot of fun.  It’s not too long or difficult, but getting a perfect (0 or 1 mistake) on every level did provide some challenge for me.  (total time for completion: little under 5 hours for all achievements)  Great game to pass the time when you’re not wanting anything too fast-paced.  Only critique: Kinda wish that this game had more replay value, since once you’re done with it, it’s over.  No more to do.  But then again, that tends to be the case with games of this style.Overall rating: 8/10			"

												Hexcells is one of the best puzzle game experiences I've had.It starts off with a simple Minesweeper-like premise. After a few levels, the game begins its brilliance by adding new types of clues beyond ""three of the surrounding hexes are empty,"" turning the game into something resembling a nonogram-like puzzle (the kind of puzzle featured in Nintendo's Picross games). These mechanics are backed up by excellent puzzle design and an ambient soundtrack that keeps players relaxed and focused as they work their way through the puzzles.The only serious flaw in the game is that there isn't any replay value. There is still quite a bit of skill in repeating the large puzzles without making a mistake, but gradually players will remember the patterns and can cheat by learning from previous mistakes. Smaller puzzles also suffer as they can become simple exercises in trial and error.Yet that flaw is a minor complaint. Anyone who enjoys logic-based puzzles should give this one a go. After finishing it, check out Hexcells Plus for an even greater challenge or Hexcells Infinite for an endless amount of content.			"

												Great series of games. I never really liked MineSweeper so I wasn't sure about Hexcells but after playing it, it's great (and unlike MineSweeper, you don't have to guess ---- it may take a little time to figure things out but guessing isn't required).The only options I'd like to see are:1. The ability to shift click a cell and change it into a different color (for times you want to test things out without making a selection).2. When you reach the area in Hexcells Plus where you can highlight cells within a 2 hex radius, it would be nice to be able to select a different color for highlighting the area. The game only provides a light white highlight and I'd prefer something with more contrast like green or red.			"

Like Super Hexagon, it doesn't require so much time, you can stop whenever you like, it is just a way to fill in the time when you have it. For example, you die during Call of Duty, waiting for respawn? Play Hexcells, that is practically it. It is a great game for your brain as it tests how quick and accurate you are.			"

												Do you enjoy sudoku? How about minesweeper? Do you want something that is both highly challenging and enormous fun, while at the same time being very relaxing?Play Hexcells. It leaves thse other games in the dust, and you'll find yourself bending over backwards to get the perfect score on every level.The first Hexcells is very short, probably only two to three hours if you're quick or determined, but it's a fun little game and it works as a great primer for Hexcells Plus, although you don't really need to play the first to understand the second (or Infinite!), but you may wish to buy it al the same, because it intrduces new concepts gradually, and you'll be able to learn the little tricks you need to succeed.And besides, how will you get the perfectionist achievement if you don't own the game?

												Nothing prepared me for what this game has done to me. I was looking for a puzzle game and came across Hexcell as one of Steam’s recommendations. “For two bucks and some change, I’ll give it a shot,” I thought. The game lulled me into relaxation by introducing concepts in easy to understand tutorials and basic puzzles. Then it added another layer of complexity, then another, and another. After finally completing one of the later puzzles without making any errors, I realized that I was not just playing a game. I was being trained on how to thing rationally and methodically using geometric and mathematical principles in ways that were light years beyond anything I had ever encountered before. At times, the game has taunted me, frustrated me, and even seemed to take a delight in watching me click on the wrong hex after getting three quarters through a map. Yet, I always go back for more. My cheap, cute, and spontaneous purchase has become an addiction. There is no other word for it. I have had to uninstall this game so that I would not be tempted by its siren call.If you are looking for an excellent puzzle game, you need not search any more.  "

Very very similar to Mine Sweeper.

												I generally don't like puzzle games. They are far too slow for my liking, but I completely understand the appeal and wish I could like them more. Hexcells may have changed this for me, for it is a perfectly crafted game from the presentation to the mechanics.You learn the rules as you go, but in a nutshell, you're tasked with finding all the blue hexes with a few clues. It plays very similar to minesweeper, but there is an emphasis on more complex rules to follow involving whether hexes are attached in a string and how many hexes are in a column.""an ambient logic puzzle game"" is the perfect descriptor for Hexcells, blending dynamic sound design with truly challenging and engaging problem solving. The sound interactions are employed in a way that only heightens the enjoyablilty of the game. The music and how your actions affect the sound is timely and bold, yet also soothing and ignorable.My only real gripe with the game would be how certain mechanics are explained in a weird order, with one mechanic not actually being explained. However, it is easy to understand regardless, and overall the game is well worth a purchase.			"

The experience is similar to playing minesweeper, but rather than getting used to the same patterns or impossible situations minesweeper players are sick of, every single level in Hexcells is beautifully crafted and brings a unique challenge and problem solving technique. If you like puzzle games at all, it would be idiotic not to try out this game for such a low price in my opinion. Once you finish the game, both sequels are equally entertaining and cheap. 10/10 cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Hexcells is a really nice spin on the classic minesweeper we all know (and love).. Instead of clearing out squares, you now have to clear hexagons, which surprisingly creates new challenges to overcome. Things get even more interesting once new mechanics are thrown into the mix like a certain amount of marked hexagons being next to each other or having at least one gap in between marked hexagons. They're added overtime, just so the player can get comfortable with the new skills they're learning though the previous levels. If you're hungry for a new kind of minesweeper, complete with an ambient soundtrack, a smooth difficulty curve, and a whole lotta hexagons, you can't go wrong with Hexcells...I do warn you that the game might feel a bit short, but hey, that's what Hexcells Infinite is for..

Which is simply ridiculous considering that a software can easily generate billions of puzzles.			"

												Pros: Minesweeper Clone but actually fun, not random. Can logically progress through levels and every additional ""clue"" is well explained, albeit hard to master.Levels 4-5-6 take a bit more time to figure out, making the challenge of a ""perfect"" score fun.Music is actually soothing and helps focus attention instead of distractionCons: Needs 100 more levels. I was able to finish the game in 2.5 hours.Would be nice if the Dev's could develop an algorythm to generate beginner/expert/master random maps for the pureenjoyment of it, but so far, once you are done... you are done. I definately recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exercizing the brain. It is well made. Just wish there was more of it. :)			"

												Hexcells and its sequels are absolutely essential to anyone that loves logic puzzle games like Picross and Sudoku. Contrary to the belief of the occasional negative (bad) reviewer, there is ALWAYS a logical way to proceed, without any guesswork. It often requires that you change the way you think about solving the puzzles, as following the same rules will only take you so far. Particularly, when it gets to the point that you have to start systematically eliminating cells as possible answers one at a time, or weighing your options based on the number of blue cells remaining, I can see why certain players would simply give up and call it impossible. It's not; I promise. Keep at it, or try to find a spoiler free hint to give you an idea of how to think through it rather than just giving you the answers.			"

Several times I was convinced that a particular puzzle would come down to guessing. I was wrong. There's always a way.I'm especially impressed with the random puzzle generator in the last game. They're not as ingenius as the hand-crafted ones, but I won't have to wait for that 4th game that will never come. Still haven't run into an unsolvable puzzle.I nominated this for a Steam Award in the ""makes you think"" category. Just reiterating: this is good.			"

												I liked this game. Pretty standard mine sweeper type game. My only issue with it, is as far as I can tell there's no random generator. Once you've finished all the levels, there's nothing left. Also the mines don't change location, so you can redo the levels over until you get a perfect score. I've revisted it a couple times, but really it only took a couple hours to go through all the levels. My time says more, but mainly that's due to the game running while doing chores, and such.			"

												As a player who decides what games to buy based on the reviews of the certain game, it's my duty to write a complete review about any game i finish, so here is my review:HEXCELLS:Hexcells is a puzzle game, where you must find out using logic if a certain cell is blue or not, depending on the information you are given about the cell. Yeah, not much to say about this one, only taht it's a really good game about puzzle lovers who like a really good challenge.Before i procceed with the PROS and CONS i would like to remind anyone who is reading this that these are my personal preferences and may differ by any individual who plays the game.PROS:+Well designed puzzles.+Helps against alzheimer (that's serious, it really helps your memory).+Difficulty has a good scaling from one level to another.CONS:-Apart from the ""Hexcells"" trilogy and the ""Squarecells"" game, no other game like this one.TL;DR This puzzle game is awesome and would recommend it to everyone.10/10			"

												80 minutes to get 98%. Recommended for fans of Minesweeper/Picross, at the price that you feel is appropriate for about 1.5 hours of play.I have a fair amount of experience with Minesweeper and Picross-style puzzles, so this felt straightforward and fun. Hexcells ends up using the same logic you'd use for those games. All puzzles are 100% prove-able; there's no forced guessing between multiple spaces. I didn't notice anywhere that I had to string together much ""if this, then this, then this, no that won't work""...no giant cascading logic messes. Comfortable and casual all the way through.Some cautions: -- Unlike some similar games, you aren't marking tiles in a toggle-able way. That is, once you left- or right-click on a tile, it will immediately be shown to be correct or incorrect (which costs you a mistake). -- To me, the default left and right click felt backwards. I restarted the game and swapped them in the pre-game settings window with no problem. -- I played through almost the entire game in a windowed smaller resolution. Puzzle 29 did not fit entirely in the window, and I couldn't find any way to scroll or scale so I could see the whole puzzle. I had to exit back out and start again with non-windowed 1080p, since I figured that would be safe for all puzzles. -- The level select screen does not seem to indicate which puzzles you used a ""mistake"" on, so it looks like it would be annoying to go back and figure that out after the fact. I'd recommend that you immediately retry puzzles if you're aiming for the (very obtainable) perfect achievement, or at least write down which puzzles you'd need to retry later.Don't get me wrong, these cautions are all very minor. I enjoyed this quick game.			"

												Note: This review is for both Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite, because they're basically a single game divided in three parts.The Hexcell games are a series of brilliant crafted puzzles that at first glance may seem like a six-sided minesweeper, but the logic used to solve them is closer to sudoku. As you progress through the levels, you are also introduced to some new mechanics accompained by a tutorial level to make sure that you understand them. Because the puzzles are carefully and wonderfully designed, you never have to guess your next move, but finding it gets hard in the later puzzles. The interface is clean and the sound effects are cool. Hexcells is easy, Hexcells Plus gets harder in the second half and Hexcells Infinite steps back a little at the beginning, but in the end offers the most challenging puzzles. It also comes with a seed-based puzzle generator, adding 999,999,999 additional puzzles (even if they aren't hand crafted, they're still good). My recommendation is that you get and play all three games in order, but if you can only pick one, pick Hexcells Infinite, it's main levels difficulty is nicely spread not to mention the puzzle generator.

												Plays like a minesweeper variant mixed in with some nonogram concepts, cells are either part of a pattern or not - it's up to you to find out which one is the case. Fortunately, there are more rules to the game than just ""we'll tell you about the adjacent spaces"". It took me around 2 hours to complete, so you might want to get this one in a sale or at least bundled with the others (plus and infinite). Other than that it does what it set out to do well. Could have been improved by adding generic puzzles (I hear that is implemented in Hexcells infinite) and maybe something like a time attack mode.			"

												Interesting puzzler. Finished in a single sitting of about an hour an a half, enjoyed every moment of it.Not the hardest of puzzlers, but enjoyed it very much. It gently introduces new concepts to make the game more diffucult, and the puzzles grow larger as well. Where the first ones take several seconds, the last few can take up to ten minutes. Not having an undo button is logical, as mistakes are immediately made known, but when your fingers don't follow your brain (i.e. when you want to left-click and you right-click, or the other way around), this is frustrating, as you have to start the puzzle anew entirely to perfect it.I would recommend to people who enjoy a quick challenge and puzzles in general. Otherwise, I'd steer clear of it - then again, why would you be looking at a puzzler review if you are not interested? ;)			"

												Hexcells is a challenging logic game, a bit like Minesweeper on a hexagonal grid, but with some cool twists that make it much more interesting and challenging. For one thing, every puzzle can be solved by logic (although some of them really test those skills). The hex grid and the types of clues used make this a unique game.Pros: A good difficulty level (for me). Quite challenging. Cons: A little short in terms of content. It only took me about 8 hours from start to finish.Recommendation: For those who like logic games, if the price is right, I strongly recommend it.			"

												How to play Hexcells? It's easy.All you need is to sit in a comfortable chair and start doing simple math. Counting, counting and counting.But if you really want to try this game now. Don't buy this version. Purchasing its sequel Hexcells Infinite is a way better decision. Because the later one has a puzzle generator that can give you tons of new puzzles to play.Link to Hexcells Infinite:This game is basically an alternative to Minesweeper. Changing the shape of hidden block from Square to Hexagon doesn't make this game any special. Both games give you very similar gameplay experience.However, Hexcells makes the game a lot easier by giving you a lot of hints. I didn't have any difficulty to finish this game very quick. So, I have to say that the game is not that challenging comparing with Minesweeper.But still is a decent game and deserve your attention.			"

												Picked this up on a whim while browsing the Top Sellers list and found myself completely addicted to it!The puzzles start off simple, gradually introducing new concepts as you progress through the levels. You will find yourself restarting levels just to get the perfect score on them. Soundtrack is quite pleasant and calming to listen to.			"

												Hexcells = Minesweeper + Picross + Hexes. Really great, innovative little game.+ Challenges in puzzles ramping up near the end. Though may not be as hard as other puzzle games+ Varieties add up to the challenges.+ Beautiful, soothing soundtracks. Great for studying. Might open this game only for the soundtrack :)+ Resonancing sounds while clicking the hexes.+ Good sense of reward when completing a level.+ Nice and simple interface.+ No guessing or trial and errors in playing. Every puzzle are well polished and ensure that there is always a way to clear it without guessing.+ Casual, relaxing and full of thinking game. No stressing about the time limit nor mistakes limit.- Game is way too short (Original).- Hoped that there is a replay button while in the puzzle.- Easy to 100%.- More rewards please, I love rewards in little games :3.In short, a great little time waster for those who are bored, seeking new games to play.

												I bought this short but sweet game when it was on sale for 50 cents. I didn't expect much, so it was a pleasant surprise to find a true logic game.Though Hexcells borrows elements from several different puzzle games, I was most reminded of nonograms, also known as Picross or Hanjie, which I've solved hundreds of by hand and in video games. As with nonograms, the game's beauty lies in the fact that the rules are are simple and it is purely logic-based (instead of relying on gimmicks or time-limits). That means that even in the later puzzles, which can be a bit challenging, you never have to resort to guess-work and anyone can solve them easily with enough focus and time.It's true the game was far too short (you can get 100% completion in a few hours), but now that I've tried it I would recommend it even at full price, though of course preferably wait for a sale. Apparently, the third installment has a random puzzle generator, which soundss like exactly the kind of thing this kind of game needs, but I will have to try it to see. Regardless, this game has proven the concept amazingly well and given my brains a few solid hours of work to do for the price of a cup of coffee.			"

												Hexcells plays like Minesweeper, using hexagons instead of squares. However, unlike Minesweeper which is randomly generated, each level in Hexcells is pre-made by the developer to have a unique and deducible solution. There are bits of spacial thinking that come in play, from crossword puzzles like Sudoku.Hexcells also takes the minesweeper playstyle and increases the complexity (always offering a deducible solution though), by introducing row/column markings in lieu of additional viewable pieces, as well as special tile number markings that denote certain behavior of where the blue pieces will be.I was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm really enjoying this series. I'm not noticing a terribly large complexity in this game, but I haven't gotten to the other two Hexcells games yet. I would recommend to people who enjoy puzzles.			"

												Hexcells is an amzing puzzle game.This game is essentially Minesweeper meets Sudoku. For me, these two puzzle games are extremely entertaining and fun. This game (along with the two sequels) captures the essence of both Minesweeper and Sudoku. Even if you haven't played either of these games that I mentioned, or you might not be intelectually gifted, Hexcells is a great game that won't dissapoint. All for the low price of only $3.The music is also very calming, and there is no rush to complete a puzzle too fast, which, for me, takes the enjoyment and fun out of playing a puzzle game. If you can't think well under pressure, don't worry. This game has no timer or penalty for taking your sweet, precious time.All in all, I rate this game a 9/10.Definetly buy this game if you're on the fence about it, and definetly consider buying the other 2 games in the series.

												Excellent game!  Reminds me of Minesweeper and also Sudoko.  It's a relaxing game to play, though it is a bit short.  The early levels teach you the basics, and you'll be introduced to more rules as you progress into the later levels.  There's plenty of ""ah ha!"" moments as you use deductive reasoning to determine if an orange hex should be marked as blue, or uncovered to reveal a numeric value about the adjacent cells.  The goal is to find ""x"" number of blue hexes in the level, where x is different for each level.  As you uncover more and more numeric cells, the more information you have about which remaining orange hexes are blue or numeric.The only downside is that the game was over before I knew it.  I completed all levels, re-doing a few to get the elusive ""0 mistakes"" in each level, and it only took me 5.5 hours.  And that's being generous (I got up to use bathroom, blow nose, etc, while game was running a few times).I did buy the game though in the Hexcells Complete bundle, which comes with two sequels, that I have yet to play.  The bundle itself was even on sale, so I think I actually only paid about $0.79 for Hexcells itself.  That said, even at it's normal price of $2.99, it's still worth buying.			"

												HexcellsA nice, relaxing puzzle game, set to a calm set of background noises and music that tickles the brain just enough to see it to the end. A super short game that doesn't take long to finish the game or even the achievements. It has a few flaws, but then again, what game isn't?Abstract - Hexcells is a short puzzle game involving numbers, hexagons, and a bit of thinking. It's short, sweet, not all that problematic, and fun for anyone looking for a little puzzle fix.What it is -  Its a puzzle game, pretty straight forward. No huge plot or anything.Who you are - The puzzle solver!What you do in game - Solve the puzzles using the context clues and hints provided by clicking the different cells. Two counters appear at the top, the remaining blue cells that need to be revealed, and the mistake counter, which affects how many ""reward cells"" you get upon finishing a level. The higher your mistake count, the less you earn. Gameplay - The aim of the game is to find all the blue cells while making few to no mistakes as possible. Finding all the blue cells and revealing the hint cells will finish the level. You need a set amount of ""reward cells"" in order to open up the newer levels, increasing in amount the further you go along. The game itself is an enjoyable experience, and, for the most part, not all that difficult. It becomes a little painful at the end, but the biggest complaint is how often ""guesstimating"" is your only option. You can easily narrow down where the blue cells will be, but more often than not you'll end up guessing about where the blue cells could be. Some are smart guesses, others are just ""welp, I'm stumped!"" guesses. It kinda detracted from the idea of solving the puzzle using smarts.Messing up isn't the end of the world. You can simply come back to the level later to try for fewer mistakes. That said, one can simply get the solution by purposefully using the screenshot function, but that's more of a ""last resort"", so don't abuse it!Envionment - White background, orange hexagons. Kinda strains the eye after a while, so take breaks!Conclusion - Really, especially for the price, its a pretty smooth game. Guesstimations aside, its a game that keeps you thinking, doesn't punish you too hard for playing the game and making mistakes as you can always come back to play at your own pace. The game also has several parts so you can easily extend your play sessions with different puzzles. If you're a hardcore puzzle lover, give this a pass. Too easy, exploitable, relies too much on guessing. If you just enjoy a good puzzle to pass the time, pick it right up!			"

It only took 90-120min to complete.There aren't a lot of levels, and some of them are kind of tutorial levels which is great but in the end you end up with even less 'actual' levels.When the game levels really get interesting ... the game ends! It's a shame because I could spend days on this one!Once again, for the price I paid I give it a 10/10, i just hope the developpers create a new batch of levels. I think I would pay another $2 per 20 levels (difficult levels that is).			"

												I got this game for $1.00, and it was well worth that amount for the entertainment I got out of it. This is a game that should run on just about any machine. I like that the puzzles make you think and the music/ambiance is pretty relaxing. My only gripe is that World 6 is far and away the hardest puzzles and it's only at this point that the game becomes challenging. By the time you get through it, you've beat the game. Great proof of concept for puzzles, and I am looking forward to playing the other Hexcells games sometime.7/10			"

												This is the pinnacle of puzzle games for me. The experience is similar to playing minesweeper, but rather than getting used to the same patterns or impossible situations minesweeper players are sick of, every single level in Hexcells is beautifully crafted and brings a unique challenge and problem solving technique. If you like puzzle games at all, it would be idiotic not to try out this game for such a low price in my opinion. Once you finish the game, both sequels are equally entertaining and cheap. 10/10 cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												I generally don't like puzzle games. They are far too slow for my liking, but I completely understand the appeal and wish I could like them more. Hexcells may have changed this for me, for it is a perfectly crafted game from the presentation to the mechanics.You learn the rules as you go, but in a nutshell, you're tasked with finding all the blue hexes with a few clues. It plays very similar to minesweeper, but there is an emphasis on more complex rules to follow involving whether hexes are attached in a string and how many hexes are in a column.""an ambient logic puzzle game"" is the perfect descriptor for Hexcells, blending dynamic sound design with truly challenging and engaging problem solving. The sound interactions are employed in a way that only heightens the enjoyablilty of the game. The music and how your actions affect the sound is timely and bold, yet also soothing and ignorable.My only real gripe with the game would be how certain mechanics are explained in a weird order, with one mechanic not actually being explained. However, it is easy to understand regardless, and overall the game is well worth a purchase.			"

The ambient music is very relaxing and fits in very well, while you're sitting in front of your computer and trying to figure out which move is the next one.I just wish there was a little bit more content to this and settings where you can adjust the volume but other than that it was a very relaxing and fun game.I really recommend this game, especially to puzzle game fans.

												Can be made better, but it's still enjoyable...Why i like it:* minesweeper! {+1}* with an interesting twist. with some interesting twists. That get revealed while progressing through, not all at once. :-bd {+1}* windowed mode. :-) {+1}* steam achievements. {+1}* small storage footprint. {+0.5}Why i am tempted to dislike it at times:* Doesn't auto-finish when ""0 remaining""... {-0.5}* No left+right click on a ""completed"" hint to reveal remaining nearby cells that are obviously empty. Guess i'm too used to this esoteric mechanic from the Windows Minesweeper. :-)* I can't detect any highlight (or shadow) of the not-yet-perfected levels! Do i have to go through all of them to get the final achievement?! :-s {-1}* No volume control for the music: it's just 100% or 0%. At least i can mute it.* No randomization. As a programmer myself, i would expect ""generate board and try to solve"" is not that difficult to include. Though, TBF, Hexcells Infinite does contain a random puzzle generator.* No ""level title"" to tell me which level i'm currently solving. I usually minimize (or alt+tab out of) the game, and don't remember this bit of detail when i come back to it... Also, when going to the next level, i usually lose track. Guess exiting to menu to check which level is the first one unsolved is doable... But it's annoying. {-0.5}* The ""column-counter"" hints can initially be easily misinterpreted to be ""neighbour-counter"" hints that are just placed on an invisible tile... Which might lead to mistakes! Eh, i guess it just takes a bit to get used to them. {-0.5}* The ""column-counter"" hints don't get highlighted when they're complete. Guess i'm too used to how Picross / Griddlers work. :-) Oh, so i have to manually do it... AND there's a guideline too?! Why is this mentioned so late after introducing the ""outside number"" hints?? :-< {-0.5}* Cannot save level state... {-0.5}* Inconsistent mechanic of the ""-X-"" hints, when they're inside a cell or outside the board... {-0.5}* No ""Exit"" button. Most people don't really need it, but it still would've been nice to have.Total: +0.5... So close to not recommending. xD "

												Hexcells is a relatively simple puzzle game similar in some ways to mineweeper.   An array of hexes is presented and  you need to left click (reveal  a filled cell) or right click to reveal a non-filled cell.   However, it is vastly different from minesweeper in that each puzzle can be solved logicially wihout guesswork.   Each revealed cell shows the number of adjacent filled cells, but there can be other clues as well, for example, the number of filled cells in a column, row, or diagonal.  In this way it also reminds me a of sudoko puzzles.   There is no timer, and if you make a mistake you can either continue on or restart to try for a ""pefect"" solution, so one can procede at whatever pace you like.Very enjoyable if you like this sort of logic puzzle.

												A nice relaxing puzzle. Very reminiscent of minesweeper, and additional elements added later on also reminded me of Picross. I completed the game on a lazy Saturday and it gave me enough challenge that it didn't feel like a breeze. Additionally, it never vexed me by being too difficult or requiring me to know the intricacies of how everything worked (those hidden rules you find after doing a puzzle for a long time). If there's one thing to note, it's that the ""Perfectionist"" achievement does NOT require you to get 0 mistakes on all levels, just to get all of those hexagonal ""points"". This is good, because there's several levels where I got 1 honest mistake and it didn't deduct anything.The game also punishes random ""spam n' solve"" play by making it impossible to unlock later levels without X number of aforementioned hexagonal points. Why you would do that anyway is beyond me.My only critique of the game is a lack of puzzles with all the elements added. Initially, the game starts off by showing you the base points, then shows you that lines and columns can have numbers too, and then shows you how to toggle everything; and suddenly, you're two-thirds of the way through the puzzles. Just a minor gripe, but getting Hexcells Plus & Infinite solves that problem nicely.			"

												This game is very similar to Minesweeper gameplay-wise, with a moderate number of progressively unlocked levels where you have to complete the pattern sort of thing. It's fun, and for $3 is very reasonably priced. Don't expect several hours of playtime, but it's a good way to burn a rainy day. 8/10 for base price, 10/10 if you can get it on sale.			"

												Fantastic puzzle game, really enjoyed it! Definitely worth the money! The idea of the game is basically a mix of minesweeper and nonograms; simple but can be quite tricky to perfect if caution is not applied. Note to others who are used to minesweeper, the controls are REVERSED so be mindful when clicking (accidentally lost numerous perfect runs because of this; this can be changed in the small window which is started before the game though)!

												20 puzzles in, I went to bed angry and regretful of my tiny purchase. After a good night's sleep though, I woke up whooping this thing's keester. I was pretty impressed that the game actually made me think and even though it looks like a guessing game, it isn't. There's always a way to deduce the next move, even if you might need to sleep on it!Overall, loved it!			"

												Just simple nice puzzle game. Don't expect much, it's basically „Mines” in Windows with better graphics, hexagons and a bit more complex rules (e.g. ""bombs must be close together"", ""bombs can't be one beside the other” and so on). + it's possible to reach 100% achievement very quickly (1-2 hours)+ great thing is, that everytime I thought I am stuck and have to wish for luck, there was a logical solution. Maybe 2x during the game I made ""I'm feeling lucky"" click, but there is an obvious attempt by the developer to make every puzzle soluble, so maybe I just didn't see it. - could be longer "

												Hexcells is a logic puzzle that's similar to other number games like Minesweeper and Picross, as you use processes of elimination and deduction to fill in patterns of tiles. The distinction here is that since the tiles are hexagons, they're not restricted by square grids, and most puzzles look like abstract shapes or very loosely defined objects.  hexes have numbers on them from 0 to 6 indicating how many of the gold tiles around them can be clicked to turn blue, which counts toward stage completion.-This game made my brain explode  LOL -Not relax game xD-Have fun.

Reasons why I'm recommending this game:1. Enjoyable puzzling - even though the core concept is very simple, enough mechanics are introduced to vary things up. 2. Pure logic puzzles - you can guess, but you never have to. There is always a way to figure out the puzzle 100% without mistakes. This is also true of the following games (Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinity, though they increase the difficulty significantly). 3. Very clean, functional and nice interface.Overall I had a lot of fun with this game and its two sequels. While the core concept is similar to minesweeper, the added mechanics and the fact that you never have to guess to solve the puzzles makes it a far superior game to its inspiration. Recommended for anyone who likes pure logic games.			"

												This is a very short puzzle game.  I finished the whole thing in about 3 hours (while watching television), but for only about $3, it was a fun time.  As a variant of minesweeper, it's simple to play, but gets pretty challenging, especially towards the end.			"

												This casual puzzler starts off a lot like Windows Minesweeper, but adds elements as you go and by the later levels it's quite challenging. The puzzle design is excellent.I bought it mainly because of the combination of high ratings and low sale price, but if I'd known how good it was I'd have happily paid full price. Casual puzzlers aren't normally my thing, but this one deserves all the praise it's getting in the steam reviews..			"

												One of the best puzzles games out there. Very relaxing. Hexcells is not hard at all, but Hexcells Plus and Infinite can be very challeging.There is always logical ways to find the right answer. I just finish all 3 games without a single guess, and a lot of the negative reviews are saying that guessing is necessary. Well, they are just publishing their lack of perseverance, or intelligence.			"

												Edit: I came back to this game again later, and had a much better time with it. I think part of my problem is that I've played way too much minesweeper, which is timed. This isn't a puzzle game to rush, so much. Once I slowed down and paid attention, it was pretty fun.It looks pretty and sounds pretty, but the actual gameplay is frustrating. I kept running into situations where the puzzle just wasn't giving me enough information to continue without guessing--which is penalized. This could have been avoided with better level design, but as it is, I was just not having fun.			"
