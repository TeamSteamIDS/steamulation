												Dwarfs!? is a strangely addicting game. If you enjoy arcade games, where the main objective is to beat your high score (or someone else's high score), you'll probably love this game.The way you score is by getting as much gold as you can, while trying to stay alive--but, you're dwarfs aren't the brightest and will insist on digging into caves filled with water, lava, and monsters, so you'll have to keep a close eye on them, which becomes harder and harder as the game progresses.The F2P version has the two easier difficulties unlocked and each can be played in 5, 15, 30, and 60 min sessions (but beware, you cannot save the game mid-session).The only problem I've encountered is in long games, where you have thousands of dwarfs in the field at one time, my computer starts to lag--which makes the game very difficult and frustrating to play.Overall, this is a fun, simple, casual game that can keep you entertained for hours or opened for a quick 5-minute session.[NOTE: If you buy the full version, your personal scores and achievements will transfer, but the F2P version has different global leaderboards, and your global score will not transfer.][EDIT: For those wondering, I personally own the full version (non-F2P), which is why my play-time on the F2P version is so low.]Concerning the DLC...Dwarfs - F2P Skirmish Pack (Recommended): Comes with 3 modes (Sandbox, Rush, and Dark). Rush and Dark modes bring new challenges to the game and can be a lot of fun. In Sandbox, you can experiment. In Rush, dwarfs spawn CONSTANTLY and you can only let 200 die. In Dark, you cannot see where caves or minerals are located.Dwarfs - F2P Difficulty Pack (Recommended): Unlocks the two harder difficulty levels (Hardcore & Tedi Hardcore) for Arcade mode.Dwarfs - F2P Endless Mode Pack (Not Recommended): Exactly like Arcade mode, except it's endless and you're allowed to pick the map size as well as the difficulty. Beware lag. Also, no high score is recorded.Dwarfs - F2P Summer Carnival Pack (Extremely NOT Recommended): Was a prize for a Steam summer sale years ago; a very simple mini-game that is completely different than the base game.Dwarfs - F2P Base Defend Pack (Not Recommended): A cute little tower defense mode that's rather different from the base game.

												So, it's free to play... you have no microtransactions that will ruin your game. You can just download this in less than 10 minutes and start playing. It's pretty relaxing and the graphics are toony and nice when you zoom in. Chose from 5 to 60 minute matches. I came here to get my KF Axe, but stayed for the cool gameplay and achievements.>I'd rate it a 8/10 (although seemingly low, really good game, but maybe not everyone will like it)>Pros: F2P, small size, fun and can get from very simple to very complicated having to control a lot of stuff that goes on around the place as you get more and more miners, cute graphics>Cons: None, really. It's good.			"

												Awesome little game that's suitable for both short and long periods of gaming. Prefer getting the free version to the paid one as I only have to pay to unlock the bits I'd actually use.Word of warning: trying to install this on my Ubuntu partition just didn't work and the devs don't seem to want to fix it.

												This game may be small, but mighty. As this game is only single-player, you can have the peace and tranquility of yourself relaxing. It's a somewhat quiet game, so you can ready your dwarves, level 'em up, and lean back and WATCH THEM GO! I've spent some time playing, and I recommend those who do not mind waiting and patience. But even if you ARE one of those people who need short time, go on 5 minute arcade! This game is very fun and a little addicting, so I guess I would recommend this.			"

												Let's be honest here. We all got this game so that we can unlock that awesome axe in Killing Floor.Making me play this game so that I can get something in another one- good job Tripwire, you cunning game developers you!But I must say after I've played it for 3 hours (going through all the tutorials, codex tips and actual game playing till I get the achievement for the axe) I found out that I really like this game. It has funny dialogues, interesting premise and overall a good theme to it. Who doesn't like magical underworld realms, where dwarfs fight gnomes and mine gold?While I got it because of Killing Floor in the first place, I will definitely be going back to it every now and then. It's a fun little game to play when you don't know what to do with your time in breaks between work and chores :)			"

Dwarfs is strangely addictive in some ways, and you sometimes grow fond of the the little miners.Cons:On the other hand, this arcade game is rather generic, and a lot of the time it's very boring and there are a lot of 'seen it all before' scenarios, but from an arcade game like this, what can you expect?6/10			"

												This is a great game.Despite not having all of the content of the paid version, there is still much fun to be had. I have played for over an hour, and I made a video for it on my YouTube channel. It's a game that takes from many other games, and is a great RTS.WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE SPOILERS! PROCEED WITH CAUTION, FELLOW DWARF!You are the dwarf overseer, and you see what the dwarfs be doing. If they start doing something you don't like...STOP THEM!This game does require a legitimate strategy, and due to the system of caves that appear, you never know if something will make you the richest dwarf in existence, or doom you and your hall. A dangerous cave can be many blocks away from the town hall, and depending on the danger inside, you can have an entire minute to deal with the situation at your own pace before it becomes a worrying threat. Sometimes you will uncover enemies. This can be a troop of 2 spiders, to 3 orcs and to a powerful warlock. To truly tackle these requires you to use fighter dwarves, which are very powerful fighters (and good miners). They cost 100 gold each (which by the time you encounter enemies you will have enough of), and are instantly available to fight. You can place a battle tower in an area that you have mined for 500 gold, and this is VITAL to beating powerful enemies such as the warlock, as you can have up to 8 enemies. Of course, in a five minute arcade play-through, you may not need this. But in a 60 minute play through, you definitely will. My one complaint is that you can't zoom out enough to view the whole arena at once, and this can be annoying when you have a load of dwarfs doing there own thing on multiple ends of the map. This has lead to many deaths in my playthroughs. Overall, I give this game a 9/10.And to top it all off, this game has a cameo from the ultimate dwarf: Yogscast Simon! :D			"

												Neat little game, I enjoyed it for the ~90mns I put into it.  Short learning curve, but for a relatively simple game, the sheer size and continual unexpected changes that happen make the game quite interesting.  I played it for the achievement to get the axe in Killing Floor!  Its fun, has a nice style, is easy going, but it can get intense.  If you want to chill after a long session of Killing Floor it is great, cannot say I will play much more of it though as i only needed the achievement.			"

												(4/5)This is a simple and fun game; very handy for passing time. (Ex. On a flight, long car ride, or a night to yourself.)The random challenges can get a bit repetitive, but will always keep you on your toes.The exploration factor and vast variety of enemies give the randomly generated maps an extra bit of flare.Sadly, the game itself looses it's charm and challenge after a few rounds. The extra modes are priced cheaply, but I myself did not find the base game convincing enough to invest any money into any of the DLCs. I suppose that's something you'll have to decide for yourself after trying the base game!			"

												Only did this game so I could get the ""Not a war hammer"" achivement so I can unlock the dwarf axe in Killing Floor.  Well, I got the achivement, but didn't unlock the axe. =/  Either way, this game is pretty strange, but yet addicting...  If you like setting up forts and all, I guess its fun.  Just not my type of game though.			"

												In Dwarfs!? you play the 'Dwarf Overseer' over your Dwarf's mining. The game is pretty simple. There are only two types of buildings and only two types of dwarf's. There are miner dwarf's and warrior dwarf's. Miners spawn automatically as you get more gold. Warrior's are obviously more adept to fight can be spawned at the main base (max 8) or, be spawned from the other building type, outposts. The aim of the game is to get as much gold as you can within the time limit or before your base is destroyed. The miners will dig around randomly but you can guide them to caves or minerals. However, giving them directions costs precious gold. This is where it gets incredibly fun. There are really not that many different types of hazardous areas. There's caves full of water or lava that can flood your mine and there are caves full of enemies. What's fun is that you won't see what's in the cave until a dwarf has dug into it. But the caves may have treasure within and gold is what keeps your mine in order.Once a dwarf has discovered a cave full of water or lava it you need to block it off with a wall, blow up a pit with dynamite (which require sacrificing a dwarf) and then solidify the rock around the area so your miners don't blindly spring another leak. These caves are certainly the most hazardous, especially when your mine has branched into something quite complex where water could be flowing through several shafts which all need blocked off. Caves with enemies can be dealt with warriors. You can build an outpost where you can spawn 4 warriors, train them and (best of all) shoot them out a cannon towards the enemy area. Shooting them out the cannon isn't accurate so you may get a dwarf or 2 in shafts without enemies. Again, this is where gold is much needed. Being able to build outposts allows you to be tactful with the placement. It's all really easy to control with shortcuts to items being labelled at the bottom, it's very easy to pick up and play. There are also time controls. You can pause the game for a brief moment, if things are getting a bit hectic, to look around and work with your mine. Best of all is the ability to speed up the game. It allows you to be as greedy as you can be. Both these controls don't affect your time limit per game. Which is perfect as these are tools to help your mine rather than alter the match itself.The F2P version probably has what most people want. You are only limited to Easy and Normal difficulties but Normal is good enough. There's no reason why people shouldn't give this a go. The game also features some humorous tutorials with a dwarf voiced by Yogscast's Simon which was a nice surprise. With games being timed from 15 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour, it is certainly a lot of fun to pick up and play.			"

												This game overall is very fun for those who like semi puzzle and action games. It is great that it is free to play, and it isn't based on taking your money. There are very easy tutorials, and is easy to play. It starts out smalle and easy, but as you progress it becomes harder, but more fun. I highly recommend this game for all.			"

												Dwarfs!? is a simple yet fun game where you don't LEAD an underground kingdom of dwarves to victory and wealth so much as you BABYSIT them. You start out with a single great hall while miner dwarves slowly come into existence and dig their way outward, discovering caves, treasure, valuable minerals, not so valuable minerals, floods, lava pools, monsters and so on. All the while YOU are responsible for hiring warrior dwarves, trapping the floods (water or lava) and directing the miners toward valuable stuff, and away from the harmful places (although it costs money to give orders or directions). The F2P game is a pretty good snag, as you get the general arcade mode on the easy and hard settings, as well as tutorial and a few challenge maps. If you want more than that, you have to buy the corresponding DLC to get the harder settings and the other modes offered in the game, which sadly the future Tripwire is leaning toward. Overall, fun, challenging little game that can offer more if you buy the entire game (with all DLC), and if you're a Killing Floor fan, this game has the achievement that will get you the Dwarven Axe on Killing Floor.

												This is a very addictive fast paced arcade game, wherein you have these dwarves to dig and mine resources through a random generated map discovering treasures and caves. It gets very intense when you have to contain the water and lava, and you also have to defend yourself against a variety of enemies along the way. There\'s always this fear of the unknown because you don't know exactly where you\'re digging up to. It\'s a great and fun game, lots of replay value! :)			"

												While the game itself is fun, and it shows much promise as a F2P which is available on Mac, there is a serious bug which results in the game to crash on Mac OS 10.6.4 (Snow Leopard). The makers have awknowledged the bug, but say they are too busy developing a new game to fix the problms with the old one. Even then, they say they may or may not address the bug when this new game is finished. I feel that's bad customer service, and it reflects poorly on them. I certainly will not download another game from them until the ones they have are bugfixed.			"

												There's a bug in the starting script, simple enough to fix, but it's been over a year and the devs haven't fixed it.Other technical issues include not being able to change the resolution if the resolution is too big, and horrible sound quality.Try the free version, but don't ever pay a dev that hasn't fixed a no start bug for over a year.

												I played this game while looking for a challenging mining game. It had some of the gameplay mechanics that I was looking for but the time limit and goal of getting a high score decreased my enjoyment. I've played through the tutorial and a 60 min ""easy"" game. I won't claim that I've beaten the game at the highest difficulty, but at the same time I don't really want to play it any more.The game was in fact free, but there are a few featured disabled until you pay a couple bucks.

												The F2P-Version constantly crashes on Mac (as I heard it also crashes on Windows).I'd really love to have this fixed but it does not seem like they're trying to fix it. =(About 7 months ago the devs said they will fix it. Since then there where no fixes and the devs never replied again.Sad but don't waste your money or time on this one!			"

												I had to download something called Mono before this would even launch.  After I downloaded Mono, it launched.... and then did nothing.  No window, no thing, nothing.  Not much fun.  Had to force it to close.If they fix the game so I can acutally play it, I'd like to; it sounded like a hoot and had better graphics than Dwarf Fortress (ha!).			"

												This is a game for people who think fast and act faster. The player does not have complete control over the dwarfs mining; you may guide some of their actions but ultimately you will have too many of them to guide every single one and then they'll dig in whatever direction they want. Your job is to guide them to gems and precious metals and see to it that they don't dig into caves with lava or water, thus flooding the cave and killing all dwarfs. To avoid floods, you have to block or blow holes in the ground. This, however, comes at a cost and thus is one of the reasons to why you have to find gems and precious metals early in the game.The game's graphics has an old look to them, with a horrendously old-fashioned main menu design, which put me off at first. However, while playing the game the design is not bad and has a more ""retro"" feel to it. I rather liked the different maps and tutorials. The game seriously tested my patience, though, and I did not enjoy playing under constant pressure.			"

'Boohoo, plis fix on mac ;_;' Game deserves an upvote just for that!Played the game for a bit too, I mean it's pretty good for a free game but the mechanics are a little too simplistic for my tastes. Kind of like a dumbed down Dungeoun Keeper on time attack mode.Give it a try if you like that sort of thing.2 of 5 reviewers who reviewed my review aren't mac users.			"

												Dwarfs is one of those games that is a little niche. Control dwarves to mine, and to fight. that's really it. the DLC adds a lot of content, and its good value for money. overall, its worth at least a try. there are no bugs or issues i've found, but if you need something to while away a bit of time then this is your game :) COMPLETIONISTS NOTE: you'll need to buy the DLC, but its worth it :)			"

												This game, although fun at first, gets extremaly boaring when you have a great and massave empire and then a water cave opens on every side of the map. You also have to buy (with real money) all of the game types worth playing. The campain is also pretty rubbish as it is a tutorial.			"

												I wanted the Dwarf ax for Killing Floor so I ended up playing this for just over an hour. Not really worth it IMO, wish I'd just loaded the longest arcade game to get the 40,000 gold required to unlock the achievement and weapon. As soon as I got in I had to mute everything, the narration and music was a little grating. The tutorials were odd as well, as I maanged to complete a couple of them without even doing anything, think that might need looking at. All in all it doesnt seem like a bad game but it desperately needs a film or some music to go along with it. Now that I have my ax I probably wont play this again.			"

												I played it for as long as I did to get an achievement in Killing Floor, and that is the only reason I can think of for why anyone would play this game. This game is pretty much a time-waster for a smartphone or tablet like the 900 million other casual (no insult there - that's just the best way to describe this) time-waster minigames out there, but I'm sure there are better ones than this one.

												Quite a fun game actually. You control a little underground empire of miners and your goal is to get as much ore as possible. However on the way you will meet caves, which could either contain all the gold you could ever want or a pool of lava or even monsters.You have to think, would I rather gamble the saftey of my empire for riches or not?Overall It's a good game, it's free and for all of you who don't mind putting a little cash into it then you can get some extra gamemodes such as sandbox etc.5/10			"

I also would suggest this game to people who have never actualy played a strategy game similar to this, it would be a perfect start for you. A game similar to this one that I have checked out is on green light and it is called ""Zombie Quarentine"" please check that out its very cool and it gives a little more chalenge than this one however I personly like this game better.

Gameplay: Very GoodControls: GoodStability: GreatGraphics: GoodDifficulty: OkaySounds: Very GoodMusic: GoodStory: N/ADwarfs is a top down game where you must guide your dwarfs to mine minerals, avoid danger and defend their homeland till time runs out to get as much points as possible. You have 2 different dwarfs; Digger and Knight, Digger dwarfs mine any space they can find and they are used for mining minerals and finding treasure, Knight dwarfs are used for combat against enemies, bosses and can defend certain areas including their homeland.PROS/CONS+ Free to play.+ Runs very smoothly.+ Dwarfs have a ranking system to improve their dig speed and attack damage.+ A lot of gamemodes to choose from.+ Great for killing time.- Some achivements are a pain to get.- Luckbased (Chances of getting 5+ bosses at once).CONCLUSION:Stragetic, fun and really good when playing to kill time.RECCORMENDED FOR THOSE WHO PLAY:MinecraftNOTES:- A lot of the different gamemodes/difficulties requires payment to play.

												I started playing this game just for the KillingFloor achievement-unlocked weapon (which took all of ~15 minutes), but ended up playing for 10 hours. Very simple but addicting game, especially if you get excited about leaderboards and high-scores. I only played the free version (which only has easy/normal modes), but even this is tons of fun.The gameplay is not really much to do with Dwarf Fortress, as one might think -- there is no base-building involved aside from planting outposts. This is more about micromanaging dwarfs to maximize mining efficiency (exploring caves, making outposts, getting away from danger) and guard against various hazards (floods, lava caves, underground citters, occasional boss-type critter). You play for a fixed time (5, 15, 30, 60 minutes) and try to maximize your score and not get killed.			"

												Somewhat similar to Lemmings mixed with Dig Dug, you play as a horde of dwarfs who are trying to expand out and mine out as much as possible before the timer runs out. There are various other game modes, and different difficulty levels which change the prices of certain items, but in general it is a fun little time sink. Just be careful, your dwarfs are about as dumb as Lemmings, and won't hesitate to leap down death holes or into lava en masse. Try to mine as many treasure caves and minerals as you can for a chance to get on the leader board! Best part is, this is free to play, so doesn't hurt giving it a shot. I personally recommond purchasing the Endless mode, to unlock more achievements and get some massive scores.			"

												TL,DR; PLAY NAO MLG-PRO""Dwarfs"" is a very deceptive game. True, there are only a few game mechanics, and almost everything is automated, but It's not as ""casual"" as it'd like you to believe.There are all these caves, and when a digger dwarf accesses one, it might have monsters, gold, water, lava, or nothing at all. The further out they expand, the more caves you have access to. As a consequence of this, the creation of your very own Moria increases exponentially.The monsters can be fought by the second type of dwarf, the Soldier, which can come from your main base, or from the only building you can build, Outposts.Water has to be walled off, and then blocked off with indestructable rock (at an expense.)Lava is slower than lava, but can melt through the walls. This requires more long-term solutions, but can be dealt with in a similar way to water.So, when does a REALLY HARD mechanic come into play?It doesn't. WAIT WAIT HOLD ON.The individual mechanics are easy to deal with, but ANY OF THEM WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING?As a game of ""Dwarfs"" continues, the dwarven diggers dig deeper and deeper. Naturally, they come across more caves. at increasing frequency.How deep is too deep? That's what this game is all about.You're constantly on edge, and worrying about anything and everything going wrong.Entering a new cave is a consistantly sphincter-tightening experience. (yes, i did just use those words that way.)If you think to yourself, ""Hey, i can dig out little passages and mine precious metals... THIS IS DUNGEON KEEPER!! RIPOFF!!""No, it's not. ""Dwarfs"" isn't trying to be Dungeon Keeper. If you try to play it as that, you'll find it lacks the depth to remain challenging.What IS challenging is the act of juggling one thing too many. ONE LITTLE ♥♥♥♥-UP can bring your whole house of cards crashing down, and, when it does, you'll just laugh like crazy before starting over again without any regrets.And I haven't even gotten to the best Part, the ""S"" key.The devs probably say they they made it ""S"" for Speed, but I think it means ""S"" for Seperates.That is, it seperates the people with two hands from the people with TWELVE.Holding ""S"" speeds up everything: the digger dwarves, the soldier dwarves, the monsters, water, and lava.Furthermore, speeding up has no effect on the timer that ticks away as you play. This means that your score will be higher, and you'll rank higher on the leaderboard the more you use it.When you add this all together, you've got APMs that make Pro Starcraft players double-take.

												Let me get started. As an idea, this works. You control dwarfs that will mine into caves filled with either treasure or tragedy, and also get gold. You can build towers to get warrior dwarfs, who will fight off goblins when your digger dwarfs mine a cave full of them. You can play a round for up to an hour.And this would be a great game... if the dwarf digger AI wasn't so stupid.I mean, you bust open a cave full of water, you put a wall down, should be good. But for some reason, digger dwarfs think it's a good idea to mine through your walls even if you placed it to block lava right in front of them. Water poured into my base and I started getting spammed with messages of a group of 10 dwarfs trying to break through the walls every 2 seconds.You can't explore or fight when you need to keep babysitting dwarfs that can't realise that walls aren't something to stick their pickaxes through. Your best bet is to hold CTRL and create unbreakable walls around said problem, but here's where that doesn't work:The lava is pouring into your base. You've already sacraficed a decent dwarf to create the hole to divert the lava's flow. And then, it heads for your base from many directions. You can't make unbreachable walls out of nowhere as you can walls, so if it happens, you might as well let it pour right in. Otherwise the game will be incredibly dull and boring as you lead the suicide diggers away from their doom.I don't know why this is around £10. It should be free for all of it, no microtransactions. Get Dungeon Keeper, not this.			"

												Yes I do recommend it...It's just missing somethign to keep me involved. Since it's free you should get it...Because it's free.Of course it's missing something. After a while you just get too big. Your warrior dwarves are all lvl. 10. And your digger dwarves are just doing whatever they want you ahve virtually unlimited money""Your dwarves have discovered a lava pit"" Fine...Block it off kill him surround it with hardened dirt. Done, I mean I like how the time limit constantly keeps you doing something...But I like to play games for long periods of time, and after awhile I found that It wasn't a challange anymore.7/10 Would Diggy Diggy Hole Again			"

												I originally came here like many others to get the Dwarfs axe and the achievement for Killing Floor, however I brought the full version of the game during the autumn sale, however to get the Gimli That Axe! achievement you must play the free to play version. But I will state for thoses that may wonder both the full and free to play version share between each other is all progress, score and achievments.In the game you have the campain, challenges which tests out your skills. You have arcade mode which has easy and normal difficulty, and finally you have the score menu which shows all your scores, achievments, medals and so on.Even though for me I don't play fast paced arcade games, this I really enjoyed and the best part its free.

												I love this game with Pros and ConsPros: The art and gameplay is very fast flowing and is very simple and easy to master with all of the different ways of loosing like water and lava having to trust yourself and not cry when you loose a dwarCons: the AI is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for example i put bedrok around a lava lake and wall it while i get tnt set but what does my dwarf do they dig right though it i really hate it			"

												This game is not good 3 reasons-1) it is pretty much a demo and doesnt bring any fun to it because you have to pay to get the good things-2) like i said it makes you pay to get all the good stuff like skirmish mode-3) its just..like..not fun at all because even though this is ''free to play'' the rest of the game when you buy it is just so boring i do not recomend this game AT ALL! but if you want to be bored out of your mind go ahead and then if you like it ok-but hear my type-THIS-GAME-SUCKS			"

												Yes I do recommend it...It's just missing somethign to keep me involved. Since it's free you should get it...Because it's free.Of course it's missing something. After a while you just get too big. Your warrior dwarves are all lvl. 10. And your digger dwarves are just doing whatever they want you ahve virtually unlimited money""Your dwarves have discovered a lava pit"" Fine...Block it off kill him surround it with hardened dirt. Done, I mean I like how the time limit constantly keeps you doing something...But I like to play games for long periods of time, and after awhile I found that It wasn't a challange anymore.7/10 Would Diggy Diggy Hole Again			"

												TL,DR; PLAY NAO MLG-PRO""Dwarfs"" is a very deceptive game. True, there are only a few game mechanics, and almost everything is automated, but It's not as ""casual"" as it'd like you to believe.There are all these caves, and when a digger dwarf accesses one, it might have monsters, gold, water, lava, or nothing at all. The further out they expand, the more caves you have access to. As a consequence of this, the creation of your very own Moria increases exponentially.The monsters can be fought by the second type of dwarf, the Soldier, which can come from your main base, or from the only building you can build, Outposts.Water has to be walled off, and then blocked off with indestructable rock (at an expense.)Lava is slower than lava, but can melt through the walls. This requires more long-term solutions, but can be dealt with in a similar way to water.So, when does a REALLY HARD mechanic come into play?It doesn't. WAIT WAIT HOLD ON.The individual mechanics are easy to deal with, but ANY OF THEM WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING?As a game of ""Dwarfs"" continues, the dwarven diggers dig deeper and deeper. Naturally, they come across more caves. at increasing frequency.How deep is too deep? That's what this game is all about.You're constantly on edge, and worrying about anything and everything going wrong.Entering a new cave is a consistantly sphincter-tightening experience. (yes, i did just use those words that way.)If you think to yourself, ""Hey, i can dig out little passages and mine precious metals... THIS IS DUNGEON KEEPER!! RIPOFF!!""No, it's not. ""Dwarfs"" isn't trying to be Dungeon Keeper. If you try to play it as that, you'll find it lacks the depth to remain challenging.What IS challenging is the act of juggling one thing too many. ONE LITTLE ♥♥♥♥-UP can bring your whole house of cards crashing down, and, when it does, you'll just laugh like crazy before starting over again without any regrets.And I haven't even gotten to the best Part, the ""S"" key.The devs probably say they they made it ""S"" for Speed, but I think it means ""S"" for Seperates.That is, it seperates the people with two hands from the people with TWELVE.Holding ""S"" speeds up everything: the digger dwarves, the soldier dwarves, the monsters, water, and lava.Furthermore, speeding up has no effect on the timer that ticks away as you play. This means that your score will be higher, and you'll rank higher on the leaderboard the more you use it.When you add this all together, you've got APMs that make Pro Starcraft players double-take.

												This is a fun, challenging game based all around how well you can micromanage a group that seems calm at first, but quickly gets more and more anarchic leading to all hell breaking loose if you don't keep your wits about you.

												I originally came here like many others to get the Dwarfs axe and the achievement for Killing Floor, however I brought the full version of the game during the autumn sale, however to get the Gimli That Axe! achievement you must play the free to play version. But I will state for thoses that may wonder both the full and free to play version share between each other is all progress, score and achievments.In the game you have the campain, challenges which tests out your skills. You have arcade mode which has easy and normal difficulty, and finally you have the score menu which shows all your scores, achievments, medals and so on.Even though for me I don't play fast paced arcade games, this I really enjoyed and the best part its free.

												Ignorant game developers. There isn't actually a linux client, they simply tried to wrap it in some sort of mono shell, which makes it do nothing but take up system resources when you try to play, and immediately crash. In addition, this game actually crashed my steam client when I tried a few workarounds to get it to run.Ignore and/or avoid this game and its creators (po2games), unless and until they learn to code their way out of a paper bag.In addition, I'd like to point out Steam's ridiculous policy of requiring 5 minutes of playtime before being allowed to post a review. I ended up clicking ""Play"" over and over again for 10 or 15 minutes until the Steam client thought I had played enough 1-second game sessions to satisfy the playtime requirements to post this review.
