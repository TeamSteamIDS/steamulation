												Orcs Must Die! 2 is the follow up to Orcs Must Die 1, and is a third person tower defence game, developed by Robot Entertainment.  The game was released on PC July 2012. The main difference with Orcs Must Die 2 is the addition of co-op gameplay. Everything else is virtually the same. You play either as a War Mage or sorceress in the story mode. You have to defend at one or more rifts which open at the start of the level. Each level has a varying amount of waves of enemies continuously spawning in order to reach said rift. Your aim is to stop them by building traps whilst also using your own character to kill them as well. Before each level you choose your load out of traps that you want to use. You start out by only being able to take 4 or 5, but work your way up to being able to take 10 traps on a stage with you.  Before jumping into each level too, you can upgrade your traps to do more damage, have a lower cool down time, or some other ability such as slowing the enemy if they are hit by it for example.  You'll notice from the very beginning that there are a few traps that you'll always want to take with you, such as the slowing trap - but included in your loadout, is your characters weapon, so you have to choose carefully. You are given an infinite amount of time to build your traps at the start of each level, and you are also given a healthy amount of time between waves to allow you to build more. You are granted extra coins after each wave, and for killing enemies, and you use these coins to purchase more traps. Whilst you can also place traps when enemies are spawning, this isn't always a good idea as your main focus should be on killing enemies then.  A large portion of this game is actually you spamming your left mouse button using your main weapon, whilst you aren't able to destroy everything with this weapon; it is more used as filler for your time as most of the damage will come from the traps.  There is a huge variety of traps as well, and you probably won't even use them all even by the end of the game, leaving you plenty of chances to experiment. The graphics in Orcs Must Die 2 are really nice. They are in the cartoon style that many of us really enjoy, but they aren't so childish that they can't portray the maturity of the title. There are some really nice special effects, such as the lava and ice traps, they all look marvellous. Everything is perfectly animated too, whilst a lot of the enemies are copy/pasted, that is to be expected from a game of this type.Orcs Must Die 2 has a very catchy sound track too; the song is played constantly and it will be driven into your head and you'll be whistling it without realising it. Other than the soundtrack, the rest of the game's audio is brilliant too. The game is narrated in the cut scenes by the male character; it would have been nice to get voice acting on the female though. This game has varying levels of difficulty, the regular easy, medium and hard mode. You only unlock hard mode after you have beaten the game. There is one other form of difficulty, and that is endless mode. This will pit you against an endless stream of enemies, meaning you have to constantly upgrade your traps and the enemies will not stop until they either kill you or destroy your rift. This mode will really test your metal but is extremely fun to play in. Most players should really be playing this game on the Medium skill level, the easy mode is too easy and will not really offer any challenge to any tower defence veteran. All of the levels in Orcs Must Die 2 are so well designed; I cannot find any faults with them at all. The early stages of the game are a tutorial stage really, allowing you to test out your traps to work out how they are best used, so the levels are pretty simple, but once you reach the end levels, you'll really be putting your trap building skills to the test, as you have to defend multiple rifts from multiple entry points of enemies. Some of the bigger levels offer a bit of support in getting around quickly in the form of teleporters, these will teleport you to the other side of the map once stepping in them. I have been playing Orcs Must Die 2 for almost thirty hours, this is because there is absolutely tons of content in this game, not only is the single player story mode eight hours of gameplay, you also have the added replay ability of playing the story again as the other hero (with different skills and abilities), and then you also can replay the whole game again on co-op which adds a whole another level of content as the enemies are all scaled up to match you and your friend - and finally, we have the endless mode, this is the part of the game that I have spent the majority of my time and I am absolutely hooked on it. As you play the story mode, once you reach the final waves of a level, you'll often feel like you wish you could carry on and see how far you get, you can do that in endless mode; you just keep building traps, and facing more and more enemies as they just keep coming. This mode alone has given me about fifteen hours of gameplay. Orcs Must Die 2 can be played on all resolutions. I played on 4k with everything on max settings and was able to get 60 FPS constantly. I did however have a few crashes, this mainly happened when you minimize the game too many times, and it gives you a message something regarding DirectX. Although this was annoying, I only had it when minimizing and not whilst in the midst of gameplay. The game can be played with a controller, but as it has elements of aiming with a crosshairs, the game is highly recommended to be played with a keyboard/mouse - it just works so much better on them. This game is an absolute must play for any tower defence fan, if you had any sort of enjoyment out of the first, you'll get more of the same out of this, and the added edition of co-op makes it even more appealing to a wider audience. Not to mention the hours and hours of content on offer in this game. The regular price tag of Â£10, 99 is fairly marked and should be considered a must play for me.

Fast-paced & addictive // Recommended for a killer co-op team+ Co-operative play is available, a feature that adds tremendously to the experience+ Plentiful available upgrades; can make a hefty difference in play-style+ Massive variety of usable, upgradeable traps; adds a lot of depth to the game+ Myriad weapons and trinkets; used to customize loadout before combat+ Includes an 'endless mode;' basically a wave feature, though it works so well with the game that it adds significantly to its replayability+ Well-planned traps can net some very satisfying combo-kills; results in many memorable moments+ Range markers make it easy to coordinate kill zones and trap combinations+ Movement and shooting mechanics are simple and polished+ Visuals, though unimpressive graphically, complement art design adequately+ Campy voice-acting and audio design (though certainly not my cup of tea, personally) admittedly add to the game's theme and atmosphere- Plot is barebones, and little is done to reinforce or advance it; seems intentionally placed on the back-burner, so this observation may ultimately have little weight on the player's experience- No automatic match-making for co-op- Only 2 playable charactersLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												A coop sequel, this game takes the first and ramps it up.  Some of the traps you used to love suck now, as they've actually been balanced to not be god-tier.  (I'm looking at you swinging mace a.k.a. roof pendulum of win.)  Each character gets their own unique trap and weapon, but beyond that they have the same access to traps, weapons, and spells.  It's a funny and fun tower defense game with a lot of shooter elements that allow you to solve missions in a number of ways, with some great survival challenge maps to have a blast with.  Best experienced coop, but still enjoyable single player.			"

												With its fast-paced multiplayer, completely redesigned spellbook, and extensive replayability, I'd say if you enjoyed the original Orcs Must Die! then I'd highly recommend Orcs Must Die! 2. However, OMD2 is shorter than OMD in terms of the campaign and only seems to expand on the original rather than offer a new innovative experience for tower defense fans.There's nothing wrong with the design of the levels or the gameplay in and of themselves. It's just that OMD!2 feels more like a sizeable update complete with co-op integration. It is a good game, though, which manages to live up to its predecessor. Soloing veterans of that game should think very hard if the amendments are enough to buy this sequel at launch.The absence of new levels, no in-game editor, and too close a resemblance with the original title make Orcs Must Die! 2 look more like an expansion pack than a fulfilling sequel.However it's still a thoroughly enjoyable experience that will charm newcomers as well as veterans of the first game.

												I was a big fan of the original Orcs Must Die, mixing the Shooter genre with Tower defense in a perfect way. so i was very excited for the sequel. and this game does not disappoint while it improves over the original in every way. expanding the traps and weapons selection. You get Story Mode, Endless Mode, and 10 Classic maps from the first game. a weekly challenge, I have played over 70 hours of this game, solo and co-op, and I feel I have a pretty good feel of it. I've also purchased and enjoyed both DLC packs which each introduced 3 new maps and new monsters. + Great mix between a Shooter and Tower Defense genres.+ improves over the original in every way+ lots of replay value+ Co-Op is so much fun mighty addictive and highly recommended.

												Orcs Must Die! 2 is a Tower Defense game, where you play as the Sorceress or the Warmage defending the Rifts from relentless waves of Orcs, Trolls and other uglies by setting up traps.Both heroes have different playstyles, while the huge variety of unlockable traps, upgrades, weapons and perks offer plenty of room of experimenting and finding your unique strategy.PROS:- Tons of unlockables: weapons, traps, accessories, costumes etc.- The CO-OP gameplay is a lot of fun.- Lot's of variations and solutions for all maps. You can find the tactic that suits you most, thanks to the large arsenal at your disposal.CONS:- It's highly recommended to play in CO-OP. Playing alone isn't that much fun.- Only 2 player CO-OP.TLDR:- Do you like Tower Defense games? Do you like CO-OP action? If you do, then Orcs Must Die! is a must-buy!			"

												After the great fun I had with the first one, I was really excited to play Orcs Must Die 2 but was disappointed by the gameplay. The levels are clearly designed for two players so (for me at least) they are not fun in single-player. The problem is not necessarily that they are difficult, but it is simply tedious to constantly run around the map trying to cover all directions. This is further aggravated by the lack of local co-op and any public matchmaking. I heartily recommend getting the first one if you have not played it. Get this one only if you have a friend that owns it and is willing to play.			"

												If you aren't going to play this game Co-Op with a friend, don't bother with this game. Orcs Must Die! was a great game and could be played alone. When you play Orcs Must Die! 2 alone, you notice something almost immediately; the design of the new levels is clearly built for Co-Op action with a friend. The early levels are easy regardless, and there are some fun new mechanics that you can play with (funneling the orcs along minecart paths) which is a nice change from the first game, where you just look for the best place to place your Swinging Maces. Sadly, once you get about midway through the game some of the interesting levels seem to have already passed. Most of the time through barricades or planning you could get 3 or 4 doors worth of orcs to run through one setup of traps, which is about what was needed to clear the levels on War Mage difficulty. Sadly, about midway through OMD!2, it seems someone decided to make a whole pile of symmetrical levels in which there is no common area to filter all of the orcs through. Fair enough, it must still be possible to do it alone right?If you've played the first game, you can picture what I am going to describe now: Imagine a 6 square wide path. There is only a buildable wall on one side. The other side of the path has a few blocks of lava, which cannot be used because if you try to throw them into it they just fly clear of the lava river onto the symmetrical path on the other side (past the point where your traps would be). There is a small section with a ceiling on which to build ceiling traps but Swinging Mace now basically does no damage and just throws the orcs away from your other traps. If you spend all of your money on one side of the level, you might get lucky with a setup that can stop the first 2 waves using all of the right traps in the limited possible building areas, but what do you do on the other side? Fight the whole waves yourself with no trap assistance? Goodluck, it works for a few levels and then you just get completely overwhelmed, You never end up with enough money to defend both sides, and you need to spend what you get to build up your untrapped side, and the original side that you built to start is leaking orcs (a lot of them) every level.There are a few levels like this in a row probably about 75% of the way through the game. You clearly need 2 players, so each can play their own separate game on their own side of the level. How is that fun?The first game was great. This one, not so much. I've had enough.			"

												I enjoyed the first Orcs Must Die! and I enjoyed this one too. I would strongly recommend this game to just about anyone. Even if you're a bit unsure about getting Orcs Must Die!, you should definitely try Orcs Must Die! 2. It fixes many of the cons of the original game, so here's a list of pros and cons.PROS-Great and easy to learn gameplay.-Two unique characters with arsenals varying enough to effect gameplay while not have too much difference between them.-Improved graphics from the original game.-Funny dialogue and commentary that serves both the entertainment value of the game and the story aspects of the game (which is surprisingly satisfying given how little there actually is).-Unlike its predecessor, there's multiplayer (albeit only dual multiplayer). And, even better, it makes sense in the story's context.-Tweaks the traps and weapons from the original game to balance them more.-Has great DLC that you should definitely try out.-Much more dynamic currency system (concerning the skulls) than the original game.-Keeps the Nightmare difficulty and adds the new Endless levels.-Expands the player's equipment to include trinkets and cosmetics.CONS-Multiplayer is limited to two people. Not a con for me personally, but it might be for some.-Tweaks the traps and weapons from the original game. Again, not a con for me personally, but I have heard some complaints concerning some of the changes.-DLC costs money. Depending on who you are, this might be a con. I personally didn't mind. The DLC was great.So, yeah, that's it. Not much do I have to complain about, and though I am sure other pros and cons exist, I can't think of them off the top of my head. Regardless, though, I highly recommend trying out this game. Odds are, it'll be a blast.			"

												Updated review:Orcs Must Die 2! is a 3rd person game that involves the many slaying of orcs, while either working with a friend or just by yourself along with the aid of the many traps and weapons this game provides.The levels are unique in every way possible some levels are small and simple while others are huge in terms of how many entry points and also how many different routes the orcs must take.This game also supports Mods however there is this bug that makes the game null and void so if you try to play it once after hours and hours of using a modded version of the game, sadly all of that will be gone in an instant. I think there is a fix  for it but i wouldn't risk it.The modes that are offered in this game is nothing but plain super awesome, you will lose hours and hours playing with game with either a friend or by yourself.I recommend such a game if you like killing orcs and seeing orcs getting killed by traps or by the hands of your co-op partner and you.

And I'd prefer if the game didn't scale monster stats with each successive wave in the late waves.Apart from that, though, I had a blast with it. Some really good meat-grinder levels to min-max. Some interesting tactical choices to make. And some levels had me daydreaming about new layouts and tools to try ""next time.""Worth a buy!			"

ORC MUST DIE! 2 A ReviewINTROOrc Must Die! 2 developed and published by Robot Entertainment[www.robotentertainment.com] is a continuation for the original Orc Must Die which includes the original cast but is now expanded with more maps, more items/weapons, and above all MORE ORCS to kill.Anyways this is a tower defense game with the difference is that you are on the ground with weapons to fight off the orcs as well so its a hybrid of third person tower defense action game. A mouthful I know but it actually works! And its fun with friends as well since it has coop now! So lets get this review typing.GameplayMake Character>Choose Map>Choose Difficulty>Choose Loadout>KIll Orcs>Win [or not]>Buy Upgrades>RepeatOrc Must Die 2 happens to feature a narrative like the first one in the form of you getting more story context by finishing a level and unlocking the next one with a cutscene playing at certain point. Also in game dialogue between the two character serves as a story context.Anyways, first you choose to either play as the male Warmage with more HP but less mana or the female Sorceress with more mana but less HP. Loadouts also differs slightly between the two with the Warmage having access to melee weapons along with shotgun while the Sorceress is more spell based with more staff and so on but the towers are mostly shared.Once thats over you can then proceed to choose your map, difficulty and play either solo or coop. Maps for the main campaign are unlocked by clearing the ones before it and clearing it also unlock more tower type and more loadout slots.Once in game you can then choose between a lot of weapons and towers provided you have unlocked them already. Initially you only have 3 slots but more are given as you clear map and the slots are shared between accesories. weapons, guardians, and traps so its prudent to choose wisely for the enemy type you will be facing which is indicated on the loadout screen.You have a limited funds at start to build your first few traps with more funds gained from killing Orcs, collecting coins, and achieving combos by killing several orcs at once or quickly. Traps ranges from the typical spike and arrow trap to the much cooler acid and ice traps but there are lot more kind with some serving a more utilitarian functions. Orcs spawn from predefine points on the map and they will charge straight at the limited life teleporter that you must defend. The path they take can be influence by putting traps that block their path although if the map have several brancing paths or there are two teleporter at once they will split up. Initially only 1 spawn point will be active but by the 4th wave usually all are actively pouring in. There are a lot of types of orcs from the typical grunt all the way to elemental monster that can split up to 3 times. Also flying enemies are also present with some weapons and traps can not be use against them and they will ignore all blockade that you made.Once you placed the traps and start the round it will continue until all orcs are dead which will give you a  10 second breather to sell/build more towers but while you can build during an attack you can only sell during these grace period in between rounds. At the middle point and right before the final round the game will give you an indefinite break until you trigger the wave yourself but the timer that affects your ranking still runs so its imperative to build/sell/break quickly and resume.Alright provided you won all the round you will then win the game and be presented with  a stat screen showing how well you did then everything is tally up and Skulls which are currencies are then dole out to you to spend. The main factor I see that affects is how fast you finish a map, letting no orc get to the teleporter, and not dying.Skulls can be use at the shops to unlock more weapons or upgrade an existing ones to be better. Same goes for traps and guardians and the good thing is that you can reset your build at any time you want at no cost whatsoever and its actually quite common to jump into a new map only to restart it because the build you have are not up to the task.Then rinse and repeat until you beat every single one of your friend's score.GraphicsOrc Must Die 2 uses a cartoony style approach to represent their game and it works well with the goofyness that the orc has [along with the idiocy of the Warmage]. Funnily enough if you turn on gib mode to high they will literally explode into chunks of meat when they die.SoundI suppose the sound are acceptable for all the weapon/spells and trap effect although the voice acting is pretty stellar for the orcs, guardians, and player character. A shame for hard hearing people though as explain below.Option Menu and ControlRebindable keys check, resolution anti-alias vsync windowed mode check although graphics setting are limited to high and low with no advance option. All the usual audio stuff check along with some gameplay options. No disability options though.Runs smoothly and if you ever need this for some reason it runs at  60 fps.So what is the issue? The dialogue options is only for the cutscene not for when the character talks in-game or quip something when they perform an action and such. That means you can barely hear it if you have hearing isssue.As for controls I used the keyboard and it is solid, no issues there.ConclusionOrc Must Die! 2 is a solid action tower defense game that does a humorous spin on the classic formula, abundant of maps, nice enemy selection, and a great amount of traps and weapons are sure to entertain you. It gets even better when you play coop. Overall an excellent game in its category. A F***KING SHAME THE SEQUEL IS A MOBA.Scoring Methology:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: S-Rank - Awarded for giving out many fun time in its category.Credit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!No drama, Just Reviews "

Very nice game!Similar to their first game, you control as one of 2 characters, laying traps and fighting orcs to defend your base. The 2 characters have very little but noticable difference in starting setup.All the traps and weapons have different effect and usage, and there are many ways of completing each stages using different approach. You can invest heavily on weapons and trinkets so you can kill the orcs yourself, or you can spend your upgrades on traps and let them do the job for you.Coop WILL make a lot of stages so much easier because you will have 2 more extra total slots to start with (6 slots each instead of 10 slots solo), double the attention from players, and double the amount of upgrades you can use! Even the hardest game mode is a piece of cake if both players have enough skulls to upgrade their traps.You can refund your upgrades infinitely, so you can plan your upgrades every wave. I only wish that the upgrades can be done BEFORE the stage start instead of after the stage end.The story/plot is unimportant nor adds any value to the gameplay, but it has some funny conversation on the beginning of every stages. This makes me look forward to starting the next stage on my first playthrough.To complete 100% achievement, you will need 2 things: the first game Orcs Must Die (for the Classic mode DLC), and a coop buddy. If you meet the requirement, all the achievements are quite doable.One thing I'd like this game to have is a way to save progress on co-op game. My personal experience, the game crashed on me on wave 39 of the endless mode coop, wasted almost 90 minutes of our time. Another time, my friend got disconnected from the internet for about 30 seconds and we lost 42 waves of endless mode time. Because of this, we don't really play endless mode online anymore because of the fear for the risk.My score: 9/10			"

												Maybe you won't play it 4ever, but it has a lot potential to be fun for a long time. The fact is, Orcs Must Die! 2 is more or less a pretty great game, because Fun tower defense gameplay with some third-person-shooting, jumping and and neat magic tricks. Co-Op for 2 players - extra fun. Story-Mode (quite okay), Endless-Survival Mode, Classic-Levels (Orcs Must Die! Part 1), other good stuff. Different approaches and efficent tactics to every map and trap/trinket set-up Fun physics that make orc say and scream funny things (for laughs)Tbh, this game has absolutely no downsides. Everything plays out at least okay. Also better than the first part,  because Co-Op. Not an epic masterpiece, but an instant classic. Go for it. "

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a tower defense type game in which you play one of two characters (male/female) in order to top the Orcish hoard from getting to their destination (of which there are sometimes multiple points to protect.)  To assist you there are numerous upgrades for your character, minions, and traps that are unlocked as you progress.  You get an action bar where you can put a set number of these things and then start the level.  Using some of these things (like minions and traps) costs coins.  Coins are independent of each level (they don't carry over so don't be shy about spending them.)  You get more as the level progresses and there are other items you can unlock that increase coin drops.  For me, survival mode was the most fun.  Still haven't made it to wave 30 of any level yet though (it's hard!)  Essentially it's progressively harder and harder waves until you're finally overwhelmed (or make it to that legendary 30th level.)  The fun factor is through the roof on this one and I highly recommend picking it up!			"

 Overview  Orcs Must Die! 2 is a tower defense game in which you must construct traps to defeat an ever-increasing wave of orcs and their minions. The game can be played in single player or two person co-op. For those familiar with the formula, the game follows the standard idea of building defenses, weaving the path that the enemy must follow and defeat them before they reach the exit. The game itself is set in a 3rd person view, allowing the player to control one of two characters that you may use to fight along-side your traps. During setup, the player may choose from a variety of traps: spike traps, arrow traps, teleporters, acid traps, barricades, guardians (AI), character weapons and trinkets for passive and active buffs. There is a healthy amount of customization what you can bring, making level design easily tailored to your play style and choice.During the matches, the goal is simple: Do not let the orcs, or their minions, past the rift (exit). Each level has a set amount of waves, enemy types and number of rift points (essentially lives) that can be expended before you lose the round. Depending on your success, the player(s) can earn bonus points in the form of skulls. These skulls can be used to upgrade your weapons, trinkets and most importantly, your traps, adding active and passive abilities and increased damage.The game has several different game modes, including story mode, several smaller DLC levels, a weekly custom mode and an Endless Mode, which, as you'd have guessed, goes until you lose or quit the level. Aside from different game modes, Orcs Must Die! 2 has three difficulties: Apprentice (Easy), War Mage (Normal) and Nightmare (Hard). As someone who has played very few tower defense games, War Mage is a nice middle ground for those just learning the game or the genre.  The game will probably provide anywhere from 20-30 hours of continuous gameplay, more so if you explore the different modes and difficulties that it has to offer. Orcs Must Die! 2 is enjoyable, yet challenging. It blends old features with new content very well. if you're a fan of tower defense games, then I think you'll enjoy Orcs Must Die! 2.  Pros   Interesting enemy types and level design. Character artwork and overall visual effects are very well done. The customization of your arsenal is fleshed out and provides a lot of variety in your build. Voice acting - While there is minimal, what is there is cute. I enjoyed the back and forth between the characters. Replayability - With the weekly challenge and the Endless Mode, the game offers a nice bit of replayability for fun, or to challenge yourself after you've finished the story.  No broken achievements - They are all obtainable.  Co-Op - the game shines if you have a partner to play with. Cons    Story - It's there, sort of, but it isn't really fleshed out aside from a bit of dialogue and a cutscene here and there.  Orc Mages - Their ranged attack can, at times, feel a little cheap (they home in on your character...a lot...)Overall, Orcs Must Die! 2 is downright fun. It's a challenge without being irritating and a ton of fun if you're able to play co-op. It's a great installment to the series and feels improved in every fashion. Check it out. I completely recommend it!			"

												-This game ts like Dungeon Defenders and is a sequal to orcs must die -This game has the same placing system as orcs must die which is the ability to place traps pretty much anywhere (ceiling, walls, and floors). -This game actually has co-op but does not have matchmaking so inviting people is a must when trying to play co-op-You can upgrade you items using skulls that can be recived during and after a map/game-Skulls can also be recived by replaying a map-Controls can be remapped---My Rating---8.5/10 -would recommend to my friends			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Orcs Must Die! 2 Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Tower Defense; Action; Coop; Strategy; RPG; Casual   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-30 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWOrcs Must Die! 2 is an amazing take on a tower defense/3rd-person action combo. Attributes of both genres are blended together perfectly to form an addictive and entertaining little game. This is a game that is very easy to enjoy.Orcs Must Die! 2 does a great job taking 3rd-person action elements and blending them with some tower defense to establish a good basis. Then they sprinkle in the lighthearted atmosphere and charming characters with the simplistic-yet-captivating mechanics of the gameâ¦ and it shapes up to be a really fun, delightful experience. Itâs definitely the kind of game you can dive right into and get hooked for hours. There is a relatively large amount of different towers and abilities in the game when compared to many other games in the tower defense genre. You have plenty of options and can have fun experimenting with different strategies. The level designs also vary enough that they call for different approaches to beat them, so you will have to try out different tactics in order to succeed. And there is a fair amount of different enemies which keeps things fresh as you progress through the game.There is also a scoring system and leaderboards to add replay value.Orcs Must Die! 2 is a step forward from the already amazing first game.  All the good aspects return, with some new ideas sprinkled in. There are many more traps and abilities, and a more extensive upgrade system.  There are many new enemies.  Thereâs a new extensive campaign, new game modes (like endless mode), and with the Steam Workshop there are now limitless possibilities for maps.  Also the addition of cooperative mode makes the experience exponentially more fun if you have a friend to play with.  I would say practically everyone should enjoy the Orcs Must Die! games.  Many hours of fun to be had with the games in this series, I recommend playing both.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Orcs Must Die 1 was a great game. I had so much fun with it, I love tower defense games, and this game just made tower defense funner, more intimate, and funnier. I had thought that Orcs Must Die 2 couldn't improve on the first game, all they could really do is add more traps and maps. But then, wham, MULTIPLAYER! Now I could share my joy of endlessly building crazy trap rooms with complimenting traps. I love to just zone out and set it to endless mode. Nothing funnier and more satisfying than for a horde of unwitting boobs to slog through a room of whirling, flaming, death that my teammate has created, only to be flung ragdoll right back into it. I love this game. Right now, this game is only $3.99 on steam. How the hell can you turn that down?			"

 Orcs? More like dorks!	Orcs Must Die! 2 is a pretty cool Third Person Tower Defense game where you take control as either the War Mage or the Sorceress.

Pros	-Various traps and weapons-Weak, strong and annoying enemies to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you over-Gets more challenging the longer you get-Some may say that the grafics are kinda bad, but I actually like it Cons	-The pathing doesn't always work properly with barricades 8/10Great game	 "

In Orcs Must Die! 2 (OMD!2), the player must set traps and other tools to defeat waves of orc minions, as well as fend them off with various weapons and trinkets; it is a castle defense title that could possibly be described under multiple other categories given its abundance of firearms, skills, traps, and melee weapons. Of the many castle defense-type games I have played throughout the years, however, OMD!2 has to be my absolute favorite. It is extremely difficult for me to choose the components of this game I believe to be the most outstanding because it is just so enjoyable and well produced. With varying modes of play, said orcs must be deterred from reaching a Rift in either a solo trial or in two-player multiplayer mayhem; combined with a heart-pounding soundtrack of heavy metal Rifts (pun intended) mixed with more traditional themes, blasting away orcs has never been more entertaining! (This previous statement derives from an upcoming Ork player in the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game.)Here are just a few reasons I still enjoy every second of Orcs Must Die! 2:Main Protagonists - When beginning OMD!2, the player has the option of selecting between two characters: an imbecile unnamed War Mage turned Miner who fans of the first game hail as the gameâs protagonist and a seductress Sorceress who acted as the prior titleâs antagonist. Obviously, these two characters-one being new to the âgood guy clique-differ in both stature and basic weaponry, but playing as each of these individuals reveals another mark of comparison: their unlockable traps, weapons, minions, and skills are unique. For instance, the War Mage begins the game with a scattershot blunderbuss, tar traps that slow enemy minions, and a device to be placed on the wall that fires multiple arrows at crossing enemies; later in the game he can place panels that fling enemies (""These orcs must fly!"" -Neosho and myself), and other damaging traps. On the other hand, the Sorceress starts with a projectile launching staff that has the ability to convert orc forces into allies for a limited time, ice vents which freeze hostiles, and acid-spraying wall machines.Humor - Though mostly from the War Mage than the Sorceress, the dialogue is very enjoyable. Whether a quip from the former villain to the witless hero or a pun directed after a combination kill by the player, each line may at least provoke a snicker from the player. There are also a few cinematic victory dances that may occur after a stage is completed, which is silly enough to be one of my favorite end-of-level treats out of any game.Gameplay - As described previously, the player deters waves of antagonistic orc brutes using a variety of set traps, weapons, trinkets, and-if available-a partner. There is a loadout system implemented to where the player can only select a given number of traps at a specific point in the story; however, this âtrapacityâ (do you see now why I am not permitted to make jokes? It should be court-ordered!) increases as the player progresses through the main campaign, and causes the player to select carefully before engaging the enemy. Each item retains its own unique upgrades, which allows players to partially dictate how they want to play. The usual shooter control layout is utilized (e.g. W, A, S, and D to maneuver, Space Bar to jump, LMB to use the equipped toolâs primary action) but there is no weapon zoom unless you are using the Steam Workshop modification for it; instead, the RMB functions your equipmentâs secondary fire button, which-as an example when using the blunderbuss-fires a ball of energy that explodes on impact to damage and scatter hostiles.Skull Currency System - As explained prior, the player has the option of purchasing upgrades to their existing items; additional equipment that can be purchased include character skins and new weapons and trinkets. Though the described system of âplay your wayâ intrigues me, how you obtain the in-game currency is even more interesting. OMD!2 utilizes Skulls as a spendable asset, and are either dropped as a mark of achievement for scoring a high combination kill or for mastering a certain campaign levelâs par, such as completing it within a given amount of time or not allowing any orcs into the Rift. This system is based more on performance than anything, which drives the player to achieve more advanced level scores and objectives for a more desirable Skull payout. It also entices players to attempt new trap and weapon combinations to try and best their previous scores.Overall Feel - Whether orcs are flying due to a well-placed spring trap or are blown meters back by an enhanced blunderbuss blast, OMD!2 melds the player together with an overwhelming sensation of hectic bliss. It is a purely indescribable impression that can be felt while playing either with a friend of solo. I honestly cannot exactly pinpoint single thing that makes this game as good as it is a cohesive punctuation of elements involving the thrill of every lightning bolt strike, every orc cartoonishly erupting in flames, every upgrade purchased; the game just feels right.TL:DR - There is not much I can truly say against this game. I have an immense amount of fun whenever I play Orcs Must Die! 2, as it a truly unique gaming experience. From my perspective, players take the role of a comedic, naive sorcerer or sensible sorceress while attempting to prevent many orcs from reaching a rift using their upgradable weapons, equipment, and traps. I must admit that this game would be better to play with friends, but is just fine as a single-player experience. Have fun with this awesome game. Also, I will happily play cooperatively with anyone wishing to do so. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			"

												Orcs Must Die 2 continues right where 1 left off. The much-awaited multiplayer experience is here, but this review will be from a single-player standpoint.To start with, you get to pick between the Warmage and the Sorceress. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but the Warmage simply feels easier to play with due to his superior health, superior tar trap, and arguably superior weapon. The Sorceress is better for charming single, large targets though, and her acid trap does more damage than the Warmage's Arrow Trap.Gameplay is more or less the same. If you played OMD1, this will all be familiar. The Elementalist girls are gone, which is a shame. This change means that you have less options to adjust to your enemies in the middle of a level. Fortunately any upgrades you purchased prior to battle can be reset at no cost. Autoballistae are now considered guardians, which means you can no longer spam them. I was sad about that as well.Amazingly they made the Gnolls more irritating. They seem to have more HP, run faster (both probably untrue, but it feels like it), and can now slow you upon hitting you, making escape impossible. A whole pack of them, especially in Endless mode (see below), will ruin your day.I'm rather disappointed that the campaign is so short. The first game took maybe 15-20 hours to complete, and had a good progression. OMD2 instead took me a mere 10 hours on normal difficulty. Granted, I already knew the basics of the game, but this was far shorter than I expected. DLC's extend the game's length a bit, but they contain no story segments, and thus you are basically playing for skulls (the game's peristent currency) and variety. Note that you'll have to play through Campaign again with another character if you want stuff unlocked on both characters.Endless mode is interesting. Waves come indefinitely and keep getting tougher until you can no longer handle it, much like Survival mode in other types of games. This mode by far is the biggest time-sink, though you are rewarded with plenty of skulls to compensate.If you like the first game and want a way to play it with friends, then OMD2 is the way to go. Overall it's an acceptable game. I still recommend the first game though.			"

Personal rating: 9/10DLC: Adds a lot to the game without putting any game breaking stuff. Complete Pack is very worth it.About Orcs Must Die! 2:It is a fast paced, tower defense game which requires you to be crafty and resourceful from the beginning until the end. But unlike most common defense tower games you actively participate in the battle, you are main defense, your towers, or rather traps, will hinder, soften or thin out the horde, but you'll still have a lot of heavy lifting to do by yourself.About the gameplayOrcs Must Die! 2 is more refined than its predecessor, it fixes little tweaks that were very annoying in the first game and balances weapons that back then felt a little too powerful and buffs weapons that were otherwise almost useless or felt too weak to be of proper use.There's a lot of variation in your towers, or rather, traps. You can out them on the ground, walls and ceiling and some traps requires certain strategies to work well. Obviously there are traps that works better with others, but nothing is truly impossible to combine, you create your own set of traps to watch enemies get brutally pierced/crushed/burnt/frozen/stripped to the bones.The game makes sure to bring new foes and tricks to ensure that you will always try something new, something you hadn't thought before or to show that your old tactics will eventually stop working. Improvements over the first gameOrcs Must Die! 2 fixes a lot of little things that were annoying in the first game some are noticeable such as clunky physics with Wind Belt, other are more subtle like not being able to place Boom Barrels too close to enemies and removing fall damage which was completely needless.Another big change was the improvements over control customization and options overall which was seriously lacking in the first Orcs Must Die!All in all once you play the first game you'll realize how the differences can affect in your game style.How difficulty is it?Orcs Must Die! 2 can be difficult, a bit overwhelming at first, but you will rarely feel that the game was unfair, that it did something ridiculous that you couldn't counter before it happened. It is a rewarding experience and you will feel great whenever you pull a maximum rank victory, especially on Nightmare (I'll talk about it in a moment).The game was tailored for co-op action and after the first stage you'll be facing two enemy spawn points to defend and it can feel unfair, especially in the beginning when you barely have anything to deal with them, it can be difficult but it's still manageable.While not something I truly appreciate, you'll have to go back to certain levels when you have better equipment to ace it (5 skull). Sure, you can start playing from the get go with a friend, but damn if it doesn't make you feel like a complete pro player when you get that maximum rank victory in a difficult map all by yourself.Nightmare?The Nightmare difficulty, unlocked by finishing the game once, is far from being a numerical difficulty where the game merely ups enemies health or their numbers (something that plagues the games ever since they were made), it ramps up the difficulty to above the roof showing even tougher enemies and giving you puny three seconds to sell traps/units. You'll be forced to rethink your strategies and sometimes change to things you never ever thought before.Bring friend to kill orcs. Have twice as fun.The co-op is just plain fun. Even more enemies to kill with a friend is never enough and being able to share strategies and putting up your traps into synergy is pure glee. If you don't have friends to play with you can always ask for others in the multiplayer groups.Orcs Must Die, sure, but there are few problems...There are two complaints about this great game I have: grinding and character selection.Grinding is bad enough (maximizing traps, accessories and weapons is expensive), but having to do twice because you have to create two separate game files for each character is just increasing the longevity of the game in a bad way, especially since it can take a while to notice the differences between both characters aside from the obvious.Changing characters requires you to return to the main menu screen, which wouldn't be such a hassle if you didn't have to leave the Party you made for multiplayer which can be very annoying.There's also the fact Orcs Must Die! 2 is MUCH shorter than it's predecessor. While the first game has whooping 24 maps in the main campaign, the second game has only 15. Of course with the Classic levels DLC (earned by having the first game) the second game is longer, but I'm was never a big fan of having to rely on DLC to have a game with good length.Final commentariesOrcs Must Die! 2 is an excellent game. It has tons of replay value and is balanced decently for both co-op and solo play. It does feel like it's an ""Orcs Must Die! 1 v2.0"" but with so many new traps, a new character and a good amount of changes, fixes here and there, it's worth every penny.Let us only hope Robot Entertainment will some day make the Orcs Must Die! 3 after they finish up Unchained and let more characters, more traps and, of course, more orcs appear to amp the fun. Maybe even boss battles?			"

												Orcs Must Die! was the interesting tower defence with lots of traps, weapons and enemies. Sequel is more dynamic, more interesting and there are much more devices in OMD!2. But the main difference is co-op. You can kill orcs with your friend. That's cool.			"

												This is a wave after wave of orc killing madness. There are many ways to kill the orcs and each way seems more pleasing than the next. This is a tower / hero defense game that is very amusing. I would recommend this to kill time or play with friends. It's not my favorite co-op game but it is fun. There's nothing about this game that screams I MUST have, so if you like the previews, the art and just wanna kill orcs, then this is the game to have. Rating: 6/10			"

Good cartoonish art, so far it was nicely optimized, no crashes and no fps lag at all.The co-op mode is even funnier of course, since you can use a lot of creativity with a friend to complete the levels.Could use a larger amount of levels, though, without the need for DLC, that is. Still, a pretty good game.			"

												-Orcs Must Die! 2-Orcs must die 2 takes on the tower defense genre, which to many incuding myself have always ignored and just seen as a 'play for ten seconds then wait around for a wave to go by while you watch your defences do the work.' But considering refunds are now an option I thought heck this game is ranked as 'Overwhelmingly Positive' I may aswell tryi it.  And what a great decision that was.The game is still a tower defense game but with all the fast paced third person shooting, and mindless comedic slaughter of orcs you could ever want. It breaks away from the bog standard tower defense where you feel you are controlling the outcome of the wave rather than the AI controlled defences. One minute you are blastiing down an ogre with your blunderbuss and the next you are trying to quickly decide within the time limit what traps to put down to get the best possible rating. This game is lovingly crafted with a quirky art style incredibly optimized gameplay creating a nicely packed game that suits even the the biggest haters of tower defense.Oh and not only this it comes with an astounding co-op that allows you and a friend to take on the entire campaign together with th difficulty cleverly scailed to the amount of players in a mission. To ensure balanced gameplay among other things.Truly a star studded preformance from Robot Entertainment!9.5/10			"

												Tower Defence game where u play as a really strong warrior or a mage against a horde of weaklings. The enemies aren't very strong it's only the fact that they have alot of hp that some of them manage to switch through. Cartoony art syle gore and humourous content. The game gets boring really easily but it's not a bad game to grab whilst it's on sale. The dlc is alright. This game tried to be like dungeon defenders but isn't as fun. It's always more fun to play with a friend so if you have a friend who has it play with them. stop the orcs from going through a portal by genocide. You sometimes feel like a lord of the rings character killing Orcs 7.5/10			"

												Orcs must Die 2 is the sequel that fans of the first game (which I also recommend that you play first) were waiting for. It keeps all of the fun aspects of the previous game while adding plenty of new things as well as addressing the criticisms of the original, the largest of which was lack of multiplayer. The game now has full Co-Op, as well as a new character in the form of the Sorceress. The game adds new levels new enemies, and an arsenal of new weapons and traps to massacre the hordes of orcs with, all while keeping the theme of the original, including the FANTASTIC soundtrack. I would say this feels more like an expansion pack than a sequel, but then you also have to take into account that both this game and the original were very cheap in price on release, and both have been on sale countless times since then. A great deal of fun, and if you like the idea of slaughtering huge hordes of orcs with hilarious trap combinations, you NEED to buy this game.			"

												Yet another game somehow I found myself addicted to.It started off simple - got this as a gift from a friend, was bored didn't have anything else to play. Okay why not - she got me the game may as well try it. I am extremely glad I did because this simple tower defense idea became Orcs Must Die. The gameplay is simple which follows a tower defense sort of idea. Instead of bland towers and a bird's eye view of watching the action, the game puts you as a player in 3rd person view capable of unleashing an array of weapons. Some weapons included are a bazooka and a spear. All weapons have secondary attacks such as turning orcs into stone or unleashing a proximal blast. On top of having a variety of weapons to choose from, the player is also able to deploy a variety of different traps or towers. Deploying defense mechanisms is very simple; it is easy to remove and add defenses almost anywhere on the map. Some of these defenses include arrow walls, tar pits, blocks, giant swinging gates with sharp cone pointing things, floor spikes etc... Basically there isn't a shortage of what to choose from when it comes to beating up the orcs. Defenses and even weapons can be upgraded with the amount of skulls you collect per level. The amount of skulls is dependent on how well you do throughout the level. Visually this game is fine. It doesn't need over the top graphics but provides enough graphic for the atmosphere that is created. Sounds and music is quite reasonable and suitable to the atmosphere. The impact noises that the weapons produce are accurate and hearing the orcs and player go off while in combat is enjoyable to hear. Running is also possible in this game (shift) which makes life and the game all that much more beautiful. You'll realize how much you use it when you play.Overall I'd have to give this game an average RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-although be it so, if this game does appeal to you - you will like it guaranteed and you will have fun playing it like I do. If you have a buddy to play with online as well, it will be even better. This game would have greatly benefitted from local-coop.ScreenShots  My favorite part about this game is the floor traps Over time, you are able to purchase different weapons which have a primary firing setting and an alternate firing setting. The alternate fire for this wand is freezing opponents "

You shall not pass!Orcs Must Die 2 is a very safe approach to the sequel. The creators decided not to change too much, adding just what clearly lacked in the first one. By the way, they didn't overwork at the making of this game - I don't want to be mean, but it could be called Orcs must die+ or Orcs Must Die: Prepare to Die edition.Now, quite honestly - Orcs Must Die 2 provides a few hours of fun, especially if the first contact with the series. A little worse if you're an experienced player - the game can end very quickly and the changes in the game doesn't seem to me to be big enough to attract longer. Unless you can find a partner for a joint butchering of orcs. Then the long hours of listening to the plaintive moans of beasts storming your dungeon are waiting for you.			"

												This game is such an unadulterated fun time to game. From the time I saw the trailer for Orcs Must Die! I knew I wanted to play. So, when I saw a humble bundle that included both Orcs Must Die! and Orcs Must Die! 2 I jumped all over thatâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I really enjoyed the slight twist of the traditional concept of a tower defense game by throwing you in the middle of all the action, it made even that much more visceral, tense and fun.I think the only flaw in this game is that fact there is not match making system in the game despite the fact the game pushes you in some aspects to play with another person. Luckily I have a few friends that have the game so I didn't need to deal with that issue at all, but I do see how it could be annoying for someone looking for someone to play the game since you will have to do it the hard way by checking the forums for people to play with. That in no way makes this game not fun, this is totally worth buying if you love have a fun time.Want to read me saying more positive things about the game? Then have a read about it on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/03/orcs-must-die-2.html.			"

												I'll start off with saying this is a very hard review for me to write. I'm still not entirely sure whether I like OMD!2 or not.I played through the base OMD!2 campaign with Kataztrophik. Playing games with others always makes for a better experience for me.Unfortunately I found myself getting bored on more than one occasion. The maps all looked pretty much the same, the variance in enemies is limited, and I found the traps to be uninspired and mostly useless.I'm a huge fun of TD games. They can be repetitive. The strategy in a TD game comes from playing towers/traps/units in best places, and finding a balance between upgrading and placing new units. Then there's the diversity. Do I need to deal with fast enemies? Maybe they're cloaked? Those ones are flying. Wait! There's a group that are resistant to a certain damage type! Oh no here comes the boss!!! OMD!2 has none of this. You place a trap and that's it. You can sell it in build phases, but there's no upgrading as the level goes on. Therefore the only option is to spam defences everywhere with your spare cash.The enemies in OMD!2 are very limited. It has some flyers, some high health hard hitting Ogres, some exploding Kobolds, some fast little buggers, Trolls that regenerate health and then the general mob. Even so they all seem pretty much the same. The game just spams you with more and more mobs as the level progresses. You counter it by spamming more and more traps. There's no real strategy. Sure the traps filter out some of the bad guys, but you'll be doing most of the killing with your weapons.This is where the game shines. The action gameplay in combat is pretty good. It's fluid and the weapons are fun to use. However, whilst this is certainly fun it offers nothing ground-breaking or unique. With the lack of variance of the enemy one faces it can also get pretty boring fast.The biggest thing the game seems to lack for me, is bosses. There should be an epic fight against a might orc, the likes of which has never been seen before! There should be a dragon! A dragon would fit into the games style nicely, and there's no reason why there isn't one.Overall OMD!2 is a mildly fun action game, with underwhelming TD elements. It's worth playing through the game with a friend, but there are better options available.Bottom line: Good in short stints with a buddy.			"

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend Orcs Must Die! 2 then skip to Results and read from there.Robot Entertainment makes a fantastic addition to their brilliant tower defense game. Orcs Must Die! 2 adds new elements of gameplay to the tower defense genre by mixing FPS, TD, and RPG games.Story:The War Mage has seals the final rift taking magic away from the world, but forever protecting it from the orcs continually onslaught. The world begins to crumble as magic no longer influences the weather i, sickness, and food. People are realizing the harsh world that they inhabit as magic is taken away. The Sorceress no longer has the ability to control the hordes of orcs, as her magic is gone and she has not long to live before they finally dispose of her. But The Master with his last fleeting breath hopes to give the kingdom one last chance opens a rift bringing back The Sorceress. The Master hopes The Sorceress will learn from her mistake and join The War Mage to restore the Order and bring back magic to the world again. Campaign:Orc Must Die! 2 offers two acts, the first consist of seven levels and the second of eight. They start out with each level only being a few waves, and then gradually increasing till you get to the last level which is about twelve waves. Similar to the original you cannot save half way into a level, meaning you need to make sure you have the time available to beat a level before you start it. The game also offers Endless Mode, which includes a variety of levels, some seen in the campaign and others that are unique. Endless mode allows you to obtain skulls (the currency used to buy upgrades) while at the same time getting to practice strategies. The campaign is played similar to the first one where you must place towers to defend rifts from being attacked, but incorporates more RPG elements. If you own Orcs Must Die! the original, you will also be given ten special levels in classic mode. Classic mode essentially is the best parts of the original campaign that can be played co-op and with the new features. This also allows you to earn more skulls and develop your character. Gameplay:Orcs Must Die! 2 allows you to play as one of two characters: The Sorceress and The War Mage. The War Mage has higher health while The Sorceress offers more mana. As such one is focused more around using melee and non-magic weapons and the other is based more on magic and spell-casting. This allows you to change how you will play right from the start of the campaign. Unlike Orcs Must Die! you can no longer upgrade your character with coins through the weavers. Instead you buy trinkets using skulls that offer your character passive abilities, upgrade your towers with skulls and unlock unique abilities for the towers, and upgrade weapons with skulls. Each level allows you to get five skulls, plus any additional bonus skulls you pick up as result of enemy drops. This gameplay is focused much more on RPG style gameplay and beating the campaign on War Mage with 5 skulls for every level is near impossible if you donât grind yourself up in Endless Mode.Multiplayer:Orcs Must Die! 2 offers multiplayer, finally you can play co-op as one player is The Sorceress and the other is The War Mage. I personally never played multiplayer, but its nearly self-explanatory that this adds all new elements to the game. A lot of the levels seem as though they are designed for two players, requiring you to essentially run from one side of the map to the other during waves. Adding multiplayer takes Orcs Must Die! and combines it with Sanctum taking the best from both worlds.  Fire and Water:The first DLC pack for Orcs Must Die! 2. The levels include new levels (Traffic Jammed, Double Decker, and The West Wing), new enemies (Fire and Water Lords), and new traps (Web Spinner, Dart Spitters, and Floor Portal). Double Decker is one of my favorite levels; it is a two pathed level where you get to use minecarts to stop your foes. The new enemies Fire and Water Lords offer all new challenges, if you donât kill them quick enough they evolve. They can evolve two times starting at Firelings and becoming Fire Lords. The Fire Lords are similar to Ogres and have a lot of health while the Firelings are like Orcs. I personally liked the Dart Spitters came in handy on levels where I wanted to concentrate traps, but ran out of space.  Family Ties:This DLC further expands Orc Must Die! 2 offering loads of new content: three new levels, two new weapons, a new trinket, and even some new enemies. The levels include: Rush Hour, Breakneck Triad, and Triple Threat. The new levels are really well designed and can be played easily solo or with a group. One of the new weapons, Stone Staff, was actually my favorite weapon as it allows you to essentially freeze enemies then do increased damage to them. The Hobgoblin Healer is a very good addition and requires you to focus your strategy differently as they can cause a simple attach to be very difficult. The Ball and Chain is essentially just a stronger Ogre. Overall this is a great addition to the game, and the new weapon in my opinion is the best in the game. Are We There Yeti?:This is another exciting DLC pack offered with Orcs Must Die! 2. The pack includes three levels: Yeti Den, The Hive, and Chilled Cavern. These levels introduce new characters (Yeti and Goblin Sapper) and offer a new weapon/trap/trinket. In my opinion these new levels are the hardest ones Iâve played in the Orcs Must Dies series, specifically âYeti Denâ. I played the levels on War Mage and beat them solo, but definitely could not do that on Nightmare. The levels are set up to be played with multiple people and this pack would probably be a lot more entertaining on multiplayer.Results:Orcs Must Die! 2 is a fantastic game that combines RPG, FPS, and TD into one single game. With co-op play you can mess around with your friends and play the maps to a whole new level. Orcs Must Die! 2 also integrate Orcs Must Die! campaign into the game (if you own the latter) allowing you to play the original levels with the new elements of the Orcs Must Die! 2. There are way more weapons to mess around with, loads more spells, trinkets, and special tower upgrades making Orcs Must Die! 2 a great addition to the first game. With loads of DLC to add to it this game is a must buy. If you are unsure or maybe just frugal, such as myself, then wait till the complete pack is on sale and grab that. As you will want to buy the DLC once you really get into the game.  Pros:+A campaign consisting of 15 new levels+Addition of endless mode that lets you go nuts.+Loads of new baddies (including the Orc Mages and Shaman from Orcs Must Die! DLC)+Co-Op play so you can mess around with a friend and have a great new experience+Incorporating RPG elements to the game+Three DLC packs+If you own the original you get Classic mode which includes ten levels from Orcs Must Die!+Loads of new spells (including spells from Orcs Must Die! DLC)+Loads of new towers (offering different play strategies)+Trinkets (which give you passive and active abilities)+Character customization with new costumes.+The story picks up right where it left off.+Two heroes which allow you to choose your play-style. +They added weekly challenges, which get you to play maps in order to earn extra skulls.+You can refund your skulls without any penalties as many times as you want. Cons:-Orcs Must Die! 2 seems to focus too much on grinding. (in order to beat the Campaign on War Mage you essentially need to play Endless mode to get skulls)-The guardian limit is still incredibly low.-There are no levels that corridor enemies so you can just build one long defensive run and have fun with the game.

												Have you played tower defense games wishing you can jump into the fray to help out when things get too hot?  Orcs must Die! 2 allows you to do this very well.  Control is friendly and smooth, graphics is great.  Can't stop grinding for the next unlock.			"

YouTubeâ¢ Video: MOB Review: Orcs Must Die! 2Â 

			Views: 71		

			Orcs Must die is a 3rd person Tower D game. Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/201790/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

Orcs Must Die 2 is a third person tower defense game with a well integratedco-op mechanic.  To begin with, the music matches to the gameplay seamlessly,and does a great job of drawing you into the mood of each battle.  The storyis brief, but is enough to set the scene for the game.  There are two characters to chose from, and while the selection is limited, they both have their own play-style that are well balanced in the game.  It centers around using traps, trinkets, weapons, and strategy to prevent themonsters from reaching the end gate.  The majority of the traps feel useful due to the level design, and it's up to the player to  select which to use based on their preference and how well they synergize with each other.  Each level gets more complex and intricate in its difficulty as you progress through the game, and it's importantto understand the available traps each level offers, and take advantage ofoptions like portals that help you travel from point to point more quickly.There is also a variety of creatures that the player is presented with, andeach one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and I go over this in moredetail in the video.  With regards to the creatures and traps, you have to beaware of what these creatures do, and plan accordingly.The large variety of levels, weapons, traps, and trinkets really personalizes the game.  The leaderboards offer an incentive to perform well to see howwell you place in comparison to others.  The co-op mode also increases the difficulty by offering more troops.  The only issue I really had with thisgame was that it offers a level of difficulty only up to a point, and whilethere is an endless mode that presents more and more troops, sometimes itfeels a little lacking for the more hardcore players.  I would have liked tosee a bit more of a challenge aspect for the more advanced players.Overall this game was very well done.  The different options add to the value of this game, and I found it entertaining and fun to play.  I can easilyrecommend this game.  For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.

												Orcs Must Die 28.5/10OVerview: Third Person Tower DefenseThe Good:+ Graphics fit the style and theme for the game+ Plenty of traps, weapons and trinkets (passive/active abilities) to fit your own playstyle. Seeing the orcs getting killed by the traps is very satisfying. Each trap, weapons and trinket can be upgraded by completing levels. + Variety of enemies, some with their own unique abilites ensuring that no trap or weapon is overpowered. Some enemies can run over your barriers, others can disable your traps, etc. You really have to be on your guard if you want to be successfull+ Lots of different maps spread across story,classic and endless mode. + Good SoundtrackThe Average:The game has co-op mode but sadly its very difficult to find anybody. ConclusionIf you loved the first game then you should love this as well as its just more of the same, and if you haven't played the first game I recommend you do so because its also an excllent tower defence game. I would have liked to have seen even more game modes and maps but more 'orcs must die' is never a bad thing. This is probably the better third person tower defense games on Steam.			"

												For fans of the original OMD, especially if you ever longed for co-op, this is a must. However, co-op aside, the other improvements are all solid as well. The main difference (aside from the addition of the Sorceress as a playable character) is a new upgrade/unlock system based on skulls earned by completing levels. It works pretty well and allows you to customize your characters with the traps and weapons you like the best. Other than that, this is pretty much the same game as OMD1, only with new campaign levels and a series of ""endless mode"" challenges... so, essentially this is more like OMD1.5 than a full on sequel. That said, I am fine with that at the low asking price. I guess the only negative thing I found was that it seemed like levels were designed for co-op. I was able to complete the game solo, so it's not impossibly difficult, but it definitely would have been easier and more fun with a partner. OMD2 provides a solid few hours of fun, plus lots more for high-score hounds.			"

												If you enjoyed the first game, then you will be most likely disappointed by it. Remember how you could create a corridor of death and let the traps do all the work? Well, this is no longer the case. Most of the traps were nerfed to the ground, while the maps were designed clearly with co op in mind.At one point, it becomes too hard to complete a mission by yourself, due to terrible design. Not to mention finding someone to play with you is terrible.If you enjoyed the first game, go back to it. This one is not worth your time. Third game is similar to the second one, so even more co-op.However, if you love Co-op those games can be good. Other than that, not really.			"

												I played through this game after completing the first part in the series and I have to say that I am somewhat disapointed with the game in several ways that I will list down below.1) In the original game the crossbow was your bread and butter, the game was really a blend of true TPS and TD but I feel like actual marksmanship has been removed from the game. Projectiles fly off in random directions unless a special focus has been met making the use of the crossbow highly impractical compared to the first game.2) Throughout the game you are reminded that you need to farm skulls in endless mode in order to beef up your traps so you can proceed in the campaign. Granted that it is still possible to complete the campaign levels without dowing this, if you want to play the game solo then it is impossible to get perfect scores in certain levels without farming up a bit.3) The heavy emphasis on coop play shows in the level designs, while most stages are perfectly doable on your own it is sometimes extremely difficult to work around in later stages.4) The original game had Weavers, certain skill trees you could use in a stage to enhance certain aspect of your character or traps, this has been completly removed from the game in favor of upgrading individual traps and weapons using skulls.5) Last but certainly not least: This game has a terrible amount of bugs. It crashes frequently upon completing stages giving you the strange state where you have unlocked the next stage but have no registered high score. While playing coop (something this game has seemingly been designed around) the game has even more oppertunities to crash making it really frustrating when you have finally gotton to one of those later waves in a stage only to see your work amount to nothing.Now for nuance it seems like that game has a somewhat more involved story line that still has a big open ending and playing as the new character class was quite an enjoyable experience.My final verdict is that if you are really looking for a game that you can casually play with friends during LAN events or get togethers that this game can be a nice fix. If you haven't played this series before and are more inclined to play solo anyway I highly recommend to get part 1 instead. If you have already bought and or played part 1 then I am not really comfortable really recommending this one.I hope the devs get around to fixing some of the bugs in this game to make it a more stable experience.  Until then the game has a lot of potential but sadly fails to deliver.			"

												Overall this game is good, many changes from OMD 1+ Trinket for supporting players+ Many varies of traps including weapons and trinkets+ Orcs got many classes, more Big Boys (troll, Elemental, Lord)+ Guardians, decoy and boom barrel can be placed above floor trap without obstruction- Push trap is too powerful- No weavers (They are replaced as trinkets which didn't help much)- Guardians are more weaker than Guardian at OMD 1 (Even can sustain by having Guardian Trinket)- Spring and Push trap clearly innefective against Big Boys (Ogre, Troll, Elemental and Lord) while OMD 1 with fortifications trap they can throw any big boys away.- Alchemist Bomb become quite innefective for mobs (only for suppression)Clearly i want the weavers back because it help us a lot compare to the trinket (Even Trap Trinket is Best of Best Trinket) however it lacks firepower for the Big Boys (Ogre, Troll, Elemental) i hope that the weaver on OMD 1 will return on OMD 3			"

Orcs Must Die! 2 Is a two player co-op tower defense game with a lot of freedom In choosing your traps, weapons, helpers In battle, and spells. You unlock things by playing levels and earning skulls as a currency to purchase upgrades. I strongly recommend playing this.			"

Yes you can have fun alone but not nearly as much fun as you can with a friend, so best played with people.The leveling, perks, upgrades are all good fun to see and work towards.

												Orcs Must Die 2 Is obviously the Sequel to Orcs Must Die, But it feels like an expansion to some reguards.For starters, not much has changed execpt New Enemies, Levels, Weapons and that sort of stuff. but It's still really fun and another feature added in was Co-Op!And let me tell you, I reccomend playing this game with a friend. It's probably more fun than Another Shooter/Tower defense hybrid game, Sanctum. Why? It has more personal involvement, meaning instead of leaving your traps to do most of the dirty work You're gonna have to start taking down orcs with Two playable characters: The Warmage from the first game, and a New character, the Sorceress.Both of them are different in reguards of their playstyles, The Warmage was made to be the Guy usually being in the heart of the Orc swarm, and the Sorceress relying on spells and staying further away but still helping out the Duo ALOT.I honestly reccomend getting this instead of the first, only because It's better, and it has some levels from the FIRST Game as an added BONUS.Seriously, I can't reccomend this game enough if you and a pal are looking for something to play together.

												Pretty fun action Tower Defense. Place down traps, support them by shooting and killing enemies. Lets you customize and reset your skills and upgrades, can be played co-op with a friend, has a good variety of levels and traps.Could be improved in a few ways mainly towards upgrades, and some levels leave very little choice in what traps to use, so you end up choosing a few favourites and sticking with them all the way through.

												I love co op games especially arcade style wave based co op shooters.For me there are allways 2 types of co op games - 4 players co op and 2 players co op.Orks must die 2 is a 2 player co op wave based tower defence 3rd person shooter with RPG elements.The game is pure awesomeness. The levels are usually mirrored but thats great for 2 player co op. It's amaizingly done with a lot of things to level up.I am giving it a thumbs up because of all the fun I had playing with my flatmate.HOWEVER the game has one flaw that has to be mentioned - all traps are useless except the first you start with. I have beaten all levels and gotten to impossible waves of endless by using only the spike trap and the wall spike trap with only trinkets for more money and revive of archers or paladins that my flatmate used to put everywhere. I have over 300 sculls that I don't need to spend anywhere because all the most usefull traps and trinkets are allready maxed and everything else is just bad or there if you like to challenge yourself and play with the crappy and expensive traps that are not needed.Except that the modding community is doing great things with the game so if you are looking for a great co op experience with someone you know in my case my flatmate this is the game to go to.

												Just as great as the first game. If you've enjoyed Orcs Must Die, you should definitely pick this one up too.Most of the gameplay is very much similar. You still have a plethora of traps to use, and lots of orcs in each stage. There are fewer overall stages in the main campaign than there were in the first game, but the game offers some new stuff to make up for it. It now has 2 playable characters. Their starting weapons and starting traps are different. Like for example the Apprentice uses a blunderbuss as the main weapon, whereas the sorceress uses a sceptre to shoot small projectiles from. The presence of two playable characters also means the game can be played in co-op.In addition to this, some stages also have an endless mode, where you can keep fighting hordes of orcs till you lose all the rift points, and the game also lets you play some of the classic stages from the first game.The upgrade mechanic has been improved from the first game. Though the simplicity of it in the first game was nice, it's also great to have a bigger variety of upgrades that this game offers. Now each trap has more than 1 upgrade, and in addition to upgrading your existing traps, you can also buy new traps, weapons, and trinkets for all sorts of benefits, depending on how you prefer to play. Now this also means that it's easier to earn skulls, which are used as upgrade points. You can now gain them in more ways. In the first game you could only get them as a rating for each mission, but now you can also get them as bonuses and random drops, and as rewards for surviving a certain amount of waves in the endless stages.Just as with new traps, you also meet some new enemies. We now have some earth elementals which split into two smaller units upon death, some tall, lanky trolls which can take a lot of punishment, and even the regular grunts now have light, medium, and heavy armour varieties.There are only a couple of minor things I didn't like. The first one is that I was unable to find an easy way to switch between characters when in the campaign menu. I first played through the whole campaign as the Apprentice, and when I wanted to try out the Sorceress, I couldn't simply pick a stage I've beaten already and to do it with her. Instead I had to create a new character profile with no upgrades or unlocks and to start the campaign all over from the start, which isn't all that great.Another thing I didn't like was how the barricades have become virtually useless now. It's possible that maybe I was just unlucky, but on many occasions I noticed that the orcs now seem to prefer to rather smash their way through the barricades rather take an alternate path, even if the alternate path is within their vision. The only time this didn't happen was when I played the classic levels from the first game.In conclusion, this is a great 3rd person tower defence game and lives up to the quality of the first one. If you've enjoyed the first one, get this one too. If you've enjoyed this one, get the first one too.			"

												If you've played the first game, you'll be happy to know that the 2nd installment has basically improved upon the first game to perfection.  Take on a bunch of new and challenging story levels alone or with a friend, battling through over 20 different monster types with a slew of new traps and weapons, all of which are upgradeable now.  As an added bonus, owners of the 1st game will also get to play 10 classic maps, as well as an ""endless"" mode to see how many waves you can survive before you run out of rift points.  All complaints I had with the first game have been fixed, and the replayability is very high in this title.  All I can say is, If you're debating picking this one up or not, you are wrong for doing this, and are merely wasting time you could be spending killing these hilarious, clumsy oafs.  Move your axe to the store page, NAO!			"

												OMD2 is a hilarious little Tower Defense game. A slightly unimportant but actually pretty funny story, sets the stage for a huge amount of orcs running towards you. Through teamwork, you can fight the hordes with clever traps, a blunderbuss, some magical power attacks and lots of other funny weaponry. Get yourself a good friend and save...the world?

												This game should be called OMD! - Co-op Edition.If you don't have a partner, expect nightmare on normal difficulty (especially in Act II) because maps are designed for co-op defense. The main offender is the last level which I can't beat alone even after watching varios YT videos. Level design is much worse than the first game. I really enjyed OMD!, but not the 2nd one. Now I just idle for trading cards. Shame.There are some positives - graphics is updated, endless mod is very good (if you have a partner), and the new second character (Sorceress) is very good. The best part is you can replay every level again and again to gain new skulls which allows you to buy traps, skills, and etc before they unlock. You couldn't do it in the original which was huge design flaw.			"

												I know this game is highly rated, but I just couldn't get into it.1) Every map is clearly designed for co-op play.  As in every single one.  Defending widely seperated and/or overlapping lanes is extremely tedious.2) The barricade, your only mazing tool, is borderline useless because they're expensive and sappers will blow them up.  It is possible to place them such that they can be defended (most of the time), but this severly restricts your mazing options, often to the point where it's not even worth using them.3) You have to grind skulls to upgrade your gear and traps.  A LOT of skulls.  It's not like Defense Grid where the only thing you need to get Gold on every map is more skill and practice.  On the bright side, you can respec your character but doing this before every single attempt become a chore quickly.4) There's no real way to play this game as a pure tower defense game.  Your character is much more powerful than your traps no matter how you build yourself.			"

												After a long session of Call of Duty I can honestly say I couldn't be happier my friend suggested 'Orcs Must Die! 2' when I asked for a good tower defense game. OMD!2 will honestly be considered one of my favourite games of all time despite only having it for 1 month... it's incredibly fun, addictive and rewarding all at the same time. The story mode was entertaining due to the variety of strategies you could employ to complete them and the fact that each level can be completed at a different success rate. Beyond this there is an unlockable 'nightmare' mode which adds another layer of strategy to the game as well as making the game more addictive. However the story mode lacked any real in-depth storyline, there were only 2 cut-scenes that I can remember and each were short. Beyond story mode you could play endless which was interesting due to the more advanced enemies, it could however be deemed a touch repetitive or tedious. I didn't see it this way as it was always rewarded. There are many acheivements to obtain and none of them felt grindy, completing the story mode got you most of them and the others introduced you to other dimensions of the game such as combo'ing (however you will have to pay for DLC to get 100% completion).Overall I would say the game is definitely worth a purchase at it's cheap price due to it including Steam trading cards / achievements and being thoroughly enjoyable.

I didn't see it this way as it was always rewarded. There are many acheivements to obtain and none of them felt grindy, completing the story mode got you most of them and the others introduced you to other dimensions of the game such as combo'ing (however you will have to pay for DLC to get 100% completion).Overall I would say the game is definitely worth a purchase at it's cheap price due to it including Steam trading cards / achievements and being thoroughly enjoyable.

												This one is really great, like its prequel, but way more. Now you can upgrade all traps  more than once, play as another Character, you have more Traps, and you can play Co-op! That is totally awesome. Now it is unlimitted replayability which makes it even more cool because it's never gonna end. I enjoyed a lot Orcs Must Die! 2 and its prequel, I would highly recommend it.My rating: 100/100			"

												OMD2, Orcs Must Die! 2 is a nice tower defence/third person shooter hybrid game that I will recommend to all. It is really strategy-based and will definitly get your brain working, so it isn't just blind-shooting. It's fun to do co-op with friends, and solo itself is awesome as well. Feel free to add me for a game, I have all DLC^^			"

												Orcs Must Die! 2 picks up right where OMD! left off and keeps piling on the fun!  Everything that made OMD great is back, with just the right amount of tweaking to keep it fresh.  New maps, new monsters, and a new playable character.  The Co-op mode is a blast and now you can play Endless Mode too!  A must have for any fan of the original OMD!			"

Co Op is fun.However, once you start finding combinations that work, the game becomes so easy that you're more clearing it just to clear it.

												This game is really good in many aspects. You can use a lot of creativity in which way you choose to demolish those large hoards of orcs. Compared to the predecessor there are some improvements. You can reassign your upgrades and play with friends, for example.The graphics aren't the best possible but the top notch gameplay is enough to keep you satisfied for a long time.Levels are so versatile that you need to consider many different factors and constantly adjust your way of playing. That's what I like the most in this game.			"

If you'r not sure if you want to buy this game. DO! if not STILL DO!! but i recommend playing multiplayer, much more fun :)			"

												This game many look like simple arcade game, but Orcs Must Die 2 is truly a great strategic tower defense. You play as ""The War Mage"" through a 3rd person camera view, and try to survive waves of orcs. Just like any TD game, there is always at least one entrance and exit the orcs must travel through. Your job is to stop them. Level design is very good, and each level has a unique feel and strategies. There is plenty of towers to chose from, and each tower follows an upgrade system which is accessed after each battle. Also there is many different weapons and items The War Mage can use, and like towers these can also be upgraded and given better abilites after each battle. Replay value is very high, each level has 3 difficulties and an unlockable surival mode, and you can chose to play with any towers you have unlocked. Upgrading all of the weapons and towers will defnitely keep you busy as well.I would reccomend this game to fans of tower defense games and strategy games. There is actually quite a bit of planning involved when setting up the perfect defense. 9/10 One of my all time favorite TD games! "

Well, it's deep, it's smart and it's downright sexy, that's why.You already know what to expect from Orcs Must Die! 2 after the last game in the series, and a new storyline has been bolted on to make everything look welcoming for newcomers.Some people may bemon the lack of co-op play, but this reviewer believes it would have caused ludonarrative dissonance.From the moment the impressively lit intro scenes start you know you're in for something special, and the actual game doesn't disappoint at all.Graphically speaking, this game is awash with truly realistic animation, all of which is highly detailed and brings the characters to life effortlessly. It's a testament to the graphical prowress of that hot new graphics card you bought for an exhorbitant amount when its in the hands of the experienced team Robot Entertainment "

With a good friend you can discuss tactics and distribute the opposing force.Levels are really challeging when played on the right difficulty.

Well, it's deep, it's smart and it's downright sexy, that's why.You already know what to expect from Orcs Must Die! 2 after the last game in the series, and a new storyline has been bolted on to make everything look welcoming for newcomers.Some people may bemon the lack of co-op play, but this reviewer believes it would have caused ludonarrative dissonance.From the moment the impressively lit intro scenes start you know you're in for something special, and the actual game doesn't disappoint at all.Graphically speaking, this game is awash with truly realistic animation, all of which is highly detailed and brings the characters to life effortlessly. It's a testament to the graphical prowress of that hot new graphics card you bought for an exhorbitant amount when its in the hands of the experienced team Robot Entertainment "

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a great game and an improvement over the first one. It is a third person tower defense game with tons of traps, trinkets, weapons, and allies. The replay value is excellent, while multiplayer adds even more enjoyment. There is one minor downside. Some of the maps appear to be balanced for two players, so doing them solo is a lot harder. Again, this is a minor problem.			"

												Something about this game has me continually coming back to it several times a year. I'd say it's one of my favourite games! It's incredibly satisfying killing the orcs, making small mazes, messing around with the various traps and weapons...I love how each playthrough can be different and custom to how YOU want to play, rather than forcing you into a certain playstyle. It has a large replay value because of that and is fun playing both solo or with a friend. It's also on sale a LOT (along with the DLCs which are fun as well for ~$1 each), definitely worth it. Highly recommend. :)			"

												I find that playing co-op portion of this game is a lot of fun. It's a pretty simple tower defense style game, but there are enough variables for you to create different playing styles and still keep it fun. I get a little bored playing this game in single player mode, but that's just my preference. In order to find some people to play with, I went on the Steam forums and found a post full of people looking for partners to play this game. Otherwise, you might not find too many people to play with.			"

												This game has very easy gameplay (you need to kill orcs-small or bigger). Has a lot of great maps, places for traps. It's very funny to play with friends, but it's harder and challenging to play on your own. Game has many many traps, weapons or some tools to kill orcs.It's a great and interesting tower defense game with good music effects and levels that you need to pass.All in all everyone who loves tower defense or massive killing games must try this Orc torture.

												This is a fun little game that I discovered and played exclusively co-op with a friend of mine.I'm a big fan of tower defense games, and this game sure can keep you occupied for a few hours at a time. Place traps, fight hordes, and different maps come with all kinds of different challenges.My personal favorite part is the variety in options you have to choose from when you create your build. There are probably around one hundred choices to equip, and you can only use 6 at a time, allowing for great differentiation and a unique build that fits your playstyle. Definitely recommend, especially on sale.			"

												Orcs Must Die! 2You know one of these games in which you ask  yourself, ""What were the developers thinking""?This is one of this, and this game has a really basic concept, but, after all, it's a really fun an entertaining game.All you need is a friend to play with, and clicking few buttons.The game's concept goes like this;You and your partner are meant to set up an ambush, and traps, to keep an X amount of Orcs getting through the Rift. The rift is shown up as a door with a dim yellow light coming from it, like something god-like. It's a defense game with waves; you can upgrade traps, outfits, gear, trinkets, and many more. Depending on what level you're on, the amount of waves and the enemy types may vary alot, and you'll have to figure out which is the best way to keep them from going through your 'fortress' in time.The game revolves around the basic and generic-kill everything theme, warriors and orcs. I don't have many hours in it, but even if you're a fan of extremely realistic, indie, or 2d games, no matter what, this game is pretty decent. At first you'll think it's plain simple and boring, but after you played it for a bit you'll get used to it, and the fun will start showing up. Play it with a friend, make up a plan, tactics, strategy, and then prove who's the king, the orcs, or your ""devilishly handsome"" protagonist, ha-ha.Good luck!			"

Posted: December 4, 2013
												  Orcs Must Die! 2 at first glance seems like a classical tower defense. You lay traps and have to survive waves of monsters in increasing strength and size. So what makes this game better than other tower defense you may ask.   Firstly, the seamless graphics along with the interesting ability of playing an active and very important role in the defense is major to its sucess. You play as your character and you have to personally mow down the monsters where your traps fail.         Secondly, the monsters require different ways to kill them, a koboldd sprinter is a small and fast unit with not a lot of hitpoints that can bypass most basic traps quite quickly and so need to be coupled either with some well placed shots to the head or another trap to slow the kobold to stop it from passing, whereas a heavy orc warrior would simply require a lot of traps or armor-piercing traps or shots to kill it. This necessity to vary trap combinations and styles plays a major role to the enjoyability of the game.   Thirdly, there are a plethora of traps and weapons to choose from, each providing a unique play style and experience. Thus you can customise your character either too a mean, lean killing machine or you can upgrade your traps say and lay down so nasty little traps in choke points that obliterate the enemy.   Fourthly, the game is not easy. For people who are not very good at tower defense games playing on anything but apprentice level can be a challenge, this skill level requirement or at least a certain level of understanding of the game is necessary as the game is challenging and keeps you on your toes, especially at later stages in the story or in nightmare or endless mode.   Lastly, the aspect of the game that makes it stand out so much from other games is the great co-op aspect. Can you name another tower defense that looks good, plays great, constantly challenges you to play at your best and allows for so many customizations? I think not. So, unless you have found a better tower defense game I highly recommend this game to whoever is looking for a challenging fun and funny game.			"

												Quite fun actually. Orcs Must Die! 2 did not have a ""wow-factor"" for me in terms of the gameplay. I have played too much Dungeon Defenders to be new to third-person tower defense. What this game does shine in is the variety of traps, I enjoy having different load outs depending on the map and my play style. The pathing of waves are designed to be optimized for certain traps (ceiling, floor or walls). The game also supplies players with a good collection of weapons used on Orcs to company the automatic traps. In the game, there are only two classes to choose from; War Mage and Sorceress. The War Mage is a male character whose quotes are quite lighthearted but unintelligent. He has two ""uniques"" a trusty Blunderbuss, a shot-gun that also doubles as a grenade launcher, and Tar Trap that slows down enemies. The Sorceress, on the other hand, has a very different style. She is more of a passive character than the War Mage. Her unique trap, Acid Sprayer is able to apply short-term effects on enemies and her Sceptre of Domination can temporarily mind control. Even with the lack of characters, Orcs Must Die! 2 is still very enjoyable to play and, if single player is getting repetitive, online co-op is always available.			"

												First off, this game is intended to be played in co-op mode.  This new feature is great and now that I've tried it, I have to say the game is very well done.  It stands equal to the first game, in some ways better.That's if you play with two players.If you play this game solo, you may find it ridiculously difficult.  A punishing level of challenge which sometimes found me having to retry maps 15 or 20 times.  All the new maps are laid out in such a way that you need to go back and forth constantly if you play alone.I wish they'd made separate co-op maps as well as some new solo maps in order to make the difficulty more consistent.  As with the first game, it's extremely entertaining and well-done and would be perfect except for the difficulty issues.			"

												Orcs Must Die 2 is the sequel to Orcs Must Die (obviously) and as lazy as it sounds I would recommend reading my review of that because this game is essentially the same again. Not that that's a bad thing! The formula works, hell in this one they even improved a few things.This time you can choose between 2 characters to play as, the apprentice or the antagonist from the previous game. Each of the characters has their strengths and weaknesses, the apprentice carries on as he did before but now gives you the choice of crossbow, blunderbuss. The crossbow being the same as the last game and the blunderbuss causing far more damage but having a much longer reload time. The sorceress has less health than the apprentice but more mana and she can control a Orc and make him fight the others for a short period. As well as that some of the starting traps are different depending on which you choose as well as a few unlockables later.Speaking of traps there are some new ones, all of which are entertaining to see unfold, the levels also sometimes have environmental traps built in which you can take advantage of.This time there are far more unlockables to collect, costumes that change your abilities, rings and trinkets to enhance the way you play and of course the upgrades.Like the first game it's repetitive as hell, but what do you expect? And also like the first it's difficulty seems to ramp up out of nowhere.I recommend this game to those who have either played the first and want more of the same. If your new to the series... Well start here. It's a better game really, since it's the first one plus extras.I'd say Â£11.99 is a little steep though considering the first is essentially the same minus a few parts. See if you can find it a bit cheaper or on a sale. Anything below Â£10 is a bargain really.			"

												My favourite tower defense game, just edging ahead of Plants Vs Zombies. Action-packed, hilarious and deeply satisfying when you start pulping Orcs in finely-tuned traps; hugely challenging and panic-inducing on harder difficulties when trying to stop that last Kobold from escaping. DLC just adds more to an already fantastic little experience, but don't expect a huge progression from the original Orcs Must Die!, because this is essentially just more- more traps, more maps, more characters (the Sorceress and a co-op mode). If that puts you off splashing out for it at full price, wait til it's on sale, because it's still eminently buyable and very, very enjoyable.			"

												TO BUY OR NOT TO BUY: Orcs Must Die 2by JunkStarPROS:â­Huge variety of trap strategiesâ­Solid mix of defensive trap laying and third person combatâ­Good variety of maps, plus weekly challenge mapsâ­Character weapons and trap specializationâ­Fantastic team strategy experienceCONS:â­Goofy soundtrackâ­Totally free respecs at any time make your character feel less uniqueâ­Max 2 players onlineFINAL DECISION: I would not recommend this game without a friend. $15 sounds fair only if both players are into the tower defense genre. I'd wait for a sale if you are purchasing solely for single player purposes.			"

												One great co-up game.This game is a trapsetter and a 3.person shother in one.The game is a sequal to the last title named orcs must die.The game is designed so you get a lot of traps and other kind of things you can set down, you put them down, and then a horde of orcs will come against you. This means you have to shot the ones, that makes it through your baricats and taps. This makes the gameplay very fun, since the game has this changes of gameplay from time to time. You can chosse between to charecters, the warmage and the sorccere. The warmage is based on attacking with a gun, that will do a lot of damage to the orponent. The sorccere can mindcontrole enemys, and therefore win time, or do big damage, by mindcontroling big enemyes. The game`s story is not really important, and you don`t really pay attetnion to it. Normally I would say this is a bad thing. But for a game like this, story is not really anthing you want. You want to progress fast, and the game is very good at doing this.When the orcs come out, the waves becomes bigger, and the enemyes more tough. This accualy makes the game very hard at times. I higly recormend to play this with a friend. The game is fun when you play alone, but still, the game has more potentiol as a co-up game. I have played through the whole game with a friend of mien, and I can tell you, we loved every single secound of it. This game is a very great game, and a very well co-up game. It gets a thumps up.9 out of 10			"

												I am a fan of the Orcs Must Die! series, and love there take on the tower defense genre. Orcs Must Die! 2 is everything you could want out of an Orcs Must Die game and more, the co op, new towers and weapons, new maps, and really just alot of fun stuff to play around with. The only negative I have with the game, is that there are no server browsers or anything, you have to have a friend join you if you want to play co op. If you did not already know, the goal of the gameplay is to fight off orcs and other magical beasts (trolls, kobolds, ogres, ect.) that are emerging from magical rifts. There is a story and most plot elements are at least touched upon over the three Orcs Must Die games. Orcs Must Die! 2 is worth yout time if you are looking for a good tower defense / action series, take a look, I am sure there is at least something you may like about the OMD series.			"

												I am not normally a fan of Tower Defense games, they get repetitive and boring after a while.

Sure the basic premise of slaughtering orcs is like any other Tower Defense game, but the sheer addition of co-op multi player made me jump for joy.			"

												Super fun and addictive Third person tower defense game, made even better with the co-operative aspect of the game.Both characters play differently with different starting weapons and a couple unique traps....and of course there is loads to do from the range of main game levels (about 20), DLC levels (should you choose to buy them; 3 levels each), endless mode (a few) and classic levels (if you have the first game purchased; 10 levels)Pros:+Super fun and well-polished gameplay/animations.+Massive range of traps, trinkets, weapons etc. ALL with upgrades.+Great range of maps, some easy and some painfully hard.+Improves on the first game majorly, great sequel!+Solo and co-op options (can do a playthrough with a mixture).+Fantastic soundtrack.+Nightmare Mode for when the first playthrough was too easy.+Spring traps...seriously, they fling enemies all around the place.+Leaderboards for when you want to show up your friends.+When an orc cries out for it's mommy whilest getting sucked into a grinder (does this make me a bad person?).Cons:-The weekly challenges are often either stupidly hard or impossible by yourself, and i've 5-skulled everything.-""Crunch"" (Level) - Maybe this level was a bit too hard to 5 skull on nightmare mode (especially solo).-The 'pros' list is too long.Seriously, even if you don't have a friend to play it with, it's still awesome; get it.Just watching hoards of orcs mindlessly run into your chaotic and unavoidable traps would make anyone's day.

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a game that you will pick up and play with the intention of only playing for half and hour and still be there a considerable time later. With the added bonus of multiplayer co-op, there are plenty of trap variances and unlockable upgrades that will leave you wanting to try different strategies to kill those Orcs.There are also plenty of levels and different types of enemy to keep this game fresh into Nightmare mode! The only downside is a lack of story or boss levels that put your skills (and your traps) to the test!			"

												One of the best tower defense game I've ever played! Orcs Must Die: 2 is extremely fun. The story is nothing to be surprised, at first I thought the game would get repetitive in a few minutes played. Well, that didn't happen. The co-op is great to play with friends if you have any. If you're a loser like me and have no friends, then you can play single player pretending there is another person playing with you and liking you for who you are, though it can make you schizophrenic after some time playing that way. The sad part is when you go back to real life and realise you were playing by yourself with no friends because you don't have one. Then, my friend, all you have left is loneliness, tears and porn. 9/10 great game. It would be even better if I had a friend to play along with me.			"

												This has to be one of the best Tower Defense games I've ever bought & played! The only problem is that theres is a lot of orcs - orcs that MUST die! 10/108/8/15 UpdateHere's a more descriptive view on the game, but a short one. Orcs Must Die! 2 is a sequel to the original, bringing us more gorey ways in destroying the one-sided army of the bloodthirsted Orcs. In protecting each given stronghold, given many traps and trinkets to fend them off in any given way possible to your imagination. All the while, progressing through the story of fending off the last strongholds against the growing threat.Anyways, I loved the game from the start, being able to choose different routes and ways to take each level, all the while, being competitive to take the first place within your Friend Leaderboard to show you were the best one to make a route crazy enough to be that well, in the first place. While with DLC to offer you more ways to slay them all down, there isn't a way to truly put a stop the Orc's, as they just keep coming, until their prepared army is scaled down to nothing but dust. Strategies has and always will be present, in progressing through the game itself.			"

												Like tower defense games? Enjoy watching orcs ragdoll across the screen after being launched by a trap to hurtle onwards to the waiting lava / bottomless pit / acid bath? Great!Two characters, a large arsenal of weapons, many zany traps, accessories, and a few good men (archers, paladins, and grumpy dwarves) stand between the orc hordes and the exit. Grab your traps because... Orcs Must Die!			"

												Orcs Must Die! 2 (or ""Orcs 2""/""OMD2"") is an odd amalgamation of third-person action and tower defense.  This creates a very fun and interesting mixture of gameplay that can be balanced at the player's discretion.  The basic format of the game is this:You have a portal or sometimes multiple portals which must be protected from waves of enemies of increasing difficulty.  The portal has a set number assigned to it that goes down if you die or enemies enter it.  If and when that number reaches zero, it's GAME OVER!At the very start, you choose between two characters, who each have access to certain weapons and traps and shout of their own cheeky one-liners:Warmage - A very balanced character with about the same amount of health and mana.  Definitely made for those who prefer to get up close and personal with their enemies.Sorceress - A character designed for those who'd rather set up traps and guardians and snipe at enemies with ranged attacks.  The Sorceress has almost double the mana as the warmage, but at the cost of having almost half the health. Once you pick a character, it's time to choose your loadout of items and tools to protect your portal:- Traps - Good old-fashioned traps act like towers in any other tower defense game.  Most activate by themselves and have a recharge.  Some are a little different, but most fit this description.  There is a wide variety of traps to choose from with countless different effects.- Guardians - Guardians are living beings which you summon to help protect the portal.  They are very much like traps in that they automatically attack enemies, but they are different in that they can move around, do not have a recharge timer, and can die.  They can, however, be revived.- Weapons - These are what throw the third-person action elements into the mix.  Weapons, while not quite as plentiful as traps, do have a wide variety.  Each weapon has a primary attack which costs nothing and can be used over and over, as well as a secondary attack which uses up mana.  Those who have played the Elder Scrolls should be familiar with how mana (magicka or stamina) works.- Trinkets - These are similar to weapons in that you carry them on your person, but they are different in that they play a more supportive role than an offensive one.You must use a balance of these four tools to defend your portal against seemingly-endless hordes of trolls, gnolls, ogres, and - of course - orcs!  The variety of enemies is just as vast as the variety of counters you have waiting for them.Inside of each level you collect gold to buy traps and guardians.  You gain the gold by killing enemies and collecting coins that are dropped by certain enemies for bonus gold.  At the end of each level, you are awarded with orc skulls depending on how well you did.  You use these skulls to unlock and upgrade new weapons, traps, guardians, and trinkets.  You can also buy a few (and I mean only a FEW) outfits for your character to wear as well.The game modes themselves are not all that diverse, but they get the job done.  You have your basic campaign made up of about 30 levels (give or take) with a pretty mediocre storyline.  Then there's the ""Endless"" mode which is not really endless as it has only 50 waves, but it sure seems endless as you find yourself constantly in a race to keep up with the increasingly difficult enemies.  You can also try out several DLC maps as well as the weekly challenge map, which has you play as a specific character with a pre-defined loadout on a certain map to see how long you can last.All-in-all, this is a great game for the price and can be very addicting.  The challenge is through the roof at times and you must be prepared to lose, if only to learn your mistakes and try again.  This game is fantastic in singleplayer, but it's an absolute blast in co-op.  What's better than singlehandedly taking on the beastly orc hordes?  Why, taking on the beastly orc hordes with a buddy, of course!  If you're a fan of mixing tower defense and third-person action, then get this game!			"

												This is by the far the best tower defense game out there. Not only is it tower defense, it is first person with multiplayer! Orcs Must Die! 2 is definitely much better than Orcs Must Die! 1. There is multiplayer, tons of added maps, loads more traps, trinkets, and customization! There is a lot to do in this game, including campaign, nightmare campaign, and endless modes for nightmare and regular. The DLC is great, adding more traps and maps, and I highly suggest it. Overall, this game is great, and a good buy, worth every cent of it!			"

												Oh man, I got this on impulse on sale. I gave it a whirl and... became addicted. Why? Well, throwing Orks all over the place is kind of fun, but besides, it's all about doing better and finding ever more fiendishly clever ways of killing them pesky Orks and Ogers. And Goblins. There's a million and one ways of doing the deed in question. Now, this isn't a great review, I know, but I've gotten most of my online contacts to get it. They also liked it alot. Then I discovered coop. It's not a hard-core game, that's sure, but that's the point of a game, it's FUN, it's like playing Super Mario Bros for the first time, it's simple, it's straight forward, it's got no plot twists and it's got no gimicks. It's just pure straight foward fun. Also, the voice acting, although not extensive, makes for some funny moments. Try it, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're looking for a game that you can pick up, play for an hour or so and then do something else and not regret wasting your time, then I would wager that this is the game for you.

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a brilliant successor to the first. There are so many new levels, traps, trinkets, and a new character in addition to the levels from the first game added on. All of that plus the DLC for an extremely low cost makes this game worth the $10 you will spend on a Steam sale. Infact, I bought this game full price and I have no regret.The newly added cooperative play makes the playability of this game extremely high. There is always something to achieve whether that be the actual achievements or simply personal targets in-game. The time it takes to 5-skull every level on story mode and endless mode is long so there is no shortage of game content.Many reviews I see on here under the ""only negative"" category are complaints about issues I have not seen. Once you get a friend to play with, this game is endlessly fun.The only issue I have ever had with this game is a single broken achievement.10/10. Will definitely buy the next iteration.			"

												I suppose how much someone might enjoy OMD2 really depends on if they have a co-op partner.  This game was designed with the idea that you'd be playing co-op.  That doesn't mean you can't play it single player (and the game gives you more inventory slots for traps, weapons and trinkets if you do), but it's a lonely experience.  Even the campaign assumes you'll play co-op, as both characters -- the War Mage and the Sorceress -- converse during the game.That said, if you do have a co-op partner (my wife is mine), then this game is an absolutel blast!  OMD2 successfully mixes strategy (tower defense), action and some wacky humor, so the game never gets dull or takes itself too seriously.  How you play depends on you.  You could rely more on traps or weapons or even trinkets, although the latter do more to augment gameplay than anything else.  Some weapons and traps are better than others on some maps, so you have to be able to adapt to your surroundings. If you own the original OMD you get ten maps from the original game to play in OMD2.  Although this is a cool idea, thanking those who've supported the developer, some of the levels aren't new to OMD2 and others don't work extremely well with some of the newer traps.The newest addition to OMD2 is the toolkit, which lets you create or edit weapons, traps and trinkets.  You can also download items other people have made from the Steam Workshop. Bottom line:  If you see OMD2 on sale, grab it!  Even at it's normal price, it's still a good deal.  I'd also recommend checking out the developer's website (Robot Entertainment) as they sometimes have deals themselves, which is where my wife and I got our discounted copies.  Don't worry, you get a Steam key.			"

												Tower Defense elements packed around a tense TPS brawler, in a stage-based game with a fair amount of progression and no less customization than necessary.The achievements and public+friend Highscores beg to be dominated, arrange a friendlist competition and you'll lose track of time!Co-Op is smooth and intuitive, there's an ingame chat to discuss trap placement and general strategy.The only thing I see as a downside is that trap placement grids on levels in this sequel are often uneven and give far less freedom than in the original. That may simply be a rough balancing attempt, it's tolerable if not unnoticable.			"

												Tower Defense elements packed around a tense TPS brawler, in a stage-based game with a fair amount of progression and no less customization than necessary.The achievements and public+friend Highscores beg to be dominated, arrange a friendlist competition and you'll lose track of time!Co-Op is smooth and intuitive, there's an ingame chat to discuss trap placement and general strategy.The only thing I see as a downside is that trap placement grids on levels in this sequel are often uneven and give far less freedom than in the original. That may simply be a rough balancing attempt, it's tolerable if not unnoticable.			"

												In general, this is just like the first game, but with a more fleshed out upgrade system and the addition of the much requested co-op mode.However, as someone who five-skulled all Nightmare levels from the first game, I found there to be a massive difficulty spike towards the end of the campaign in this sequel. You can tell how much the developers emphasized designing with co-op in mind, as you're playing levels that seemingly require you to be in four different places at once.It's still an enjoyable (albeit overly challenging) game if you're playing it solo.

												One great co-up game.This game is a trapsetter and a 3.person shother in one.The game is a sequal to the last title named orcs must die.The game is designed so you get a lot of traps and other kind of things you can set down, you put them down, and then a horde of orcs will come against you. This means you have to shot the ones, that makes it through your baricats and taps. This makes the gameplay very fun, since the game has this changes of gameplay from time to time. You can chosse between to charecters, the warmage and the sorccere. The warmage is based on attacking with a gun, that will do a lot of damage to the orponent. The sorccere can mindcontrole enemys, and therefore win time, or do big damage, by mindcontroling big enemyes. The game`s story is not really important, and you don`t really pay attetnion to it. Normally I would say this is a bad thing. But for a game like this, story is not really anthing you want. You want to progress fast, and the game is very good at doing this.When the orcs come out, the waves becomes bigger, and the enemyes more tough. This accualy makes the game very hard at times. I higly recormend to play this with a friend. The game is fun when you play alone, but still, the game has more potentiol as a co-up game. I have played through the whole game with a friend of mien, and I can tell you, we loved every single secound of it. This game is a very great game, and a very well co-up game.

												One of the best tower defense game I've ever played! Orcs Must Die: 2 is extremely fun. The story is nothing to be surprised, at first I thought the game would get repetitive in a few minutes played. Well, that didn't happen. The co-op is great to play with friends if you have any. If you're a loser like me and have no friends, then you can play single player pretending there is another person playing with you and liking you for who you are, though it can make you schizophrenic after some time playing that way. The sad part is when you go back to real life and realise you were playing by yourself with no friends because you don't have one. Then, my friend, all you have left is loneliness, tears and porn. 9/10 great game. It would be even better if I had a friend to play along with me.			"

												Very well made blend of tower-defense and third-person action. Orcs Must Die 2 kept most of the traps and skills from the first game (apart from the Weavers) and added tons more. The same levels can be done using different strategies, so there is a lot of replayability. All levels are solo-able, though they do take some planning, experimenting and multi-tasking. Co-op mode is easier and a lot more fun! Recommended to any tower-defense lover!			"

												Fans of the original game will find OMD2 mostly enjoyable. The gameplay mechanics are identical, but there are lots of new traps, weapons and avatar buffs, all of which have several upgrades to select. There are also a couple of new orc types. The result is even more tactical depth and playing style diversity. Story mode seems a bit short compared to OMD1, but replayability is extended by the game type called Endless, where the objective is to survive as many waves as possible before you get overrun. And then there's coop mode, but this isn't necessarily a good thing. Some of the maps seem to be specifically designed for two players, with far too many orcs coming from too many directions for one player to cover all at once. This makes some maps frustrating to play, even after hours of grinding Endless for enough skulls to fully upgrade your traps. I don't mind difficult games, but OMD2 at times simply feels unfair to solo players. Overall though OMD2 is still worth playing.			"

I must say: Best Tower Defense game ever. Solo is a hugh challenge at some point but definatly fun to figure out what to do. I advise you to buy this game, it gets a 10/10 from me. "

												It's the sequel to Orcs Must Die! Here comes more orc-slaughtering mayhem at its absolute finest! This iteration has better graphics, more refined & compelling strategy, genuinely creative & exciting maps, and waaaay more delicious, delicious unlockables than the original (the hunger for skulls will be extreme - you've been warned!). There are several DLC packs now available which do an admirable job of forcing you to develop new killing techniques and motivating you to persist in slicing & dicing orcs (along with the newly added enemies) in order to earn yet more skulls which (as in the first game) are the currency with which you purchase new items and upgrades.The crown jewel of this genocidal romp... The area where it *really* shines is, without a doubt, the co-op multi-player. This game has provided me with the most fun I've ever had with other players here on Steam. Grab this game (and all the DLC!) for yourself and a good friend, hop onto a Ventrilo or Teamspeak server and you absolutely won't regret the gore-soaked results. Best played with a 360 controller (in my opinion anyway; though a certain Aussie friend of mine insists that mouse/keyboard control is the way to go) and an unquenchable thirst for chaos on an orc-pocalyptic scale. Yeah, I said it. I went there. I regret nothing!			"

												Super fun and addictive Third person tower defense game, made even better with the co-operative aspect of the game.Both characters play differently with different starting weapons and a couple unique traps....and of course there is loads to do from the range of main game levels (about 20), DLC levels (should you choose to buy them; 3 levels each), endless mode (a few) and classic levels (if you have the first game purchased; 10 levels)Pros:+Super fun and well-polished gameplay/animations.+Massive range of traps, trinkets, weapons etc. ALL with upgrades.+Great range of maps, some easy and some painfully hard.+Improves on the first game majorly, great sequel!+Solo and co-op options (can do a playthrough with a mixture).+Fantastic soundtrack.+Nightmare Mode for when the first playthrough was too easy.+Spring traps...seriously, they fling enemies all around the place.+Leaderboards for when you want to show up your friends.+When an orc cries out for it's mommy whilest getting sucked into a grinder (does this make me a bad person?).Cons:-The weekly challenges are often either stupidly hard or impossible by yourself, and i've 5-skulled everything.-""Crunch"" (Level) - Maybe this level was a bit too hard to 5 skull on nightmare mode (especially solo).-The 'pros' list is too long.Seriously, even if you don't have a friend to play it with, it's still awesome; get it.Just watching hoards of orcs mindlessly run into your chaotic and unavoidable traps would make anyone's day.

												Orcs Must Die 2 continues right where 1 left off. The much-awaited multiplayer experience is here, but this review will be from a single-player standpoint.To start with, you get to pick between the Warmage and the Sorceress. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, but the Warmage simply feels easier to play with due to his superior health, superior tar trap, and arguably superior weapon. The Sorceress is better for charming single, large targets though, and her acid trap does more damage than the Warmage's Arrow Trap.Gameplay is more or less the same. If you played OMD1, this will all be familiar. The Elementalist girls are gone, which is a shame. This change means that you have less options to adjust to your enemies in the middle of a level. Fortunately any upgrades you purchased prior to battle can be reset at no cost. Autoballistae are now considered guardians, which means you can no longer spam them. I was sad about that as well.Amazingly they made the Gnolls more irritating. They seem to have more HP, run faster (both probably untrue, but it feels like it), and can now slow you upon hitting you, making escape impossible. A whole pack of them, especially in Endless mode (see below), will ruin your day.I'm rather disappointed that the campaign is so short. The first game took maybe 15-20 hours to complete, and had a good progression. OMD2 instead took me a mere 10 hours on normal difficulty. Granted, I already knew the basics of the game, but this was far shorter than I expected. DLC's extend the game's length a bit, but they contain no story segments, and thus you are basically playing for skulls (the game's peristent currency) and variety. Note that you'll have to play through Campaign again with another character if you want stuff unlocked on both characters.Endless mode is interesting. Waves come indefinitely and keep getting tougher until you can no longer handle it, much like Survival mode in other types of games. This mode by far is the biggest time-sink, though you are rewarded with plenty of skulls to compensate.If you like the first game and want a way to play it with friends, then OMD2 is the way to go. Overall it's an acceptable game. I still recommend the first game though.			"

Very well executed, genuine graphics, nothing of negative critique.(8/10) Strategy could be put into setting the traps up which makes it more enjoyable to slay those pesky orcs. There's a high variety of traps, all of them provide a good versitility to the orc fighting. There could be more weapons and traps but there is plenty. All of which are enjoyable to use. Co-op works like a charm. Multiplayer would've been astonishing but it's still good.  There is a workshop which is kind of dead. Anyone can hop in without any pre-knowledge and win. I recommend it.

Very well executed, genuine graphics, nothing of negative critique.(8/10) Strategy could be put into setting the traps up which makes it more enjoyable to slay those pesky orcs. There's a high variety of traps, all of them provide a good versitility to the orc fighting. There could be more weapons and traps but there is plenty. All of which are enjoyable to use. Co-op works like a charm. Multiplayer would've been astonishing but it's still good.  There is a workshop which is kind of dead. Anyone can hop in without any pre-knowledge and win. I recommend it.

												I am a fan of tower defense games, but OMD!2 really takes it to another level.  The addition of co-op from the first game makes for hours of entertainment and strategy as each player can focus on one type of play-style or you can both wade in and start smashing orcs! There is a lot of replayability here too; finishing the level isn't enough as you're going to want to earn a better score or beat the game on Nightmare.  I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes the tower defense genre!			"

												Orcs Must Die 2 is the sequel to Orcs Must Die (obviously) and as lazy as it sounds I would recommend reading my review of that because this game is essentially the same again. Not that that's a bad thing! The formula works, hell in this one they even improved a few things.This time you can choose between 2 characters to play as, the apprentice or the antagonist from the previous game. Each of the characters has their strengths and weaknesses, the apprentice carries on as he did before but now gives you the choice of crossbow, blunderbuss. The crossbow being the same as the last game and the blunderbuss causing far more damage but having a much longer reload time. The sorceress has less health than the apprentice but more mana and she can control a Orc and make him fight the others for a short period. As well as that some of the starting traps are different depending on which you choose as well as a few unlockables later.Speaking of traps there are some new ones, all of which are entertaining to see unfold, the levels also sometimes have environmental traps built in which you can take advantage of.This time there are far more unlockables to collect, costumes that change your abilities, rings and trinkets to enhance the way you play and of course the upgrades.Like the first game it's repetitive as hell, but what do you expect? And also like the first it's difficulty seems to ramp up out of nowhere.I recommend this game to those who have either played the first and want more of the same. If your new to the series... Well start here. It's a better game really, since it's the first one plus extras.I'd say Â£11.99 is a little steep though considering the first is essentially the same minus a few parts. See if you can find it a bit cheaper or on a sale. Anything below Â£10 is a bargain really.			"

												This has to be one of the best Tower Defense games I've ever bought & played! The only problem is that theres is a lot of orcs - orcs that MUST die! 10/108/8/15 UpdateHere's a more descriptive view on the game, but a short one. Orcs Must Die! 2 is a sequel to the original, bringing us more gorey ways in destroying the one-sided army of the bloodthirsted Orcs. In protecting each given stronghold, given many traps and trinkets to fend them off in any given way possible to your imagination. All the while, progressing through the story of fending off the last strongholds against the growing threat.Anyways, I loved the game from the start, being able to choose different routes and ways to take each level, all the while, being competitive to take the first place within your Friend Leaderboard to show you were the best one to make a route crazy enough to be that well, in the first place. While with DLC to offer you more ways to slay them all down, there isn't a way to truly put a stop the Orc's, as they just keep coming, until their prepared army is scaled down to nothing but dust. Strategies has and always will be present, in progressing through the game itself.			"

												The first time I saw the title of this game, I thought to myself. ""Yes yes... orcs MUST DIE"" and having a 2 next to it indicated to me that it would double the holocaust of orcs by my hand. Why I hate orcs so much you might? When i was a level 10 human warrior just minding my own business in Goldshire Tavern he showed up andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥everyone even my bestfriend Saurion, he had to have 36 stitches in his â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I vowed from that day to have my vengeance and this game would be the reaper of their souls. I began to fap vigorously for hours to build up the adrenaline to fight the orc hordes, everything was going well until the gnoll hunters came out of nowhere slapping all of my archers one by one, and they were lead by no other than Hogger my arch nemesis... While trying to kill gnolls below westbrook garrison he chased, beat, and violated me multiple times until I was able to crawl to Westfall and heal my wounds. Then i spammed 50 paladins and theyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥everything gg wp commend me.			"

												i know its a cardinal sin to recommend a tower defense game at any cost, but Orcs Must Die 2 is easily the best and most personal tower defense game i've ever played. At higher difficulties it definitely does feel like a tower defense game where you can't do anything but hope to god that your traps can get rid of everything fast enough, but the ability to run around and mess with things as the game runs is a real game-changerso yes for $4 its worth getting, go for it, buy the two-pack, have urself a good time			"

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a hilarious and entertaining third person tower defence. Use a combination of weapons, magic and traps to kill endless hordes of dimwitted orcs. It is co-op based but can easily be played solo. It is not a necessity to play the first game, however the game play is almost identical.This game is without a doubt, one of my most favourite games of all time.			"

												Hello guys, The Quick Brown Fox here.Well i have to something to say about this game, first it's cool to play with your friend or solo. You can have fun with in-game voice chat system. Quality of the graphics is good and the engine is fast enough to get excited. But it has cons.- In endless game mode after 35-40th waves is really hard to play. You have to be pro or practiced for days to pass it.- Its really bad to you can only play with 2 players. It could be fun with 4 players.- Needs really good teamwork. You have to really practice it with your mate / just troll the game and have your fun with x2 multiplier. Its up to you.This review ends in there. Hope you guys see you in another review. Have fun.

												Gotta hankering for mass murdering orc's while they charge linear paths and try to kill you and your nexus? lol Well buy this game. Its kinda one of those games you can just pick up and put down and always come back. The leaderboards are a nice addition if you're feeling competitive with friends or online players. I recommend playing with a friend tho lol. Just makes it much more fun and better time investment.core game play is simple. Kill X waves of enemies get gold spend on a Large verity of traps to stop the enemy dead in their tracks!  You'll find out soon that each new level gets a bit more difficult and always has a twist. Either new paths for the enemy or a new type. Flying , Elemental , Troll, or special unit with unique aspect.The starting levels are pretty simple but later planning and resource management will be a thing. But its always fun to retry for that perfect score. :)Buy it and have a good time with a friend totally worth it. :)			"

												I got this game on a good sale with most of the dlc included, so here's my review.Great game, lots of fun with a friend.I gotta be honest I had bought Orcs Must Die (the first game) and I just could never get into the game, but this game has improved in alot of ways and the online CO-OP brings it to a whole new lvl- highly recommended ;) !Basically the idea of this game is simple, but the execution is not ;) .The goal of the game is to stop the baddies (mostly orcs, thus the game's name) from reaching the ending points once they spawn at starting points.Easy enough right?  Wrong =p plenty of enemy types, and lot and lots of them.  And how you go about attacking them is totally up to you and the tools you choose to get the job done.There are various different traps, helpers (guardians), trinkets (like armor pieces), and weapons you can equip and upgrade via skulls you earn from how you do on each lvl you play through, fun process and makes it have something to work towards ;) ; rewarding to say the least.Even at full price I'd can whole heartedly recommend this game, the dlc on other hand I'm not totally sure of yet, b/c most of the dlc was included in the pack I bought, so hard for me to judge the bang for buck on the dlc.Fun game though.

												Quick Summary: Orcs Must Die 2 is the co-op follow-up to the original game and while there are changes in maps and some of the traps, the core gameplay is the same. This is a good thing because the first Orcs Must Die is awesome, and only lacked the ability to play with your friends.Spoilers AheadIf youâve played the first Orcs Must Die recently you will remember that at the end, the war mage (you) closed the rifts into the orc world and trapped the evil sorceress on the other side with her minions. Closing the rifts had the side effect of making magic unusable, so the power she had over the orcs is gone, and now they want her dead. In this sequel, one last rift is opened by an old wise wizard (presumed dead in the first game) and the sorceress has escaped being chased by her former orcs. Itâs team up time, and the war mage must work with the sorceress to stop the hordes of orcs from breaking through the rift into the human world. This time around you can choose which character to play the game as: war mage or sorceress. Mostly theyâre the same but each has a couple of traps unique to them.  For example the war mage has the tar trap (one of the best floor traps) and the sorceress has the acid spray wall trap (decent against heavy enemies). Consensus seems to be that war mage is better overall. I played the sorceress and had fun with the polymorph ring against the super heavy enemies.Just like the first Orcs Must Die, the game is broken up into a series of independent map levels, and every level you start from scratch setting up traps and barricades to kill all the orcs before they reach the rift (or rifts). Itâs a hybrid tower defense/third person shooter, so youâre in the thick of the action, blasting enemies along with your traps, or mopping up the ones who manage to break past. Every level you beat gives you âskullsâ which are currency to buy upgrades for traps or unlock new spells/traps. Unlike the first game, you can replay levels over and over to farm skulls and eventually buy every upgrade. Pros:+Co-op campaign! You can play every level with a friend. This along with the skull farming adds a lot of replayability to the campaign.+Pretty much everything good in the first game is still there, including maps for the first game. You can play the âclassic levelsâ with the new traps and sorceress character.Cons:-The âendless modeâ gets buggy as you get to higher levels. Maybe itâs my computer but it really started to lag around wave 35. It actually crashed for me a couple times.Overall, if you liked Orcs Must Die 1, you should like part 2. Theyâre basically the same game with added improvements, options, and levels for the sequel.  "

												This game really rocks :)  I can recommend this game as 'must have' title.It is true, that design of levels is mostly created for two players, but this is simply the feature for me, not the bug.This is addicting orc mass murder simulator.			"

												While you could argue that this game is simply the first with co-op slapped in, that is by no means a bad thing. The first game was really fun and this one is pretty much the same with some new toys to play with, a few new enemies to slaughter, and the option to do it all with a friend. This game is also playable solo though if you don't have a buddy. Like the first game, the dialog and animations are quite funny. It mostly reuses music from the first game, but the music is really good so I'm not complaining. Basically, a ""it wasn't broke, so we didn't fix it"" sequel... with a pal.			"

												If you haved played the first orcs must die you will love this, and even people who haven't! As soon as you start shooting orcs in the face and impaling them with spikes you will rember the fun you had playing the first one! Also with the new multiplayer you can play with your friends! Orcs must die 2 also intruduces a new female character, The Sorceress, who can charm enemies with her magic wand. Personally I think she's a great addition to the game!So If you like strategy games and third person shooters, buy it its a good game! "

												Hello guys, The Quick Brown Fox here.Well i have to something to say about this game, first it's cool to play with your friend or solo. You can have fun with in-game voice chat system. Quality of the graphics is good and the engine is fast enough to get excited. But it has cons.- In endless game mode after 35-40th waves is really hard to play. You have to be pro or practiced for days to pass it.- Its really bad to you can only play with 2 players. It could be fun with 4 players.- Needs really good teamwork. You have to really practice it with your mate / just troll the game and have your fun with x2 multiplier. Its up to you.This review ends in there. Hope you guys see you in another review. Have fun.

												My only complaint about this awesome sequel is that the main campaign is blatantly unfinished, lasting only 15 levels over the previous gameâs 24, and going out on somewhat of a whimper. Act 3 is completely missing, and most of the new monsters only appear in the skimpy DLC with 3 levels each, no voice acting and no story included. But instead of an Act 3, we got a new playable character with a different tech tree, ONLINE CO-OP, a staggeringly large armory of weapons, an endless mode with over a dozen maps, a new dwarven mines setting with awesome environmental hazards which half the game takes place in, a unique challenge level that cycles every week, about a dozen maps from the first game (if you own it on Steam), 3 DLC packs with freaky new monsters and good weapons, and Steam Workshop integration so you can play with mods you like. Also included are many very welcome interface changes, such as not having to pick your weapons again every time you restart a level, and a set-up break before Nightmare levels. A very fun, very worthy sequel that expands and improves upon the original. Have fun earning thousands of skulls to purchase all the upgradesâ¦ and then do it all over again with the other character! Itâll keep you busy for a long time. But enjoy it while it lasts, because OMD3 is a free-to-play League of Legends clone. (Ughâ¦ why??!!)			"

												The first time I saw the title of this game, I thought to myself. ""Yes yes... orcs MUST DIE"" and having a 2 next to it indicated to me that it would double the holocaust of orcs by my hand. Why I hate orcs so much you might? When i was a level 10 human warrior just minding my own business in Goldshire Tavern he showed up andâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥everyone even my bestfriend Saurion, he had to have 36 stitches in his â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I vowed from that day to have my vengeance and this game would be the reaper of their souls. I began to fap vigorously for hours to build up the adrenaline to fight the orc hordes, everything was going well until the gnoll hunters came out of nowhere slapping all of my archers one by one, and they were lead by no other than Hogger my arch nemesis... While trying to kill gnolls below westbrook garrison he chased, beat, and violated me multiple times until I was able to crawl to Westfall and heal my wounds. Then i spammed 50 paladins and theyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥everything gg wp commend me.			"

												Honestly, I was skeptical about this game, just watching people play on youtube. My friend kinda coaxed me into getting it, and it's probably the most amazing game I've played in a long time! The game is a bit short, but does provide lots of replay ability through the different modes OMD2 incorporates. This game can get a little monotonous at times, but when playing with a friend it can provide hours of entertainment. ~Pros~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1.) Enemies are fun and make the game challenging at points; A fair amount of the enemies in this game are unique, and have different weaknesses, attacks and strategies. It makes for interesting gameplay!2.) Ragdolls are wonderful; When aren't orcs flying through the air into a wall funny?3.) Replayability is good; The game doesn't make you start over when finished, and gives the ability to reset the skulls you put into your traps and weapons, allowing you to try new things. OMD2 also gives a harder version of the campaign, and a mode called endless; which is basically just play until you lose. 4.) Great customization; I'm mainly talking about the traps here. Each trap has 2 different abilities to it, but you can only choose one. There are lots of different combos you can perform by tweaking at the abilities of your traps.5.) Differentiation between characters; The sorcerer and war mage are not entirely the same, and have different traps as well as weapons, allowing the player to choose their play style.~Cons~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1.) Online seems barren; Ihaven't seen anyone online, so this game can get lonely without a friend.2.) Traps sell for the same as they were bought; I wouldn't really list this as a con, it's more in the middle of the both. When you buy a trap, at any point in the game you can sell it for the exact amount of money. With certain overpowered traps this can become slightly game breaking, and tends to remove the challenge in some occasions. However it's great in the fact that you can remove it and replace it somewhere else. I constantly misclick xD so for me this is great. 3.) Seems like an addition to the first game rather than a sequel; I think most people could agree, this game kinda seems like an adaptation of the first one.Overall, this is a fantastic game, I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't bought it yet, and is thinking of doing so :)  "

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a hilarious and entertaining third person tower defence. Use a combination of weapons, magic and traps to kill endless hordes of dimwitted orcs. It is co-op based but can easily be played solo. It is not a necessity to play the first game, however the game play is almost identical.This game is without a doubt, one of my most favourite games of all time.			"

												This Game is soo nice and COOP is realy good,but the Name is unfortunenate.People may think its like a low budget twinstick shooter.But in real its a deep tactical Game,the placement of the Traps decide the Battle,and the Traps must be combined in a Clever way its not just ""build alot of Traps to deal alot of Damage"".The Traps have different Prices and you have far more Traps than you can put into your Spellbook for use.When selecting your Traps and Items you can also see what Items your Partner has.There more Cheap Items which for example slow a enemy down,or expensive ones which for example sucks enemys into a grinder.Traps are classified in Floor,Wall and Ceiling Traps.With Barricades you can controll which direction the Enemys will go,as long as there is a open way they wont attack the Barricades,so you can guide Enemys coming from 3 different locations into 1 Bottleeck where your Traps await them.The Traps realy must be placed in a thougtfull way its not about spamming damage.After Battle you earn Skulls,which are used to unlock new Traps and upgrade existing Traps.You also have Trinkets and Weapons to unlock and upgrade.This Game is realy realy good and it still has a nice Community.You wont have Problems finding COOP Partners there is a big Forum pinned Post for it too.I posted 1x and instantly had like 10 friend Requests.The Studio making the Game is atm working on Orcs must Die Unchained which will be a Free to Play MOBA Game.There is the possibility to buy a Founders Pack for Ors must die Unchained for 15 Euros.It contains entry ino the Closed Beta and contains stuff worth 45 Euros.INCLUDING 1 KEY  FOR ORCS MUST DIE FRANCHISE PACKThat means when you spend the 15 Euros on a Founders Packyou get acces to closed Beta,premium Currency worth 15 Euros,Skins,Charackters and Stuff AND ORCS MUST DIE 1 and ORCS MUST DIE 2 INCLUDING ALL DLCSo when you wanna buy Orcs must die 2 you wanna consider buying a Founders Pack for Orcs must die Unchained.My Personal Rating is 88% Gamefun,very good and solid Game Mechanics.And im no Fan of Tower Defense at all,you dont have to like Tower Defense to like Orcs must Die 2 ita totaly different			"

												At the time of this posting, Orcs Must Die 2 is 90% off; That's less than $2!Orcs Must Die 2 is a tower defence game that puts equal emphasis on the player and the traps he/she places, as in one cannot win without the other on the harder difficulties. You can choose the 4-8 traps, weapons, and utilities you use at the beginning of each round, and upgrade them too. The upgrade system allows you to choose one of two unique stat buffs / extra abilities, and gives an additional aspect to modify your items each round. There is a lot of clicking involved for some personal items (especially the sorceress's Staff of Domination). Co-op is also an aspect which, in my opinion, enhances the experience to a degree; However, the game can be completed entirely alone.The OST is most noticable during the beginning of the waves, and the last wave, where it conveys the chaos taking place when the late-game waves start throwing hundreds of orcs, imps, golems and trolls at you. Orcs Must Die 2 definately has some charm to it's presentation.Overall, I think it's a no brainer to pick it up on sale, as it provided me with a good 20 or so hours of fun (though I did not complete all DLC maps)			"

However, I probably would have not bought this at full price (25% reason being that I'm poor).The game itself is great. A tower defense+FPS with funny dialouge and great graphics. Very fun game. My only complaint about this is the mouse. The mouse sensitivity is quite high which can be annoying. It gets annoying trying to turn the other way and somehow the the screen makes a 360. With that being said, the aiming can get tough too, especially trying to shoot the fast runners. Swing your cursor to fast, you're gonna miss the target. Swing it slow, you're gonna miss the target. Other than that, great game, and very well worth the price on sale.			"

												You ever have one of those games where you wish they would continue on and on forever.  That is this game.  The tightly programmed gameplay, 3d physics engine is perfect for what this game is for.  I wish they would've continued onto creating this as an MMO, dungeon runs, as I instantly fell in love with the characters, and the manners in which you can wreak havoc on the enemies.  If you read this from the future, resurrect this game engine, and characters and create more varieties other than just a tower defense game, people will love it.			"

												Saw this on sale and I say ""Hey, there is a demo too. Why not?"". After a few minutes and some test runs later I already had the full game. Played a few games with the warmage and after a while I decided to give a try to the sorceress class. And this is what I heard:""Ooh! So many at once""""Yes! Yes!""""Aah.. yes!""""Oh Delicious!""""More! More!""And you combine those lines with this skin:

Well.. you know...( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)Ha! But for real now. The game it's a solid ""Tower"" Defense game (with a nice twist), a third person action game and also has nice rpg elements in it (like unlocking new traps, weapons, upgrades and so on). Also the sense of humour it's a nice touch and well done overall, I just wish there were more lines or voice acting between the 2 main characters. Yeah I know, you are here for the killing but the interaction and presentation of the game really got me hooked and wanted to know even more about the story and characters.The game has coop, and some modes to keep things fresh but I'm having a blast with endless mode for the moment. Oh, and the game has steamworkshop built in so that's a nice plus too. I only wish there were more sorceress skins over there.. yeah.. Very good game and addictive too. Give it a try.			"

												Hello guys, The Quick Brown Fox here.Well i have to something to say about this game, first it's cool to play with your friend or solo. You can have fun with in-game voice chat system. Quality of the graphics is good and the engine is fast enough to get excited. But it has cons.- In endless game mode after 35-40th waves is really hard to play. You have to be pro or practiced for days to pass it.- Its really bad to you can only play with 2 players. It could be fun with 4 players.- Needs really good teamwork. You have to really practice it with your mate / just troll the game and have your fun with x2 multiplier. Its up to you.This review ends in there. Hope you guys see you in another review. Have fun.

												While you could argue that this game is simply the first with co-op slapped in, that is by no means a bad thing. The first game was really fun and this one is pretty much the same with some new toys to play with, a few new enemies to slaughter, and the option to do it all with a friend. This game is also playable solo though if you don't have a buddy. Like the first game, the dialog and animations are quite funny. It mostly reuses music from the first game, but the music is really good so I'm not complaining. Basically, a ""it wasn't broke, so we didn't fix it"" sequel... with a pal.			"

As soon as you start shooting orcs in the face and impaling them with spikes you will rember the fun you had playing the first one! Also with the new multiplayer you can play with your friends! Orcs must die 2 also intruduces a new female character, The Sorceress, who can charm enemies with her magic wand. Personally I think she's a great addition to the game!So If you like strategy games and third person shooters, buy it its a good game! "

												An interesting FPS Tower Defense game. Light hearted and witty commentary and voice lines. Unique story and easy/challenging levels of gameplay for both novice and experts alike. The Graphics are beautiful and have a very 'Team Fortress 2' look and feel to them. I've logged over 70 hours in this game and have gotten every achievement and I still have new maps to play, new weapons to use and different strategies to implement. I definitely recommend this game as it's hours of fun for you and a friend (if you wish). Regardless of what way you like to play, up close and personal, or further back and let all your traps do the work, this game can cater to you. But whatever method you choose to use, just remember... THESE ORCS MUST DIE!			"

They balanced this solely for co-op play.If you're buying this to play with another player? Good. Do it. But if you're buying it for solo play, I wouldn't.			"

												For sure a wonderful game! It brings a lot of fun to a concept I havent seen done this well in a long time. The game pits you against angry mobs of orcs and other mythical creatures and does it with simplicity and fun!The game starts with a short story about why the orcs are attacking and so on and so forth. However from there you start. Orcs spawn from a single (or up to 4 locations later on) location and have one goal. Reach a predetermined  ""door"" if you will on the map, and beat the heck out of anything that stands between them and the objective. If too many enemies pass through the door you must retry the level.You can choose between two characters. A male character or a female character. The male character comes equipped with a shot gun and his own set of default traps to throw off enemies with. The female caracter comes with a wand that you can shoot either lower power bolts from faster or shoot charged up high damage bolts that also have a short ranged knockdown effect on enemies around the enemy hit with it. The game offers new traps,trinkets, and weapons avalible to your character iin the spellbook. The in game store that uses skulls as currency that you obtain through beating levels. Everything is upgradable and it's always fun to see what kind of damage you can do with an uprgraded trap or weapon.Co-op is the name of the game for the best fun in this game. Grab a buddy and you two can stop the orcs together! It's the same concept as playing alone except for that you get to do it with a friend. For me it return my mind to a simpler time sitting in my parents living room ripping through a game with a freind. It's great fun!The game also comes with an endless mode in which enemies spawn in an infinite number of waves. It adds a lot of replay value after a somewhat short campaign. (maybe 5 to 6 hours).Put aside anydoubt and pick up this game if you think it looks good. It's a great buy and will give you lots of entertainment especially with the three DLC pack bringing new levels and weapons. An easy 9/10 for me!			"

												Notorious fun. I personally prefer to play solo as the game seems to be made for solo and the multiplayer lags quite a bit. Aside from that, the game will last you quite a while if you're into tower defense games. I completed the campaign before I stopped playing, and that was due to lack of time. Definitely worth the price tag.			"

												I played the first Orcs Must Die! and I was immediately hooked. If you are into tower defense games, but aren't afraid to get your hands dirty in melee combat either, this is the game for you. Grab a co-op partner and it becomes even better, great fun with a friend, but still quite enjoyable on your own.Definitely a must buy. Now, what are you waiting for, go and smash some orcs!			"

												Orcs Must Die 2 is a total improvement over the first game, the AI has been reworked and now you can truely block out enemy paths. Test your trap placing and combo making skills to the test with its wide variety of traps to use. This game becomes tougher as you play but also more rewarding, if you are having trouble with a stage, why not have a buddy help you out. Over all its a fun addicting experience.			"

												Orcs Must Die! 2 is an excellent follow-up to Robot Entertainment's ""Orcs Must Die!"" Offering new features such as co-operative play with a friend and levels with unlimited play, this game is definitely an improvement on its predecessor.  In this title, you take up the role of the War Mage, previously tasked with closing all magical rifts allowing orcs into his world and now tasked with protecting that same world from an orcish incursion alongside his old enemy.Orcs Must Die! 2 plays as some sort of hybrid between a third-person action/shooter game and a tower defense title.  With good fortune, the game does this beautifully and seamlessly.  Levels are spent with players both working on building up their defenses and then taking upon themselves the challenge of killing any orcs that may have managed to survive through the vast and sometimes comedic array of traps that they've established.If you enjoy third person shooter or action games and have any interest in tower defense, this game may be for you.  This game may also suit anyone wishing to find a shooting/action experience with a little bit of unique element implementation.  Anyone looking for a great game for two-player co-op should also look here.Key Features:- Co-Operative Experience (2 players)- Tower Defense Elements- Third Person Action/Third Person Shooter Elements- Waves of Enemies- Heavy Comic Relief- Upgrades and Skill TreesTime Personally Spent on Orcs Must Die! 2: 18 hours			"

												I think Orcs Must Die! 2 is very addictive.In this game, you put traps and fight against various enemies trying to pass through us.You have a few traps and weapons at first but you will get new ones and upgrade them after victory.Then it's available more way to fight, and stages, simple or complex or something, and get more interesting.It's also available to coop mode, so you can play with your friends too.So now I really recommend this game!

												When people talk about the traps being nerfed they weren't kidding. Every single second you have to micro manage each pathway and it gets extremely stressful. I was a fan of the orginal because it was better balanced, traps could actually kill, and you were rewarded with headshots.And to top it all off it has a saving problem, I played on endless mode today for about two hours straight. I quit the game like normal and all of the items that I unlocked were now locked again. Sad part about this is that I was actually going to give this game a positive score despite all it's flaws, don't get me wrong it can still be fun but the saving system made me lose my marbles with this game. Video games are already a waste of time to begin with, but never allowing me to advance even makes me feel even worse.			"

												This is a third-person tower defense game...i guess that's what you can call it :)You have to defeat orcs before they reach a portal (or multiple portals).In order to stop them, you can place different traps throughout the level, but you can also shoot them yourself, which is definitely harder and not as fast, so using traps is needed in order to stop them.You can upgrade your weapons and traps by earning skulls, which you will get after completing a level or when they drop randomly while killing orcs.You have mutliple types of orcs like flying ones, fast ones, strong ones etc. which need different tactics or traps to defeat them fast enough.It is a lot of fun, especially in co-op. So grab it if you like those kind of games.			"

												Orcs must die 2 is like a third person tower defense with a cool story. I reccomend this game because it is really fun to play with a friend and just compete scores fighting waves of orcs. Every map has its own special twist to the objective so every map is diferent, making the replay value for this game pretty high. One thing I wish this game would have is more than 2 players allowed in a match. I think the online wave survival game mode would be a lot more fun with more than 2 players, maybe 4.			"

												Overall a great game, as long as you have somebody to play with. I say this due to the fact that it gets nearly impossible to solo the later levels, even with good gear. Other than that, Orcs Must Die is soooo addictive. If you are a fan of tower defense games or games like Sanctum, then this is right up your alley. The cartoony art style is goofy and fun and suits the game very well. This is absolutely worth the cash to buy a copy for yourself as well as a friend. 8.3/10			"

												Orcs Must Die 2 is an amazingly fun and enteraining game, single player as well as multiplayer. When bought you recieve a large amount of content and if that's not enough there is always still the DLCs. The DLCs also give a new array of traps, although I think these should be included in the base game. All in all a great game for many hours of fun and definitely a purchase well made when bought on sale.			"

												I found Orcs Must Die! 2 to be a very fun experience. It is a 3rd person tower defense-style game, where the objective is to stop orcs from getting to a rift by utilizing various traps and weapons/spells. If you enjoyed the first game, you will definately enjoy this one as well- same orc slaughter, but more traps and weapons to use and upgrade. Orcs Must Die! 2 has a big upgrade system- you get ""skulls"" after each map to spend on upgrading your traps and weapons in many different ways. The better you do, the more skulls you get, and your upgrades persist thoughout all of the modes, allowing you to tackle the very hard modes such as endless and nightmare. There is also is coop, which I think is a big selling point for this game. I just completed the story mode with my friend, and it was a ton of fun. Watching your combined traps massacre hundreds of orcs as they try to pass by is just so satisfying. As you get into harder levels, teamwork becomes very important as you try to hold the line against and army of orcs.Even after you complete the story, there is still much you can do- endless mode (never ending waves of orcs, see how long you can last), nightmare mode (harder difficulty, but you keep your previous upgrades as I mentioned before), and many other modes.There are a couple of downsides, though, that I will mention. First off, the in-game voice chat is downright awful, and overrides the steam chat so you can't use it. There is no way to turn it off, so my friend and I just made it push-to-talk, bound the key to something we never used, and then used skype or mumble.Also, there really isn't much of a ""story"", it is not what this game's focus is- it is all about the gameplay. So if you are a person who is looking for a good story to drive you through the game, this is not it.This game is not for everyone. If you don't like 3rd person action or tower/wave defense games, I don't think this will really change your mind about the genres. But if you have any interest at all in the game, I would definitely pick it up. It is very good at what it does.Lastly, many of the levels seem to be made with coop in mind. If you plan to play though this game solo, you might have a difficult time getting through some of the levels.Overall, this game was a blast to play with my friend. If you are looking for a good coop game to play with a buddy, I strongly recommend you try out Orcs Must Die! 2. Even alone, though, this game can still be a fun time. It has a light sense of humor about it that makes it all the more enjoyable, despite the fact that you are slaughtering orcs by the thousands!			"

												For those of you who have never played Orcs Must Die!, it is a tower defense game that allows the player to freely roam the environment.  Youâll be allowed to pre-pick what traps and weapons youâd like to use before the waves of enemies start coming, place said traps, and then take an active role in stopping them yourself.Orcs Must Die! 2 keeps with the general theme.  The player will be allowed to pick between two characters (a male war mage or a female sorceress) and will immediately begin their trek from level to level, unlocking new traps and earning skulls to purchase upgrades.  The spellbook is a lot more impressive, providing the player with more traps and upgrade options.  Thereâs also a page for trinkets that give both passive and active effectsâ¦a welcome addition in my opinion.All in all, Orcs Must Die! 2 is a great game that Iâve had a lot of fun with so far.  I look forward to unlocking more of its content, all the while listening to the gameâs soundtrack.  If you liked Orcs Must Die! or just enjoy a good tower defense game, then give this game your attention.

												If you have any interest in tower defence you should already own this.Combining 3rd person shooter and Tower defence, Orcs Must Die 2 allows constantly exciting gameplay with tactical thought like no other. The hordes of enemies overrun the screen with countless numbers as they run through carefully constructed death trap mazes and meet grizzly doom while you blast them away.Tons of traps, weapons and everything else each with a unique upgrade tree which when attempting to max out every item can take days. (Iâm not even close with 33 hours)Comparable only to Dungeon Defenders, Orcs Must Die 2 is quite simply a masterpiece. "

												I love it.I'm a HUGE fan of the ""Deception"" games and ""Tecmo's Deception"" (the first one on PS1) is still one of my favorite games of all time. This game is great too, but in this game you can, and in most cases have to, also directly attack your enemies. The traps are all well thought out and interact with eachother very nicely, though not for the orcs.Level designs are fantastic allowing different tactics to beat them. You'll run around them thinking of where you want to throw which traps. Then the horde starts flowing and you need to improvise.Both characters have some unique traps and weapons that only they can use.If you have the first game, this game has redone levels from it outside the main story.There's a good amount of enemy variety, each with their own strengths / weaknesses. There's a wide selection of weapons and trinkets which can give you magic attacks, or abilities, or buffs etc..There's many types of traps, but you can only take a handfull with you. Less if you want to take an extra weapon or trinket so you'll have to plan your strategy carefully before you even begin. Each trap is further varied by how you upgrade them, and you can respec the traps/weapons/trinkets you have and how they are upgraded any time in the menu.I recomend the ""franchise pack"" that comes with the both games and all the DLC.

												I don't usually like tower defense games, but this one combines it with third person action and has a great selection of weapons and traps to use, along with two player co-op. The enemies are likewise varied and you must use different tactics against them. Lots of fun in short bursts, can get tiring/tedious if played for too long.			"

												A super fun tower defence game, and it get's even better when you can play it with a friend in co-op!I just love to see the orcs being splattered everywhere, and that you can also run around with a weapon and fight instead of just watching, actually you have to fight in order to get far in the game.Upgradable traps, weapons, different weapons and traps that can be bought.This is a really fun game to play with one of your friends, or alone for that matter.

												Action game + RTS, extremely fun with friends, if you have the first one too you can play that ones maps on OMD2. Co-op is GREAT fun. Even solo it is really fun although the maps are designed with 2 people in mind. If you plan on playing mostly solo grab the first one too. Anti-zerg type gameplay.			"

												This game is very...unexpectedly engrossing. The developer team made many efforts for the combination of stuffs. At first, it has the most amount of stuffs(including weapons, trinkets and guardians) so far during the tower defense genre. Secondly, the combination of different traps, weapons and trinkets makes its strategies much more extensive and variable. All right, I admit its normal mode is quite a bit easy. But in nightmare and endless mode,you will pay more concentration on the combination of different useful stuffs for victory. Its co-op mode is another excellence compared to other similiar games. Unlike Dungeon Defender, you must have close cooperation with your partner in OMD2. Or you will surely be defeated by the orc very soon. Heroism creed is not necessary and is a poisonous seed to the playing experience. I remember when playing co-op in Dungeon Defenders, the only thing I can do was to rest and watch beside if one of my partners used the magician class. That was so boring that I gave up playing with others. If you worry about how to combine various stuffs, this game has the weekly challange to teach you the trick of most stuffs. If you are a fan of tower defense game and co-op, this game would be the one you must have.			"

												This is by far the most fun game I have played. It's a cross between a shooter and tower defense game. I recommend #2 expecially if you have someone to play with. It is much more fun with two people, but still a great game (although more difficult since levels are designed for two players).  If it is on sale, definitely get it. If you have any doubts you can try the demo to get a feel for the game.			"

												Overall Score 9/10Fun factor 8/10Control and Gameplay 9/10Graphics 8/10Sound 9/10Replayability 9/10As a sequel to the original Orcs Must Die goes it's almost perfect as they addressed a lot of the issue that plagued the first game. The developers added multiplayer and skins adding hours of replayability with friends. They also fixing the taxing issue of playing Nightmare Mode allowing a build phase before the level starts. Multiplayer can be a bit buggy at times and if you crash or dc you lose all the progress made on the map of choice. It can be frustrating at times but enjoying the steampunk-isk tower defender with friends adds so much more debt to the game. Like with the original if you can pick it up for 50%-90% off itâs well worth the time and money.			"

												Opening caveat:  I am not traditionally a person that plays Tower Defense games.  This is in fact my first one.  To get right to the point of it...I loved the game.  If the name wasn't a dead giveaway, the game has a silly, lighthearted tone to most of it that, when combined with the creative ways you can inflict mass orc genocide (some favorites being hurling them by the packs into bottomless chasms with a well timed gust of wind and launching them ragdoll-style for their afternoon lava bath), leads to plenty of destructive catharsis.  While you can play all the missions single player...the game is at its best (IMO) when played with a friend.  Many a map benefits heavily from having a second mind on hand to help combat the games challenges, and with co-op your individual action bar is halved so it emphasizes working and planning together.  The missions also reward player skill with the main currency of the game, skulls.  Doing things like beating a mission within a certain time limit...not letting anyone through your defenses...and even ""hidden"" bonuses like not using mana or not taking damage all reward you with additional skulls after the level.  If however you're not that great at pulling things off that way, levels can be farmed repeatedly for unlimited skulls so you aren't punished harshly.In conclusion...recommended.  Get a friend...get some chips...and get killing.			"

												Orcs Must Die! 2 is a game for you to play with your friends and by yourself! Its the simple things that make this game fun to play again and again.  Resetting your trap choices to tackle difficult stages make getting those 5 skulls per level endless replayability. Definitely a must have game when you just want to kill some pixels and relax.			"

												I was a bit hesitant buying this at first, seeing as I don't have any friends to play this with, and it's designed as co-op. I wish I bought it earlier. It is well possible to beat the game single player, though at times it can feel a little overwhelming. I've beaten the campaign, but have not beaten the DLC's yet, as I have yet to try them. If the only thing preventing you from buying this is the fact that it's designed for co-op, just get it. If you get stuck, watch a guide. Fryedegg's channel on Youtube was a great help to me on some of the harder levels. I have yet to try the levels on Nightmare mode (Hardmode) seeing as I'm farming skulls to make things easier. If you're thrown off by me saying you need to spend time farming, you don't. I just am to make things easier.You can reset the upgrades, refunding 100% of what was spent, which is a feature I wish i'd figured out before I was halfway through the game.This game is extremely fun, moddable, has a lot of replayable value, beatable in single-player, has a co-op mode, is better when eating tacos (What game isn't?) and... well... yeah. Get it.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												This is an amzing game. My only complaint is that it focuses too much on playing with friends, and u can only play with one at a time. The game is too difficult for solo play and if you have more than 1 friend that wants to play someone is gonna be left out. I hope an orcs must die 3 doesnt have this problem, if there ever will be a third game.			"

												Absolutely a must buy for an massive orc slaying fan! There's a HUGE list of traps, weapons, trinkets, vanities and guardians which you can buy with skulls you get by winning maps. Also, with DLC packs, you'll get hours and hours of funny orc slaying with your best friends! I think the DLC are a must get if you like this game, each pack adds 3 new maps, bunch of new weapons/traps. You'll also get some endless maps.As you play with your friend, you progress in the singleplayer as well, and your friend of course also does. Every chanllenge can be done again, again and again.Speaking about endless, its a game mode where you keep facing orcs, and you'll just have to kick theirâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥as long as you can, while tougher and thougher enemies keeps coming. When you've lost all your ""rift points"" you'll lose, same is in Story and Nightmare mode.Over 200 hours and counting... !			"

												Orcs Must Die 2 is really more of the same, but this time it's bigger and, in some ways, even better. There are quite a lot of new traps, it introduces online co-op, collecting skulls has a better purpose and there's more replayability in general, thanks to Endless Mode.Graphically it looks the same and the one liners are once again amusing. The sounds in general (traps, kills, orcs, you name it) don't disappoint.As you can see it's a complete package and, considering the price, it's truly worth your money.[Rating: 88/100]			"

												Initially this game was fun.  The wave based defense was challenging and the mechanics were fresh.  The problem is once you continue to play past an hour or two.  The game turns into an endless grind without anything new.  While some may enjoy that type of game play, when it comes to wave defense, it gets a bit dull and mindless.  If you're looking for a wave defense game to burn time and you like that sort of micromanagement, this game is definitely a good buy for the price.  I, unfortunately, would not recommend the game.

												Not a bad game, just lacks any real choice. You're pretty much guided from the start of how to play and what to do. Its one of those games that does a superb job of pretending to offer players strategic choice but once you learn the ins and outs theres really very few things you can do to maintain interest in it.Get it for $5 tops if you must. I simply can't recommend this game :(			"

												Fast-paced and action-packed games with simple, challenging gameplay and a humorous story, as well as several other modes to play in? This game has it all. Take the role of either the robust war mage or the crafty sorceress and fight off hordes of orcs with your large variety of upgradeable, disposable traps and your own upgradeable weapons and accessories. Play with a friend, or slaughter them all yourself. I personally love games that are simple and fast-paced, but also challenging, just like this one, and I'm finding it extremely addicting!			"

												7.5/10Really a fun and smart game.Basically, is a tower defense game that allows the player, which controls the main character in a third person perspective, to place traps in order to stop ordes of orcs and other type of monsters.The amount of traps, weapons and spells make the game replayable, thus you'll like to try different setups on the maps, both in survival and story modes.I recommend this game with a 7.5/10.

												Short said (and not completely true) the game is the same as the first one. You also have to defend your fortress against a big army of Orcs, with traps, guards and magic, but the game, still looking the same, changed a lot of things:Coop: The whole game can (and should) be solved in 2 player Coop mode. Both players choose their weapons of choice and defend the tunnels and floors together. The big contra is, that money and inventory is not shared, but seperated.Since every player has at least one weapon, and mostly have one spell and one artifact, you have to ask, which slot you should use for traps.If one player use 3 slots for said things, he still has 8 slots for traps and other things, but two players with each a weapon, spell and artifact only can choose 2 traps each, so coop means less varity in trap placement.Still, two players can be at 2 places at once and can do better crowd control. A lot of maps from the first game (some of them are playable in the second one, if you have both games) are way easier if played in coop.No Skilltrees but big unlocking system: You no longer have a skilltree (which is bad) but have way over hundred different traps and items you can unlock and upgrade, so even after playing the campaign, you still wont have unlocked everything.The simple trap system from the first game is gone. Now you have a ton of new traps, you can upgrade and customize (a bit), big weapons like the magic rocket launcher, all spell rings from the first game and new artifacts, that give you boosts and special abilitys.With a good campaign, a lot of challenge maps (some of them are quite hard again), some DLCs, the game has a lot of content you can play for hours.It is recommended to play this game in coop, because some maps are way to hard alone.All in all the second game feels way more easy than the first. The big variety of weapons and abilitys and the use of two players at once spamming their weapons, the orcs feeling weaker and the traps are able to be upgraded, it is more casual than the sometimes nearly impossible nightmare mode of the first game.

												Dungeon Defenders was the first tower defense game I played and I couldn't get into it. It wasn't a bad game by any means, but the animation felt too slow paced for my liking and I couldn't get into the leveling and gear upgrades as much as I usually would in an RPG.A friend got me Orcs Must Die 2 to play with him and although I was skeptical at first, I enjoyed (and am still enjoying) the absolute hell out of it. It's much faster pace and spending talent points (or skulls) for weapon / trap upgrades has never been more fun. This is surprising to me because I usually prefer RPG elements in video games, and this one doesn't have any really, but I enjoyed it regardless. If you're looking for a great tower defense, you probably want to check this one out.			"

												This game is fantastic, although I have to admit it is very similar to the first game in the series.Orcs must Die was a single player Tower Defence / Third Person action hybrid that combined the two genres very well. This sequel adds an additional player character, new traps, levels and most importantly a two player co-op mode. I'd recomend this game even if it retailed for Â£39.99, at the current (non-sale) price of Â£18.99 with all DLC it's a must-buy.Speaking of DLC, what you get is a selection of more difficult levels, new traps and new weapons. If you own the original OMD you also get 10 of the original levels to play in OMD2. It's not essential to own all the DLC (you'll likely only play the new levels after completing most of the main game), but I am glad I picked it up.			"

												The sequel to Orcs Must Die! is by itself a slightly worse game than the original, however it brings with it the addition of a co-op mode which can easily greatly improve your enjoyment of the game.The game suffers from the same issues as the original, mediocre level design and unbalanced traps/weapons. However it does bring with it some improvements as well. For instance in this game you only get some traps and weapons by default as you progress through the campaign, the others you have to buy with skulls, which you get by doing well in a level and picking up if they drop from an enemy. This adds another level to the game, and with the option to refund your skulls for free any time you want to, you can try out different styles of gameplay every single time.However I was not feeling the atmosphere of the game as I did in the original, that with the addition of new monster types, which seem to be there just to add to the number of different monsters, makes this game slightly worse than the original in my opinion. That is if you're only playing it in single player, however since the game is built more around the co-op aspect if you play it with someone else it becomes better than the original.7Â½ / 10			"

												Great game with a very annoying tendency to crash in multiplayer endless mode. If you confine yourself to the story missions you'll have a really good time, but for me half the fun is seeing how long you can last and unfortunately you just can't rely on the game to last as long as you can (in co-op, that is, in single player I've never had a problem).

Not sure what i expected but the gameplay is a great mix of oldschool horde shooters (think, serious sam) mixed with tower defence in a medieval rpg setting. Quite similar to Sanctum, but with less emphasis on serious tower defence maze strategy.Play as a warrior (melee) or caster (ranged) to destroy the orcs as you place a wide variety of traps to impale, shoot acid, burn, freze, and generally eliminate in the fastest way possible.

												Great game with a very annoying tendency to crash in multiplayer endless mode. If you confine yourself to the story missions you'll have a really good time, but for me half the fun is seeing how long you can last and unfortunately you just can't rely on the game to last as long as you can (in co-op, that is, in single player I've never had a problem). I'd give it an A+ ffor single player and a B- for multi.			"

												This game is fun and interesting. Imagine a regular tower defense, but instead of doing everything in God View, you're actually running around on the map setting up traps, towers and minions to help you kill waves of orcs.The fact that you're able to help out by attacking with a vast variation of weapons and trinkets completes this game. You even get to upgrade defences you think are useful with ingame currency.Don't be fooled by my play time, I used to play this on a different account and put quite a few hours into Endless mode with friends. While it doesnt have insane amounts of replayability, it is definitely worth trying out if you've never played this genre of games before.			"

												Dungeon Defenders was the first tower defense game I played and I couldn't get into it. It wasn't a bad game by any means, but the animation felt too slow paced for my liking and I couldn't get into the leveling and gear upgrades as much as I usually would in an RPG.A friend got me Orcs Must Die 2 to play with him and although I was skeptical at first, I enjoyed (and am still enjoying) the absolute hell out of it. It's much faster pace and spending talent points (or skulls) for weapon / trap upgrades has never been more fun. This is surprising to me because I usually prefer RPG elements in video games, and this one doesn't have any really, but I enjoyed it regardless. If you're looking for a great tower defense, you probably want to check this one out.			"

												The sequel to Orcs Must Die! is by itself a slightly worse game than the original, however it brings with it the addition of a co-op mode which can easily greatly improve your enjoyment of the game.The game suffers from the same issues as the original, mediocre level design and unbalanced traps/weapons. However it does bring with it some improvements as well. For instance in this game you only get some traps and weapons by default as you progress through the campaign, the others you have to buy with skulls, which you get by doing well in a level and picking up if they drop from an enemy. This adds another level to the game, and with the option to refund your skulls for free any time you want to, you can try out different styles of gameplay every single time.However I was not feeling the atmosphere of the game as I did in the original, that with the addition of new monster types, which seem to be there just to add to the number of different monsters, makes this game slightly worse than the original in my opinion. That is if you're only playing it in single player, however since the game is built more around the co-op aspect if you play it with someone else it becomes better than the original.7Â½ / 10			"

												This game is fantastic, although I have to admit it is very similar to the first game in the series.Orcs must Die was a single player Tower Defence / Third Person action hybrid that combined the two genres very well. This sequel adds an additional player character, new traps, levels and most importantly a two player co-op mode. I'd recomend this game even if it retailed for Â£39.99, at the current (non-sale) price of Â£18.99 with all DLC it's a must-buy.Speaking of DLC, what you get is a selection of more difficult levels, new traps and new weapons. If you own the original OMD you also get 10 of the original levels to play in OMD2. It's not essential to own all the DLC (you'll likely only play the new levels after completing most of the main game), but I am glad I picked it up.			"

												Just plain fun! I love the FPS/RPG/Tower Defense mashup concept of this game and have played quite a bit on my own. I'd recommend playing with a keyboard and mouse over a controller, the experience was better for me personally. You can get pretty complex with your abilities and items and it's easier to toggle between options with a keyboard.This game is a lot of fun in multiplayer so I highly recommend trying that out with a friend.

												Brilliant game, if you have a friend.While I have only played the game for a few hours, the hours I have played were extremely fun. I haven't been following the story when I have been playing, so this is just a recommendation on the gameplay. The game is a third person tower defense game, simple in design but bloody hard at times. if you have a friend to play with you, both pick up the game and you will spend hours on this game. if your a solo gamer, you may find yourself getting bored. Whatever the price you wont regret your purchase, however playing with a buddy will be the highlight of the game.			"

												So... maybe I shouldn't have played Dungeon Defenders before playing this game because all I could do while playing Orcs Must Die! 2 is compare it to Defenders, and it wasn't winning.The game itself isn't that bad, it just feels redundant when you could just play Defenders instead. That may sound harsh and I'm sure there are people out there that may like Orcs more, but I'm not one.So I suggest if you're interested in playing this sorta game, check the Dungeon Defenders series out.

												I was looking for a game with controller support and this happened to be on sale and had very positive reviews. First off, the controller support is a joke. I could play the game just as well without any controller support with standard steam controller features. It is in large part a FPS and there is no aim assist when playing with a controller.The unique selling point is the FPS mixing with a tower defense, but I must say that it is painfully obvious why TDs are usually from a top down RTS perspective. Flying enemies for example are very easy to overlook, because they are above you. The perspective also makes its hard to tell where hordes are going to spawn and which way they are going to take. The game only shows you where the first wave is going to go and successive waves might do something entirely differently.Overall the game is terrible at explaining itself. It is so overexcited to get started that it is doesnât explain its mechanics at all. How much damage does a tower/weapon do? What's its range? What type of enemy can it attack? How much HP do enemies have? Which enemies attack structures? Which enemies have what attack modifiers? What are combos/killing sprees and when do they happen?If the game contains this information, it hides it well. I had to discover everything through trial and error. The gameplay is pleasant, but repetitive and gets old very fast. The FPS perspective has more downsides than upsides and does nothing to improve the genre. Has its charm, but is not a good TD game and after you take that away, what is left?			"

												I only give this game a Negative review because of one thing...it's multiplayer only. Yes, I know you can play it on single player, but you're playing on multiplayer difficulty. The whole game was designed for co-op, not SP. It becomes an endless, overwhelming grind trying to battle the Orcs by yourself. There is no way to defend 2 doors with 4 portals spewing enemies alone. I got into OMD watching SSOHPKC's playthrough of it on his channel and I loved that game. It was hard, but fun. It was balanced, well thought out...this, nah...they just made one side of a level and mirrored it, you can clearly see it was made for co-op. Which is fine for people who have 50 friends on their list and have people to play it with, but I don't. Even the traps are kind of lacking. You'd think a regular Orc walking through a row of 10 poisoned spikes would kill it, but apparently not. And, there's so little place to put stuff, most of the walls have bumpy's that won't allow wall traps, ceilings are too high up to use ceiling traps, all you're left with is goo and spikes along with Guardians. Well good luck with that. The barricades are useless due to the fact that Boomers blow them up in less than a second. The costs are too high also. They even up'd the cost of most basic and useful trap(Goo) by 50 points. But anyway, like I said, despite it's flaws it's still a good game. IF, you have someone to play it with. That's the one major fun killer of this game, no real balanced single player. Otherwise, it would have been a yes recommendation.			"

												How did you ruin such a simple game? You â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up tower defence. A â¥â¥â¥â¥ing flash game.The impressive part is how little you added to the game, how few changes you made, and how those few changes were so incredibly awful, they managed to make the game almost unplayable.

												So... maybe I shouldn't have played Dungeon Defenders before playing this game because all I could do while playing Orcs Must Die! 2 is compare it to Defenders, and it wasn't winning.The game itself isn't that bad, it just feels redundant when you could just play Defenders instead. That may sound harsh and I'm sure there are people out there that may like Orcs more, but I'm not one.So I suggest if you're interested in playing this sorta game, check the Dungeon Defenders series out.

												Overall the game provides alot of replay value, until you unlock all the weapons and traps. Then it is simply replaying levels using the same tools over and over again. There is comedy throughout the campaign, and the characters perform a little victory dance after each match, but that quickly gets old. Co-op was a hassle since I picked it up much later after its' release, the game is mostly dead in regards to Matchmaking.			"

												Are you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kidding me? It's really all I can say. I find myself repeating it over and over. They took a great game and made it redundant. If you loved Orcs Must Die, then stick with it. Don't come to the sequel. All it offers you are cheap graffics and gameplay. The game feels as though it has regressed to a more primitive state of being. I just can't do it. Sorry if this isn't a better review, but just play the first one and enjoy it for what it was, but don't give this sequel the light of day; it doesn't deserve it.			"

												Excellent game but multiplayer drops connection for no reason kicking both players from the game. I find this game is much more enjoyable playing in cooperative mode hence until this is fixed, which the developer doesn't accept any liability for whatsoever and blames the fans for their bad connections (do they think people are playing with 56k?), I cannot reccomend this game.Unfinished possibly untested multiplayer, poor dev who won't fix these game issues, blames fans. When are devs going to care about their products rather than just the money? Mass commercialisation has ruined the game industry - gamers get **** on left right and centre. Imagine buying a new car with headlights that don't work - would this be acceptable? NO.			"

												Takes everything from the original and makes it better. Instead of using a talent tree that costs gold per map to upgrade, there is a persistent upgrade system. You are rewarded skulls for finishing a level that you use to upgrade your traps, weapons and accessories. Being able to respec for free between maps adds a great deal of flexibility and promotes teamwork in the new co-op modes. All 3 game modes can be played co-op and the monster spawns are adjusted accordingly, leading to different strategies for SP & co-op.Both this and the original are cheap and worth picking up. Do you like killing orcs with guns, bows, hammers, traps, pets, or even magic? Then this is the game for you!			"

												So... maybe I shouldn't have played Dungeon Defenders before playing this game because all I could do while playing Orcs Must Die! 2 is compare it to Defenders, and it wasn't winning.The game itself isn't that bad, it just feels redundant when you could just play Defenders instead. That may sound harsh and I'm sure there are people out there that may like Orcs more, but I'm not one.So I suggest if you're interested in playing this sorta game, check the Dungeon Defenders series out.

												The game is nice to play, but for me it gets boring very quickly. And there is one serious reason: limited multiplayer. With someone this game is damn fun, but you can only play multi by inviting friend, you won't be connected with some random person.I wouldn't recommend it. If you like tower defence games, then go ahead. IMO it's not really worth it, if you don't have a friend to play with.			"

												It's a tower defense game where the player does more damage than the towers (which are actually traps).  The traps have limited damage output, so it falls to the player to do most of the damage.What I like is how well this game separates solo from co-op.  In solo, you'll fight fewer (but not too few) orcs, and have access to up to 9 traps at once.  While in co-op, each player will have up to only 6 traps, meaning good teamwork is required.  Each character has some unique items/traps, while there is a large range of ""general"" traps that both characters will have.Overall a very solid game, and very fun when done with a friend.			"

												Great game, good humor, and very entertaining to watch orcs die. HOWEVER, this game gets repetitive fast and most of the traps either fall into funny or useful category. Warning to all SoloPlayers. Most of the maps are designed around coop in mind, it is very difficult to defend them as a single player (this game is meant to be played in coop so I cannot really blame them for this point).			"

												I only give this game a Negative review because of one thing...it's multiplayer only. Yes, I know you can play it on single player, but you're playing on multiplayer difficulty. The whole game was designed for co-op, not SP. It becomes an endless, overwhelming grind trying to battle the Orcs by yourself. There is no way to defend 2 doors with 4 portals spewing enemies alone. I got into OMD watching SSOHPKC's playthrough of it on his channel and I loved that game. It was hard, but fun. It was balanced, well thought out...this, nah...they just made one side of a level and mirrored it, you can clearly see it was made for co-op. Which is fine for people who have 50 friends on their list and have people to play it with, but I don't. Even the traps are kind of lacking. You'd think a regular Orc walking through a row of 10 poisoned spikes would kill it, but apparently not. And, there's so little place to put stuff, most of the walls have bumpy's that won't allow wall traps, ceilings are too high up to use ceiling traps, all you're left with is goo and spikes along with Guardians. Well good luck with that. The barricades are useless due to the fact that Boomers blow them up in less than a second. The costs are too high also. They even up'd the cost of most basic and useful trap(Goo) by 50 points. But anyway, like I said, despite it's flaws it's still a good game. IF, you have someone to play it with. That's the one major fun killer of this game, no real balanced single player. Otherwise, it would have been a yes recommendation.			"

And then I can't join said friend's game without it being stuck on connecting.I really don't know why such is happening to me because this remains happening with no firewall up or anything of the likes.It's too bad, because it looked like it was going to be a fun game, but I got it to play with others.I'm not saying that if you have windows 8.1 it won't work for you either, but at this poing, I can't say that it will either. Truly dissapointing that such a game has an issue with a further form of windows a mere three or four years later. Or maybe, despite no fire wall up, it's just me. Quite sad because it looked fun and there's just no real reason why after fixing a file it shouldn't be working still.			"

												THIS IS A SINGLEPLAYER ONLY REVIEW!Let me start by saying that the game is not meant for singleplayer. In fact its almost unplayable in singleplayer! Most of the maps are made for two players, you can handle the easier ones on your own but not later on when the orcs comes from several directions at once! The game doesnt substitute for only one player, which means that you wont get enough money and you wont be able to cover everything on your own! I mean, just look at the steam page pictures, do you see any singleplayer pictures? They completely ignored those who perfer to play singleplayer. There is too much grinding involved too. To unlock everything you need to collect thousands of skulls, which would be fun in coop but not in singleplayer im afraid!Now to the really bad part:The traps are weak and expensive, the barricades are usless, they last for two rounds and then gets destroyed. All the fun in custom pathways is completely ruined by this! The weapons are boring and repetetive. The crossbow only works if you hit the head now? And some enemies are too powerful, just blasting through your traps making them useless for half a minute so the swarm can overrun you easily. Since the traps are useless and the enemies are overpowered you will be forced to do everything yourself. you wont be able to just sit back and see the orcs getting slaughtered by your trapmaking like a good defence game would. And that takes the fun out of this game completely! You can probably have fun after youve upgraded everything but why should i have to WORK in a GAME just to have simple fun?You should stick with Orcs Must Die 1 if you are a singleplayer guy!			"

												Great fun co-op game. Only worth getting it if it is on super sale. I just don't think the game is worth what the developers are asking. The game does support 4k resolution which is awesome but it is cartoony graphics all the same. The game gets repetative after a while though if you don't really care for leaderboard crap as is in my case but none the less still fun in co-op. Enjoy.Wanna see some game play? Here is some videos at 4k resolution I have on my page. Note: It is better to watch directly than through Steam as Steam seems to have lots of lag.Your choice of course.

Barriers get bombed in almost every level, which takes away your ability to force mobs along a certain path; a fundamental mechanic in tower defense games.Basically, this is a third-person shooter with a few poorly-implemented miscellaneous elements.

												Huge source of cancer due to constant co-op disconnecting.. just bought this game both me and my girlfriend and we can't play a single level without disconnecting issues... Our connection is good, without any background downloading etc. and even though we get disconnected after every 10-15 minutes. Not even one warning pop-up, just a direct disconnect. When I buy a game I expect it to work. WASTE OF MONEY!			"

												I used to have a good review here.

Games like this are supposed to be able to hand a lot ofâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥going on. That is their foundation.. It isn't my computer, either. I can run most games on max settings with no issues..			"

												This is effectively Orcs Must Die! 1.5.  There are new additions, but they are not much.The new additions include:Playing as the sorceress. (you can't switch between the sorceress and the warmage, each requires a new, separate, save.  also, some traps are unique to the character)Some new traps. (as expected)Some new enemies. (as expected)Endless mode. (aka grinding for skulls)Levels of upgrades for the trap. (necessitating the aformentioned grinding for skulls)Co-op. (aka, sacrificing the game on the bloody altar of co-op.  the game is now balanced for two players, so expect a serious spike in difficulty in the second act.  a single player can overcome this with lots of grinding for skulls to buy the traps and upgrade them.)If you liked the first one, go for it.  If you have not played the first one, get that instead.  This one is just more of the same, aimed at the co-op crowd.			"

												This game is an absolute bargain! Firstly, I'll go over the improvements over the first game. First of all, we have the skull purchase system. After you comlete a level, based on an array of criterea, you are given a skull rating. These skulls are all added to your tally. You may then head over to the shop and spend these skulls on whatever you choose! This shop includes tons of traps, a large number of weapons and a good number of trinkets. Trinkets are new too, they provide passive and active bonuses, but normally do not directly affect combat with the horde. You may think that with that much content for this price, everything is just a reskin. Nope! There are tons of new traps, all varying dramatically from eachother. The weapons are all viable in their own ways, I haven't found anything to be straight up the best. Basically, tons of content that will leave you ""staying for one more minute to get that next trap"". Also, nothing is too overpriced, so there is very little grinding. Three levels max will get you that new piece of expensive gear to try out. By the way, some items are locked so you have to unlock them by beating a level. We don't want you getting the good stuff too soon! Finally, tons of upgrades! Every trinket, weapon and trap has a nice line of upgrades to further customise your play. My personal favourite trap is the haymaker, a spinning bar that comes down from the ceiling to deal damage and push the orcs around. I upgraded it to make it literally throw the orcs up into the air, sometimes to their deaths, which just makes the game that much more fun!Secondly, CO-OP! This is easily the best part of this game, now you can join in the orc slaying action with a friend! It is perfectly balanced, with all ""money"" earned being evenly split between players. However, always keep an eye out for that bonus skull that sometimes pops up after killing an enemy. Both players can see them, and me and my friend have had great races across the map to get us one step closer to that expensive weapon. Everything is better with friends, and Orcs Must Die 2 is exponentially so.I'll cover the rest on this paragraph. First of all, we have a new character, the sorceress. She has unique traps of her own, unobtainable by the classic War Mage, but he has his unique traps too. With some very interesting and often humerous dialogue between the rivals, it provides a great bit of story telling without drifting from the main content: killing Orcs. Another great addition to Orcs Must Die 2 is the secondry fire. Every weapon has primary and secondry fire modes, with the secondry providing a nice effect at the cost of a bit of mana. I'm pretty sure you can upgrade every weapons secondry fire, so you can find what fits you and make it the best it can be!Overall, It's just a blast. Especially at the Â£6 it is during this Holiday sale, you really can't go wrong with Orcs Must Die 2.			"

												Having played through the game entirely with THREE different friends, I can now say that I think this game is the current standard for the tower-defense/fps hybrid genre.  The interface (extremely important in this genre) is very good, the gameplay is smooth, the characters are funny and interesting, and the story even makes enough sense to pay attention.  I highly recommend it over other td hybrids such as Deathtrap or Sanctum, though those games have some merit as well.The game's main problem is that in order to unlock all of the traps and empower them properly, you have to play the game through many times, or endure boring grinds.   Because you can refund your trap decisions at any time for free, this seems like a pointless mechanic which amounts to a pile of bookkeeping every time you wish to change strategies.  Skulls should come at a rate several times what they drop at in the game, because the game should be (and is for the most part) about your strategy and choices of traps per level, not what trap perks you happened to have unlocked at any given moment.  This is especially true since, with a little annoying click-through processing, you can rearrange your trap features anyway.			"

												SO is this game Worth the cash? In a word YES> If you liked the first One, you'll love this one. If you like Tower Defense, you'll enjoy thios game. If you enjoyed Dungeon Defenders, Defense Grid, or Sanctum you'll Love this game. Even if you've never played those other games this game is still worth the cash. Though be warned, this game will shift your alignment towards the darkside.The game takes the standard Tower defense mechanic and adds a few twists. You set traps to 'strongly deter' the orc hordes from their goal.  Kill more orks, get money, get money, Buyt more traps. Winde variety of enemies, wide variety of traps  and the ability to get into the fray when things get hectic.CHallenging, FUn, FUnny and will  A LOT of replayability.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS HIGH Replayability. With different difficulty settings, Endless mode,  Traps Gear, Two playable Characters/classes and even a regularly updated special weekly challenge. You'll be playing this game for a while. That's to say nothing about the Mods. Simple Mechanics, High depth., The mechanics are fairly simple and it's very easy to see and gauge the actions of each trap. How you approach any given level depends on not only which class but which set of traps you take in. Some combinations make things easy but there always harder and different ways if you like to experiment and challenge yourself The Story actually continues from the first one but strangely they do it in such away that not playing the first one will not leave you in the dark.  THe oneliners and dialogue between the War Mage and Sorceress between missions is genuinely funny and clever. CONS: I really can't think of any cons beyond that it can get a little repetitive at times but as said it's only as repetitive as your ability to experiment with new builds and tactics. If you don't like trying sub optimal or harder builds and simply approach it with a straight line ideology this game will get boring for you. If you're the type who likes to try new things, new tactics and new placements just for the heck of it or just to challenge yourself. You will love this game.THE AWESOME:Ragdoll physics! If you cannot find joy in using a giant swinging mace to knoick a bunch of orcs onto a bed of spiks. Or using a spring trap to catapult orcs half way across a room and ontro the bed of flaming brimstone you set up. You my friend are a sad sad individual.Should you get the first one. I actually recomend it. It's not entirely a step down from this. The advancement to two was more of a lateral than a linear advancement.  Oh There's also co-op multiplayer			"

I uninstalled and reinstalled the game its self, steam altogether, and at some point my computer also had to be reset to factory settings- reinstalling after that also didnt change the situation. The file verification says there is an issue with the download every time but it never fixes the problem when you update the game. Im tempted to uninstall steam for good seeing how they dont even bother to fix the downloads that they sell. Its defective product at this point. I wouldnt recommend this game and say that steam techs must really suck at their jobs.			"

												I enjoyed this game alot, until it just stopped working. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game its self, steam altogether, and at some point my computer also had to be reset to factory settings- reinstalling after that also didnt change the situation. The file verification says there is an issue with the download every time but it never fixes the problem when you update the game. Im tempted to uninstall steam for good seeing how they dont even bother to fix the downloads that they sell. Its defective product at this point. I wouldnt recommend this game and say that steam techs must really suck at their jobs.			"

I bought two copies of this for the co-op, it doesn't offer local and is constantly kicking for ""connection error"" to the main menu forcing a restart of the level. It's an extremely consistent problem making it essentially unplayable! I am so disappointed. I've never had this issue on any other game and searching this problem heeds other accounts of players complaining about this same issue!  The game play is fun and solid but these technical errors are a disaster. And no, I am not minusing to my desktop to cause the disconnections issues because that crashes my whole computer and forces a restart! 9/10 times!			"

												A nice game, through a combination of traps, weaponry, teamwork and planning you can smoothly run through the levels with a decent amount of challenge. Orcs range in size and ability to prevent things from getting dull too quickly.I can however not recommend this game for a simple reason. The base game does not provide enough content to justify the price, the amount of orcs you'll be fighting is limited at best (personally I think boring amounts). However through mods a lot of things can be rectified and made fun, the amount of content is astonoshing and the various overpowered mods (both for the players and the orcs) make it much more fun and give it a lot more gametime.Unfortunately the developers have rigged the game in such a way that adding even a single mod will prevent anything you do from being saved.You heard me right, no saves, no unlocks will be remembered, no level progress, NOTHING.Why? Well according to the devs it's to prevent people from installing ""every unlock costs 0 gold""-mods and simply unlocking everything instantly. Personally I do not see the problem with that, some people prefer unlocking as they play, others prefer having everything from the start, and it certainly doesn't justify kicking mod support in the head for it.Obviously, if you're the kind of person who doesn't mind lack of proper mod support, go ahead an buy it, you'll have a great time for a few hours.If however, you're like me, you'll find this game is but a shell of what it can be with mods, and once you played with mods, you won't want to go back, but you'll be forced to go back because the game refused to safe otherwise.

												A standalone TPP Tower Defense game inspired by all those StarCraft / Warcraft 3 mods. You've seen one, you've seen them all.Picking spells (towers) is a tad cumbersome, grinding skulls (which you spend on spells) is boring and there is no PvP (send enemies against other players, defend your own Portal/stone/exit). Then again, worth a shot if there's currently nothing else on your play-to list.			"

												**Composite Score: 9.125/10** If you enjoyed the first game, you'll definitely enjoy the second. If you have fun with tower defense games which incorporate FPS elements, you'll enjoy this too.This game launched at $15 for a single copy or $25 for two. Or, if you got it during the Steam sale, $12.50/$22.50. That's really inexpensive for this quality of game. I definitely recommend picking it up at these prices f you're into this game genre. **Entertainment Value: 10/10** Solid excitement mixed with charming humor. I really enjoyed playing solo. Co-operative play really depends on who you're playing with and dealing with network/tech issues. My partner had some microphone and XBOX controller issues, so we had to deal with tech problems at the start. But, after we got those sorted, we had a good time roasting, slicing, and crushing waves of orcs. **Graphics: 9/10** The Vision engine still delivers as good of a product as it did in OMD!. On my SLI GTX 570 setup, I get solid graphics performance and appearance. Anti-aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering are both great. No artifacting at all. Only reason this doesn't get a 10 is that the traps often don't mesh perfectly with the surroundings. And, coins sometimes get lost behind walls. **Sound: 9/10** Solid sound like the first game. Music is lively and entertaining. The surround system works. The orcs still tell silly lines, and now that dwarves have been added, they enhance the humor too. I give this game a 9 instead of the standard 8, because the dialog and music enhance the experience better than most other low-budget games of this style. **Design and Gameplay: 9/10** Gameplay has been tweaked since OMD!. There are more weapons, trinkets, and a new female character, the sorceress. There are new monsters. There are other ways to play such as ENDLESS and Co-op. Also, the way players can upgrade traps and items is distinctly different from the first game.... somewhat more like an RPG than before. Otherwise though, it's still build traps and use your character's powers to defeat the waves of mosters before they exit the map. **Game Length: 9/10** Given the game's low price and its incorporated multiplayer mode, don't think too harshly about it taking me less than three hours to complete the first half of the campaign on War Mage (normal) difficulty. I'm not done with the second half yet, but I've spent a couple of hours doing and redoing the next few maps. Also, I've spent many more hours playing through ENDLESS maps, going for high-scores, and playing through the classic maps using the new trap upgrades and weapons. Therefore, I'm quite happy with the game's length.			"

												This is the first time writing a review I wish I had a middle thumbs option, because this game is a mixed bag. It is FUN, but it squanders it's full potential with some terrible designer choices that I will detail below. As another reminder, THIS GAME IS NOT BAD, it's just ""meh"":WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME? CO-OP - Primarily designed to be a co-op experience, this game certainly shines when you play with a friend. You have two different characters, the crazy mage lady and the dumb-happy miner mage, focused on mana and being a jack-of-all-trades respectively. Selection is nice to have, and synergizing towers is always fun GAMEPLAY - If you've played any other FPTD game, you know the gist of this. Round by round, you place towers and attack the incoming mobs at you. Absolutely no complaints here, it's as good as any other game. ORC VARIETY - There's enjoy variety in the incoming orcs to constantly keep you on your feet, be it a regular grunt, a quick-footed orclet, or a regenerating troll (or Mister Moneybags!) FUN - Above all else, this game was fun to play with a friend. It took 17 hours to finish the game with all maps five-skulled, and I don't regret a single one of those hours.WHAT'S MEDIOCRE ABOUT THIS GAME? STORY - The story is absolutely useless. It was interesting, and it probably would've helped if I had played the original game, but there definitely could've been more story. I got what was going on, but I eventually lowered the voice audio because I really didn't care. DIFFICULTY - The game really isn't that hard, even on the hardest difficulty. If you are looking to get a challenge out of this game, you've come to the wrong place.WHAT'S BAD ABOUT THIS GAME? BUILDINGS - Okay, get ready for this because I'm about to rip on Orcs Must Die! 2 This game only had 9 good/useful towers OUT OF 35. This is less than 1/3 of the buildings!This is completely unacceptable for a TD game! All the tower unlocks that you get get your hopes up for 2 minutes before you realize in-game that they rate of fire is too damn slow or too expensive to actually use. Compared to Sanctum 2 or Dungeon Defenders, utter crap. WEAPONS - Same thing with weapons! I didn't count, but only some 6 weapons were actually useful/useable in-game, which out of a list of ~20, is an utter disappointment. SKULL RESETTING - Want to remove a single trap pick? Good â¥â¥â¥â¥ing luck, because you'll be having to be resetting all 200 of your skulls and picking everything from scratch EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Why on earth can you not have an individual remove individual selections?Compared to the Sanctum series and the Dungeon Defenders series, arguably the two most popular FPTD games on Steam, this game pales in comparison to them all. That's not to say that isn't fun for the time that you play it or that's objectively ""bad"", but if you had twenty dollars in your hand and you wanted to pick a FPTD game to get into, This should not be your first pick. Sanctum 2 > Dungeon Defenders > DD2 > Orcs=Sanctum6.5/10			"

												While i do recommend this game and it is fun to buy and level up traps, the game does have one real flaw. it doesn't really have a replay value, and i find that you start to rely on the same old traps due to having to level them up to be useful. While the storyline is interesting and the game is quite fun, once i beat the game i felt very little desire to replay even on the endless modes. Once you fully level up a trap, its very useful and its hardpressed to replace it with a lesser trap without grinding out the required skulls to get the new trap leveled up to be usefull. The weapons can make the game more difficult, and its rarley a good choice to use anything that drains magic, the 'powerful' abilities of the magic items make them less then effective. often you have to use more then one weapon, limiting the amount of traps you can have. Over all the game is a blast, but with little to no return value in the end.			"

												I got a refund on this game because there aren't enough stages first of all.  Secondly they are designed so that you must play with another player to beat them.  I really can't recommend this game and I'm not buying it even at $1.49 price point, which is dirt cheap.  I know that I simply won't play the game.			"

												Its a good game,with smooth graphics and nice building stuff, but...*Its really hard to play (even in easy mode)*it has 100 orcs spawning at once in the five beggining levels*and most of all,It gets boring after 30 minutes.and the reason i didnt ask for a refund is,that i bought this for 1$.4/10 wouldnt kill 10309 orcs again.

Have you beaten the 30 or so VERY short levels? good.... game is complete. not even any achievements either, just play the same game again but as a girl (same towers: which are 90%+ of the game), then as a diff girl then as a diff guy. why.......

												Everything the fantastic OMD is and then some.  Online co-op of course being the big addition.  Despite reused assets, notably some music and later level themes - there's now 2 characters, a greater assortment of traps, weapons and vastly expanded skull-based upgrade system, where skulls can now be earned in various ways, including drops from mobs mid-game.  The base game has fewer maps than OMD, however owning the first adds 10 more classic levels, DLC then adds 9 more (at 3 a piece) plus new weapons, trinkets and traps and a few extra maps for the gruelling endless mode.   Good wholesome orc slaughter, with a gleeful grin and dash of strategy makes this some of the most engaging co-op action going, as you team up to let the orcs have it, ""RIGHT IN THE FACE!"".			"

												Tower defense genre is very dear to me, but there is a lot of dev teams that just copy paste generic ideas from others, most time failing at that.Robot Entertainment managed to create a unique game within the TD genre, which is quite an achievement, they have introduced a very nice mix of FPS action and Tower Defense planning. You place towers then play out the role of a hero and you can see how effective your tower placement is, what helps you in your fight and what does not so that you can potentially improve next time. The little bits of lore, environments and monsters may not be entirely unique but are done with style, their own style which I do appreciate. OMD1 and OMD2 are a must for any tower defense games fan.What has happened that the devs decided to go with some stupid moba-like variation of OMD i have not idea but I really hope they will release a continuation of OMD 1 or 2.

This is super babytown gamedev101â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ so what's the issue?  Game has a mind of its own and seems to just randomly pick a device to output through and doesn't care what the default device is.

												Started playing in COOP with my girlfriend, got disconnected at the end of of a level. How frustrating, but these things happen, right? So we start again, and get disconnected again. We always play together, so I don't expect network issues to be the problem. I look on forums, and I only find people who complain about the same issue, including knowledgeable people. Since 2012. I tried to post something on the Robots website, and their website doesn't seem to work. Well, I don't expect a refund, nor any help so here's the best I can do; give the game a bad review. It's sad however, as it seemed okay.			"

												Not a step up  from the first game by any means.The level design is worse, there are sidetracks which are annoying to reach.The balance is kind of off, it feels like it's been balanced for co-op. On some maps it feels like you kill 90% percent of the enemies with your weapons instead of the traps, because you don't have enough money. This is supposed to be a tower defense game, not a shooter.The progress by which you earn your traps is not ideal, sometimes you can only get a certain trap right after the one map you would have really needed it, so you have to replay the map to get all the skulls: voila! Artificial game length padding...The new weapons are boring, the new traps unneccessary, and the trinkets? I've rarely even added them to my loadout...The only worthy addition is that you can upgrade your traps, but other than that, this game does nothing better than the first one.			"

												Choose your own play style to defend the tower with adorable characters and a good variety of choices. It was a pretty enjoyable experience, especially as a Co-op game. Yet, it seems like the difficulty level does not necessary increase over time, but some levels are just impossible to pass, unless you upgraded your traps entirely and used some help from a friend. Bottom line: It is fun to play, yet the levels difficulty is not balanced and calculated in a way that will not let you pass to the next one.			"

												The game itself is fun and could prove very addicting, but I do not recommend it for a one good reason (I myself regret buying this game for myself and my friend) - the coop is broken with bad game design and net code. Orcs must die 2 is all about 2 person coop, almost every map has like two (or more) hallways, two rifts, two orc spawn points etc, so its the most fun when played with a friend, however most of the time you get random disconnects without any reason and without a save point or a chance to reconnect. It is rarely a problem during most of the story missions as they are short, but if you play other modes like endless, it could take 1 or 2 hours to complete, and any second you could just get a message popping up, saying that there is a connection trouble and then it just redirects you to the main menu, so you will have to start the level from the beggining. If you check official forums, you will see that MANY people have this problem, and devs just can not fix it.So if you just want to have some solo fun killing orcs with many different traps and weapons to help you - go ahead and buy this game, but if you plan on playing coop like the game is designed to, don't waste your money, coop is basically unplayable.Cheers.

												Orc Must Die 2 is a very fun game. Good graphics and entertaining levels.Even the so simple story is funny to watch.The 2 players mode makes it even more enjoyable, you may spend countless hours fighting Orcs and playing the same level several times to make the best score or find a new way to kill them all at once.Sadly the commercial politic of this game is despicable. Every greedy technics we are use to see in the selling of video games are used there :- Countless DLC at high price with little content- DLC's weapons are more efficient- you have to buy the First one to play his missions (and unlock the achievment linked)- they even sell the music of the game as a DLCThe game itself is not updated anymore, however the weekly challenge is still updated.Don't buy this game unless you find it in an interesting bundle with all the DLC.

Steam needs to fix the crappy connection. or add LAN mode too it. since it is just not working at all.			"

												I dont recommend this game because there is a game that is exactly the same as this one but better. I feel that this game is just much more overall repetitive and bland because there are such few things you can use. If you enjoy games in this genre, play Dungeon Defenders. It has more classes that are quite unique along with more unique tower defenses that you can build. Trust me, I'm a doctor.			"

												DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE A CONTROLLER PLAYER - YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!Trash.  Devs apparently became lazy and liars between OMD and OMD2.  For over a year they've been ""fixing the issue and adding in proper controller support,"" and they never got around to getting it taken care of.  That's what my research for a fix for this issue turned up.  No one's managed to ever figure this one out.  The controller support, oddly for Xbox nonetheless, isn't present - even though they listed it as having full controller support in Steam.The Xbox controller, at random, tends to permanently come up as an improperly mapped gaming mouse.  No matter how many times I exit and relaunch the game, even after a reboot and disabling my firewall, this crap game still fails to detect the controller as what it actually is...a controller.  I wish someone had the clout to get them to focus on fixing this issue now instead of pushing out yet another game they clearly aren't ready for yet.This is an issue with the programming of the game, not anything else.  Most players can simply plug and play without a problem.  The minority group, even though it isn't a very small group, cannot.			"

												Finished the first play through despite the fact that every. single. time. I load the game it tries to install direct x 9, fails, then triggers the revert feature command in windows (and for some reason making my next boot up restart 3 times).Game is mildly fun, a nice way to kill some time.I turned on mods to try out some new traps, farm some skulls for upgrades since I play single player, that sort of thing. After three times of playing and having no idea why my progress isn't saved, it turns out the devs have a blanket policy of turning off game saves when any mod is enabled. Oh, and they provide no warning of this ""feature"". I guess I don't play the game the way the mods want me to. At any rate, that really kills the recommendation for me.Suck it, Robot.			"

												Here is why I CANNOT recommend this to ANYONE: I will tell this in the form of a ""good-news-and-bad-news"" message.The Good News:""Orcs Must Die! 2"" has a Steam Workshop and there's even a modding tool available for it.The Bad News:If you're playing a modded game, then guess what: not only does it not put your score up on the Leaderboards (which I wouldn't mind, and is understandable); it ALSO will NOT save your progress AT ALL! This means that if you use even a COSMETIC mod in your game (such as the Princess Leia Slave Outfit), then you will find that your game DID NOT save your progress the next time you open the game! Indeed, this reminds me of the plight of Sisyphus!According to Greek mythology, Sisyphus is a king who's being punished for eternity in the Underworld. His punishment: he must push a boulder up a huge mountain; and just when he and the boulder are almost at the top of that mountain, the boulder slips from his grasp; and it rolls all the way to the bottom of the mountain!Because of this SISYPHIAN game policy of not saving the progress of modded games, I BEG you, reader, to tell all of your friends, their brothers, their sisters, their fathers, their mothers, and their pets NOT to purchase this game!Oh, and one more thing: if you start playing ""Orcs Must Die! Unchained"" (which is an upcoming free-to-play sequel to this game), then PLEASE, and I cannot emphasize this enough... PLEASE don't pay microtransactions of ANY kind! Not only that, but please do me a big favor by telling everyone you see in that particular game to ALSO not make any microtransactions in ""Orcs Must Die! Unchained"", and you might also want to ask your fellow OMD!U players not to buy this game or the original ""Orcs Must Die!"". This way, we can work together to hit ROBOT where it hurts: their Net Income!			"

												I'm a huge tower defense fan. There are a lot of ways to make a game like this, and in some ways, this is one of the strongest versions of TD I've ever played. It has a lot of ways to experiment, it has weapon and enemy interactions which aren't just raw math and a matter of course--so you have an opportunity to think outside the box and really explore interesting ways to solve the puzzle of beating various waves and difficulties.But there are two TD mechanisms that really bug me and make me lose interest. They're both related to the idea of building the walls that push the enemies around the map. In a game where you get to build walls, the route you design for the enemy to take is a big part of the game and the puzzle.First, you don't get the piece that lets you make a wall until you've played for several levels. I encountered a bug where my progress wasn't being saved, and as a result, I had to play the same several levels over and over again to get access to this piece. Also, the wall pieces initially cost a ludicrous amount. When you upgrade them, they cost less, though, only with a mod, do they cost an amount that makes designing paths through the level at all interesting. Otherwise they just seem to take away money better spent on damage dealing traps--in which case, why bother?Second, the wall pieces do not consistently work. While I'm a fan of physics adding an unpredictable element to a game, when you can't be guaranteed that your walls will even work at all in some circumstances, I get really frustrated. Again--if walls don't work consistently, why have that element at all? Just make me place aggressive defenses, then. Or use the model (That they've incorporated) of putting down friendly units which move around and tie up the enemies.They have everything in the kitchen sink here, and I think they leaned too heavily on RPG mechanics, both in terms of holding back all the cool stuff you could play the game with, and in terms of being dogmatically rock-paper-scissors about how all the traps work to the extent that there is a monster 'counter' to walls (and I'm not talking about flying--I'm talking about running units who can climb over barriers and do so inconsistently, as well as normal units that just glitch over the barriers--there's also exploding units which destroy your built traps, which as a mechanism would be interesting, but, again, they can cross barriers which means you can't deal with them by building deep--you have to hope you shoot them in time, or a ranged trap--which you don't initially get, thanks to the RPG style gating--gets them). I'd like it if you had access to all traps, and the monsters didn't arbitrarily run over walls, but had to destroy their way through them consistently, unless they were fliers.			"

												Orcs Must Die! 2 is a solid game, as far as hybrid tower defense goes. However, it never managed to, ah, grab my attention. It just felt very same ol, same ol. Not particularly difficult. I was hoping that there'd be room for some cool trap combinations but in the end, it becomes a straight-forward efficiency game: pick the tools that will do the most damage with the least resources, and attempt to maximize resource gathering.

												I don't know about the co-op... but the overall game is not nearly as well designed as the original. I constantly found myself wishing I had trap x, y, or z. You only get traps at the end of levels or when you buy them (in between levels). This can easily leave you without what you need as every level is designed or a variety of traps. This offers more replayability, but the grind to get there simply isn't enjoyable. I recommend playing the first game instead. Each level is built with specific traps in mind (traps you are given).

												I don't know about the co-op... but the overall game is not nearly as well designed as the original. I constantly found myself wishing I had trap x, y, or z. You only get traps at the end of levels or when you buy them (in between levels). This can easily leave you without what you need as every level is designed or a variety of traps. This offers more replayability, but the grind to get there simply isn't enjoyable. I recommend playing the first game instead. Each level is built with specific traps in mind (traps you are given).

												+ It's cheap.+ A good title for casual players, easy to pick up.+ A good gift for a 5 year old.- Shallow gameplay.- Was fun for about 10 minates.- Too easy, the only challenge is endless mode which is pointless unless you cared about steam achievements.OVERALL: It's easy and simple to learn and gives the illusion of constant progression. In reality it is barely any content, repetative, maps have obvious choke points and certain traps/defenses are overwhelmingly powerfull compaired to others. It got to the point where with a friend we were able to build defenses for 3/10 rounds, the remaining rounds we could just AFK. "

												After watching the game trailer I thought that maybe it would be a nice filler game to play. What I didnt like about it:+It requires 2GB space in your disk, and its just too simple to use all that space+The mouse Sensivility is just too mad, and that is just horrible in a game where you have to aim to your target (millions of orcs) to kill'em. My character kept commiting suicide because of falling out the map, I couldnt control the movement of my mouse, this was by far my reason of why I wouldnt recommend this game. I think its an important part of it.			"

												Was never able to get 'into' this game and don't see what the fuss was all about - as far as tower defense games goes both Dungeon Defenders (for the first 60 levels) and Sanctum (which features similar options to take a direct hand in the defense) are superior games. Orcs Must Die suffers from grinds to unlock stuff and poor presentation, while the 'build almost anywhere' approach at first seems fine it is too easy to waste time trying to build stuff 'juuust right' to avoid wasting space so that you can fit in more traps.

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

Everything in DD is far better: weapons, traps, monsters, characters, classes, graphics, sound, gameplay, level design, upgrades, skill system, literally everything. No autofire in the year 2012 for a game that badly needs it, lol. I hate this game.			"

The idea of the game sounded incredibly fun at first, so I bought the two pack for my wife and myself. Neither one of us found it to be all that exciting. Great idea and principle behind the game, but I feel the execution was somewhat poor. 4 or a 5 out of 10 from me.			"

The same amount of mouse movement can move the camera either a couple degrees or a full 180, and its anyones guess as to which it will be. Werid this is, the mouse pointer when scroling through the menu is  perfectly fine, its just the in game camera movement. Google'd the problem and it seems to be very common with no fixes. Game developers just say that probably becuase my computer isn't powerful enough, but I have a very beefy comoputer and I tried turning graphics all the way down.			"

The game is about replayability, though, and if you manage to get through the first couple of levels, you may find that you don't have a problem replaying some for more unlockable stuff.I couldn't follow the story, really, but the main characters are funny, and hearing the same voiceover 100 times didn't get as grating as you'd think.If you play endless mode, right around Wave 45, things get a little ridiculous!

												I love this game. The levels change enough that finding and making ""cheap"" combos is actually required to win on harder difficulties. Also I've played it in 3D (using 3rd party software) and the physics/environment are a lot of fun from a nearer to first person view. Physics, trap options, and teamwork mechanics make it by far better and less formulaic than dungeon defenders.			"

												What to say about OMD!2. Honestly it is a fun game and is even better co-op. Traps and weapons are all fun to use and each map offers its own unique challenge. Making combos with different traps and creating choke points are key to winning. Enemies can be quite challenging if you let them be. Game play is solid and the art style is nice. Overall I'd give this a solid 8/10.			"

												Really love this game. Very fun tower defence game and I absolutely love actually being in it with 3rd person shooting. Just one problem that I found: almost all the maps are designed for 2 players. I'm not saying they're not possible alone tough, far from that. I'd just like to see an improvement there, something that would change the spawn places for maps if you either did them alone or coop. However, it may not be a bad thing for many people.

												Hello, friends. I recently purchased this fine video game and I must tell you that I, being a friend to orcs, find this title to be quite disgusting. I was not expecting to be able to catapult helpless orcs into empty chasms. I didn't think I'd be able to spew skin-melting acid or spray spikes at these poor fellows. I certainly had no idea that I'd be able to light them on fire or release vicious, vicious Jehovah's Witnesses to pester them. Frankly, if you have it in your heart to help protect the orcs then steer your way clear of purchasing this barbaric title.			"

												Nennenswertes 2-Mann-Koop SpielOrcs Must Die! 2 ist ein Action-Tower-Defense Spiel, dass hÃ¤lt was es verspricht. Gut, eine groÃartige Story verbirgt sich nicht wirklich dahinter, aber diesen Zweck soll es als Koop Spiel eben auch nicht erfÃ¼llen.Es gilt viele Horden Orcs abzuwehren die an bestimmten Stellen spawnen und versuchen Ã¼ber die Map zu laufen um an die AusgÃ¤nge zu kommen.Das muss der Spieler zu verhindern wissen und so hat man neben seinen Waffen eine Menge Fallen zur Auswahl um die lÃ¤stigen Biester ein fÃ¼r alle Mal dahin zurÃ¼ckzuschieÃen, wo sie hergekommen sind. An der KreativitÃ¤t von den unterschiedlichsten Fallen wurde nicht gespart, so kann man Orcs mit Sprungfedern die Klippen runterschieÃen, mit Brandfeilen durchlÃ¶chern, mithilfe von ElektrizitÃ¤t verbrutzeln lassen, oder oder oder. Es gibt eine Menge auszuprobieren und wenn man erstmal mit der eigentlichen Kampagne durch ist, gibt es auch noch aus jedem Kampagnen Level einen Endlos Modus, mit dem man sich mit Freunden oder anderen Spielern messen kann. Da gilt es zu zweit oder auch alleine so lange wie mÃ¶glich durchzuhalten. Die Wellen werden immer schwieriger und die Orcs immer krÃ¤ftiger. Bis man irgendwann von einem endlos langen Strom aus Super Orcs Ã¼berrannt wird, hat man aber jede Menge SpaÃ und durch die vielen einzigartigen Fallen die man im Level platzieren kann, lassen sich viele lustige und effektive Kombinationen erzielen. Auch jetzt noch, nach langer Zeit spiele ich hin und wieder mal eine Partie und es macht noch genauso viel SpaÃ wie vorher. Ich wÃ¼rde euch dringend ans Herz legen das Spiel mit einem guten Freund zu spielen, dass macht sehr sehr viel SpaÃ!			"

												The original Orcs Must Die was FANTASTIC. Stemming the wave was absolutely ingenious fun, and this sequel streamlines the traps system, adds multiplayer, AND finally gives your Ashley J. Williams-inspired protagonist a Boomstick.I love that the light sense of dangerous fun between the Warmage and the Sorceress is still intact, and that the nature of what you're being asked to do is as ridiculous as ever. Half the fun of Orcs Must Die was its' aesthetic - which is as brilliant as ever.  I hope they port over the rest of OMD 1's levels, and allow endless with the classic maps.Ok, that's enough listening to me.  Go kill Orcs!			"

It would be nice if I could play with more than just one friend, but there's so many games with 4 player coop anyway, and most don't work well with just 2 people.So yeah, get this game if you want a fast paced shooter mixed with a tower defense RTS that you can play with a friend for hours until they hate you and quit.

												If I were to describe Orcs Must Die 2 in 2 words, I would say ""Hilarious Chaos"".  This game is a 3rd person tower defense/brawler in my eyes, and having completed it on a friends computer, I still can't get enough.Pros- The traps are hilarous to watch, especially the spring trap that launches foes flying.The writing is witty, though short, and funny.Map layout is varied and intersting, I have never had a similar expierence from any other maps, pushing the use of certain traps.The replayability is extremely high in my eyes because of its weekly challenges and endless modes, as well as the strive to collect all the skullsCo-op is the best part, where teamwork can create some of the funniest chain traps ever, making it hard to beat the level when you are laughing so hardThis game is intense and fast paced, something I greatly enjoy as it creates an rush down your spine as you sprint around trying to protect my riftsCons- Gun play for me was very awkward with some ranged weapons, where I found my shots hitting orcs, but not doing damageAll the DLC for me is also a problem, as there are 3 dlcs so far, and when all combined, they total the same amount as the gamePlaying single player doesn't give the full expierence of the gameIn the end, I find this a buy for me and too all as well. I have heard that Orcs Must Die 2 is like Dungeon Defenders, but saying that is like comparing a milkshake to spoiled milk, it doesn't serve the justice this game deserves.			"

												Oh Orcs Must Die! 2...what can I say after way too many hours of playing?Pro:1) Great mixture of Tower Defense and 3rd Person ShooterYou really have to think of a strategy for every level and, especially when playing the Sorceress there are hardly levels where the same strategy works twice. This is a really nice change from OMD 1. So you have to use your brain in every level. The third person shooter part adds nicely to it as you cannot lean back in the beginning and your very own skills are also needed.2) Co-op!You can play with a friend in this one and especially for Nightmare and Endless it is a load of fun, especially when aiming for high scores or just randomly picking traps and weapons and seeing how far you get.3) ReplayabilityCollecting skulls, getting high scores, beating the map with War Mage and Sorceress, trying new combinations of traps and so on and so forth....you can replay a level a hundred times and it will hardly ever get boringCons:1.) Co-opYes, this is a Pro, but especially in War Mage and if one of the players is experienced, Co-op gets old and boring rather fast as it offers no real challenge. Even Nightmare can get too easy. So personally, I think there should've been an additional mode or something comparable to make Co-op a little more challenging.2.) No real changesOMD 1 was great. OMD 2 is great. But there are hardly any REAL changes. Half of the game even uses the same general map layout as the first game. I'd love to see differences and new experiments, maybe commanding the Orcs for a while or something.Conclusion:Especially during a Sale you just cannot go wrong with the game. You can use the demo to try it out and see for yourself whether or not you like it, too.			"

												This is a really fun game, if you like setting up traps and defending/turtling. I enjoyed the first half of the game better than the second half (all I played was multiplayer) because once they introduce 2 or more entrances and portals you have to use all the time just to keep up, it becomes less laid back fun and more intense puzzle solving under pressure. Starts to feel like stressful work sometimes.I only played multiplayer co-op, and it was a blast. Definitely a well-polished game. However, it is rather short (we finished it in 6hrs), and not very replayable, so my suggestion would be to get it on sale.			"

												If you're in the mood for tactical combat, well planned defenses and fighting against hordes of intelectual enemies... You're out of luck. But, if you're looking for hilarious hack and slash combat, teamed up with traps, dudes, and different weapons, all the while fighting a nearly endless onslaught of orcs, trolls, and all kinds of other nasties, then Orcs Must Die! 2 is your game. I've played it, I love it. Lots of things to do, no two situations are the same, and the ability to place and even upgrade your traps and emplacements makes the game a lot more personable. It's got witty comedy, sketch humor, and slapstick built in, and the best yet, tons of different game objectives that revolve around killing orcs. Two player, and personable = a good game to me.			"

												OK, after almost 600 hours in this game (Its my most played title) you prob know I'm gonna say ITS FREAKIN' AWESOME!! I've always been a fan of Tower Defense games with Defense Grid being my former #1 choice. (Peeved I did all those hours at Onlive and they're not reflected here). I actually didnt think it got better than that (and for true TDefense DG is #1) but OMD2 ups the game by PUTTING YOU IN THE GAME!! You not only set traps and watching them work but the majority of your success is dependent on your 3rd person skills combat. This game is so much fun and has so much replayabilty its CRazY!!You often replay maps until you DOMINATE them.  Then there are the Endless modes. The very nice DLC's, Coop and more. The beauty of the game is the fact that any level can be solved in a variety of ways. Different trap combos and placement can have wildy varying results. The art style is fun and the two avatars are different enough that its worth playing the game fully 2X just to max out each toon. The need to 5 skull each level (max points) can become an obsession especially since the diff between winning/losing can come down to a single mislaid trap. Even when you lose you never feel like the game cheated you. You always feel like ""If I just did...'X', I would have won!!"". If you like tower defense I can guarantee you'll like this game. Its a very unique spin on this popular game genre. Enjoy!! (I'm off to put a couple more hours into it...)			"

												The first time you play through a level is frantic, and often desparate. The highs are high and the defeats sting. But the controls are spot-on, and if you lose it's your fault. You will then revisit your favorite levels again and again, using your hard-won gear, your better sense of each level's layout, and a sense of what comes next to move your way up the leader boards. Plenty of replay value here. Trying to hit the enemy with as many different *kinds* of traps at the same time is key to high scores, and its a blast when you can pull it off. I haven't enjoyed a shooter this much since Doom II back in the day. The only important thing missing is a framework for player-made levels. (Players can only mod the waves, not the levels.)			"

												Orcs must die! 2 is a mix between Tower defence and third person shooter. Your goal is to stop the orcs from going into the rift. And to do that you Obviously have to place traps. You have a spellbook where you can unlock awesome traps and weapons by buying them with the skulls of the orcs! You can slow the orcs, you can freeze them, burn them, fling them into the abyss or even throw them into another dimension. You also have Guardians that will fight for you and kill as many orcs as they can until they die. Don't think that this is some boring old tower defence game where you just sit back and watch. No, you have weapons too that you have to kill the orcs with. Without you there is no hope.Orcs must die! 2 is a realy fun game with tons of action and humor. You never get bored of it :3Now go to the store and buy it!			"

												This game is an extremely addictive mix between a third-person shooter, and a tower defense game. Leveling up is fun, and the skulls system allows you to re-assign your upgrades depending on what stage you are trying to beat.So every time you go to play a stage you need to upgrade your traps and weapons speciffically for that stage. You can then either keep those upgrades how you like them, or refund your skulls and spend them on diferent upgrades whenever you want.You are never locked in when you purchase an upgrade and customizing your kit for the level at hand is half the fun.

												This game is everything I look for in a game, and its among my favorites. It has great humor, is challenging and rewarding, and is paced very well. Its a huge improvement on the first game, it just feels much more complete. The enemies are varied, and each require different tactics to be successful. The new system for buying traps/weapons/items makes the game feel much bigger. It really allows you to create the character you want. Everything works in harmony, and building successful killboxes gives a sense of accomplishment.			"

												The first Orcs Must Die was a funny, challenging, inventive barrel of fun. The second is much of the same quality but with the one feature that was most sorely missed from the first installment: Co-op gameplay. The addition of this feature, as well as a huge multitude of traps, customisation, and a larger library of levels, makes OMD2 superior to its predecessor in every way. A larger variety of enemies helps to keep you on your toes and to change strategies in the middle of battle. As always the central feature of the game is building your maze of death. Killing hordes of orcs with all the different traps is just as sadistically cathartic as it was before. Highly recommended!			"

												This game is missing something, is it the lack of horror, is it the lack of challenges, is it the lack of weapons (special awesome super weapons and upgrades).... What ever it is the game is definitely missing something that conjures fun.For someone that never thought or ever played a strategy based game, this game is well worth it. The traps are complex and they need to be placed in a bottle neck area to stifle large amounts of enemies. The enemies have different distinctive ablilties to help make it more engaging. So on and so on.... Once the game is beaten the re-playability is limited. I say give it a go at and have some fun. :)			"

The weapons feel a little limited, but ultimately it's more about the crazy traps anyways, and it's always fun to find more inventive ways to make the orcs cry.If you're reading this, and wondering if you should buy the game....

												This game is pretty fun.I'm sure this would only be fun as a multiplayer game. I play with friends and it can be very interesting, considering its like a first person tower defense game. You have a toon with weapons you can choose to upgrade. You also have an inventory of traps you can pay for which are laid down along the pathways that the Orc's will follow. This is pretty fun because it is a 3rd person shooter, with the strategies of placing traps on the floors, walls and ceilings. Not to mention your weapons can get pretty sweet. Its also very chill. The game speed is not too fast to make it a super tight tower defense game, but just fast enough to be entertained without spilling your drink all over your desk. I recommend this game to anyone who likes the strategy beat-em-up's. Its worth it for the experience. I got this game when it was on sale. It's currently listed for $14.99 which I think is a little much for the content, but it is an excellent game nontheless. 8/10			"

It even has many of the levels from the previous game in classic mode. Great stuff. Check out the original too. Even though this is a 100% improvement, there's still lots of fun to be had.			"

Each kill you make in it is very satisfying, the defenses are upgradable, and thre is a good few hours of gameplay (Im 1/2 done campaign at 6 hrs, and i still have some other non story levels to do, excluding DLC). Alot of people sa ""Dungeon defenders"" is better, but i personally think Orcs Must Die! 2 is a welcome addition to any library, and will keep you entertained for a few days.+Good combat with cool weapons and traps+Lots of level types+Lots of enemies-Not really a gripping story-There is only 2 playable characters (Although there are different skins)Good overall singleplayer, great with mates. 8/10			"

												A tower defense and a third-person shooter are mixed together in this game, where the objective is as simple as it could be: Orcs Must Die! As you go through either multiplayer or singleplayer you will receive skulls based on your performance, which you can spend to unlock anything from a Tar Trap to the truly hilarious Spring Trap, as well as weapons, trinkets and even costumes! Whats even better is that you are able to upgrade and choose a special ability for all of your orc-killing arsenal, making sure that you will be able to play the game over and over again, and still have a new layout for your traps, or a new set of traps to test out together. You are also able to choose from 2 heroes, both of which have traps and weapons that the other doesnt. Altogether, this game is one of best games Ive ever played, even though I barely played it at all. If I had to give this a score, it would be 9/10			"

												As the tower defense genre has gotten more popular there have been many games that have added to or improved upon the formula. This has allowed the genre to stay relatively fresh and not to become a tired trend. The original Orcs Must Die provided the interesting spin of not only forgoing the towers completely in exchange for traps, but putting the player directly into the fray themselves. Orcs Must Die 2 successfully adds to this formula in a number of ways.The goal of Orcs Must Die 2 is to protect the rift points of each level from the invading orcs and other creatures. First, the player must choose between the Warmage and the Sorceress, both with their own unique ability. Players are given a set number of slots for them to bring both weapons and traps. Some players may prefer to try their hand with minimal traps, while others will rely on them almost exclusively. As players progress through the game, they will be thrown new enemies, forcing them to adapt their strategies on each level. Based on their performance, players earn skulls, which allow them to unlock new traps, weapons, and even outfits for their character. Arguably, the largest addition is the cooperative multiplayer. Instead of taking on the hordes of orcs alone with a single loadout, you can now play with one other person, each with their own specific loadouts. This encourages teamwork in a number of ways. Strategic combinations of traps allow the duo to rack up combos, affording them more currency to place more traps or hanging onto the currency to get a better rating, and thus more skulls,  at the end of the level. Picking weapons that work well together allow for clearing out any stragglers that get past the traps or simply an easier time for those who prefer the more hands-on approach. The levels are appropriately sized for what's asked of the player. Many of the larger levels also give players shortcuts to different areas, ensuring they have ample time to respond to each wave of enemies that appears if they have a good strategy. While the perfect strategy might not be stumbled upon immediately, after a couple of tries the various choke points in the levels become more obvious with a couple of exceptions. Many levels also incorporate special traps of their own for the player to utilize, simply adding to the fun and strategy of a given place. Different enemies with different weaknesses encourage the player to use a variety of traps and weapons to find the playstyle that suits them best. While the option does exist to go heavy on the weapons, it's clear the game was designed around the use of both traps and weapons for a player to progress very far. This means only the most skilled third-person action players will have any chance at all of beating levels without the heavy use of traps.The art style and mixed rock soundtrack add a lot to the game's atmosphere and personality, which is far from serious. The Warmage and Sorceress bust into breakdancing after a particularly good performance. Sarcastic and humurous quips are constantly dropped by the heroes. Orcs and other enemies make exclamations about wanting their mother while they are chewed to bits by a wall grinder or other nefarious device. The amount of violence is large, but the exaggerated proportions of both the heroes and enemies leads to it not being disturbing to teenagers and adults.While Orcs Must Die 2 can be played alone, it is painfully obvious that is not the way the game is designed. Solo orcslayers will have a hard time making meaningful progression, especially in the higher difficulty settings. Large numbers of enemies, in combination with some of the more complex levels, makes micromanaging the stages without one defined choke point more of a chore than fun. This difficulty is greatly eased with the presence of a co-op partner. It's hard to recommend the game as a solo experience given the huge artificial spike in difficulty thanks to the game's focus. Certain levels crank the difficulty level up far too high past what was in the previous stage. Even with a co-op partner, most players will run into some of these stages like a brick wall that require a lot of frustration and annoyance to climb over. The story is bare minimum, and while not terrible, only really serves as an excuse for the chaos going on within the game's universe. Most players likely won't have an issue with this, but the game is not for those looking for a narrative heavy experience.Despite its flaws, Orcs Must Die 2 is incredibly fun and addictive. The thrill of getting five skulls on a level that has become the bane of your existence is hard to beat. With a friend, the game is guaranteed to provide you with hours of amusement and fun, even long after you've beaten the campaign, as long as you can deal with the steep difficulty spikes you encounter.

												Really a great game to play Solo or Multiplayer with a friend (Co-Op Campaigns/Storyline). Fun Storyline to play, sometimes a bit tricky how to handle a level. Basicly you'll just have to keep Orcs and other monsters (Trolls, Yeti's, Ogre's...etc) from your base. Defending is kinda hard to do on your own, so you get turrets (From slowing to arrowshooting turrets) and Guardians (Allied mobs that help you to defend the base like Archers, Knights and Dwarves <--  <3 ).I really recommend this game to all ages.

												This franchise is one of the best for you and your significant other to play together to take down hordes of Orcs in this hybrid 3rd-Person-Action/Tower Defense game.  The light-hearted humor of the idiot apprentice adds a unique charm to this game as you feel like you're playing a happy, orc-killing puppy that's just discovering the world.  The Sassy Sorceress who was (SPOILER BLANK)..... in the first game is a nice addition over the first installment as she has a different set of core powers and strengths.  With their powers combined, they are Captain Planet!....of... Orc Killing.Vols. 1 and 2 are graphically and stylistically the same.  Nothing revolutional here, just good fun.Says someone with too many hours into Tropico 2-5.			"

												This game is pretty amazing I have to say. I got 2 copies while it was on sale so I'd have someone to play it with, it came with all the expansions as well. The game is silly at times which is fine, the traps have a fun range to them and the coop makes it really fun. It also has mod support so people have changes some of the underwelming weapons and traps to make them better. Pros: Overall fun gameplay.Quite a few traps to have fun with.CoopA good selection of maps.Decent amount of comedy.Quite a few mobs to have to plan around.Traps are viscious and creating a gauntlet of death to watch them squirm through is a special kind of joy.Though I don't own the first game (so I can't compare this to it) it seems that if you do own it you can play the maps from that game in coop as there is a classic maps option.Cons:Some of the traps are kind of lame in their vanilla state (can be changed with mods though) for example, the void portal, it can't do anything by itself so you need to set it up with other traps to get enemies into it, it's freaking massive so finding a place to put the thing is is difficult, the ability to summon skeletons of the mobs that you throw in is cool in theory but they rarely spawn and they seem to die as soon as they're out of combat. Another example is the coinforge in my opinion, it's big and takes up alot of floor space that you could be using for other traps and all for, what I'd consider, a minor effect.Similarly some of the weapons seem underpowered, or overpowered, the dwarvern hammer can stunlock loads of people for easy kills, meanwhile the wind belt can't seem to kill anything directly and relies on throwing people off cliffs.All of the things I'd consider cons are really fixable by checking out the mods people made to fix the traps and such that are under-used, the game is 100% worth picking up in my opinion, especially if it's on sale. Was worth every cent. "

												To start off, this game is a strategy game (If you didn't already know). Now I think this game is actually pretty fun! Some levels really make you have to think about how to stop Orcs from entering here and there and how to make sure you have enough money for different traps and such! Some levels are just a bit too hard for what you have equipped and I don't really find myself wanting to replay the level after I fail which is a downfall for the game in my opinion. Besides that, I think it is a fun and exciting game and I would give it probably a 7/10 rating.			"

Playing through the solo campaign was a good time but the co-op was even better. They did a really great job balancing the levels and forcing the 2 players to work together to stop the never ending waves of Orcs. Since completing this game I've bought the original game and now I'm eagerly awaiting to see how Unchained will turn out.			"

												This is a good game. I enjoyed OMD I a great deal, but OMD2 less so. Why? It seems to have been designed around 2 player coop. The maps are pretty big and sprawling, and you'll be doing a lot of running back and forth frantically trying to defend multiple entry points. OMD I had this too, but with about 1/3 as much running. If you have a friend to play with, this is probably a blast, but it's sort of onerous as a single player game (but doable).			"

												All I can say is: GREAT GAME! I love tower defence games and this one just blows my mind! This game is not too easy nor not too hard either (unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty :D). It gives you a good challenge and a huge variety of towers to use and all other items to stop the orcs. I love that they included 2 different chracthers to the game and both of them has differents setups which allows you to try differents defences which weren't on the first orcs must die game. Great maps and great modes in this game, my personal favorite is the endless mode. In that mode you simply just fight so long as you can. CO-OP with a friend is a wonderful experience and it works great! If you have a friend who likes tower defence games and you also like them, then this game is for you guys! I rate this game 5/5 it is worth every penny.			"

												Trufly more fun than anyone had let on. Got it for free from purchasing a Gamecon Headset. The headset is breath taking with 7.1 Dolby surround sound. But Orcs Must Die 2 is probably the best part, this game takes the cake, fun goofy story, entertaining characters, whitty one liners and above all else, lots of death.			"

												Really fun game, albeit is kind of short to play by yourself you'll finsh it pretty fast, but its got enough replay value to try out all the different traps and weapons and is a pretty good way to kill some time and listen to decent plotline, if you have free time and it goes on sale, i would sugest picking it up as it is a fun play			"

												This game is one of the best FPS tower defence esc games that I have played in a while. Although I strongly feel that they highly encourage co-op gameplay with multiple paths for enemies to go which would be made much easier with 1 person covering each lane and with 1 person on each of the 2 clases gaining the benefits of both very easily. 9/10 but very focused on co-op gameplay  so grab a buddy and get killing orcs!!

												Really a great game to play Solo or Multiplayer with a friend (Co-Op Campaigns/Storyline). Fun Storyline to play, sometimes a bit tricky how to handle a level. Basicly you'll just have to keep Orcs and other monsters (Trolls, Yeti's, Ogre's...etc) from your base. Defending is kinda hard to do on your own, so you get turrets (From slowing to arrowshooting turrets) and Guardians (Allied mobs that help you to defend the base like Archers, Knights and Dwarves <--  <3 ).I really recommend this game to all ages.

Plenty of game modes to choose from to keep a challenge. Good price for all of the addon packs unlike certain games that will go unnamed. Also, great to play if you have a good friend, girlfriend/boyfriend who loves casual games or just someone to play with once in awhile. I definitely reccommend this game to anyone who likes to have a fun, casual time.			"

												I was bummed out that they nerfed the crossbow and broke the headshot registry, but there is a workaround of sorts... you just have to use the ice amulet to freeze the enemy and then headshots from the crossbow will register properly. Another annoying thing is if you want to try playing as the opposite character, you have to start from scratch. It would be nice if you could just switch your character at any time and have all your skulls intact. Co-op sounds good in theory but it's actually pretty awful unless you and your partner are completely intune with one another and you are both completely adept at playing.Even though it's not as good as the first one, there's still lots of fun to be had on the singe player campaign.

If you only play single player games you may want to try the origional OMD first. Overall thumbs up! 85/100 on my scale			"

												""Needs more Void Wall""Amazing fun in co-op, great base game, runs well on my 3 year old alienware laptop, plus adds great combo's in killing enemies, especially with physics.9/10 No Elsa skin for Enchantress			"

												I've never been a huge fan of tower defense, but this must be an exception. Immensely fun game in so many ways, FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT, play it with a friend or alone, I only wish the multiplayer mode allowed more than 2 players total but I mean...it's more than enough :)8.5/10			"

												Game is fun, easy control and a good time waster for 15 minutes or hours if needed!  Mixes tower defense along with 3rd person fighter/shooter style gaming, low learning curve but still is challenging as the levels progress.  One of my favorite games!			"

												Third-person, tower defense game and lots of fun. The co-op play works great. All DLCs are good, too. If I had to think of negatives, the story is sort of stupid and there is not endless content. If I hadn't finished all levels and upgrades, I would still be playing this game. I played it through alone on my own and eventually talked a friend into joining after I had finished and played through again, gladly.			"

												A nice round based game for killing the time.Here you got a dungeon where you can build traps for defending your base.So every round you are able to build different combinations.Nice small hack and slay action but no must have ;-)			"

												Overall pretty decent game.Got it in the humble bundle awhile ago and didn't expect it to be that great, looked at some footage since it was just sitting there and decided to give it a go. The game isn't exactly addictive but it makes you want to progress due to the ease of the levels and the fact that you can customise your gear with upgrades.I recommend this game if its under Â£10 as it will give you something to do but I wouldn't say its a top priority purchase at all. If anything just a time killer if you need one.			"

												A very good mix of RPG and Tower Defence. Play as a Warmage or Sorceress against a rift that summons orcs, you must kill them as well as build various traps in order to stop them leaving minesites and buildings. Very fun and addictive gameplay, and a great music soundtrack embedded within game.			"
