												It pains me to warn people off of the sixth installment of one of the most beloved series of all time. I have played every major Civ release since the original. This installment of Firaxis' flagship game continues their bad trend of releasing broken, unfinished AAA titles with AAA prices upon which they immediately pile DLC before fixing the core game.A short list of broken things in Civ VI (cribbed and edited from a post I made to /r/civ several days ago):- It is trivially easy to beat the AI at high difficulty while ignoring faith, science, culture, this little thing called having a navy, any kind of military conquest or might makes right kind of posturing, oh and air force, that's right, Civ VI has air units. In Civ VI you can regularly beat the game at high difficulty while totally ignoring the cultural, social and military technologies which have defined the last 600 years of human society.- The differences between the various civilizations as it applies to strategy are meaningless. A basic commerce & industrial zone build will allow you to steamroll the AI regardless of your starting Civ. Totally takes the flavor out of the game.- The map generator. Standard size map and continents means 2 land masses which stretch pole to pole. If the player is somehow misguided enought to build a navy, they will have to build two of them because the oceans are guaranteed to be completely cut off from one another.- Speaking of Navies - do not build them. They do not do meaningful damage to late game units. Seriously, embark a mechanized infantry and watch nuclear subs (!!!) take 5 or 6 rounds to sink ONE troop transport. Harald Hardrada can chastize me all he likes, there is simply no point to building navies in Civ VI. To the rocket surgeon who decided subs cannot go under ice: what were you thinking?!- Wonders are completely meaningless from a strategic perspective, extremely expensive to build and many require rare combinations of environment that are often not available the player. That said, they LOOK fantastic and the progressive build animations are really one of the game's highlights.- The UI: there are so many things it would be nice to know. What are my production bonuses on that city center? I do not believe there is any way of knowing what bonuses a city is getting from neighboring districts (production, ameneties). As these bonuses are a major factor in strategy, not informing the player is a HUGE oversight. Of course let us not forget to mention the lack of a build queue. Late game city, science and civics management is a repetitive click festivel of ""please research / build / do the same thing I selected 3 turns ago. sigh.""- The cultural victory system: my tourists + their tourists, some number or percentage of my tourists going to their country being equal to or lesser than my number of tourists who eat pork. Completely inelegant, furthermore the UI feels very inconsistent at actually reporting tourism correctly via the overlay.- Suzerain: neat idea, big creativity points, poorly executed and a boat load of strategy problems. I cannot go to war to defend my surrogate city states until VERY late game. Being allied with another AI does not preclude them from regularly attacking my city states! There is no diplomatic means to warn an AI off of attacking a city state, I have to make war on my ally or just give up and let them conquer a city state (often entirely within my country's borders). City states I do liberate reward me with peanuts. In past Civs those city states were your man for life. In Civ 6 you get 3 envoys. This is the equivalent of my country going to war, spending our soldier's blood to overthrow some vast oppressor at whose aftermath, the newly freed city state effectively throws some pocket change on the floor.- Warmongering - I stopped playing this game about the 4th or 5th time one of the AIs asked me to participate in a joint war and immediately denounced me for ... warmongering. All the style of the 'in joke' of Gandhi being nuke happy, none of the humor.- The ugly: how many games have I lost only to have to reload the turn before and try and figure out how I lost because the game does not tell me? Seriously, when the turn starts and my empire has been relegated to the dustbin of history, it would be nice to know WHO WON and WHY. Continued ugly: putting your unit on alert status does not work most of the time. Cities that can take a shot at an opponent do not highlight, you have to hunt around looking for them then click twice on the TINY crosshair in order to first set focus to that city's crosshair and then select a target. This sounds like a nitpick but in a large war it is a lot of hunting and clicking and you are bound to overlook one or more opportunities to lob rocks at your aggressor. The sound which signals a new barbarian camp has been settled does not have a corresponding ""AND HERE IT IS"" button or indcator leaving you to scan the map manually. Finally, the game crashes on close nearly 100% of the time if you have been playing for a couple hours or more.Frustrating is an understatement. Considering Firaxis has been making this game for over a quarter century (!!!), the problems with the title they released and we spent $60 US on are embarrassing. That we are one major patch in and the game still exhibits so many basic flaws (but we have lots of five dollar DLC!) is not the message from the developer which I intend to endorse with my wallet and neither should you.

												This game has some of the worst AI I have ever seen. The game introduced a newish idea, that each civilization, in addition to victory goals, would be driven by their own personal reasons. For example, the vikings like anyone with a strong navy, egypt anyone with a strong army, brazil hates anyone who gets lots of great people, and china hates anyone who builds a lot of wonders. This had potential to make games more complex, as it would allow you to form alliances that catered to your goal, and the goals of the AI.In practice, the system is horribly done. Let's go through a few turns of meeting the Vikings:Turn 1: Oh hi! We found the vikingsTurn 2: Oh they won't accept our gifts? That's weirdTurn 4: Vikings: ""Your navy is s***, we denounce you!""Turn 7: Vikings: ""Your navy is still s***, we declare war""You then spend about 20 turns at war, taking some citiesTurn 28: All other AI ""Warmonger. Warmonger. We declare war""How does that make any sense? Gorgo, one of the leaders of Sparta, will actually attack you for being weak, because they hate the weak. And the warmonger system makes 0 sense, as well. If someone declares war on you, and you take one of their cities in return, you are a warmonger. Did they capture some of your cities in a previous war, and you took them back? Warmonger. Another AI asked you to go to war with them to take out a second AI? Well now they both think you are a warmonger. It is absurd.			"

												TLDR - Interesting choices with city building, good graphics.  But AI and diplomacy is broken.I like the city districts and the strategic possibilities it entails.  But it feels like they spent all their time on that mechanic.Imagine being invited by a nation to help them fight a war, and then get denounced by the SAME country as a warmonger for your troubles.  Imagine getting suprised attacked by a nation, defending yourself and taking one of that nation's cities in retaliation and being denounced as a warmonger by that nation and everyone else.  Imagine liberating a nation long-dead for millennia, no acknowledgment of thanks, and then being denounced by the same liberated nation as a warmonger.  Welcome to Civ VI, where you are hated no matter what you do.  And no matter what victory condition you start with, you always end up wanting to nuke the &*$@#^& out of the nations around you.  For the first time in all the Civ games I've played I wished there was an option to execute opposing leaders, that's how annoyed I got.  Ah to see the eternally annoying Phillip II lose his head, now THAT would be fun...Wait there's more!  Imagine being asked for a gift of resources, plus gold, plus gold per turn.  You think to yourself, ""I feel generous today"" and offer at least the resources and the one-time gold, but not the gold per turn.  Well, these entitled♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥will tell you, ""Not good enough!  We want a gift from you the way WE say it.""  It's unreal.  So back to nuking them.  Honestly I cannot understand the thinking that went into the diplomacy, it's the worst I've ever seen.  It doesn't just feel unfinished, it's plain bad.  As usual your opponents get to say snarky comments and threaten and bully you and you get no options to respond.  This has been an issue for me in previous games too, but it's even more exquistely painful in Civ VI.  And the AI does ridiculous things like FLOOD your country with their missionaries and apostles, blocking your path and there's no option to even say, ""Hey, can you relax with the religion thing?""  I had to declare war multiple times just so I could move around my own empire.  And of course, the flood of hate and denouncing hits you from all sides.  I played king level and at the end of the game city states still had warriors and even some nations.  This game needed way more playtesting.  I hope like other Civ games it improves with patches, but I'm not pre-ordering a Civ game ever again.			"

												After numerous shorter games, and romperstomping my way through a huge map with 11 AI players, conquest only victory and epic timescale, I really feel that I've played enough to say that the AI in this game is an absolute joke. Really, this game isn't worth your time... Get Civ V instead - it's a far superior game...My key issues are as follows:1) The AI repeatedly declares war, sends nothing to attack you, then begs for peace some turns later prostrating themselves before you with offerings of gold and luxuries.2) When at war with the AI, they never attack. I remember playing Civ IV, and seeing armies building up on my border before the AI declares war. No behaviour of that sort is to be seen here.3) The AI is schizophrenic and utterly moronic. They will condemn you for warmongering, while frequently attempting to encourage you to join in their wars. Involving yourself in even a single war during an otherwise peaceful playthrough can lead to unanimous loathing from the AI, with constant denouncements being shouted at you.4) The AI never uses aircraft...5) The AI settles cities in any location they can, and leaves them completely undefended. The AI does not choose efficient locations for city building, and thus irritates that player into having to declare war in order to raze the cities and more efficiently use the land.6) The victory screen statistics are total garbage. There is no map replay.7) The UI feels a bit awkward, with various essential tools seemingly overlooked. There is, for example, no list of all units. If you want to find your builders, you must do this manually by scrolling over your empire. A further oversight is the lack of a global politics overview. If you want to know who is at war with whom, you must ""speak"" to each leader in turn, and look at their current relationships.Complaints aside, however, I have to say that this game is looks stunning - it is rich in detail and vivid in colour, and the wonder animations are an absolute delight. The sound design is fantastic, and music is memorable and quite beautiful. The new district system is absolute genius - making the process of building and laying out a city a substantially more interesting and nuanced process compared to Civ V. It's a terrible shame that the AI is just such garbage - it ruins the game. I used to play ""comp stomps"" with my friends on a fairly regular basis, but doing so in Civ VI would be a waste of time.Edit:Some people have suggested that I play the game on harder difficulties, but my understanding is that higher difficulty levels simply add a multiplier to the AI's output (e.g. they get a 2x production multiplier so that they can always outproduce you), and does not affect their behaviour. Since my biggest problem with the game is its broken AI, playing on harder difficulties simply gives them an advantage, but does not make them ""smarter"".Additionally, I think it's valid to compare the game to Civ V. I played Civ V from its initial 'vanilla' release, and (I realise that I'm referencing personal memories from ~6 years ago) do not recall being as disappointed with the AI after making the jump from the mature game of Civ IV to the then new game of Civ V. Therefore, I stand by my statement that Civ V is a better game. It is not more content that I desire, but a challenging, inteligent AI.			"

												Game was advertised with Steam Workshop support both before and after release. Now they have removed this tag from the store page entirely and staying totally silent on mod support, probably to keep people buying DLC.And as far as Civ games go, it's just very ""meh"". You'd be better off buying the complete Civ 5.			"

												Civ 6 had me hooked and playing late into the night for 80+ hours on ""King"" Difficulty for the past few weeks. So its doing something right at least. However even with all its greatness I have to not recommend it at this time. Civ 6 has a few issues that are infuriating to the point I did not want to play the game anymore even when I felt the ""One more turn"" urge to keep playing.First the changes that made me love Civ 6;-Art style: I actually like the style, especially the map fog which I assume everyone likes.-Barbarians: Holy jebus they can actually be a challange to deal with. Even late game when you least expect it.-Districts/Wonder Placement: Actually make city placement and specialization more thought provoking and fun.-Tech/Culture Eureka/Inspiration: Another good feature that can effect your gameplay style of a game.-Great Persons: if you want em you gotta go after them vigorously. And they range from ""Oh neat"" to ""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THATS AWESOME""-Various other things but here comes the long rant...Now the things that made me wonder what I was doing with my life playing Civ 6 (Mostly AI related);-UI/Infromation: So much detailed information is just GONE from Civ 5. You gotta memorize your luxurious resource trade deals because the game will not tell you how many you had in total or who you traded it to/from. You have no clue how well religion is spreading. You cannot look at Units special abilities. Combat Numbers do not accurately indicate the amount of damage your unit will deal. You have no way to look at deal historys with other civs. the ""Gossips"" tell you everything you don't need to know, from england building a granary to your civ trading with another civ the turn you setup a trade deal.-AI Agendas/Diplomacy: First off, the Agenda system is not a bad ""Idea"" its just the AI does not execute it correctly in relation to diplomacy and AI Insanity. Bottom line, if you are doing well, they will hate you, leading to all the AI denouncing eachother as well. If you manage to find ONE AI that tolerates you enough to become an Ally, they will do everything in their power to not be your friend/ally behind the scenes. Like declaring war on you for no reason.-Ai Combat Tactics/Peace terms: Speaking of declaring war, the AI are so bad at tactical combat that the Barbarians can wipe them out given the minor opportunity. They tend to fall behind in higher Tech Units because they don't upgrade their units usually. Also I think they were either programed to be complete panzies or their military command give out their orders in different languages to each unit. Because 90% of the time they will not attack anything in melee unless they can one shot it. If their HP drops to 60% that unit will run away. This leads them to just shuffle outside completly outmatched cities with a single archer able to fend off 10-15 units by himself without them even attacking the city. then the AI goes pants on head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and decides all hope is lost and will give you EVERYTHING they own for peace.-AI General AI Batshit insanity: The AI in Civ 6 are more akin to an Alien then a human player because they act insanely random. I would say they act like Civ 5 Ghandi but at least he was predictable with his madness. ""We have been best friends for thousands of years sharing trade and tech-DECLARES WAR ON YOU"" ""Wanna do a joint war against this Warmongering prick burning down my cities? YOU ARE A WARMONGERER!"" They are such massive hypocrites like the Joint War example. EVERYTHING they ask you to stop doing, They are currently doing to you but x10, Units near borders in particular even if its a single unit 2 tiles away in your own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ territory while they have a massive army IN your borders.-War, War Never Changes, (Except it does for the worse): War in Civ 6 is now a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because unless you declare war on people within 20 turns of the game, WARMONGERING. even the casus belli's do nothing to change this (Except Liberation wars which never happen because nobody likes you), the ""Severity"" of Warmongering penalties translate to ""How long they will hate my guts"" not ""How much they will hate my guts"" so no matter how justified your war is, everyone will denounce you for declaring war on anyone, even the people who joined the war with you. Because you are a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ marching your forces to go punch that genocidal civililization in the face, who kick puppies for fun. Next on the agenda of war is ""War Weariness"" this as a good mechanic that falls off the mark due to its execution. Because yes it makes it so you cannot just be at war forever and kill everyone. But it screws over the AI while it forces the player in the late game to keep wars in short increments or have all your cities get pissy. This screws over the defender/AI because War Weariness skyrockets in cities being fought around. probably why the AI caves and throws everything they have at you, I've sieged a city and within 2-3 turns barbarians spawned around it and it turned into a 3-way fight.-Last but not least, PACING: The games pace is so wrong, without rushing science you will have nukes by the Napoleonic Era. Epic game speed is the old standard speed. You will never stay long enough in one era to enjoy it. Finally once you hit the Atomic Era the game speed kicks into high gear rushing the game into a suddon stop. You will get the coolest tech and units 5 turns before you achieve a Science victory, possible to not even get them with a Culture victory.I've stopped playing my current game because of these problems which I desperately hope get patched or something as there is a game in here that I love. but I can't play it without feeling like I'm a cat chasing blind deaf and stupid mice to a finish line on the counter. sure there are many ways to get onto the counter and the mice ""could"" reach it. but one jumped off the counter, another♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in my cat-bowl, the final one thought we were buddies then had a brain aneurysm and tried to bite me but had no teeth and just gnawed on me And before you say ""Raise the Difficulty."" thats just tying rope to the mice to pull them towards the goal faster. They are still Blind Deaf and Dumb.			"

												Civ VI has all the promises of being great, but is being held back by what I can only assume is lack of development time.I've enjoyed the game so far and I'm certain I'll keep playing it for awhile, but after some 60 hours the novelty is wearing off and the flaws that I initially wrote off as rare quirks can now be seen clearly as major problems.There are minor bugs all over, most of them more annoying than gamebreaking but they are very clearly things that should have been on a ""to-fix"" list after in-house playtesting, yet they're present in the released game. I've had very few technical issues (game hanging upon exit being the only one) and I can understand why those are generally hard to track down, but UI elements getting stuck, being declared war on by a civ you have not yet met or by your own civ, both Greek civs being able to have the same leader in the same game, diplomacy faux pas penalties despite no transgressions, war weariness not decreasing, painfully obvious production -> gold exploits? These are things that should not make it into the final game, or in worst case be fixed with a release day patch.Significantly worse though is the atrocious AI. I was playing as China, had built a desert hills city where I builder rushed Petra, two turns after it's completed Scythia turns up with an army of horsemen, the city has no fortifications and not a single unit within five-six turns of brisk march. Welp, that city's clearly done for... except the horsemen proceed to parade up and down the flood plains, both city-side and not, rather than bang their heads against my non-existant walls and taking that (better than Civ V pre-nerf power level) sweet sweet wonder. I find an archer somewhere that starts taking pot shots at the horsies, a few turns later I can buy ancient walls and a crossbowman joins the archer and fifteen turns later the riverbank is red with horse- and manblood. Not a single horseman ever attacked the city. I meet Russia, they're so impressed by my culture and science and everything else (they were at least an age, propably two behind me) they want to be bestest friends forever and five turns later they hate me and declare war. Then nothing. More nothing. Twenty turns later a spearman appears. Then two more. Then Tsar Peter offers me the entire russian state earnings and his own personal allowance to please stop the bloodshed. Had he used that money in some other fashion, such as actually funding an army to attack me with the game could have been somewhat challenging.And that's a huge problem, the AI is so bad it makes the game far too easy, and when I as a player make mistakes I'm not punished for them - I'm actually rewarded no matter if I play well or poorly.The barbarian AI is largely far better, which is hilarious in it's own way. Start a large or huge pangea map, plod around for 20-30 turns and you'll typically see several of the other civs succumb to barbarian invasion. Maybe the barbarian AI developers should have a chat with their civ AI colleagues, because the former beats the latter hands down every time.Lastly there's a glaring lack of what I'll categorize as ""interface features"". There's no Civ V-esque option to see terrain tiles clearly separated, because honestly woods and rain forest blend together real well under the fog of war in explored territory, separate desert from plains same story. Hills can be deciphered using the strategic view but otherwise can be tricky to spot. The civilopedia is half-baked at best, not explaining alot of game features and details. Unit stats are scarce, there's melee strength, ranged/bombard, movement, and then there's ""excellent against mounted units"" without any actual numbers, unless you train the unit and there's a mounted unit you can feign an attack on to get the tooltip stats (which are excellent). Why can't I be allowed to see those stats before training the unit? There's no ""restart game"" feature like was added in Civ V after player requests. When starting a new game, the game always uses the same settings (small continents) instead of the settings you last set.Want to use your city attack against that invading knight when you have three other units stationed in the city? How about just clicking on the city with units stationed? Better work on your scroll wheel micro, because you need to zoom in/out a bit to simply be able to click the city instead of something else. Want to see religious follower stats without clicking on a religious unit? Sorry, can't do without clicking on each city.The game is extremely well polished in the art/music deparment, one might not enjoy the style or agree with some of the choices but that's an esthetic choice, not a flaw of the game. The intro movie is absolutely awesome and these set the bar for a great gaming experience. As long as the experience I get is a mediocre one and the AI keep tripping on it's own shoelaces I cannot recommend others paying money for Civ VI. I have no doubt the game will see a string of patches in the near future, but the game needs an AI overhaul to stand the test of time.			"

The Short of It: While Civilization VI isn't a bad game, it is quite fundamentally flawed and comes in no way close to its predecessors, Civ IV and V. If you're new to the series, definitely play those instead, or if not, go for Endless Legend, why not. All three are better experiences than Civ VI.The Long of It: The Civilization series should be well-known to all gamers, but not everyone has actually played the games. The groundlayer of the turn-based 4X-genre, Civilization takes a player, and his empire, from the Stone Age to the Information Age, with the player making decisions on where to focus in terms of scientific research, military development, cultural progress, expansion, and many other factors. Every game is different, not just in terms of player-determined settings, but also in terms of map layout, rival civs, etcetera.The Right of It: Civ VI improves one thing greatly compared to its predecessors, and that is city development. The Districs system really forces you to think, and to specialize. Gone are the days of a single city building every improvement and Wonder. It's just not possible anymore, and that's a good thing. With the districts-system, Science and Production are no longer the be-all, end-all of games which need to be focused on primarily.Barbarians are no longer the pointless annoyances they were in the previous games. They're much deadlier now, and every civ needs to stay on its toes. This definitely gives the barbarians-element some much needed relevance.A few other nice improvements made it to Civ VI, including military/noncombatant escort formations (finally!), expendable builders (which deals with unit clutter), mix-and-match cultural policies, and Eureka!-boosts for techs and civics, earned by fulfilling all kinds of mini-tasks. Now, if they'd just stuck to that, Civ VI would have been a straight-up improvement over VI, but sadly, there's a lot to discuss when I point out...The Wrong of It: With all the desire for innovation and change, Civ VI trips over itself in quite a few departments, in same cases making the game frustrating and irritating to play.The diplomacy system is, for want of a better word, a complete disgrace. Rival Civs will all, without exception, viciously loathe each other, including you, denouncing each other and you as often as they can, even when you've done them absolutely no wrong. One Civ had several diplomacy bonuses from good relations, but still declared me filth because we had a different system of government. Meanwhile, the A.I. leaders will not stop spamming you with pointless messages every turn, and because they, for some reason, need to slowly fade out twice, it's an infuriating habit which costs you a lot of time and has no benefit at all.You might as well never bother with trade deals either. The AI will never, ever agree to a trade deal, nor suggest one, which doesn't favour them at least 3:1, even if they are pathetically weak. Their deals are nothing short of extortionate, and all they do is waste your time with more pointless interruptions, because you'd never, ever accept any of their deals anyway. As for espionage, well, expect all the A.I. opponents to focus only on you, sabotaging your Industrial Zones relentlessly, causing you to gnash your teeth as you waste yet more turns rebuilding things.What few friends you have will, guaranteed, suddenly declare war on you for no reason at all, even though they're much weaker than you are and have nothing to gain from the conflict. And then, within ten turns, they'll come begging on their knees for peace. Refuse, and the entire world will hate you even more for being a warmonger. That's right, you will be a warmongering menace to the world even if you never once declare war. Having war declared on you and defending yourself is apparently an atrocity. This kind of system makes a player wonder if this game was even playtested at all.In fact, it's not just diplomacy, really. The A.I. in general is often downright moronic.The choice of art style, as well as the writing, are questionable to say the least. While it's true that Civ V was high on realism, and therefore seriousness, Civ VI has taken to the other extreme. The art style is jarringly cartoony, with leaders looking like caricatures and the map nauseatingly green and yellow, the UI is ugly with oversaturated colours, and the educational quotes that came with tech discoveries have been replaced with cringey pseudo-witty pop culture soundbites from comedians and other assorted funny-people. Not even Sean Bean's excellent narration can save the writing from being eye-rollingly lame. All things combined, Civ VI has the look of one of those crappy mobile games.Lastly, the Civilipedia isn't much help. The game neglects to explain a lot of things and looking them up in the Civilipedia doesn't help one bit. You're supposed to smell that you can only build a single Archaelogist per city that has an archaeology museum, for instance. Often, building options will be grayed out without any explanation as to why. And don't get me started on National Parks. Ugh.And of course, once more, many civilizations and mechanics are not present, or in a bare-bones way, which means Firaxis has once more held back things which were present in the previous game, only to release them in expensive DLC packs. It's a nasty habit, and every game developer should ask itself some serious questions when it resorts to deliberately holding back game content to be able to release it as DLC later.The Last of It: Civ VI has some good ideas, but its positive elements don't come close to making it as good as Civ IV or Civ V. It's certainly not a bad game, but as an entry in the Civilization series, it falls far short of the standards the franchise holds itself to. Seriously, get the previous Civs instead, or if you've played those, give Endless Legend a go.			"

												Civilization 6 is a good game, but not if you compare it to Civilization 5, which is just a much better game. Civ 6 does some things better than Civ 5, like for example the district system, the finished wonder animations, culture, great people, espionage and trade routes. Some things that I liked in Civ 5 are worse in civ 6, like statistics, map, A.I, resources and religion.One thing that might be insignificant to you is the map showing owned water tiles as if they were land tiles. To me that is just a fun killer since I love looking at the map to see the empire I have created. In this system it just looks like a blob instead of an empire.The A.I in Civilization 6 is pure garbage. In one game I played I had declared war ONCE in the entire game. One time in 354 turns (1932 A.D) and every single A.I denounced me for being a warmonger when I did it on like turn 100, and renewed their warmonger denouncements continualy through the rest of the game, despite me not starting a single war since then. I think this is why the A.I for some reason counts wars declared against you as you being a warmonger, which is just beyond stupid.- The A.I is also incapable of fighting human players. All I did to win every single war was to just sit there and do nothing until the A.I gave up. They send like one or two units into my land and that's it. I play on immortal difficulty.- The A.I mocked me by saying my economy was weak and that I would go bankrupt soon...I had the strongest economy in the game.- Diplomacy...I might be overly harsh on this game, but that is only because I have like 2.000 hours on Civ 5, and I'm making a lot of comparisons between Civ 6 and Civ 5. It seems like they're doing the same ""mistake"" they did with Civ 5, where the game was fixed through multiple expensive DLC's.At Civilization 6's current state, I will say you're better off just buying Civilization 5 if you don't have that.This is a subjective review, so treat it as such.

												TL;DR: At the current state I cannot recommend this game. Not until the issues with the AI mechanics have been truly addressed.Civilization is one of my absolute favorite game brands so I was naturally really excited about the Civilization VI and also preordered the game. The reason for my late review is that my laptop unfortunately broke fairly soon after the release and I was without a PC until only very recently. After around a hundred hours I've now reached the conclusion that this game has a few core issues in how the AI acts that make it extremely frustrating and hard for even the most open-minded player to fully enjoy the game. I've tried my very best to overcome the downsides for the sake of the many upsides and enjoy the game. However in the end I just can't overcome the main downside of the game. The graphical design is fantastic and the game packs with many welcomed ideas or enhancements like the districts and new wonder placement, day-night cycle, new city state mechanics and the beautiful drawn map.A major thing the Civilization V was lacking was a proper diplomacy and that's what Firaxis wanted to upgrade in the 6th installment of the series. The ending result was the idea being great but the implementation not that much. In this review I will focus on those few major points that keep me from recommending this game despite how much I love it otherwise.The AI constantly denounces you for unrealistic reasons. A few of them being: ""your military is too weak"", ""you have so much that I do not"" (having one other luxury resource that the AI doesn't), ""you have accuired more great people than I have"", ""you have a different coverment policy than I have"" or ""you haven't spread your religion to my city yet"". It's absolutely frustrating when you try your best to be friendly with the AI but the relationship either starts right off negative or ends up going there very swiftly. In short the AI most of the time thinks and acts like a very close-minded pessimist.The other negative aspect of the game goes hand-in-hand with the issue I mentioned above. All the AI Civilizations are more or less warmongers that seek any possibility to declare war on you. My ""best"" experience was when in a very early game (below turn 50) I met an AI and they immediately declared war on me. This was followed by every other AI in the game (3) declaring war on me one by one during the next couple of turns. Half of these AI's I had not even met yet. What makes the situation more absurd is that every time when you counter the attack of an AI who has declared war on you, the other AI's denounce YOU as a warmonger. ""The world shall know truth about you"". How does that make sense?The recent Australia update supposedly came with minor adjustments and tuning for the AI as well but I honestly can't see much of an improvement. The core issues are still there. Instead of pushing out new DLC for the game I'd hope that Firaxis would patch the base game so it wouldn't feel so unfinished. It is no coincidence that this game has gotten really mixed reviews so far and as a new buyer I would hold my purchase for now. I will gladly change my rating later on when the issues with the AI mechanics have been addressed properly. I love Civilization and it greatly saddens me to give this game a negative review even if it wasn't my final opinion.			"

Posted: November 20, 2016
												This is the first Steam review I have ever written.  I am prompted to write this based on how disappointed I am in this game.  I have owned every single version of Civilization since Civ 1, including Alpha Centauri, and this is the first version I would not recommend.Here are my opinions of the “Good”, the “Marginally Bad”, and the “Really Bad”.GOOD:Temporary Builders:  I did not like this at first, but have come around to appreciating the design choice to have builders expire after 3 uses.  It keeps the unit clutter down, and forces the player to make productions choices all throughout the game.Military Unit Scaling:  This seems improved.  There are no longer such big jumps in unit power that used to occur at particular times in the tech tree.  Unit’s gradually improve as you tech-up in a more sensible way.Barbarians:  The game designers clearly put a lot of work into this, and it shows.  Barbarians are challenging and fun.  It adds a real threat to the early-game.City State and Envoys:  I like the envoy mechanism of influencing city-states.  It seems more realistic and natural than the Civ-5 system.Civ Selection:  I do like the new civ and leader selections.MARGINALLY BAD (or Needs Improvement):Districts:  I like the design concept of districts… the need to plan ahead for city development.  It’s a nice design feature, but I feel that there could be some improvement in how it’s implemented.  First, there needs to be more non-district building options.  Historically, cities do specialize, but not to the extent pushed in this game.  There needs to be more basic city improvements that are not tied to districts.  Also, some districts are poorly thought out… the Entertainment Complex comes to mind.  Every city needs amenities to be healthy, so forcing the player to use up a district for these improvements runs counter to the city-specializing concept.Roads:  If Builders expire after 3 uses, then there are problems with using them to build roads… you would have to make tons of them to get anywhere.  However, auto constructing roads along trade routes is not a sensible fix to that problem.  Instead, they should have added a road-builder unit that also expires… after maybe 6 uses or so.  As it stands, you end up choosing trade-routes in the early game more for building roads where you need them, rather than for the trade you receive.  This is counter to the idea of trade-routes.  Apparently, the designers didn’t understand how advanced players use roads as both a military tool and exploration tool.  And historically, roads were built for these reasons just as much as for trade.Graphical Design:  I don’t hate the cartoony graphics, but I don’t really like them either.  Also, although it does make for a clearly defined map, the additional graphical touches tend to clutter up the map more than in previous games.  Also, for some resources, it’s not as easy to see at a glance the difference between improved and not improved as it used to be in Civ-5.  I much prefer the Civ-5 graphical aesthetic.Culture:  I see what they were attempting with the separate culture tree… they clearly desired to allow more customization of your Civ.  In practice though, culture doesn’t really end up feeling like culture anymore, and just feels like an alternate tech-tree (and that’s exactly what it is).  This approach is more flexible, but something has been lost in the translation.  Also, I do like the ability to adjust your cultural benefits on the fly, but it seems too easy and fast.  There should be more consequence to doing so than just gold-cost.   I miss the days when changing government type was a big-deal, and required careful planning.REALLY BAD:Diplomacy:  This is so bad it gets it’s own subsections…     Denouncing:  OMG this is bad.  The AI civs will start denouncing you early and often for trivial things, and they never stop.  I have been denounced for having a different government than an AI civ, for building more wonders than them (is that bad?), for keeping a city that I conquered about 1000 years in the past, etc.  I am forced to wonder if the designers have actually played this game at all.  It’s ridiculous.     Trade deals:  The AI civs will propose the most insane trade deals.  They always expect you to lose out on every trade deal at a rate of about 2 to 1… they expect you to trade 2 resources for their 1.  They never offer better deals, no matter what your relationship.  It makes the trade-deal feature a complete waste of time.  I hit the escape key the second it pops up without even looking at it anymore.     Comments:  The AI civs will continually interrupt the game to make senseless comments on everything you do.  You get spammed with the diplomacy window almost every turn… and not for anything you have to make a decision about… just random comments.  Again, I have to wonder if the designers ever actually played this game.AI (or lack of AI):  This is the big one… this is so incredibly bad.  I have played well into the Atomic age on King level.  All the AI civs were still running around with primitive units while I was driving along their shores with Battleships and building planes.  And, I wasn’t even really trying to tech up fast… I was more into exploring the game’s features.  This never happened in Civ-5 at the higher levels.  Also, unlike previous Civ games, the AI doesn’t know how to build a Civilization.  Again, in the Atomic age, there were still many primitive Wonders that were unbuilt and available… like the Colossus and Coliseum… that’s ridiculous.  They should just rename it from “Artificial Intelligence” to “Artificial Idiot”.Warmongering Penalty:  I had hoped this would get fixed from Civ-5.  If someone declares war on you, and you kick their butts and take their cities, you are not a war monger… you’re just effective.  However, this game will punish you for that.  What are we supposed to do, allow other civs to declare war, and then once they start losing let them off the hook just to have them do it again 10 years later?  The game should keep track of who started hostilities, and adjust accordingly.SUMMARY:Although there have been some improvements in the basic game design from Civ-5 to Civ-6, there are enough misses to make this game a “Do Not Recommend”.   The AI is so bad that it makes the game completely unenjoyable.  And the Diplomacy is so annoying that even if you like beating up on the “Artificial Idiot”, you will be irritated to the point of just shutting it down.  The big design changes… Districts and Culture and interesting but can use some more tweaking… especially Culture.Maybe after an expansion or two that fixes things, this game might be worth it, but as it stands, it’s not.  Currently (and yes even at its’ launch) Civ-5 is a much better game. "

												Positives:- Graphics are more pleasing to the eye.- More options for declaring war.- AI more realistic at points, especially when you are taking their cities.- More map customization. - Districts make cities a lot more fun to micro-manage.- Roads are no longer the extreme burden on finances they once were.- The policy card system means that you can customize your civ a lot more.- Religious units can be moved around the map to convert cities, and can heal. - The tech and culture trees are well thought out. Cons:- Districts can make island maps a pain, as well as land maps, as the AI will settler rush you.- You have to declare war just to stop settler spam from wiping out your civ. If you want to be a peaceful civ, then expect to lose the game - unless going for a tech victory. - Religious units are heavily overpowered and have too fast movement. It is easy to be absent-minded and then see 10 religious units at your capital the next turn - because the game gives no warning. Kinda important since they can wipe out your whole religion, and you can't get it back. - Barbarians heavily overpowered to the point that it makes gameplay slow and tedious on higher difficulty.- Even the AI struggle to fight the barbarians, and often many of their city tiles are razed, and besieged by barbarians even in the Modern Era. - Need to play a lot more wide than previous games, whereas before you could make do with 3-4 cities, Civ 6 makes you have at least 5-6. - The game requires way too much system resources just to run the game, and without warning they upped the requirements. Tactic to get people who can't run the game to buy it? OR just don't care?- Diplomacy system is worse than Civ 5, if that is possible, and the Civs randomly condemn for no reason.- Basically take elements from Civ 3, Civ 4, Civ 5, and don't do a great job of it.- Spy system is okay, but they should have followed after Beyond Earth with it. No incentive to use spies but to stop tech stealing and sabotaging production. - DLC's are over-priced and offer far less than they did in Civ 5 or Beyond Earth.  - Spending a lot of money on a game that is worse in many areas than the previous game. If you are on a budget or just want to play a Civ game, then try earlier games, as you aren't gaining anything great by buying Civ 6. But if you are into the Civ genre, and want something different to Civ 5, then I guess this foots the bill. But if you want a 'better game' than earlier Civ games, then you are sure to be dissapointed. I don't know how some come to the conclusion that it is an 'out of the this world' like experience, as it isn't. IF I was to be super harsh then this is taking Settlers or Rise of Nations style graphics, adding the Rise of Nations card system, and then mix and matching elements from previous games to make a frankenstein monster of the Civ genre, with a few new addons like districts. Whether you enjoy the game or not, you walk away feeling like you didn't get what you thought you ordered. Fair warning. You can enjoy the game once you get over its downsides and game bugs though.

												Is this a bad game? No not at all. Is this a good game? YesIs it a great game living to Civilization standards? No. Lots of good, lots  of bad. The diplomacy system is dreadful. The AI denounces you, if you breath differently. You can't trust your allies because they spy relentlessly. One minute they praise me for my culture then next there denouncing me for my culture. I got called warmonger for, being attacked by the Aztecs 3 times. Then I formally declared war and got blasted, when I had goo reasons for war. I hope fireaxis games fixes this soon. Map looks great, cities  districts are awesome addition, resources are more meaningful... But diplomacy AI are nearly game breaking.			"

												After a good first impression, the bad sides of Civ VI became more and more obvious to me. Although it has maybe more to offer than vanilla Civ V, it still lacks of content. The beginning of the match is relatively fast, but as building certain wonders, or also settlers or important buildings takes many, many turns, you find yourself spending a lot of turns just doing nothing, just waiting for the next turn, as you can't do anything interesting. And even worse, what you *can* do, is additional, annoying micro-management: the builders can only improve 3 grounds and get disposed afterwards. So in addition to waiting for buildings to finally get finished, you interrupt your slow progress to spend money that you'd prefer to spend otherwise on new builders, or you stop building an important building, again for a new builder. As you will need at least 3 builders to improve enough grounds around any city, you can imagine how long it takes. Civ V did a far better job with the automatic builders which you could tell not to remove forests and so on. The same applies with the new districts... a nice idea in theory, but as the districts have no point until you have some actual buildings on them, again you spend dozens of turns till you get everything done. It takes years to get into action and therefore Civ VI's gameplay is far less fluent and dynamic than the one of Civ V.The AI was a big flaw at the beginning and is still not really good, the AI players are or way too weak or way too strong and you cannot coexist with any neighbour - as soon as only one border separates you from another player, you will be unable to have good relations with him, whatever you do. The designs of the world leaders are quite inconsistent and also ugly, they are partly really annoying with their gestures and sounds (""huu huu... Aaahi!!"" what the hell)... and there are very little diplomatic options. Diplomacy and AI were never a pro aspect of the Civ games and it is sad to see that there was no improvement in comparison to Civ V.Also the graphics are not really consistent. The undiscovered map is very beautiful, but the rest is too comic-like and the whole thing looks too much like a boardgame to me. Civ V looks far more beautiful. Another problem: Unfortunately resources are not as obvious as in Civ V and you will need to work with additional map symbols so that you don't miss them.Combat hasn't really been improved. Air combat is as slow as it was Civ V, archers still can strike at a distance of 2 fields but bazooka troops and machine gunners only 1... I think that it would be better for Civ to change its combat system drastically, following the example of Age of Wonders, where combat is fought on an additional tactical map. This would make the fights also much more epic when you maybe succeed winning with stone age bowmen against modern troops.Therefore the very good ratings on the magazines surprise me because already during the first match those flaws were quite obvious. I also only finished 2 matches so far, because I always got bored after 2-3 hours when the same monotoneous routine of annoying builder management and clicking ""next turn"" kicked in. Maybe the game is more ""complete"" than Civ V was, but it is not better. Old weak points remained, new weak points were added.Also finishing a match is not very satisfying. First of all, at the moment achieving science victory is way too easy. And second: Why is there no epilogue? Ok, thank God there is at least a little video, while Civ V had nothing but a picture. But after spending maybe dozens of hours on one single match, why not do something special? This would be a great feature: A spoken ending sequence, an epilogue in which the history of your civilization from scratch till the end is summarized, like: spent two centuries in war, built many miracles in ancient times, was the first one to build an airplane, was the most peaceful and never declared war, was constantly attacked by (nation), was feared for destroying captured cities...To make it short, Civ VI is a victim of what we Germans would call ""Verschlimmbesserung"", which means, trying to improve something, maybe with good intentions, but actually failing and making it worse instead. The most significant changes to Civ V are a different style of graphics of which it is hard to tell if it is now more good or bad, and tons of additional unnecessary micro-management.I cannot recommend buying it for now (Jan 2017). Let's see what the upcoming patches and DLCs will change - until then, thumbs down.			"

												+Intro video. The intro is great. Although it is no Baba Yetu, the video combined with the awesome score had me in chills. The last game's intro was really good as well but this one was just spectacular and a great way to introduce players to what will be an extravagant game. +Main menu. Very good looking and very intuitive. It is much more simple this time around, with few sub-menus that you have to nagivate just to start or continue a game. The options panel has many, many settings. There is also a ""New to Civ VI"" advisor option for returning players. There is now a benchmark to test your system.+Civics and research.I thought, coming into this, that I would not like a second tree, but it in fact helps to expand the gameplay especially with the addition of governments and policies. Research now adds more to your game, not just a building and a unit here and there. The game feels like it is tailoring itself for you quicker than it would in Civ V.+Governments, policies and casus belli.One thing I thought that I was certain to hate was the removal of social policies and the addition of governments and policies, especially with the card system. However, it has turned out to be very useful especially when you need a specific resource like gold or faith, or if there are many barbarians surrounding you. You can unlock more governments and policies in the civics and research trees. Casus belli, which is a justification for war, is a great addition to this game. There are many different casus belli in the game. Declaring a liberation war can be used if someone has captured one of your or one of your allies' cities. The warmonger penalty for this is nothing, but only for the recapture of that city. There is a holy war, which is war on a civilization whose religion has been spread to one or more of your cities. All warmonger penalties for this are halved. There is also a  reconquest war, protectorate war and a few more.+Districts. I also thought that I would dislike districts and having to manage each one and finding space to build each one, pre-planning cities etc. But it had turned out to be a service and a great addition to the game. There are many more district types than I had initially realised. This all sums up to a very unique game.+Huge maps. Compared to the pre-installed maps in Civ V, these maps are huge and a treat to explore! I recommend setting the amount of civilizations in your game to upwards of 8. It had taken me over 150 turns to find another civ in a game of 8 civs on Continents. I was really starting to question whether there were any other civs or not.+Great people and promotions. Great people are truly great. Each unique great person has a unique ability, except for the great prophet. This mixes the gameplay up a bit and adds variation.Promotions now have their own tree. They also heal the unit, not to full health though which is still a very nice feature. +Trading, envoys, and builders. Trading takes on a new format which I feel is much more customisable. Traders add roads as they travel and have new bonuses.Envoys are better ways to handle gifts from city states. You do not have to be an ally (or suzerain) with a city state to receive its bonus, just send an envoy. Builders now have charges like Great Prophets, Missionaries and Inquisitors did in Civ V. This might seem like a bad thing, but they get the job done on the turn that you order them to do it.+Game length. In Civilization VI, the developers have stated that they have tried to lower the game length to just get through everything faster. This is definitely a positive thing. Before this game was released, I started a Standard Speed game from Ancient era in Civilization V. After playing for around 10 hours, I was in the industrial era. After around 10 hours on Standard from the Ancient era in Civilization VI, I have almost completed the Research and Civics trees.This helps to filter out all of the repetitiveness and the waiting around and it does a good job at that.+Graphics. The graphics, which can be considered cartoony, I don't mind. The graphics in Civilization V were definitely more realistic than they are in Civilization VI. This doesn't particularly bother me, I don't mind how the graphics look. If anything, the graphics look quite nice. If it bothers you, then consider everything else in the game before you decide to not buy it.+-AI. The AI in the game is okay. The only reason that the AI isn't a negative for me is because I like that they have agendas and the gossip features and how they react to some things that you do. After watching the AI match and reading peoples' complaints, it looks like the AI has multiple issues, like the placement of districts and expanding their civilization. The AI would also declare war and then make a peace treaty soon after. There were pillaged tiles and sitting units for most of the game. These things don't particularly bother me. I can still play a game fine with these issues but it looks like it really riles people up.+-Few glitches at launch. From launch, the game has very few glitches. However, here are some which I have enoucntered. Mousing over the messages which appear on the right of the screen as they did in the previous game does not always reveal what the message is. You need to fiddle with your mouse a bit for it to finally show. Also, meeting a new city-state has three separate messages and it would be nice if they were incorporated into one to unclutter the screen. The game does have a system of making multiple messages into one. It should do this for these city state messages.-Amenities, housing and others. Although it can be fun to micromanage these small additions, it feels more like Cities: Skylines than Civilization in this respect. Being able to queue productions was a neat part of Civ V, but it has been removed from Civ VI.			"

												**11/24/16 Updated Review - Fall 2016 update**  New Rating (6/10)Some improvements have been made to the AI, but it is still ineffective at fielding a modern military and attacking effectively. Also, the warmongering penalties for taking cities still apply irrespective of the war initiator.  The ""freeze when exiting to desktop"" bug is unfixed. **Original 11/03/16 Review** (Rating: 4/10)I love history, and I love computer games.  Thus, every release of a Civilization game leads me down a path of addiction and lost sleep.This pattern has held true to a certain extent for Civilization 6, but I have to give the newest Civ game some tough love and admit that it is not yet up to par.Let me start out this review by saying I have enjoyed a significant amount of my playtime so far with Civilization 6.  I will start with the positives:1.  I like the new districts feature, where you must pick a tile for a campus, market, temple, etc., before you build it.  This prevents you from having one or two ""supercities"" containing all of your wonders and other important buildings, which never quite felt realistic to me in previous Civ games.2.   Some will disagree, but I think the way workers/builders are incorporated in Civ 6 is an improvement.  Workers cannot build an infinite number of improvements, as they could in previous Civ games.  Now, by default, they can build 3 improvements - but, the improvements are completed instantly.  I will accept the trade-off of having to build/buy new workers when I don't have to wait 5 turns for them to complete their work.3.  On a related note, in past Civ games (except for Civilization Revolution), you would have to micromanage your workers in order to build roads between your cities (or cities to other nations).  In Civ 6, when you build a Trader unit and initiate a trade route, roads are built automatically.  I absolutely LOVE this.4.   I like the new ""Eureka"" moments that speed up your research when you complete a specific task in the game - these consistent shots of dopamine are quite addictive and encourage you to mix-up your playstyle.5.   Diplomacy is a mess (more on this later in the review), but I do appreciate how the interface now gives you a scale of how much a leader likes/dislikes you and the reasons for their attitude towards you.6.  The espionage component of the game is greatly enhanced over Civ 5.  Now, when you send spies to a given city, you are offered various missions (steal a technology advance, steal gold, sabotage production, etc.).Now, the negatives:1.  **BUGS**  Some of the bugs/glitches I have encountered have been fairly minor - for example, I had the game crash when I was choosing a diplomatic card/option after researching a specific civic policy (closing out of the pop-up menus and then proceeding was the workaround).  Some bugs are just plain weird - I was playing as Teddy Roosevelt (America), met Germany, Germany later declared a joint war on me along with ... Teddy Roosevelt?  No, it was actually Arabia (who I had not yet met in the game).  One bug, however, is quite aggravating - when I try to exit to the desktop, the game will just sit there.  The computer itself is not frozen - I can Ctrl-Alt-Del and sign out of Windows 10 - but it is an irritating inconvenience.  Oddly enough, this particular bug did not present itself during my first week of play; it first started happening several days ago when I would play for long periods of time (2+ hours), and now it happens virtually every time I exit (regardless of how long I played).2.  **User Interface **  The actual layout of the interface is not terrible, but there are many items of information that are completely missing (or I simply have not found them yet).  In Civ 5, you could click the Diplomacy window and be able to instantly see what luxury resources other Civs had to offer, what resources City States had, what trade agreements were currently active, and what wars were currently taking place.  ALL of that is gone!  So, if I need to trade for some luxuries, I have to click each leader portrait, open the trade screen, and see if they have a surplus luxury they might want to trade.  Click-click-click-click-click-click.  Do you want to see if a nation is at war with one of your prized City States?  Too bad.  Want to know when your trade agreement with England will be expiring - or,  if you even have a trade agreement with England at all - tough luck.  I can't even see what resources I have from trading.  If I forget I traded for diamonds 10 turns ago, I might very well trade for it again.3.  **Diplomacy is a mess**  There's no sugarcoating it.  I like the ability to send a delegation/embassy, which will provide you with information about the other nation (sometimes too much information - thanks, but I don't really need to know about each trivial thing a nation does, like building a Settler).  Nations have specific agendas - which is neat, except that the agendas almost always conflict with how you have to play the game.  For example, one leader does not like nations that interact with City States.  If I wanted to cooperate with him, I would have to completely ignore one facet of the game itself. Nations will denounce you all the time.  And when they denounce you once, they generally keep doing it indefinitely.To reduce warmongering penalties, you are now given justifications for going to war (casus belli), which is really cool except that sometimes they don't trigger.  I once caught an enemy spy, which should have opened a casus belli against that nation, but it didn't.Finally, one of the many things I loved about Civ 5 was when a leader would propose a joint war to you, you could reply in effect ""Sounds good, but can you give me 10 turns to get ready?""  This option is gone in Civ 6, which is very disappointing.  Look, I generally don't have an army that is mobilized and ready to go to war on a moment's notice, okay?Want to pledge protection to your favorite City States (as you could in Civ 5)?  Can't do it.4. **Amenities** I might be in the minority on this, but I actually liked the overall Happiness meter in Civ 5.  It was a straightforward indicator of the happiness/unhappiness level of my nation, and I always enjoyed going into a Golden Age after an extended period of happiness.  Now, happiness is determined on a city-by-city basis and is remedied by ""amenities"", which is okay I guess, except that how amenities are calculated is unclear at best.  The quickest way to get amenities is by luxury resources, but trading for them is a mess due to the diplomacy interface (see above).     5.**AI (lack thereof)**It has been well documented by other reviewers that the AI of other nations in the game is suspect - whether it is waging war, engaging in diplomacy, building cities, etc.  I thought the AI in Civ 5 : Brave New World wasn't bad at all - by the modern era, I had developed friendships with other nations that shared my ideology, and nations of opposing ideologies had formed alliances amongst themselves.  Couldn't Firaxis have built on this, instead of going back to Square One? 6.  **No Diplomatic Victory Condition and No World Congress / United Nations** Civ 4 and Civ 5 had Diplomatic Victory Conditions out of the box, and dealing with nations at the World Congress and proposing various resolutions was great fun in Civ 5 : Brave New World.  Oh well - I guess certain things had to be saved for the expansions, right?So, at this point, Civ 6 is really a mixed bag.  Hopefully patches will clean up the bugs and UI issues, but there is a lot of work that needs to be done in many areas - specifically the AI needs a major upgrade.  I hope we don't have to wait for an expansion to get logical, competent play from the CPU.If you're looking for a complete and polished Civ experience, I would recommend sticking with Civ 5 and the Brave New World expansion for now.

												It makes me very sad not to recommend this game. I've been playing and loving Civ ever since Civ 1 back in the 20th century. But recommending this game would mean supporting Firaxis' bad practice of releasing a broken, partial game. Why broken/partial? AI is really really really bad. I mean civ 1 AI was much better than this. I could just as well play with no AI enemies and it would be the same (maybe less annoying). End-game management of cities is much worth than previous versions. I like that there is no cap on the amount of colonies (except for luxury resources providing bonus to only 4 each). But come on, do I really need to tell every city to build ""Market project"" (ie convert production to gold) every 2-3 turns? Can't I just tell them to keep on building this??? Is implementing a production queue that hard to do? I mean you've done it in civ 5, why not in 6? No replay after you win. It might be petty, but this is something players know and love ever since civ 1, so why remove it? After you win, there is very little data. You see your score, but not how it is calculated. There is no map replay like there used to be in previous games. Basically there is nothing at all except a very short cutscene. Winning felt so unrewarding.So really, the game is great, I had lots of fun playing it, but Firaxis, I expected more out of you. Don't betray your customers just for a few more $. We've been with you since the first days, we love you, please return the favor. Please fix these (and other) things, and make civ great again.			"

												Let me start out by saying that I want to give this a *good* review. I really, really do. Because for the first 25-30 hours it was a refreshing change from Civ 5 in a lot of ways. Yes, it has its bugs and flaws (Diplomacy in particular), but I figured that Firaxis would be quick to patch out some of these nagging little issues, as well as swiftly release the integrated modding tools (as they had talked plenty about) and that winning combination would help solve these issues and allow modders to add further depth and quality to what I considered a decent basic framework. Certainly, at least, the game actually runs stable and could be played on release, which is more than anyone could say for Civ 5 even today.So why am I giving this a thumbs down?Well, for starters, the diplomacy flaws I mentioned. If you've played Civ 5 you'll remember that once an AI denounced you, that was pretty much it for the rest of the game. You were going to eternally be re-denounced every time the modifier expired. As well, a denunciation from one AI often meant a dogpile of further denunciations from several other leaders in a laughable gongshow of virtual feces slinging that wouldn't end until those AIs were eliminated (Which usually resulted in further denunciation, et cetera)...Well, Firaxis, in their attempts to ""fix"" this somehow actually managed to make it even worse. It seems that in Civ 6, just being a player in the game will get you denounced by AIs. In my first game, I was actually denounced by 3 different leaders in less than 100 turns, and all I did was focus on development inside my own borders. This continued to snowball the entire game until I had every leader, -including my allies-, denouncing and subsequently declaring war on me every few turns without discernible cause. Usually these wars would end in their surrendering and paying me. At one point I was earning 75 GPT in surrender deals across the board Banks HATED me. Learn how I was making 180 GPT with this one simple trick!.Diplomacy rating: Wat/10But Tyler, what about the district system? Surely that's a great addition!Well, I'm glad you asked, poopypants. I like the idea. It's a good idea. It was one of my favorite parts of Endless Legend. And it would be a favorite part here too, if Firaxis didn't manage to make it so My-Steam-Username. For starters, cities generally look like one coherent, sprawling entity. Not so with Civ 6! Apparently Firaxis' definition of a city is ""Looks like a bunch of tile improvements loosely clustered together"". Now, I'm not asking for Cities Skylines when I play Civ 6, but having the ground texture around districts change to something akin to Civ 4's city ground textures, and/or having more of the small buildings fill in the gaps between districts, or just making the districts take up the -whole- tile instead of only occupying about 2/3 of it would all look better than what we got, visually. But visuals aren't all that matters, so here's the real issue with districts:The garbage UI makes it almost impossible to plan them thanks to almost zero information, and it isn't until the late game that you can actually see *all* the effects the location will have on a district. Indeed, I actually had to resort to Reddit to figure out efficient district placement, because Civ 6 itself does such a crap job at providing any useful information. But the real kicker is that I found by late game district planning hardly even mattered. I would build my cities to crank out as much production and gold as they could while completely ignoring the other currencies, and I would somehow still be coming out in first place in 4/5 victory conditions I checked during setup.""Okay so the city building changes are total duds, at least the combat is good right? I mean, Corps and Armies and stuff - pretty cool right?""Oh you naive little bumnugget. I was like you once. Then I tested these systems out. Turns out they fulfill the same role as combat strength promotions in previous Civ games, except now you have to destroy a perfectly good unit (or 2) to use it. I honestly don't know what the hell the point of this was. When they talked about Corps and Armies, they made it sound like you could combine an infantry unit with artillery and AA (for example) and have a unit that, while weaker than those 3 individually, could fulfill the roles of each unit within one tile.What we got however, was again, strength promotions that require you to kill up to 2 units to promote the intended unit.I believe this short clip sums up my feelings on this accurately:

""At least Firaxis introduced culturally diverse units like they talked about in Q&As and dev videos!""Fahck you. Digganobz.In other words, no. They gave us the same unit models with different skin tones/paint jobs. So everyone still uses Sherman tanks, it's just that some civs get GREY Sherman tanks, while some get TAN. Or GREEEEEN. OooOOOOOooOOhMuch wow. Such diversity. Very multiculturalism. And your cities? Step backwards. They're diverse up until the industrial age and then they all look identical. I mean, even Civ 5 had at least distinct cities based on ethnicity.""Alright, Captain Crabbypanties, why don't you just get mods for these things then and fix them?""Shut your sausage hole, that's 'MR. Captain Crabbypanties' to you. Also, Firaxis has added Workshop Support after -half a year- of the game being out. Hey, they still failed class, but at least they got at least one point toward their grade. Of course, we're gonig to have to take it away thanks to their DLC policy being straight out of the SEGA bible, but you know. Thought that counts.""Did Firaxis get -anything- right, according to you then!?""Sure, it's just that for everything they got right, they seemed to get 2 things wrong the more I played. The art direction is so-so. I'm *okay* with it, but I'm still not a fan really. If I wanted to play something that looks like Clash of Clans, I'd play Clash of Clans like a filthy casual. It's not unpleasant, it's just... Not what I think of visually when someone says ""Civilization"".They were right about this being the most fleshed-out base game in the series. They've managed to include spying and religion as base game features, which is cool. Leaves more room open for totally new features to the series in further expansions/DLC. However, religion suffers from the same dumb AI as Civ 5 when it comes to picking bonuses and any time you lose a founding to an AI, you can consider it an opportunity completely wasted for the rest of the game. And I really only found spying useful from the perspective of preventing enemy spies from annoyingly destroying my districts. Maybe these systems will get more refining and weight down the line but right now they don't feel particularly influential towards the outcome of a game, at least in singleplayer.Like I said, the bad rating is a huge shame, since Civ 6 has a lot of really great ideas that just haven't been that well executed. I get that it's a first try for a lot of this stuff and new systems take some tweaking and patching to get just right, but until that happens I really can't say that Civ 6 has much going for it right now to make it worth paying $80 CADWould give a 50/50 review if possible.

												I am very happy to have written this review because it helped me figure out what was very wrong with this game.TL;DR: This is RECOMMANDED for NEW CIV PLAYERS, who have not experienced the series yet and will probably have a ton of fun discovering the ""complex"" mechanics of a 4X game. Though I'd say Civ 4 and 5 are probably a ton of fun as well.For ""veterans"", this is a glorious NO. Not because of AI/Diplomacy, which have been rightly criticized; rather because of stupid mechanics. One word: tedious.What works- city building and planning (districts <3)- the added culture tree- government cards could be refined but the idea isn't too bad- builders chargesWhat doesn't work- AI- diplomacy and agendas (omg wtf it's awful)- religion (100% not worth the investment)- stupid mechanics: where is the fun?Why fun cannot be had (for me at least)My analysis is this: the game has very tedious-to-optimize mechanics alongside a general lack of challenge. This awesome ""combo"" makes you feel like you're working without the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment that comes from overcoming difficult odds.Two examples below:1) EUREKAS AND INSPIRATIONSUpon realizing specific actions (eg. building three archers), you get a massive reduction in a specific tech cost (50% or 40% of the tech). This is available for every science and culture tech in the game.The way the feature was introduced by Firaxis, it seemed that it would allow for civs to go faster upon certain tech routes (for example, sea-related techs for the Vikings) thus making every game different depending on what happens in your game, where you start, who you encounter... I would call it an ""organic evolution"" of your civ depending on the context you're in. Sounds good! Sounds like a ton of replayability!Now let's look at this from the ""optimizer"" perspective, that is, players who cannot play a game without trying to exploit every mechanic in the best way possible (that would be me). Of course we are going to try to get every eureka and inspiration: it's A 50% REDUCTION IN TECH COST, FOR DUCK'S SAKE!! EVEN THE BEST BUILDINGS DON'T DOUBLE SCIENCE YIELDS. But getting these eurekas/inspirations is tedious (each one has a very specific trigger). So you go along the tech tree, researching 50% of every tech BUT NO MORE because you don't wait to forfeit your 50% reduction. You just switch techs everytime you reach 50%.This is not fun. This is the opposite of fun. I'm certain this is not the way Firaxis intended this mechanic to be used in.2) DISTRICT BUILD COSTThere are hidden formulas within the game (WHY hide this information from me?). As an example, district build cost goes up the more tech you research: if you got 50 tech, the district cost will be much higher than when you had researched 13 techs. In and of itself, it doesn't sound too good already, does it?BUT THERE'S A TWIST: if you place your district on the map (by launching production), it locks the cost! So, the Optimizer will place every district as early as possible, then immediately switch production to more sensible things (like military units), just in order to avoid the cost increasing with tech. STUPID STUPID STUPID mechanic.It also makes founding new cities completely not worth it past a certain amount of turn (because local production will never be able to afford building the increased-cost districts).What they could do going forwardI know it's easy to talk trash on a game that I've spent 80 hours on and end up not recommending. So, here are my two cents on how to make the game better.1) get rid of the eurekas and inspirations OR make the requirements harder to attain so that you aren't tempted to go after all the bonus2) improve military AI so as to make the AI an actual danger3) improve diplomacy so that the AI understands it is playing a game that they want to WIN. With this mindset, allying the player can be very beneficial if it helps overcoming a stronger opponent or eating part of their empire.Currently, every civ will hate your gut for conquering that tiny Roman 2-pop city after Trajan declared war ON YOU. From that moment on, don't ever hope to ally anyone, because you're a badass WARMONGER in the eyes of the whole world. Let that sink in for a minute.4) get rid of the ""agendas"", open or hidden. It's stupid. The AI shouldn't hate you or love you depending on set-in-stone conditions related to (a)historical facts, rather they should assess the situation they are in and how allying or warring you makes them come closer to their own victory5) rebalance the whole game: religion, tourism can safely be ignored 100% of the time. Military, maybe science are the only viable options. Civs are also wildly unbalanced.6) Religious combat isn't right. Missionaries have always been tedious to manage. Why make it a unit? Rather, let us manage religion through a dedicated screen, that would allow us to specify what city we want to target. No more going around the map, that's tedious.7) Have a sensible formula for district cost8) Don't hide formulas from the playerThank you for your time.Your hateful comments will be disbanded. I don't care about your ""freedom of speech"", I do care about my feelings.Fair criticism is always welcome, I love being proven wrong (I absolutely mean it, no sarcasm).			"

												I really, really wanted to love this game.  Early signs were encouraging, Civ IV represents the high water mark of the entire series, even a decade after release, so I was very pleased to read that Firaxis had recruited some of the original Civ IV team.Civ VI brings some new concepts on board, namely the ability to divide your sprawling city into districts, with a limited number of spaces available for cultural wonders.  Also, you now have not one, but two research streams to manage - one for technology and the other for social policy.  New policy discoveries unlock new forms of government in the same way that new technologies will unlock military units.  Also, the AI has been tweaked, with each rival civilization pursuing their own public and hidden agendas.  Moreover, the barbarian factions of old have been rehashed and are now more agressive and will continue to be a destabilising influence in the latter stages of the game when they will inexplicably turn up with heavy weaponry and battleships.  To cap it all, Sean Bean has been recruited to lend his vocal talents to the game.Early reviews looked very promising and if I'm honest, a little too good to be true.  Criticism seemed muted, there were murmurs of gripes at the game's AI but nothing that set alarm bells off, but being a Civ fan, I went ahead and bought it as soon as I could, anyway.First impressions weren't good.  The game was galacially slow on my four year old 3750K / 8GB RAM system, with the game being practically unplayable as the AI took an age to complete turns.  None of the reviews mentioned this.  A subsequent upgrade to a 16GB 6700K helped matters, as the game now chugs along reasonably well but you'll need to pay careful attention to the recommended system spec.  Then there's the AI.  Your rivals are always placed very close to you so it's extremely difficult to expand your civilization early in the game.  The Policy tech tree proves to be a missed opportunity as the various forms of government aren't unlocked until much later in the game compared with Civ IV and V.  The AI will also do some inexplicable things, such as forcing a neighbour with no diplomatic disputes and a healthy trade relationship to suddenly declare war on you.  War itself is hugely costly in terms of gain vs investment, so you tend to become bogged down in WW1-esque stalemates very quickly.  Your opponent will sue for peace, but will inexplicably declare war on you again a few turns later.  Hopefully, modders will be able to address some of the criticisms I have levelled at the game.  I have no doubt that Firaxis will release the usual spin offs and add ons to Civ VI, but it remains to be seen whether they will fix some of the more frustrating aspects of Civ VI.  In summary, the very poor AI, the plodding pace of the game and the sudden outbreaks of unwinnable wars results in a game that simply isn't much fun to play.  It pains me to say this, but the game is a huge disappointment and simply isn't worth buying at full RRP.  While the issue of game speed will be addressed in time as hardware continues to improve, there's no getting away from the fact that right now you won't be able to enjoy this game or play the larger maps unless you've a high end system sporting a video card with a lot of on-board memory.  Even a whizzy PC won't address the terrible AI, however.  Perhaps Firaxis will address some of these concerns in a subsequent patch?			"

												4/24/17As of right now, during wartime, the AI is passable. They are much better about actively pillaging tiles, capturing civilians, and coordinating ranged attacks during times of war than they used to be. Warmonger penalties are reduced even if you expand your territory if the AI instigated the war, which is good, because they ALWAYS instigate war. In spite of the hate, the game IS improving. Just slowly, and I'm guessing priority on releasing DLCs is the reason for that. There are still several problems with the game though keeping it from being much of a challenge.First of all, the AI is still stupid during the early game. First off, they WILL rush religion. This leaves them lacking in military power. Second, they WILL spam settlers, again mostly ignoring military. Third, they WILL go out of their way to forward settle, meaning they will park their new cities right next to you, even if you're on opposite ends of the world and they have plentiful resources nearby.So you will inevitably be put in a situation where they throw a bunch of settlers at your front door, and bam, free settlers and easy to conquer cities. This will cause you to snowball out of control, as free settlers/cities is a HUGE boost. There's no reason not to do this. Early game there are no warmonger penalties, and you need to build military units anyway or risk getting ganked by barbarians. Speaking of barbarians, they will completely prostrate all the AI civs for being so greedy even without your intervention.The AI needs to focus more on expanding its cities SAFELY in the early game, utilizing uncontested nearby resources instead of always trying to forward settle. Forward settling is something that should only do prior to staging a conquest, or if there are no other options for expansion.They also really need to buff holy sites and theatre squares. Theatre squares in particular are 100% USELESS unless you are going all in on a culture victory. They are ONLY good for tourism, NOT culture, and since tourism does NOTHING for your economy (for reasons I've never understood), there is no reason to build them. Which is a shame, because competing for great works might actually give you something to do during peacetime. All you need to get huge culture output is spam monuments and grab the Meritocracy social policy.Obviously, this review is based on the Prince difficulty, which is the only actual balanced difficulty. Upper difficulties don't affect AI behavior, they only give a whole bunch of free buffs and resources. All that does is restrict your victory options, which in my opinion make the game even more boring unless you only care about warmongering.			"

												This hurts me. I have been playing Civ since an 11 year old me picked up Civ III complete and lost almost all of his free time to it. But this must be said. In its current state, unless you are a die-hard Civ fan, I would wait for a sale, or stick to a modded Civ V complete.Good:-Districts: At least from an imersion standpoint, the mechanic makes the map feel a little more alive, as everything isn't crammed into a single tile, it helps paint a picture of large urban centers with smaller towns scattered around the map. Also, since districts gain bonuses from each other, natural wonders, improvements, and terrain features, it can be a lot of fun to plot out your cities to ensure maximum effeciency. Tall play is encouraged with districts as well. Factories, for example can boost the production for all cities within a certain radius, not just the city they are attached to. Overall, districts are a fun addition to the game.-Art: This is subjective. Some hate it, some love it, and I am in the latter category. I like how the fog of war looks like an old map, it's a nice upgrade from the old clouds of yesteryear. I don't mind the leader animations, and I think some are quite nice/adorable (Victoria's denouncement animation, it is adorable, watch it).-Barbarians: Actually a threat rather than a nuisance. Though perhaps they are too good for the civ AI to handle. See the bad section.-Music: Really good. Especially that intro/menu theme. Don't know if it will win a Grammy like Baba Yetu did, but it is still really beautiful song.Bad:-The AI... My gods, the AI. Do not expect to have any meaningful relationships other than war at this point in the game. I have had several games where I encounter a civ, only for them to break the game's own diplomatic rules and declare wars on me for no conceivable reason. It wasn't even surprise wars, it was full blown formal wars, and we had just met a turn ago! Good luck to you if the AI will even prosecute said war. Sometimes they don't produce a single unit, other times they flood your lands with units, but stand before your foritifed cities in wonder as you plink away at them. Sometimes the AI gets wiped by barbarians! This mess will hopefully be improved with patches, but this was not a good foot to set off on.-Warmongering and Causus Belli: An awesome idea, courtesy of our friends over at Paradox. If you have a good reason to declare war (religious reasons, liberation, ally needs help) state that reason when you declare war, and warmonger penalties are reduced! Right? Wrong! Even if you have every reason to declare war (reclaim your original capitol), and you are in the right, expect to have the entire world turn their backs on you, or declare war on you in turn. While I haven’t encountered it yet, I am willing to bet that even if you enter a joint war with your ally, they will denounce you as a warmonger, even though they dragged you into the war.-Diplomacy: Let's ignore the infinite warmongering AI for now. While the agenda system works in theory, there are several things that you need to do to win that WILL cause the AI to throw a hissy fit. Settle on a different continent than Victoria? Angry England. Have one less unit than Cleopatra?♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Egypt. Declare war on someone sharing Theodore's continent? American denouncement. Sumeria harassing city-states and you want in on the fun? Gilgamesh obviously thinks that YOU are the true warmonger. The fact that each leader also has a hidden agenda that you can't see without a rather large investment is a monkey wrench in the works that the diplomacy system can ill afford. You might just be better off having the foreign policy of the DPRK (North Korea) in this game; fortify your borders and lash out at anyone that gets close (along with routing all the food aid to your dear leader). -Happiness: Happiness has gone from an empire-wide resource to a local one, now called amenities. You need a certain number per pop to keep the city happy. This all but requires you to settle near luxuries to keep your cities content. Settle away from them, and the city will be rabid within a few turns. The empire wide system worked. This system, not so much.-UI: The UI royally screws over several mechanics in this game. The poor religious UI is far more confusing than Civ V's pressure system ever was, mis-clicking and mis-selecting cities/units/production tabs will occur frequently. Also, you will experience your civ declaring war on itself at some point, or a civ you haven’t met yet declaring war on you.-Religion: Speaking of that elephant in the room, the theological combat between religious units was a neat idea, but a poorly executed mechanic. There are three religious units, and only two of those can fight. And if the religious victory is on, or Gandhi is in play, expect to get swamped by religious units that the Ai will spawn (sometimes by cheating, I swear) that you can't stop without declaring war on the civ that sent them, or lose your tailored religion to the AI's cult of madness. Turn the victory condition off and hope a mod comes out soon that will disable religion all together or reform it.Ugly:-Districts: They can't be moved once you chose the initial construction site. So if you mis-click (and you will) hope you have an autosave or quick save to go to, otherwise your carefully laid plans will go flying out the window, plunge a few hundred stories, and splatter on the pavement below.-Wonders: This is more of a gripe about how they are placed. While having wonders placed like districts helps to avoid the wonder spam of the older games, it does lead to several problems in my view. Perhaps this only applies to me, a guy who likes his immersion, but why is the Great Library, the structure that holds all of our culture's combined writings, sitting out in the middle of nowhere next to some crazy, mad-max-ian college town, rather than in the heart of our capitol, a city as old as time itself?-Mods: As of now, there is no easy way to apply them without text and file editing, and frankly, not all of us can do that. Hopefully workshop or some other mod system gets implemented soon. Civ V lived (and still lives) on its mods. Heck, mods keep even Beyond Earth somewhat alive. Without them this game is as good as dead. (Disclaimer: I will remove this section once mods are addressed)-Windows Defender: Yeah, it doesn't like this game. Make sure you fix that before attempting to play this on a windows 10 system. There are a few guides on how to do that in the steam forums.Overall, I just can’t recommend this game in its current state. Perhaps you will enjoy it more than I, and if you do, then more power to you. I’m going to wait for a few patches before I try this game again. Hopefully it will be better then, and I can change the rating on this review to a more positive one. Otherwise, its back to my heavily modded CIv V game with me. "

												As someone who has been a hopeless addict since the days of Civilization II, and who was ~still~ playing Civ V up until this release, I was very anxious to finally get my hands on Civ VI.  I watched some of the pre-release gameplay on the interwebs, so I was prepared for the most obvious changes.  I really, really, ~really~ wanted to love this game.And there are parts that I do love.  The new way that cities are managed, where each tile can contain a valuable resource or an even more valuable district, is sublime.  Having to pick and choose which cities will focus on what vs. the old method of just building everything everywhere is far more realistic and challenging.  The new trade system, which not only increases your gold income but can also provide boosts in science, culture, and production while simultaneously (and freely) building a road network is a huge improvement over past iterations.  ""Researching"" cultural advancements as well as technological breakthroughs provides a whole new level of development.  Earning and deploying envoys to gradually boost your influence (and rewards) from city states is a fresh new take on that mechanic.  Frequently earning boosts to your technological or cultural advancement simply by doing normal activities which you'd have done anyway is great.  The amount of thought going into this game, and the obvious efforts to deploy a truly ~new~ Civilization rather than a re-skin of past versions is quite welcome.But for every one of the ""goods"", there is a bad.  With so many potential paths toward development and city-building, the game itself can be overwhelming at times.  The new, hyper-aggressive barbarians can require far too much effort to contain during the crucial early game.  Diplomacy with the AI is just as baffling as ever, if not more so--you'll frequently get cryptic messages from AI leaders which hint to something you're doing well (or not) without explaining what it is, you'll still have AI empires pledging eternal friendship and adoration in one turn and then declaring war on you the next, you'll frequently be offered one-sided trades which hurt your diplomacy rating if refused, and once the AIs have declared war on you (and fought just as ineffectually as ever), you'll be offered a king's ransom to return to peace.  The map itself can be difficult to decipher, as some resources look very similar and rain forest tiles have the tendency to obscure goody huts or barbarian camps located within them.  Ship-building and intercontinental exploration seems to come a little too soon on the timeline, leading to even more inane (and unskippable) diplomacy screens.  Once religions come into play, the missionary spam is unbelievable (and largely unstoppable).  The ""sleep"" and ""skip turn"" buttons are easily confused with builders and settlers, making for the possibility of forgetting a unit for centuries.  Garrisoned units and city walls do not automatically activate when a hostile unit is within range, but units set to ""fortify until healed"" DO re-activate every time they are attacked.  All of this leads to a great deal of unnecessary button-mashing, map scrolling, and waiting for the dang AI to shut up so you can just get on with the next turn.It's that last bit which is perhaps most disappointing in this game--I no longer feel that ""one more turn"" urge which I have in every previous edition of the franchise.  I've started numerous games, using different leaders and map settings (and the lack of map options is another downgrade), but I've yet to actually ~finish~ a single game.  Each attempt starts the same: found my capital, expand, bump into AI civs, attempt to build up good relations with them, and then end up fighting wars which they cannot possibly win but insist on starting.  Meanwhile I'm trying to remember which city just finished which district, deciding whether to produce even more districts, or building within them, or wonders, or military units, or builders & settlers to further expand, or traders for money, or spies for diplomacy, or architects for ruins (but do I have enough buildings to put them in?)...it really is a case of too many options spoiling the whole thing.  Oh, and when you tack on keeping track of which cities need more housing or amenities or food to expand...it becomes more of a chore than a form of entertainment.Long-time Civ fans will have already bought this game, so there's no point in making a recommendation to them.  Those new to the franchise have probably been actively avoiding it up until now, so there's no point there either.  But, on the off chance that you're someone familiar with Civilization who has not yet purchased this version...wait.  With some patches and refinements this may well become a very good game, but in its current form it might be worth the money, but it isn't worth the time required to play it.			"

												Quick and dirty summary for people transitioning from CIV5.Pros:1. Early game is more diverse. You have more decisions to make - and everything you do feels ""right""2. Mid game is incredibly fun. Now that you aren't constantly battling your happiness meters, you have time to focus on your goals. You have many ways of remaining stable in the mid-game and expanding further. 3.  Civic tree is now researched just like the tech tree. Both these trees feel like they have a very real and important impact on your strategy and gameplay, without making you feel like you have to constantly check for optimal routes. This is huge.4. The little things. I can't go over them all, but: linking units, how harbors now work, barbarian AI, naval changes, dipomacy, natural wonders, resources (inc. luxury and strategic), unit upgrades, builders/repairs, and religion all feel so much better in CIV 6. They feel very well designed and not cumbersome at allCons:1. As of now, I think the lategame is worse than in CIV5. It's hard to quantify with my limited playtime but it's not really that much worse. I feel that expansions will offset this.Overall:Early and Midgame are SO much better than CIV5. Lategame is slightly worse than CIV5. I think it's beyond worth it. As a base game, it's almost better than CIV5 withall the expansions, so I'm very excited to see how CIV6 expansions help the game out.			"

												Im a Civ player from the first Hour. Played Civ1 on Amiga 500 and even got the Civ-net Edition for Hotseat games and Lan. And i really have to say this Civ is the worse Civ i ever played. I totaly wasted my money on this one. The AI is Super Dumb. Another Civ Declared war on you and you conquere one of the enemys Citys and make peace after that and every nation hates you for 2000 Years for beeing a warmonger. Warmongering is such a idiotic feature in this Game there is even a mod for that. Such things should not need a mod! It should be possible to defend yourself without offending the whole world!The End of Turn takes so long. You can read a book wile playing this game. Other games with much more stuff happening during the turns with more Factions make a AI Turn in secounds. Civ needs some minutes in late game. (With 24gb Ram on SSD and i7 Intel- 7700k)Different Speed levels are idiotic. It would be cool to reduce the research time and building stay on the same speed as on ""normal"" so you can actually enjoy every Aera. Like Classic, Industrial a.s.o. I really with i could build a Classic Kingdom with Classic Battles and after i enjoyed that Aera for a wile it moves slowly towards Medieval times and then i can enjoy this Aera.But no. On marathon everythign is just slower. So in the time you Build a Knight he is already obsolete because you researched Gunpowder. On ""normal Speed"" you research a better Unit type in the time you building 2 Actual Units. But its the same on Marathon. The only difference is that it takes 20 Turns insead of 10. Game speed levels would make sense if they just slow down the development of the Nations (Research and Cluture) but keep the building speed from ""Standard Speed""Why i didnt give the game back. Well its a Civ Game. You need some hours to find out how it is. Maybe a ton of mods and spend alot money on several Addons and Civs could make this game fun. But right now. Dont buy it please. You will be frustrated for sure.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game at the moment. I played on Prince difficulty (standard) for my first playthrough while I got used to the new systems etc. I focused on science output and found myself 27 technologies ahead of my nearest rival (more than double). I conquered the Civs that were on my continent then spent a bit of time sorting out the empire while I decided whether to go for Science or Domination victory, I destroyed another Civ then before I know it I win a Culture victory, I'd hardly gone for any culture the whole game. I've started again on a higher difficulty but I really don't like the Civ method of making it harder, I want to play against a smarter opponent, not one that just has lower costs etc than me.It seems like the AI is still playing Civ5, totally unaware of all the boosts to technology and civics that are available. It also seems to have a problem upgrading troops meaning it often just has a mass of slingers and warriers while you roll through it with a few tanks and artillery in the late game.While the systems all feel improved the AI doesn't seem capable of using them which makes much of it pretty pointless. I'm pretty sure Civ6 will be a really great Civ game, but they need to put a LOT of work into the AI to make it happen. If it does I'll happily change my review.EDIT: 02/11/16 minor edit regarding AI capabilities.			"

												I've been playing the Civ series since it started.  Since IV it seems to be launching broke and being gradually fixed.  This one is no different.  The AI is horrible.  Diplomecy is a joke.  The entire game all the AI does is denouce everyone at any chance they are given.  All the trade offers are you give them whatever they want, they give you nothing, or 1 gold per turn.  You ask for something from them, they want all the gold you make per turn... Let's say you have a hug set of cities with a small amount of space not taken up either in between your cities because the land is worthless desert or up north there is just a bit of snow.  Don't blink, some random civ with jump in there and build a city.  Don't declare war and kill that settler or just get rid of that city though, because now you're the biggest war monger ever.  Speaking of stupid reasons to denounce.... You longer have a religion because you don't really care, but the guy who is taking over half of the map on religions is still denouncing you about converting one of his cities... that you didn't even know you did... Even though he has now converted all your cities, along with 3 other civs...Or you know... The game just started and suddenly a settler pops up a city right next to your main city next to 0 resources , lightyears away from their capital, just to be annoying and see how much you want to be a warmonger right away. If anyone declares war on you, which will happen, over and over... for no real reason... All you need is a ranged unit in your city and they don't stand a chance.  they just trickle in and you poke them back one at a time.  When you retaliate for them all coming to get you, and take one of their cities, you're the warmonger, not them...  I could go on...  "

												After playing this game for a considerable amount of time (many offline hours not counted) here is my opinion.Pros~~The District System is Very Neat and I think it is a Wonderful Addition to civ. It allows much more diversity when planning how to plan your cities.~New Policy system is quite unique and fresh. That being said I would love to see the indrodution of having to choose negative policies. (your Government can be all positive ya know)~less reliance on building wonders (Civ 5 you pretty much win the game if you could build the wonders before your opponents)~City states have been greatly updated since civ 5 (all kinds of unique and cool bonuses)~improved multiplayer. (Way better then Civ 5)~Great people now have new system which is really cool Cons~~ AI is terrible. Prob the worst AI I have ever seen. Not only are the AI absolutely terrible at combat but they often impossible to please. ie. most every game i have played result in every nation being Angry at me even when i have never declared war.      +note on AI in all the games i played it was clear that some of the AI Leaders have clear Advantages over the other AI leaders. For example Germany was almost Always at the top, and Egypt at the bottom of the score board.      + note AI has been receving updates and may improve in the future.~ Religion Has not changed at all since Civ 5 . (the Ai also spams missionaries and apostles and blankets your map with them, this can be really irritating)~ Personally I did not like the art direction, after Civ 5 i was hoping that the developers would pursue a more realistic aproach to the the next game. The leaders look extreamly goofy in my opinion.~ No Dlipomatic victory yet ( There is now a Religion victory)~ Diplomacy with AI is Pretty Bad~ Alliances with AI are pointless ( if you get attacked you ally will never come to help you)I could go on but, these are the main points I feel should be brought up. I want to say i was really torn on to give a positive or a negative review. there are lots of things that i liked but there are also things that i wish that could be undone. If you are a Civ fan I can't really say if you will like it or not, it has it's weaknesses and strengths. I would say if its on sale buy it but, at its current price its not worth it. Hopefully the DLC will spice things up in the future.~The Insane Meatball			"

												I rarely write reviews.I love the Civ franchise.This game is an awful wreck with a few outstanding ideas. The new city building mechanics are enjoyable and makes the player take time in consideration of city planning.But, so many more things are messed up in this game than not. I am not going to say anything new that hasn't already been complained about in other reviews.The AI is VERY EASY to defeat, but somehow manages to still be a PITA. There is hardly any reasoning to their actions, they stack units in the most awful ways. The AI on harder difficulties seems to measure and then triple the pace of their advancement by the players advancement. They race through science, culture, and religion at a pace that is almost impossible to replicate but yet they are easy to defeat militarly. This shows a clear lack of AI tuning and just plain ole laziness in my eyes, it really is awful.If you somehow have a large and fun game (almost impossible), your save will sometimes not load after a couple of hundred turns. Don't worry, it isn't your computer, it is the POS game again! As a bonus, the AI will be just as messed up when you start another!NO RESTART BUTTON! /throws a Hot Pocket on the floorDo not buy this game for anything over $20. Even at that price, I would wait till this game has been out for 3 or 4 years so that the mod community can fix this mess with a few good ideas.Very unhappy with my initial purchase.			"

												This is a difficult decision...I thought it was quite fun to play through the first time, but there are some major issues that definitely need to be fixed in order to get me coming back for more.Pros- The visuals are absolutely gorgeous!- There's so much attention to detail, it's insane. I love the way cities are organised ingame (especially when compared to the spray paint city tool of Civ 5). Roads actually connect in meaningful ways rather than cutting through everything and creating unwanted super roundabouts. There's a day/night cycle and cities light up when it gets dark. Flocks of birds travel the map and there are ♥♥♥♥ing chickens wandering around the granaries. With all the details, the world feels much more alive in comparison to the one within Civ 5 and sometimes I just sit there looking at the screen because of it.- The animations are superb and smooth!- The district system is a welcome addition in my opinion and it adds a lot of depth to the game.- City-states are easy to manage and aren't a complete chore like the ones in Civ 5.- The Barbarians can ♥♥♥♥ing annihilate you if you're not careful. They're more of a threat than an annoyance which is actually fun.- The new policy and government system is good fun!- Being able to organise troops into corps and armies is a very nice addition and helps to simplify combat gameplay.- There are some aspects of the AI that have improved from the previous game, but... Cons- Boy can the AI make some stupid decisions. Sometimes spontaneous war can be enjoyable, but when the civ declaring the war has absolutely nothing to gain from it and won't even bother to show up, it's just annoying.- The Agenda System. Great idea, but I feel some of the agendas are stupid and sometimes the penalties are way too high. For example, Ceopatra hates civs that don't have a large army, so if you're not focusing on troop production early on, she'll probably denounce you and declare war on you and every other civilization that doesn't meet her stupid standards. She basically spawns into the game hating a buttload of other civs. The penalties are way to high, and because a lot of the agendas clash in some way, everybody starts hating eachother except Ghandi.- Casus Belli. Another awesome idea, but it didn't really make it easier to declare war without gaining warmonger penalties. For example, in one game Ghandi was converting all of my♥♥♥♥♥♥to his religion so I decided to declare a holy war on his♥♥♥♥♥ This Casus Belli gave me a medium warmonger penalty which I thought would be easy to manage, but as soon as I declared the holy war everybody hated me and denounced me and I lost 14 points to each relationship. So for me, the warmongering penalties are way too high and need to be adjusted.- Theological combat. Again, another cool idea but there isn't enough depth to it. Since there are only 3 religious units, there's not a lot of strategy involved, especially if you're up against Ghandi's theocracy and his religion focused entirely on theological combat. When he came in with that wave of apostles (knowing that the warmonger penalty for holy war was too high), all I could do was wait until he converted everything and remove all the heresy after. Maybe if there were more units and terrain modifiers this could be fun, but for me it just wasted screen space.- It's insanely easy to win a cultural victory. The first time a played I won a cultural victory but I wasn't even aiming for it. I feel like this has something to do with the crazy culture boost from launching a rocket and the fact that you need to focus on culture for a bit in order to get the really juicy policies. It gets the point where in order to get a scientific victory you need to actively neglect your culture and tourism output. This definitely needs a bit of tweaking.What else can I say? This game was fun to play the first couple of times, but with these issues present I don't really feel like playing it more. I want to have alliances clashing over scarce resources and not everybody hating each other because they want more wonders or because they won't bother to settle on my continent. In my opinion there are a lot of small issues that have a big impact on the game, and I can't really recommend it until they are fixed.			"

												Civilization VI is the equivalent of an European board game. The game built around a longterm plan and executing it, successfully netting you the game if it's built well enough. Civ VI mirrors this. You plan districts around your cities, you time technologic/civic boosts, the movement rules are constrained so that you have to have a defence or offence together at that exact moment, you plan on grabbing wonders and taking great people, and on and on. This isn't necessarily bad game design but it relies on polish and the fact that your opponent is relatively competent. Civ games are notorious about a lack of polish on release and the AI is the AI.Typically what happens is patches upon patches until the game becomes 'workable' or even 'fun'. VI hasn't had anything close to that. Some dominant strategies have been nerfed but that's about it. It just seems so apathetic. I'll highlight the UI for a moment. Easy fix but nothing has actually happened to improve it. But I digress.I'll start with positives - what did VI do well?THE POSITIVESDistrictsFor the most part, districts have been nailed. They require you to specialise your cities and think about placement, meshing with the terrain and not overwriting it. Not all districts are good [aerodrome] but for the most part, it's a well thought out system.BuildersBuilders are essentially workers but they have such a clever fix. They're one-shot allowing you to instantly build an improvement. It works so well with the one unit per tile system. It's such a clever fix.Government SystemThe government system as a whole is a positive. It's divided up into four sets of governments each allowing a different amount of policy slots along with the bonus associated with it. In general, it's a very good idea allowing maximum flexibility in swapping and rewarding you for thinking longterm about what you want to do. The problem is that there's too many worthless ones but it's less of a negative and more of a 'this could have been implemented better'.Culture TreeEssentially a tech tree but for culture. It's largely barren but offers good trade offs and is better then any other system Civ has made for culture, so I think this falls into positives.NEUTRALCity StatesOne of the AI or I keep getting surrounded by them and make expanding peacefully impossible. A system in which they were taken off the map entirely and was instead in a UI would easily fix this and hopefully make the people who like city states and people like me happy.Yes, you can turn them off but it's a bit like turning off all warfare for the game. It's blatantly supposed to be an important part of the game.NEGATIVESArtificial IntelligenceThe elephant in the room for this entire game and its downfall. There's no way to sugarcoat this. It has absolutely no idea on how to play the game, no hope of ever getting an idea on how to play this game, and even massive advantages can't bridge the gap. The game is all about planning things out long term which is something the AI cannot do. When it comes to military, intelligent use and placement of your troops combined with bombardment is important. The AI cannot do this either. I can't be confident because you can't see the AI's policy selection, but based on what I've seen they cannot do that either. I also strongly believe that it simply doesn't ever have a chance of figuring out how to play the game through patches.This would be bad enough. However, the devs have insisted on making things worse for the AI. The warmongering system is such a bad idea but it's only worse for the AI. You'll see one AI declare on someone and then get universally denounced and hated. Guess what happens then? Someone else declares on them and everyone denounces them. So on and so forth until the entire world is mad. The player can deal with this with frustration. The AI can't.The AI sometimes completely ignores settling their own territory and starts sending settlers over to you for no practical reason. Sometimes they are completely unable to defend against barbarians even into the late game.I can't really say anything else. The AI is bad and is almost certainly likely to stay bad. The warmongering penalty is unlikely to ever leave the game at this stage which I think is the only way for it to improve. It's not something you can buff until they're magically somewhat decent like in other Civ games because of the game design around long term planning.ReligionThe only redeemable part about religion is the pantheons. It's interesting without being that powerful and it's a nice uncomplicated touch for a complicated game. After that, it just gets dreadful.Religions are extremely limited and about half of the game will miss out on them. 50% + 1 leads to a weird exclusive win condition club and can actually make you powerless to stop a civ from winning. Benefits are mediocre and aren't really worth your time and the AI is too incompetent to actually win via religion so ignoring this entire thing just seems to be the ideal play. It's also poorly documented with a lot of numbers and words that don't actually seem to mean much. The worst part of this is that the AI insists on flooding you win tons of religious units making you completely and utterly unable to move any units in your empire onto their tiles. We're talking a religious carpet of doom here. This hasn't been fixed in any patch so far. Poor Documentation & UISelf explanatory.Movement and the One Unit Per Tile SystemUnits can only move onto tiles they have the movement points for. This seems logical but it slows down gameplay so much and practical reinforcement is impossible especially with how specialised you want your cities to be. 1UPT also has inherent problems from combining two separate systems together and hoping they work. There's simply not enough terrain to move around in a randomly generated map instead of a properly designed from a developer map. Slow movement times make this worse. The AI has no idea how to work with this system making combat easy but also frustrating. Movement rules and roads desperately need fixed but this is something that the devs oddly proudly announced and as such I have a sinking feeling that it won't be addressed. This is another problem that isn't 'as bad' because of how incompetent the AI is.Agendas/DiplomacyGood idea, bad execution. They add flair but the AI just seems predestined to hate you making this all irrelevant. I've gotten some policy combinations that make it literally impossible for them to like you. What does classify as diplomacy is just 'throw money at them until they like you'. AI desperately needs a dash of realpolitik - the enemy of my enemy is definitely not the person I should be denouncing and annoying.Ending the GameTakes such a long time to end once you've reached a dominant position.How do I summarise VI? It's a game with the dreaded death knell words of 'potential' and 'has promise' along with 'good ideas, bad execution'. I can't really say I regret playing the game since I've had fun with it and the money that went to purchasing this game was given to me. I just don't see myself playing much more of the game. It's nothing I will return to like Civ IV or a Paradox game, but it has entertained me. If not everything has to be a deep and significant experience, then VI fits the niche of a fun fling for a few hours. I can't recommend it if you aren't into the whole European board game style theme or if you're looking for a long lasting strategy game. If you're into that style of game, buy on sale and skip the DLC unless you really want to play as Superstralia.[EDIT - Coast has been buffed and I've removed it accordingly from my review. It's definitely not godawful anymore.]			"

												First impression: Christopher Tin delivers again. The menu theme may not be Baba Yetu, but it's pretty damn close. Seems I will now have two games where everytime I start them, I have to hang out in the main menu for a few minutes: Civ IV and Civ VI+ Runs flawlessly. Literally haven't encountered any technical issues so far. Loading and such seems smoother than Civ V.+ More Micro-managing (probably a minus for some people)+ How disctrics and builders work are a nice addition. Even if they don't actually change much from how workers functioned in previous installments, it makes the game fresh.+ I like how policies work+/- I'm not a fan of the ""cartoon"" look of the units. However cities, buildings and the fog of war are spectacular+/- Features. I'm liking ALL the new features that they've added. The ones they've changed, I like too. However, the ones that are missing, I'm missing. Overall this might be a plus though, might move it later- Some bugs, nothing game breaking so far though- Diplomacy seems... sketchy. As in, needs fixing much like Civ V did with expansions (iirc). I like how the different Civs seem to have more personality thoughUpdate: Diplomacy seems to have the same problem that it had at the start of Civ V (vanilla), it feels random. Don't know if I've just been unlucky and triggered several opposing Civ hidden agendas or if this is indeed the case.UPDATE: After som experimenting, seems like the AI likes to declare war against you if they think they can beat you. So if your army is small - war. Of course, to some extent this has ALWAYS happened in Civ, but it happens constantly in this game if you play a certain ""style"". I guess that makes for more ""realistic"" AI, as that is how multiplayer matches often play out. But for people like me, who always prefered playing for culture victories, this is a big minus. Not enough for me to give the game a ""not recommended"", but enough for me to say ""untill they fix this, I'd recommend Civ V + DLCs more"". And I'd like to add that trying to spice up the diplomacy formula is a good idea, but it needs tweaking.I'm really liking it so far. It is in not perfect, but it freshens up the Civ formula with some of the new additions and I really like how they didn't take the easy and safe way out with the changes.I remember reading how some things would be ""simplified"" and ""streamlined"", which usually translates to ""we made stuff easier for casuals who can't bother with complex games"". But of all the things I've encountered so far that they've streamlined or simplified, it's all been legit. Nothing that takes away complexity, only things that make for a smoother experience.The issues that I've found so far in the game (Diplomacy and bugs) are hopefully things they'll fix with patches and expansions, just like they did with Civ V. Seems like Civ VI has a bright future ahead of it.Will update review accordingly			"

												With more than 3000 hours racked up on Civ V, I should be sacrificing sleep and my social life to play this game.As it is, I've won several games but now given up.It's still exciting at the beginning - founding cities, fighting barbarians, trying to avoid getting taken over by the AI.And there is lots to like in the new game - builders, the new city layouts, envoys to City States, Eureka and so forth.However once you get to mid-game, and the AI doesn't update its armies, at that point you can go for Domination very easily, but if you're a Science Victory type (as I am) then it's just a grind. The mid-to-late game is just a grind, it's not enjoyable, so the thrill of victory is lost - it's just a relief not to be repeating every other turn ""yes, keep that spy there please"" or ""yes, keep that trade route"".Luxuries - yes, no idea which city is getting what.The ""one more turn"" has been lost. I don't want one more turn. It's basically, after a few hours, boring, not compelling.I'll spin it up again once there's been a patch. There's an incredible game in here, somewhere, but it needs a hell of a polish to reveal it.			"

												Turn-Based games are often difficult to get into due to the complexity of their mechanics: planning your moves ahead of your opponent, be it an AI or a human, forces you to think ahead much like chess would do.Getting better at a turn-based game demands from the player the understanding of the metagame in place. This means knowing in advance from your previous knowledge of playing the game, what moves could yield in the desired effect.A basic early game strategy for Civilization VI (one of many) would be to rush Astrology and a Holy Site if you encounter a Natural Wonder in the first turns, so you can get ahead in the religious path with an associated Great Prophet permitting you to create an early religion.This is an example of a meta: you find a Natural Wonder in the early turns (a), you research Astrology (b), you build a Holy Site (c), you get your Great Prophet in time (d), you found your religion (e).There are plenty of those and the secret is to know in advance which one you will use to get to your goals. It's the motto of Civ VI and Sean Bean tells it to you during the trailer when launching the game ""you must adapt and press forward if you are to reach your journey's end"".Now here comes the problem: the AI will actively cockblock your strategy and ruin whatever meta you are trying to go for, at the expense of following a proper one for itself. In other words the AI will constantly try to counter what you are doing in a way that is unproductive for itself and thus, will focus on destroying whatever sparks of creativity you are trying to put into the damn game.In higher difficulties, this behaviour does not change. It simply gets percentage related boni on everything.While this very poorly implemented AI effectively kills the game, Firaxis did nothing to bring solutions to better it and focuses instead on releasing civilization packs to money grab credulous buyers.It has some good points despite the AI mess however, the art direction is good accross the board and many animations are top-notch despite having a mobile game feel going on (it's only a feel though).Also, It is probably a nice experience when played in multiplayer, with an AI limited to controlling barbarians...Avoid this at all costs if you plan on mostly playing the singleplayer. Go for the previous iteration (Civilization V) or Endless Legend.Update 3 March: Some grammar and formatting. "

												Here's what you'll come to expect of the wondrous creatures known as the Civ6 AI: 1) Geting denounced first 50 turns by every sentient being on the continent2) Geting spammed by indecisive enemy war chariots who dance back and fourth without really doing anything3) Enemy will retreat back to their capital to sit around for the next 2000 years without touching unit upgrades4) Oh and you'll be at war with the ♥♥♥♥er for the rest of your campaign most likely since they're stubborn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s5) Get scared to see an AI player entering the industrial age but thankfully he's just really cultured and is 5 tiers ahead, his people are still as dumb as apes in science6) Formal War is the only war7) AI has rediculous output on higher difficulties but never takes advantage of it8) AI will make ridiculous one sided trade and peace deals, and WONT negotatie any terms.9) General ♥♥♥♥ing whining from the AI and constant denounciations and insults really pushes me over the edge to where I say: ""♥♥♥♥ it I was trying to play a peaceful merchant republic but now you all get the nuclear holocaust""10) Hidden agendas are another sour layer of crust the AI will use to judge and dencouce you11) ♥♥♥♥ every leader who thinks they can tell you what to do. Why is it Rome's problem if you're not big enough, or Egypt's if you dont have an army to protect her, that picky size queen12) Again, difficulty spike goes from Prince: Easy comp stomp, all the way to King: A long, arduous war of attrition against non stop cannon fodder, and it only gets worse with all the enemy benefits down the line13) AI gets no warmongering penalties and gets free pickings on anything that moves. Oh you want to protect your homeland from Greece settling on your nice luxeries next door? THEN YOU'RE BASICALLY HITLER TO THE AI14) I want off of Gilgamesh's wild chariot rideI spent $80 worthless Canadian dollars on an unfinished shell that is in some dire need of patching. Firaxis, please put some soul into the PvE. I know competitive multiplayer is the big meme today but ffs who ever has time for Civ multiplayer. I'm going to put this aside until AI gets a SERIOUS makeover, and Workshop is included, hell I'd be alright with workshop since modders have proven time and time again that they know what the community really wants. Can't wait for Leader DLC packs too, woo hoo...			"

												I'm a huge Civilization fan, and have been since I first played Civ II many years ago. Every single Civ game since Civ II, has been able to provide me with that ""Just one more turn..."" feeling at launch despite any shortcomings or bugs that needed to be ironed out with patches or expansions. I'll even include Beyond Earth in that statement. Sure it had it's flaws, but it had me coming back for more turns (just not as many as IV or V did).I'm sad to say, Civ VI does not provide me with that same feeling at launch. There are numerous issues that I have with the game. Some of these issues I recognize as being based on my personal tastes rather than any fault on the developers part, but the majority of the major issues I have seem to be common complaints I've seen here and elsewhere, and sadly ignored or swept aside by professional reviewers. -The UI is woefully inefficient compared to the UI's in IV and V. While I appreciate the drive to try something new (and I admit, I fell very hard for V's UI and design, I love art deco designs), the UI feels less like a fully fleshed out idea, and more like something that is still in the beta stage, being tweaked and primed before launch. -Tooltips really need a lot of work.-The map and fog of war design can be a bit of an eyesore and confusing to boot. While I'm fine with the ""map"" design for undiscovered territory, the fog of war either needs a color change or complete revamp as it can be confusing and a bit of an eye sore in determining what features and resources lay within the fog of war, as well as where the fog of war ends and where the undiscovered portion of the map begins.-The diplomacy options, while improved (huge fan of the casus belli feature), still need some tweaking. AI players can ask you to remove your troops from their border, but you're unable to make the same request. Why? -Speaking of AI, it still needs a lot of work. Here's a good example, an AI player will ask you to enter a joint war with them. You agree. The very next turn, the very same AI player will denounce you as a warmonger. Uhhhhh, what?-You are given no clear indication how diplomatic bonuses and penalties work, beyond a vague ""War monger +15"", etc. tooltip. -When AI leaders denounce you, their animation screen loads, you see their denunciation, then another screen loads where (until you meet a particular research requirement) your only option is to say goodbye. I know some people hated the way Civ V's diplomacy worked, but I miss it quite a bit compared to this convoluted yet barebones method of telling me that Cleopatra doesn't think I have a very large army every few turns. Honestly, this whole issue could be solved by not forcing me to watch an animation prior to making a choice every time another civ wants to denounce me or make me an offer. -The great people and policy cards feel really sparse. While I think the new system shows promise, it's really aggravating to see the list of cards popup and feel like art assets for each great person or policy wasn't included or ready for launch.-While I think the new mechanics like city districts and the new policy mechanics sounded cool pre-launch, I find myself often confused as to how exactly they and their bonuses work due to the lack of aforementioned tooltips. I get that as I play more, my understanding of them will grow, but it's really frustrating to have to figure it out this way whereas previous Firaxis titles were much much better at communicating how core game mechanics worked. I'm hoping that I can eventually change this review to a recommend in the coming months, but for right now, I realize that while I'm in the minority, I cannot heartedly recommend this game until it gets some serious TLC from Firaxis. There's a great base here for what I think can be a truly fantastic addition to the Civ series, it just needs a lot of work to get there. I hope Firaxis can eventually fix these issues and make this the game I know they're capable of making. Buy at your own risk, for now.  "

												Edit: There is a dedicated tutorial mode which I completely overlooked the first time around. My apologies. TL;DR - After Beyond Earth which I just could not bring myself to play I am hooked to Civ 6. It is a great new game. Civilization 6 is great new entry to the series. I played it straight for 3 hours. Would have played more but reasons. You can go ahead and buy the game. It is nothing like Beyond Earth. It is not a reskin. Everything feels different and plays different. The game is very good looking and runs great. The tutorial could have been better and settings menu more fleshed out. Music is great. The cartoonish graphics compliment the game.So I come here to give my two cents after playing for nearly 3 hours and roughly 200 turns.Graphics: I will start with this because ever since Civ 6 was announced many have been bashing it because it looks cartoony. Trust me, the change in graphics style was a great decision. Had Civ 6 had a simillar type of graphics to Civ 5 everything would look cluttered and not so pretty. After building some districts and settling about 3 cities, the area really looks fleshed out and very good. The units are great to look at. Though I would have liked more animation for units. Like units bleeding and all instead of just their numbers reducing.Gameplay: When I started the game it felt the same as Civ 5 at first but after 20 or turns the changes began to pop up. Everything that Civ 5 had have been improved upon. The freedom has been reduced and there are a lot of constraints now. For example - The builder can only make 3 things after that it vanishes. The builder cannot make improvements. Cities cannot attack unless you have walls, Then to build certain improvements or districts you need to have a certain amount of population. Happiness has been removed and I think this is great. In Civ 5, I was always worried about happiness and always did stuff to keep my hapiness steady. City stated give you quests to complete. No need of building roads now. The tutorial though leaves something to be desired. Even when I selected ""New to Civilization"" mode, the guide did not tell me there are two trees now - Tech and Civic. Though everything can been found in the in game encyclopedia. Alliances can be made with other leaders. I still haven't grasped everything but this is just the gist of things. There are tons more that I have noticed and I am sure there tons which will only show up as I advance more. Settings: The settings are a bit confusing. Most options only have a low or high option. No medium option. But there a lot of settings that can played with. In short the graphics setting menu is not organized at all. Civ 5 menu was better.Music: Music is simply too good this time around. The 25th anniversary OST has all the tracks from Civ 6. Contains some 76 tracks.Optimization: The game runs great. Tons of settings to play around with. So I am sure everybody can find a combination where they can play. Though I would have liked the option to have medium preset too. Hope a patch fixes this. I am sure the performance can be increased more. The game ready drivers are yet to come out and its only the first day.			"

												Been waiting to review this to see what the updates would be like. Because let's be honest, it's a Civ game - this version will last about 3-5 years and not be GREAT till about year 4 lol. My own personal gripes:1) Diplomacy is pointless. No matter what you do, the AI will like and dislike you randomly. The devlopers tried making it more complex, and in doing so just broke it lol. They should really know their game and their players by now. We don't want a Diplomacy simulator. Though if we did, we'd want it to actually work lol. No, what we want is to create our own CIVILIZATION. Oddly enough that is implied in the title of the game lol. So stop trying to turn the series into a hodge podge of everything. Other Civs should be obstacles or tools. I miss being able to gift technology to another Civ. I miss being able to bribe them into attacking each other. Felt like a game of chess. Not ...whatever this mixed up crap is now. Oh I built the pyramids, now everyone hates me. Well, shoot. Oh I did nothing for 10 turns except build buildings and the like. BUT BECAUSE I DIDN'T EXPAND, everyone hates me. Alright, I've expanded....denounced lolCome on. 2) Barbarians. Used to be just minorly annoying. An obstacle or resource during the early game, and forgotten about mid to late game. AS IT SHOULD BE!Now, seems raging barbarians is just the default setting. With districts and the fact builders have limited charges - they capture a builder or damage an improvement, and you're set back way more than you should be. Fair enough though - a challenge. However, it doesn't FEEL like a challenge. Feels like a fly buzzing in your ear. Challenge in killing the fly, but you'd rather it just leave you the h3ll alone. Either make the Barbarians what they WERE, or make them more relevant - with named barbarian generals, greater perks for beating them, and maybe barbian held cities. Instead of, oh here are 5 camps around you that spit a unit out every few turns. Have fun rebuilding workers and traders. 3) Builders. Do not like limited uses. At all. I mean, I get it - they build stuff instantly now, so have to nerf it down to make for balanced gameplay. That said....it takes the same amount of time only in a less realistic way. Building things SHOULD take turns to complete. When have you ever seen a building or mine erected instantly out of thin air? lol Having builders not burn out too is MORE realistic. Revert it back please. It's annoying and really throws off the flow of the game. My gripes aside, the game itself is not worth buying RIGHT NOW. Wait till they add more Civs. Because it's pretty sparse at the moment. They touted the whole, ""ohh now the same Civ can have different leaders with different agendas and different perks"" only....by that they meant Greece. Greece and only Greece lol. Also, seems you can have both Greek Civs on the same map. Really odd. And btw, the perks aren't that much different from each other lol. Wait till they add more stuff. Get the game. Have fun. Till then, play Civ 5			"

												I loved Civ5, and I enjoyed Beyond Earth for it's futuristic setting and the affinities system, so I had high hopes for Civ6.And one by one my hopes are crashing, and the game just keep getting annoying.I won't talk about hyper raged barbarians, or stupid AI, you can look at all the other reviews.Instead, I'll talk about some little things that, if changed, could turn this game into a jewel.1) Builders. The fast build was fun in the first game, but you were always putting out more builders instead of actually buildings or military units, and while they can get their ""build limit"" upgraded, it's still tedious to keep building them. Workers on Civ5 and CivBE are definitely better.2) Maps. This is probably the WORST FREAKING THING in the game, even worse than AI. You are there, setting map on HUGE, and after two or three turns... YEAH, YOU GUESS IT, YOU HAVE ANOTHER 3 CIV NEAR YOU, AND THEY ARE ALL GOING TO DECLARE WAR ON YOU. What's the point of having HUGE maps if you can't build cities where the hell you want because near you the other civs just keep spamming Settlers? And don't get me started on island types of map: they are my favorite type of map, and I love sending out my navy, but how can I send out my navy if you put me MILES away from the sea? I don't pretend to have my capital just on the sea, but at least to have it near, for a second city. NOT FOR A FIFTH. Map generator is STUPID, the one on Civ5 and CivBE was better.3) Research trees. It was a nice addiction to the game, having two trees and having the way to cut the research time in half. It WAS nice. But hey, you have to work your♥♥♥♥♥off to made it (as it should be), but the game decides that AI players have ALL the research times halved. Because why not?Am I gonna keep playing this game when I own both Civ5 and CivBE? Yes.Am I gonna keep swearing and raging against this stupid game when I play? Yes.Am I gonna keep telling you all to stay away from this game until they fix it? ♥♥♥♥ YES.EDIT: found out why the maps suck so bad. Small, Medium and Standard are bigger than their Civ5 sizes, Civ5 Large is way bigger than Civ6 Large, AND MOST OF ALL, CIV5 HUGE IS WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY BIGGER THAN CIV6 HUGE. To give you an idea, Civ6 Huge is basically Civ5 Large-sized. Yep. And you have to play in that map with 11 AI players plus up to 24 city-states.Way to go, Firaxis.			"

												In start, when I first started playing, I liked this. It felt a good breath of fresh air. After being able to dig in, and see, especially post patches. This game just falls, on so many fronts. Despite that, it has some good things.Pro catagories: Good GraphicsGood MusicGood AnimationsGood Sound DesignGood Religious DesignGood Diplomacy Interface (Outside of a few issues.)Con's:Stupid AI (Even Post Patch)Horrible UI (Game seeks to hide information almost from you at times.)No penalties for going tall and wide. (And stupidly easy to do so.)War solves almost every problem. (So many ways to bleed folks offensively and defensively.)Ai feels stale and uninteresting. Diplomacy with the Ai is never worth it. (What it will agree to in weakness, is suicidally stupid. Or demand, equally so.)Difficulty again just gives the Ai free units, not stronger design.I wanted to hope this would be good. I love civ. I've countless hours in 1-5, and loved them. But this design just hurts it, maybe, just maybe they can salvage it in a dlc. But I don't have hope they will. Avoid until its under $25, maybe might be worth it then.			"

												48 hours and I'm tired of it, even though I've clocked hundreds upon hundreds of hours in Civ 3-5. That is bad for a Civ game.  It simply seems to have little in the way of new discoveries and the system of districts has the nasty side effect that you more often busy yourself with the internal affairs of your empire instead of exploring the world - which gets tedious and uninspiring after you've done it for a few games. Game mechanics like diplomacy, religion and spying feel chorelike. With the lack of map generation options, the crazy AI, the lacklustre rewards for expansion and exploration, the reduced need to find specific strategic resources, it all ends up being pretty samey. I can't put my finger on it but it also feels like the different civs are less unique now.You'd think that focusing on internal affairs would be fun, especially for someone like me who really loves playing the turtle, but you will rarely find a game where an AI will not force you to war, either by settling ridiculously close to you or suicide attacking you. Want to focus a match on culture and science? Forget it, war it is. Want to be a reclusive island civ that colonizes the new world? Forget it, an AI will always spawn at a set distance from you. Want to be a glorious diplomat? Nope, the AI will hate you relentlessly. There also doesn't seem to be much of a way to get ahead without fighting - which gets boring if you've already played countless wars in Civ5.I understand that they've tried to streamline the gameplay a bit, by reducing the different types of units you get through the ages, balancing starting map points more etc. but there's not escaping that this also makes every game more repetative. I prefer my Civ matches to be more assymetrical as it keeps the matches interesting and really increases the replay value. The lack of global happiness (Which was a stupid system in itself) and the addition of the generic entertainment complex now makes luxury resources seem to have much less of an impact on the gameplay - and the spawn rate of resources is less chaotic, which makes for finding especially interesting spots on the map for settling (and fighting over) incredibly rare.There are many good sides to the game as well - but you can find those in the positive reviews. My hopes are that they'll turn this game around with a few wonderful expansions and patches. Until then, look for a sale to pick this one up. There still potential to turns this into a great game and I'll change my review if they do so.			"

Posted: October 25, 2016
												NOTE: THIS REVIEW WAS MADE AROUND WHEN CIV VI WAS FIRST RELEASED. IT MAY NO LONGER BE AS ACCURATE AS IT FIRST WAS. TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.Short: At this time, I'd only recommend buying Civ VI if you intend to play primarily with others. The biggest problems revolve around the AI, and multiplayer gameplay is MUCH better than singleplayer. Even then, though, I'd suggest you put some thought into it.If you intend to play primarily singleplayer, just stick to Civ V. It's fun, and suffers none of the issues that Civ VI has to deal with.Long:I'm honestly shocked that I'm writing this.I loved Civ V. I have ~163 hours logged on it. But this...I expected better.Graphics:The graphics are probably the area where Civ VI actually does well. It's clear that a lot of effort was put into making a game that looked very pretty (because it IS very pretty).If only they put as much effort into making the gameplay as high-quality.Soundtrack:I've seen some articles raving about Civ VI's soundtrack. There is NOTHING special about it. It's barely present, and not memorable at all. (The title screen music is the exception to this. THAT is amazing.)As for sound effects, they're nothing special, but they're of acceptable quality.Gameplay:Good:+It has the same deep, complex, addicting strategy gameplay that the Civ franchise is known for.+The new District system adds more planning to city building, and encourages you to build more cities so you can access a wider variety of resources. Planning = Strategery = Better.+The Happiness system from Civ V has been replaced by Amenities. The way it's set up removes almost all of the penalties for building a ton of cities. This means that ""building wide"" is now a MUCH more viable strategy than it was in Civ V.+Citystates are now MUCH fancier. Becoming their best friend now grants you a VERY special bonus unique to that specific citystate (as long as you stay their best friend, at least)+Religion plays a much bigger role. It's not DLC anymore, and they've added a victory method relating to it. Nice to see it getting some much-needed attention.+Culture has gotten an overhaul, it's now needed to unlock government policies (as well as some buildings). The tiny upgrade trees from Civ V have been replaced by a giant research tree comparable to the science one.+Some changes to how unit maintainence and economics work means that maintaining a larger standing army is now feasable without late-game special abilities.Bad:-THE AI, AKA THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. Oh my goodness, where to begin?I expect some occasional stupidity or unreasonableness from AI in any game. Civ gets more leeway in this regard due to the fact that it's SO. FREAKING. COMPLICATED! (in a good way. I like complex.)However, instead of the mostly-semi-reasonable AI one would expect, we get AI civs with LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE expectations that, if you don't meet, they just go out and declare war on you. Non-stop. No diplomacy of any sort is possible (because they're so unreasonable) and it's HIGHLY doubtful it would help anyways. It's unreasonable, it's not fair (as while the AI civs pretty much always end up hating each other, they barely ever declare war on each other), and most importantly, IT'S NOT FUN. For someone like me who prefers to go for victories besides domination, this is pretty much game-ruining.In addition to this, they also seem to have the ability to create LIMITLESS military and religious units with little to no cost or negative side-effects. Again, unreasonable, unfair, and unfun.The AI is the BIGGEST ISSUE Civ VI has. I am not the only one to hold this opinion, either. If it wasn't an issue, this would be a MUCH more positive review.-Housing. It's an arbitrary limit on how many people you can have, and it exists for LITERALLY. NO. REASON. (realism? who needs that? I want fun gameplay, not realism.) By limiting population, the game forces you to ""build wide"", as it's COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to ""build tall"" (comparable to how in Civ V, the happiness system made ""building wide"" a horrible idea). Housing adds nothing to the gameplay, and does nothing but make certain strategies impossible.-Religion has a few very noticable flaws. My 3 main complaints are:1: The 2 methods of spreading your religion are missionary units, and pressure emanated from cities. This is all well and good, EXCEPT THERE IS NO WAY TO SEE ANY REPRESENTATION OF PRESSURE AT ALL. You're left guessing as to whether you're having an effect or not. Now that religion is so much more important, something like this is MUCH more of a problem.2: It's possible to have your religion wiped out. If all of your cities are converted to a different religion after you've founded your own religion, CONGRATULATIONS! Your religion is dead. This would be a fairly minor thing if it weren't for the fact that the AIs get limitless religious units (as mentioned above), thus giving them a VERY unfair advantage religion-wise. It'd probably be tolerable, if it weren't for...3: Several times, I have had several of my cities stop believing in my religion for no discernable reason whatsoever. No enemy missionaries, no religious pressure of other religions. ABSOLUTE. BULL****.While I like the increased attention Religion has gotten, it has so many flaws that it's not a viable strategy for a player to use.-There's no tutorial for returning Civ players. I don't want a full ""how to play"" session, I just want to know whats different from Civ V.It took me an hour of reading the Civilopedia (the ingame instruction manual) to figure out what I know now, and I STILL don't get all the new stuff.-You can't rename cities. I play a lot of multiplayer, and renaming cities in Civ V was a very big source of laughs amongst my friends and I. It IS a fairly minor complaint, but I HAVE done a little bit of looking into it, and everything I've found suggests that it would be VERY easy to add. Seriously Firaxis, WTH.-They got rid of diplomatic victory. :(Overall:Civ VI is HORRIBLY flawed. The devs need to wake up and fix some of these glaring issues.If you want it for singleplayer, wait for the issues to be fixed. If you NEED singleplayer Civ, go get/play Civ V. It's very similar, it's balanced, and it's fun.If you want it for multiplayer (especially with friends), I would say get it. It's Civ, it's fun, and the biggest issues are much less present in multiplayer.			"

												tl;dr: Good game, Bad AI. Playing a mechanically sound strategy game with inept opponents isn't very fun. When devs / modders fix the AI it'll be amazing. Until then, it's merely 'ok'.It has A LOT to like: city building, general improvments to how things make much more sense (Trade caravans build roads, techs get boosts for relevant activity, city planning), art style of the map (though leaders have really long faces), combat animations, tech / culture trees, unit progression compared to civ5, etc etc.;;However, while the game is a joy to play in a mechanical sense, it's lacking in two things that are kind of a big deal -- the diplomacy, and the AI.The long-hyped 'agendas' for the AI are honestly not doing anything. The AI is still insane -- declaring war on you with 7 warriors in ancient era and then wandering around getting picked off by archers for a bit before begging for peace. It's literally the same level of useless as Civ 5 on release, if not worse.The sad part is that giving the AI huge bonuses on higher difficulties doesn't really make the game more 'challenging', it just makes it more annoying. This might be my opinion but not being able to complete a single wonder and being PHYSICALLY unable to race with 500% (or w/e high bonuses AI gets) more science / culture / faith / gold on deity isn't my idea of fun. And the saddest part of it all is because the AI is so inept they'll still somehow lose to you in wars, with three times your numbers and straight up stronger units.Game balance is basically alright, with a few outliers. They've made warrior line have bonus vs spear line. That's good. Crossbowmen turn into Field Cannons that don't have 1 range like the freaking Gatling Gun -- that's very good! The new government system with cards is good; However, each individual card is so weak that basically all civs that have bonuses to government policy slots are really, really weak. To a point where Greece is downright useless as 1 policy slot + hoplites (that take extra damage from base warriors) just make it worse than rome in every way. Yeah, the 40 power legions are back with a vengeance, which makes me happy as a civ veteran, though I can imagine how it can be annoying for someone who starts near rome.But all that doesn't really matter past 100 turns because for some reason in 80% of cases the AI just refuses to upgrade units. I get it, bows and chariots are cool, but it's 1952 and I do think it's not that hard to invest in some muskets! OR EVEN SWORDS!The AI also doesn't seem to understand trade. Example: it offers me 52 gold for a resource, I click the gold away, then add the same exact amount they offered in the first place, and they refuse. Sometimes they ask for 2 resources and 200 gold for open borders; Sometimes they're winning war and peace out offering everything they have. I don't think it should do those things!All in all, not a bad civ game, with a lot to like, but just like Civ 5 it'll probably require a lot of patching and an expansion or two THAT WILL HOPEFULLY FIX THE AI to be fully enjoyable for me. It's not a bad game. It's playable. But jeez, how hard is it to just make GOOD ai again? You did it for civ3 and civ4, Firaxis. Civ5 and 6 are both easier games AND have worse AI. It just annoys me to no end =/Edit: Re-shuffled some thoughts, and added a few words on multiplayer:It's basically the same as civ 5, maybe a LITTLE bit better. Played with 1 person on a standard size map, the first 100 turns were flawless, then the random desyncs begun. I suggest playing on small maps as I don't think there have been much improvments under the hood to remedy civ5's problems. At least it reconnected my friend every time through ~15 desyncs in ~50 turns. But that's really not an acceptable number for a triple A game that had the exact same problems in the previous installment.Upd: Desyncs fixed by saving and re-hosting the game, as it turns out. So if anyone has that problem this fixed it for me!			"

												Honest impressions by a seasoned player after many hours of CIV VICon’s: - First, developers did not listen to the community: from the many wishes and comments, and the actual mods that were created by the community in CIV V, it should have been obvious to the developers what people want. It is an immense luxury for a software company, let alone a game developer, to have an actual community of fans and die-hard players. Unfortunately they did not read the forums and put all the wishes into the new version VI. Below some comments of my own. - Look-and-feel: cartoonish. Stupid green all over the place, even hills are green. Units and leaders look like from a cartoon movie. CIV V was about ‘serious’ gameplay, more realistic as a copy of the real world. The total cartoon look of VI makes the game look for children, instead of a ‘simulation of world history’. And the loook-and-feel is not tweakable in the settings. - Immensely irritating barbarians: barbarians are the strongest civilization now. Their camps pop up all the time and all over the place! A peaceful beginning with building cities and improving tiles is completely out of the question: you are swarmed by barbarians all the time. This is something like the ‘raging barbarians’ setting in CIV V, but now it’s standard. Very very annoying and no fun at all. You must use up all your production for military units. Also, the barbarians are way too strong to be any fun. And they keep going right into the information era, they never stop appearing. Not a balanced gameplay this way. Barbarians should become weaker in advancing eras, and stop appearing altogether entering the modern era. - No good maps: there are only maps that throw all civilizations together in one spot. And they all go to war with you all the time. This makes everything in the game going against you all the time. Not balanced. No fun. Very stupid that there is no earth map. Let alone a large earth map. Or a map that gives you an ‘earth-like’ layout of landmasses. Those maps offer space, exploration, distance betweek civilizations and a realistic feel. - Absence of real good advanced settings: there are no advanced settings available, that let you tweak your game and starting settings. The community was fond of the ingame editor. Developers should have been awake, and provide something similar from the outset. Not to cheat, not so extensive as the IGE, but provide options to start a game according to your preferences in the world, preferred map location and so on. - PC hardware specs: this game is very memory and cpu consuming. It is impossible to run on current hardware but only in the lowest quality setting. Why must a game force a player to buy a whole new computer? - Spreading cities into districts: personally, I don’t see any advantage in this. Growth of cities (more tiles are acquired) is slow anyhow, so districts take up space in tiles that otherwise would be turned into farms, mines etc. The same goes for wonders. They appear on their own tile now. I fail to see the usefulness or the fun of it. - Computer opponents are idiots: the artifical intelligence of the opposing civs is just as bad as in CIV V. They are imbeciles. CIV is a game, of course. It is not a real simulation of history, true. But still, right there is the fun of it: that is why it is called ‘civilization’. But when I go to higher levels of difficulties, I want more intelligent play from the AI opponents, not that they totally unrealistically get more production, more units, more of everything than you do, and you get minus everything. That is not realistic. The game should go for intelligent exploration, tile improvement, culture victory etc. instead. Like in chess game software. - Diplomacy is non-existent: For all these reasons in the previous point, diplomacy is still complete nonsense in version VI. You ‘buy’ favors with trading or with gold. That is not diplomacy. Diplomacy is to actually form alliances, that are long and true, or that let you do interesting things together. Unlike CIV V you can no longer agree upon common projects, trade prohibitions or form United Nations. Diplomacy is still no element of the game. It was even better in CIV V. It is even better in Beyond Earth: there you can use spies to really steal goodies, damage an opponent or even start a revolution and obtain an enemy city! Those things should have been in CIV VI. They should have added a Trojan Horse unit for example, to take an enemey city by surprise. Creating intelligence agencies and spy rings is unfortunately not possible. - Time-line is not good: many gamers commented on the fact that in CIV V everything that matters happens in the classical, medieval and renaissance eras. The game only plays and ends for a few turns in the modern or information era. Whereas those eras are the most interesting! The developers did not listen to the community. Still, in CIV VI you are only a few turns in the information era and then the game is over. This should be more balanced: more time in the ultimate eras. And provide more interesting things in the modern and information era. Put in satellites. Military satellites, communication satellites, satellites that alter the gameplay, such as in Beyond Earth. A missed opportunity. Pro’s:- some interesting new civilizations- good narrator, Sean Bean- that’s about it, sadly High hopes:- activation of the Steam workshop and mods, mods, mods- someone of the developers reading my entry here So... and now back to my game of Civilization V.

												This review is for the single-player game only.TL;DR This game has left me with a distasteful feeling of being cheated and robbed. This game is a micromanagement chore. Not strategy. The maps are too crowded. The units have no place to move around. I feel like a traffic constable trying to clear a rush-hour traffic, particularly from mid-game. One unit per tile, with AI non-military units blocking user military paths is a glaring flaw. The AI missionaries spammed all over the map do not help.The UI is a disaster. It is unintuitive, and indecisive. Finding resources on the map is a tedious task, with inadequate filters on the map. The camera keeps resetting to units of its choosing after every action I take, giving me a headache. The AI is incredibly hostile and illogical (stupid?), always cooking up wars. I felt like I was in a sorority house trying to win a date to the prom. Trying to understand the AI's motives involves digging deeper than into Facebook's privacy settings. They might as well have just used excel sheets as UI. The gameplay is not fun. The pestilent barbarians force you to grow militarily. The technology tree is pre-destined by giving away eureka points for specific actions. Choice has been curtailed for such gimmicks.All these elements come together in a deleterious way, forcing you to play a tactical, reactive game than a strategic, proactive game. This game is not for rulers, it's for bureaucrats. No real choice, just an illusion. This game is one sequel away from being turned into a pay-to-win freemium mobile and console app. Yes, this game could be something great, but why should one pay for just a possibility?			"

												The game is fun, but underwhelming. The scope and magnitude feels greatly diminished from Civ 5. The cartoony aesthetic may appeal to or repulse, depending on your tastes. I was strongly in the second camp, but found it easy to get used to. Sean Bean's performance as the narrator has received a lot of praise, but doesn't carry the gravity of previous incarnations. Sadly, when put together, these elements make the game feel like you're playing ""Sid Meier's: Civilization Jr.""For now, the DLC situation is frustrating bordering on insulting. Individual civilizations should NOT cost $5.00 USD or any localized equivalent. I felt a sense of sick irony, when rewatching the opening cinematic. A moving video, illustrating the pinnacles of human achievement, which once, literally brought me to tears and convinced me to buy the game. Now when I watch it, I can't help but reflect on Firaxis/2K's greed, and how they are trying to nickel and dime their player base. The lofty ambitions of that intro video feel a bit insincere now.If and when some major DLC is released and bundled in an affordable package, I may change this review. Until then, Civilization 5 is a much, much, better and more complete experience.			"

												In its current form, the AI for this game while not making it unplayable, it is extremely unenjoyable.The AI makes nonsense decisions, and tooltips and information provided to the player regarding relations or what an AI might intend to do means nothing.Constant wars, suicidal AI, wars where the AI can't reach or has no intention of fighting. Wars that the AI agrees to attack you with another AI depsite having good relations with you. The AI flip flopping with regards to agendas. The flaws are so obvious yet play testing picked up nothing.EDIT: For those commenting, I've been playing on King difficulty. The AI isn't a challenge per se, I am ususually in top 2 or 3 score wise in a large game by late classical/early medieval, It just completely makes no sense.			"

EDIT: It should be noted that my review pertains to those who have friends to play with regularly, or who like playing with other people in public matches. If you are looking for a single-player strategy game, please buy anything but this. Get Civ 5, Endless Space, or whatever. The AI is so bad I have to assume Firaxis let the inexperienced interns build it, then forgot to send it to QA. If I didn't have friends to play with this would be a negative review. That said...Having now played for many more hours than is healthy and having won a few games, I feel that I can safely declare this my favorite Civilization game yet released and it isn't a flight of fancy.If you remember to compare this to the previous Civilization games as they were on launch and without any DLC, this is the richest release in terms of content yet. Gameplay is a definite step away from past Civilization title features, and this is where it gets divisive. There are many things that veteran Civ or recent Civ 5 players will have to unlearn - such as the fact that cities no longer automatically are able to bombard enemy units, changing up early game quite a bit - which I see as good. Because let's face it: if you didn't want changes to the Civ games, you wouldn't be (considering) buying a sequel. You'd be playing the previous games. POSITIVE THOUGHTS:  The district system is ingenious. I've played every Civ game since the first and I have never cared about each and every city of mine the way I do here. Because of the way Wonders and Districts are built on the map now instead of inside a city's tile, the layout of your improvements is paramount. Now instead of picking a bonus to build, you actually have to design and plan each time you expand and develop. Because cities are so much more dynamic, the map terrain is now much more important as well - instead of resource markers and city banners, I see mountain ranges offering the promise of protection, lakes aren't just oceans that couldn't commit but instead are sources of fresh water (which now matters) and stretches of forest or rolling hills are lines I can use in a pinch as a defensive measure. I see plots of land with potential, not just a board to shuffle my units around on. No other Civ game has managed to make me this interested in a randomly generated map.Units can now be stacked again, to the delight of doomstackers everywhere. However now it is done in a more controlled fashion: combining two identical units makes a Corps. Three forms an Army. When you ""feed"" units to each other to form these Corps or Armies it removes the upkeep from the staked unit, but you can't separate them again; making those first few corps and armies huge tactical considerations. Properly used, stacked units and careful terrain exploitation can change the tide of all but the most hopeless of situations.NEGATIVE THOUGHTS:  The AI is truly trash at making any kind of relevant or threating plays. It doesn't promote units. It seems to cheat for religious units as well as military ones, as I can read a city's layout and guess pretty accurately what they should be making per turn and what they should be able to produce. I should be able to, within a certain margin of error correctly guess the size of an army that can be fielded by any given Civ I have eyes on. Here, I cannot. The AI will not engage in wars correctly. It will not attack your defense-less cities, instead prefering to station units around your mostly heavily defended areas - and then never try to cordone your army off or in most cases won't even engage.Outside of the AI, there are many design choices I question. For example, you can no longer rename your settlements or cities. There are only 5 map generation scripts out right now. I know, its because of the DLC but coming from Civ 5's 30-something maps, that was a shock. You can't save match rulesets, so if you want to quickly restart that exact same game you have manually reenter every rule you picked; map type, rainfall, etc nothing stays. Many keybindings and simple but huge functions were either forgotten or removed; things like setting a unit to Alert, or a hit key for fortifying until healed. The 'auto-explore' option is gone.It deserves its own section: The quotes are simply terrible. Don't believe me? Look at the quote here, at the bottom of the screenshot. It's almost embarrassing to have this crap play when it's supposedly 2800B.C., which leads me in to another point about the voiceover work.


Wow... wifi references in a Civilization game. How jarring and inappropriate. 
A Screenshot of Sid Meier's Civilization VI
By: Element Zero




The narration is not well balanced in terms of quality. Half of the time Sean Bean sounds bored as dirt. Sometimes he sounds great. Occasionally he just sounds downright bad. For what it is worth, after the second game we started we all muted the voicework.Personally, the most frustrating nonsensical change as a primarily multiplayer-oriented player is that you can no longer predefine teams while in the lobby. That 2v2 you really wanted to throw in on, or your 3 players vs. 6 AI world war? Yeah, no dice. What a terrible feature to have removed.---Ultimately though, these things are minor when taken and compared to the whole multiplayer glory of Civ 6. Annoying, yes, but minor. I have faith that they will be fixed, a reputation that Firaxis has earned in my opinion. Anything more, such as new features or expansions will come in good time.I hope to god they fix the AI so I can blanket recommend this game, as it is very good otherwise.			"

												Civilization 6 is the successor of perhaps the finest historical simulation game in, well, history.  Not counting Beyond Earth here... Does it live up to its former glory (minus BE)?  Definitely!Will you still catch the one more turn syndrome?  Of course!   Is it worth $60 for the base game?  Depends Is it worth $80 for the base game + 4 future DLCs?  Yes. Civ 6 takes much of Civ 5 + DLCs and adds several new and fun features to it.  Every Civ 5 fan will enjoy this game, once they have adapted to its different art-style. Having said that, the base Civ 6 game still feels slightly lacking compared to Civ 5 + DLCs.  But that is because Civ 6 does not have DLCs yet.  If you were to compare the base game of Civ 6 to the base game of Civ 5, there is no comparison.  Civ 6 is simply on another level of greatness.   But as with Civ 5, the upcoming DLCs for Civ 6 will improve the game dramatically (I sincerely hope).    Therefore, if you are interested in this game, buy the Deluxe edition, even if you don't plan on playing the game until DLCs are out, as you are getting 4 future DLCs for just $20 more, which does save you some money.  The base Civ 6 game might not be as polished as Civ 5 + DLCs, but Civ 6 with its own DLCs will definitely be. Some negatives about Civ 6 compared to Civ 5 (will add more when I get the chance):A lot of customization options are currently missing when setting up your game, such as:-the lack of maps to select from (only 5 + shuffle, compared to Civ 5's dozens). -ability to add/remove City-States from the game. -the map/artstyle will take some time to get used to, especially the fog of war. Overall, recommending in hope that Civ 6 DLCs are as awesome as Civ 5 DLCs!			"

												ANOTHER UPDATE: So, I finished my campaign. Everything about this game felt much smoother than previous Civ games considering this is just the base game, and Firaxis likes to release lots of content. By the way, using units is way more interesting now. YOU CAN DEPLOY AIRPLANES. You don't have to keep them stationed as in the previous Civ games where they had to be in a base! This is probably my favorite feature. lolUPDATE: At first I was worried about the districts limiting my playstyle/freedom, however, it's quite the opposite. It ACTUALLY FEELS like your empire is growing! I used to hate in Civ 5 how all you could do was build and improvement and then just pile a bunch of random buildings for queue in your cities. Now you actually have to make your empire grow! LOVE this new feature.I have to say it now, everyone was skeptical about this game because of Civilization: Beyond Earth, BUT THIS GAME IS PERFECT. Firaxis did an amazing job. Graphics are beautiful, combat is fun, building the empire is so much more detailed. This game is perfect. Also Japan super aggressive. lmao.			"

												2nd Update: After ~16 hours of play and one culture victory with France and despite some smaller flaws that still exist (like not being able to rename any cities), I nevertheless adhere to my former opinion: This might be – or at least become very soon – the best entry in the series yet. Update: After having read so many reviews stating that Civ 5 is better: Please, people, remember how bland Civ 5 felt before the two major DLCs were released. Compared to that, Civ 6 is a huge step forward.Original review: While the new graphics style might need getting used to by some, there's really not much to complain about. The interface is sleek and polished and the new fog of war (as well as the strategic view) are gorgeous. Same goes for the amazin theme by Christopher Tin. Civilization 6 takes a fresh turn on well-tried mechanics and is changing those that didn't quite work out, as well as introducing a lot of new ones – and they all seem to fit perfectly. The base game includes nearly everything that was in the Civ 5 DLCs. Not everything, but there has to be something left for modding and DLC, right? Let's end with this: If you ever liked a 4X game in general or a Civ game in particular, you can grab this one without hesitation. It might be - or at least become very soon - the best entry in the series yet.			"

												This game was amazing to explore at first; tinkering with the new mechanics, unit models and animations. This was by far superb to its predecessor in its aesthetics. But that's where it stops in my opinion. The AI is abysmal at this point, knowing next to nothing about fighting a good war. They simply just suck at violence. Which leaves diplomacy, also pretty horrendously implemented. Alliances become fixed throughout the game and don't change dynamically at best, otherwise its just a deranged bloodbath with no end-goals. As for someone who got the deluxe edition, I'm still holding my breath but I feel like I got ripped off with this Viking DLC nonsense. The new wonders are a copy-paste job the way I see it, and I think most people don't care about the scenarios. I'm still waiting for the remaining two DLCs that I have been promised, but they better have some good and bulky content.			"

												If you are new to Sid Meier's Civilization, you should try Civ V or Civ IV instead of this game. Only buy this game if you already love the franchise and want to try out the latest spin. This is not yet the greatest Civ ever, but it has potential.Good:There are plenty of new design tweaks and features.Social policies are researched with culture, as a second tech tree.Governments provide slots for policies, which can be interchanged according to situational needs.Terrain improvements are made by consumable builder units.Some world wonders have pretty specific requirements, requiring long-range planning.Barbarians are much stronger and more aggressive.Trade units are more important than ever.Mixed:City districts ""unstack"" the cities, prompting more careful city planning, but the restrictions can feel heavy-handed and artificial.Religion is fun but not strong enough to matter much except to lose the game unexpectedly, and there is no way to recover from losing the initial race to found a religion.Boosts for technology and social policies are a nice way to create incentives like mini-quests, but they can be pretty hit-or-miss in actual gameplay.Regional bonuses to production and amenities extend to nearby cities, requiring a compact cluster of cities in the later game.Production costs of new districts and cities increase dramatically as you build them.City states provide unique bonuses to their dearest allies, but the bonuses are not well-balanced.City states sometimes claim large chunks of the map, leaving no way to recover this territory short of direct conquest.Bad:The AI is very poor.AI opponents are given egregious cheats.There are fewer techs in the tech tree and fewer upgrades for military units.The unique traits of civilizations are poorly balanced.It is hard to find a difficulty setting that feels just right.Not enough attention was paid, in general, to balancing the game.The game has become more buggy with recent updates.Unit movement across the map is too slow.Diplomacy is a no-fun, lose-lose in this game.Despite all the changes, gameplay feels remarkably similar to Civ V.

												The great things about Civ 6 are the new features and ideas and the possible complexitiy - well its Civ ;-DBut it is buggy, it lags like crazy beyond turn 300 and I love to play loooong games. The diplomacy is screwed up, with everyone hating you for no reason (or a million reasons - but without the possibiliy to avoid it - they hate you when you are weak and they hate you when you are strong - right ;-D) and once you win a war you are a warmonger forever...And then there is the unit spam (to make up for a sometimes braindead especially combat AI), which might cause the turns to be so laggy in late game - the AI spammed units in my long games to the point that every neutral tile was littered with combat units - but that was not enough yet - even though it was sometimes impossible to fight a war, cause the spam units completly blocked me from reaching my enemy - oh my....The AI keeps on spamming units, so that they are stacked in the encampaments or cities and the moment you declare war - they spawn in your territory behind your units lines  - thats just unbelievable - because it ends in mass pillaging and there is no way to prevent it - than there are the extremly long times, it needs to repair buildings and districts (they seem sometimes to be longer than it takes to build new ones - what the heck Firaxis?)  - so the long repair times together with the unit spamming and spawning in my territory - it is so enraging....And I guess there would be an easy solution for it, like allowing the AI to build at max 10 or 15 units per city (not 30-50 - Civ V has a supply limit per City...) - but no, not being fixed in the patches instead new DLCs - of course...I guess solving the unit spam would also solve the laggy turns in the late game - as it is not my rig that is slow - quite the opposite - but as every unit has at least a quick animation and you add hundreds of units to it - it would explain quite easily the long turn times in late game...so fix it Firaxis - it should be easy enough!I love to play with huge maps (love the yet not another earth maps) with all Civs on them and long research times, cause I want to enjoy each Era und build all the building - not just rush through CIV like in a flash/browser game...and win the space race in 1400 AD - that of course makes turn lags and unit spam worse...Also religious units block your military units from movement in your own territory...I guess it would need 3 layers of units so that there is not so much traffic jam ;-D - military units, religious units and civilian units...At least 80% of my shown play time, I waited for AI turns being executed....up to 20 minutes for one turn to be processed...Until it is fixed, I will no recommend CIV VI - even though I love Civ games and Firaxis in general and CIV VI has great potential...There are a few mods around, that fix some of theses aspects (Better AI, better diplomacy and better UI for example) - but it should not be the task of modders to fix this game....

I cannot belive this is not an alpha or beta build.  Me and a buddy just spent the last 2 days playing nothing but civ and every few miniutes one of us would look over to the other and say, how the hell did a problem this glaring get past the testers?!?!?!No build queues?  What a joke, it's literally laughable, turns take FOREVER when you have 10+ cities and even just 2 people playing.Delete units for massive gold?!?! You have GOT to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥kidding me!The AI is completely incompetent and even on diety has pikemen while im massacring them with airplanes.Those are my 3 biggest beefs but believe me, every little detail feels rushed and like intern steve finished making it last tuesday and they were like ok we're ready for launch!Alpha game with a retail price!  save your money till they fix it BIG TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												I do not recommend buying this game in its current state. Reason being that the game is unbearably boring. I say this even though I really enjoy the other Civ-Games, still I'm also not a big fan of the older games(1-3). In Civ Vi there is not enough content to keep you entertained during the long and laggy turn times which get even worse the longer the game goes on. Several mechanics are still more annoying than anything else: especially Diplomacy, City-States, Religion, AI. Diplomacy: Allies braking alliances through surprise wars, ridiculous(and broken) ruler agendas, still very illogical.City-States: Very boring system where you don't really have any real influence. Also no diplomatic victory (yet).Religion: Religious unit spam, Religious victory broken and op, religious leaders very annoying, theological combat really not worth it.AI: AI not keeping up with tech, AI not upgrading units, AI dumb in combat, etc.Right now I cannot recommend this game. This does not mean that it'll improve, but in its current state I'm unable to play it anymore because it is so extremely boring.			"

												9/10After 20 hours of play I can easily say this is the best Civ ON RELEASE. Easily a 9/10, there is a lot more strategic depth and player options than there were in vanilla Civ 5.Is Civ 6 perfect? No, there are definitely a few tweaks needed, especially to the AI which does some silly things and gets annoying bonuses (King+ difficulty) which I am really not a fan of. There are few strange UI design choices (overall pretty good though, mostly clear and consice). And diplomacy victory which is something I quite enjoyed has been removed. :/ Saying that, for every small problem I have there are 3 or 4 great changes (great people system, government types and policies, tweaks to combat and movement, housing and amenities in individual cities .etc.etc.). I LOVE the changes to districts and wonders, it makes terrain and planning extremely important. There's a lot of changes which can't be summed up in this small review however.Unlike CIv 5 and Civ 4 I dont think 2 major expansions are needed before a buy, this is already a great game worth your money and after after some patching and tweaks to the AI and UI (and hopefully an awesome expansion to add diplomactic victory back!) this will easily be the best Civ to date.

												Interesting turn based strategy game mainly ruined by a poor GUIPros:- Nice graphics- District system is interesting- Two distinct tech trees are interesting (science, culture) Cons:- Expansion penality which increases construction costs for buildings feels even more strange than the expansion penalities in Civ5- AI uses worse strategy/tactics than in Civ5. During wars the AI often just walks to your cities without attacking anything and just waits within the range of the defending archers.- There is no feeling that your civilization is taking off. The production/research/income only increase slightly during the course of the game- The fog of war displays the areas as if they were drawn by pencil, which in return harms the overview- Really really bad GUI. Which is why I make a own section for thisThe GUI:- The tech trees provide almost no overview and info.  I mean just look at this:http://www.pcgamesn.com/sites/default/files/active%20research_0.jpgYou can only see the technologies of a single era without scrolling. Moreover, some passive bonuses are not directly displayed in the tech tree and are only shown via Mouse over. The cultural tech tree is even worse, since there are only four different icons for policies:https://s3.amazonaws.com/indieobscura-www/assets/editorial/2016/10/Civilization_VI_-_Devs_play_as_Brazil_screenshot_-_Technology_tree.jpg- You have to wait for the leader animations to accept/refuse an AI initiated deal. Pressing escape aborts the whole diplomacy.- The GUI provides almost no info about the adjacency bonus, which you gain by building an improvement or an district- The City screen is cluttered (e.g. the main city screen only shows food income. Food surplus is hidden in a sub screen)- You have to select the city before you can see the maximum populace for the city- Warnings only pop up if cities are overpopulated and not if fully populated- Some sub windows (Building selection, Carawan destination) are drawn ontop of other windows in a weird way:http://static.trustedreviews.com/94/00003b140/b55a/civilization-vi-11.jpg- The scrolling via moving the mouse to the screen edges does not work well. - The icons and text are often very large, presumably because they are optimized for touch or controller input giving you the feel of a console port.- You cannot bypass automatic unit rotation by quickly selecting another unit after the first unit has finished moving. You cannot even disable the automatic rotation directly via the options menue. However, you can disable it by editing the ini file (addition requested by Lif_)			"

												EDIT: My review is a bit outdated, there's been a patch a week ago that fixed some of the problems.TL;DRTop 3 problems:1. Terrible User Interface that is impractical and lacks useful info but is filled with useless data in a bad format2. Absolutely horrible AI3. Unbalanced tech trees, construction costs and generally everything is unbalancedI was checking the bad reviews the next day after the launch and I was feeling quite angry at people that were bashing this game just after 2-3 hours of playing. I felt the game was quite well done, with a few bad things, sure, but I didn't feel there were enough reasons to give a negative review.However, now I see it in a different light. I've only played for around 30 hours, in those 30 hours I played 2 full games and after those 2 games I tried starting a third but I just couldn't do it. For how nice the game animations and overall style look, district planning, housing and amenity systems are, the game is riddled with problems and I just can't enjoy it anymore. The worst thing about it right now is the lack of info. Lack of info on what? ON EVERYTHING. The UI is terrible, just plain terrible, there's a lot of useless information that's being presented in a very cluttered way and A LOT of crucial information that's either hard to get to (for example you have to select your city and then go to the religion menu just to see how many citizens are of which religion) or, in most cases, just simply missing: things like religious pressure(you can sort of see it with a religious unit, but that's also not explained what it is and how it works) and border growth are just not there, also the Civilopedia pretty much won't help you with anything. So much info missing from it, there's almost nothing relevant explained in there.Also, the structure of the tech tree is absolutely terrible and illogical, to the point where you can get to information era without having techs from the ancient era or how you can build horse archer units/crossbowmen without ever researching archery. And if that wasn't enough, you can't even see at a first glance everything that ""X"" tech gives you. Some techs give you passive bonuses,unlocks etc. But you have to mouse over the empty space in the tech for it to show you. Most of the time you'd forget about those ""hidden"" bonuses if the advisor wouldn't tell you about it.The Barbarians, however, seem to have improved quite a bit, but even there you will see some questionable decisions(sometimes) for the AI, like leaving the camp to attack an archer, even though there are 2 more units near it, ready to just capture the camp and kill the unit. And I feel like after around the 70-90 turns mark they become quite a non-entity, their units rarely seem to scale with eras and they can't even count as ""annoying"" since they'll get obliterated instantly.The AI of leaders though is just plain terrible. Many players were fooled into thinking it's a great improvement over the CIV 5 AI just because they got attacked early with a big army. However, once you get over that initial attack(which probably happens because of the inexistent and light war penalties in the first 2 eras), the AI becomes just another barbarian civilization that's not really doing much. You see them warring eachother often but you almost never see them taking a city or something, there's nothing real there. It just feels so fake and scripted, I've played Civ 4 and 5 and the thing that kept me coming back to play was a sense that I wasn't the only one making decisions in the game, the civilization AI was there making decisions with/against me, everyone seemed to be more involved in what's going on in the game. But in Civ 6, everything dies after the first 2 eras. If you can't understand what I mean, just check this: the AI gets an extra settler in Emperor, Immortal and Deity difficulties. In Civ 5 that only happened on Deity. That should tell you something if the AI requires such bonuses to be relevant at a difficulty like Emperor.(hint: it's still not relevant)The production times also make no sense and I can't understand why the wonders have to cost so much. It's standard for a wonder to take around 40~ turns to build in your best city and I can't understand who thought this is a good idea. You already have to build district that eat away your tiles yields + seeing as how every wonder needs a tile to be placed on(which also eats away all the yields of the tile) and they have specific types of tiles they require. Why, above all that, add a ridicoulous production cost for them. I just can't see the reasoning.Pretty much everything is an unbalanced mess.I'm not even going to talk about things like the AI being completely illogical with their declarations and the broken selling units mechanic.Now, to add some pros: I like the districts and the new way of wonder tiles, the cities look way better, you now need to specialize your cities and build everything more carefully, which I like very much. But the best thing about Civ 6 is the religious warfare and the fact that faith is not such a hard ""resource"" to gain if you don't get the perfect pantheon in the beginning.--------------------I'd advise to not buy it yet.

												The AI is utterly braindead, either drooling aimlessly or ranting incoherantly with no option to mute leaders, and blatantly cheats to make up for the lack of intelligence. This is not new for Civ games, but it's especially egregious in 6. Really needs more fixes before it's worth playing much.			"

												I am a beloved fan of Civilization series. Historical context is important, and I think this game really nails it; although, I feel like the game completely leaves out a huge array of notable historical moments, people, things, etc that could easily be in the game.Here are my Pros and Cons lists:Pros (with some cons):1) Graphics are astonishing; however, it seems like there's an unecessary mix of more realistic, yet cartoonish feel to the graphics. Civilization 5 had more realistic looking scenery, units, and buildings, and should have just been updated off of that. 2) Unit combat: Unit combat is far more intruiging to watch; the animations are more compelling to see play out. 3) Unit Stacking: FINALLY! Unit stacking is incorporated into the game; however, you can either only stack a military unit with a support unit, or stack numerous units of the same type into the same hex... this, I still don't understand. I don't fully grasp the idea as to why the developers seem to not understand anything related to how an actual military functions.4) Leader Interactions: Interacting with a leader is more pleasing. Leader animations are far more enjoyable, and they have expressions depending on if they're pleased or upset. 5) District building: Incorporating districts is a huge plus for this game. You can view all the buildings under construction as well as when they're finished; everything isn't just assumed it's in the city like in previous games. The layout of the districts also is really neat. Placing districts, like a holy site, nearer a mountain actually helps improve the income of faith because you're next to a mountain. Harbor district is my favorite, because wonders are really neat to build around the harbor.6) Wonders are far more interesting, and enticing, to build. Wonders build up more and more as you construct them, which is fun to watch over time. Once complete, viewing the wonder in it's animation completion shows the surrounding area in which is built, which makes it that much more intruiging. The Wonders, themselves, look very impressive.7) Attempting to achieve other victories rather than just domination is more enjoyable. Disctricts and Wonders help with drawing you to win the game with other victories. I haven't won the space race yet, but the steps it takes to get there seem really interesting (building a launch site [district], orbital satelite, moon landing, mars landing). Unfortunately, the CONS outway the Pros:1) Setting up a game isn't nearly as in depth as Civilization 5. Theres very few map types, ""Huge"" isn't even huge at all for maps; you are placed really near other civs. There's no Earth map, which is a big thumbs down for me. 2) There's no point in trying to win the game on anything beyond Emperor difficulty. Starting on Emperor difficulty, other civs start with WAY too many military units, cities, and benefits. The Emperor difficulty is the third from hardest difficulty, so how do the developers expect you to have ANY chance of winning on Deity? Starting out the game, the only thing you can even try to do is constantly produce military units, but even then... there's not a great chance to win this on Emperor difficulty.3) Map sizes are not NEARLY big enough. I'm partial to having the biggest available map possible, and I'm sure I'm far from being the only one. I want large scale battles against numerous civs across numerous continents. HUGE on Civ 6 isn't even close to giving you that opportunity. You'd be lucky to have more than three cities. Huge gives you 12 civs to play against, but the map puts everyone far too close to one another, and you have little opportunity to expand or build large armies. 4) The Graphics have too much of a cartoon feel for my liking. Yes, there are GREAT graphical aspects to this game, but there's too much of a backwards step for me to thoroughly give the overall graphics a good enough rating to enjoy. 5) The Hex tiles feel like they were made larger in this game. I could be wrong, but that's the impression I get, which makes the game much smaller than it should be. 6) Yet again, the diversity of units is completely lacking. You have numerous unique units for every civ, but most only get one unique unit. The Germans get only the U-Boat... really? They had some of the most specific units in military history, and they only get 1 unique unit.7) NO MOD SUPPORT! Supposedly there's going to be mod support, but this should have been launched with the game. The developers have specifically stated that the MOD aspect of this game is one of the most popular aspects to the game itself, since freelance developers can make the game much larger, and more enjoyable to play. Until Mod support is released, this game is simply not as enjoyable as it could be. 8) Having a very limited game being launched, such as Civilization 6, displeases me. Games used to be made as complete as possible back in the day, and these days, developers seem to just say, ""Well, looks good enough. We'll just release patches as we go along."" No, I bought this game to play NOW, not wait 6 months for me to actually start enjoying the game. Overall, I'm disappointed with the launch of this game. I know the game will improve, but I don't buy a game to enjoy later. Don't purchase this game until AT LEAST mod support is released.			"

												It's hard to quantify what doesn't click in this game, but I just don't enjoy it like I have past games in the series. Might be a little long:- Turns take longer. Not necessarily sit and wait turns like late-game Civ 5, but each individual turn throughout the entire game has you managing things, so Civ 6 lacks the fast buildup phase that the other games had. That's due in large part to the next issue, which is...- Miltary conquest is happening, whether you want it to or not, regardless of difficulty. I enjoyed the civ building aspect of the series in the past, often ignoring military expansion in favor of just building my own civ. Can't really do that here, you will absolutely need to focus on defense, and often military units and actually using them just to get reasonable tech advancement. - Advancement doesn't have the same rewarding feel to it, either. The culture system and tech tree only have a few spots that feel like milestones, and the rest just quickly become ignored. It all seems built with a very specific goal in mind from the start, so you focus on getting certain cards and a government to support them, with no organic feel to the buildup. It makes it a bit tedious to play for hours, because there's little adaptation from an initial strategy you're somewhat bottlenecked into from the moment you pick your civ's leader. - The new spy system is atrocious. Build a spy, then you're forced to choose not just what city to defend or go against but also individual districts. For a larger city in late game, this turns into a maddening display of micromanagement that you're forced to repeat after a fairly short number of turns for each spy. - I'm also not a fan of the new builders. They're expendable units with a number of charges, rather than being persistent. You can't automate anymore. Some things they can repair on pillage, others have to be fixed through that city's production screen.- Barbarians are annoying. They ramp up in tech, your units don't wake on seeing an enemy in Civ 6, they're smarter about pillaging, and the map is worse about letting you know where to combat them. They aren't hard to deal with, they're just a constant aggravation that stops being fun fairly quickly combined with all of the other management you're doing.- Enemy civs are aggressive, and they stockpile units like crazy. Even at farily early turns it seems like you're being swarmed, and with so many of the civs being military-centric they don't hesitate to declare war on you. This is probably fine if you enjoy Civ as a wargame, but that's never been what I liked about it and I still don't find the combat any more compelling in this version than it was in 5. - Wonders don't feel that wonderful anymore. They take up precious expansion hexes, they take forever to build, and often it's a tossup if it's even worth it. You're not going to mass produce them like past games, it's not even possible. The screens when you do complete one are neat, but you're rarely going to see any of them. - At 1440p the UI is ungodly small. Little tiny X's to close windows, and a number of other issues make it a bit frustrating to get the information you need when you need it. It's not that Civ 6 is a bad game, it's just only going to be a good one for a particular mindset of player. This is a less casual, far less relaxing game than the others in the series that focuses far too much on armies and not enough on the things that always made Civ stand out to me from other strategy games. It also seems like games actually take longer to complete in Civ 6 than they did even in 5, but at least the save feature is a little better. It'll be better after an expansion or two to streamline things, but right now I don't recommend it unless you're the warmongering type or only ever played the previous entries in the series on the highest difficulties.

												Is the game bad ? No.Is it better that Civ V was at the moment of its release ? Yes.Does it have great potential ? Absolutely.But right now, the game is plagued by constant, eternal, stupid reccuring wars for the simple reason that the AI is batshit crazy. Turn 100 on the easiest difficulty settings, I had already been declared war 7 times. To no avail, since the Ai doesn't know how to lead a war, despite not producing anything but military units since the beginning of the game.My advice ? Wait six months for the game to be heavily patched. And if it isn't, simply don't buy it.**************EDIT 10/31/2016******************Turns out the AI is even worse that I thought. It tends to be insanely agressive on the lowest difficulty levels, simply because you leading the game and not having the most powerful army always lead one or several nations to attack you, no matter how senseless and how desperate the assault is. This actually makes the game harder at easiest difficulty levels, but that's not even the worst.  I'm finishing a game on ""prince"" difficulty, on a large ""central sea"" map. The ting is, the IA simply do not know how to expand. The biggest AI empire must be 8 cities large, while mine is the double without even waging any war. 2/3 OF THE LAND MAP IS ♥♥♥♥ING EMPTY, simply because the AI apparently never thought about expanding to the huge, fertile, mineral-rich empty lands everywhere. And before you ask: no, this is not Civ V, there is no actual penalty to a great empire. Makes the game INSANELY easy.			"

												First off: I hope that I can change this review later on, they hopefully will patch many of the problems the game currently has. And yes, there are gamebreaking bugs right now.1. You want a military victory? Fine, take it. There will be no real defence from the AI. Why not? Well, even worse than in Civ5, they just stumble around with their units, have no plan what to do. If you have one Archer and one Warrior out in the field (not even near a city), you can beat up to 5 or 6 enemy troops easy. Why? Well, their archers often donÄt even attack you, but just stand there, while their warriors attack your one warrior like suicide-squads... it is funny to see, but in the end you win every war because the AI just doesn't use what they have.2. You want to talk with the AI? Forget it.2.1. Yes, they all have agendas... but that is more slapstick. Queen Victoria loves rich people because she loves money (okay...?), so in turn 288 she tells me that she loves my good income. Well, then she suffers a stroke, and while I still have the same income, in turn 289 she tells me that I am a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Interesting!2.2. Roosevelt loves his Taoism. I am Catholic, he is my Ally. I see his 2 Apostles and 1 Missionary, and ask him to NOT use them o my cities. He says ""Yes"" and uses them in the same turn against my cities. I get informed that he broke his promise... and that is it. I ask him again, he says ""Yes"" again, breaks it next round again. There is no consequence. The AI will always say ""Yes"" to everything - No spies? Yes, of couse, but let me send you this spy. No religion? Yeah, just ignore my 4 other missionaries going to you right now.In the end, there is no dimplomcy, there are no promises, it is just a ""feature"" without any meaning or consequence whatsoever.2.3. So yeah, the AI is not able to win any battle, and not able to remember what they promised you 30 seconds ago, but when it comes to trading, WOW, they are hardcore. One for one? Hell no! The AI will only accept trades that are very one-sided, and maybe because of that they will not really trade with each other. When you meet a new Civ after round 300, they will suddenly make you big offers to trade goods... they could do that with all the other Civs, too, but since they all want 1 for 2, nobody trades in the end. Bravo!3. The ""Politics"" in the game are pretty meaningless. They simply are. The boosts may be great for pro-players in tournaments, but for a casual player they are just a big part of the game with little to no consequence for the gameplay. 4. The Civilizations are not balanced at all. If you start 5 games, you will always see the same Civilisations weak (England, hello! Germany, hello!), always the same civilizations strong (hi Mister Roosevelt, hi Tomyris!). This point is not yet a problem for me, because I don't played enough to see if it is really always the case or just a coincident. But I suspect major balancing-issues.So in the end, the game needs work. Most of the work is needed for the AI. Diplomacy is dead right now, promises are meaningless, when fighting, the big  and mighty leaders are just toddlers without a clue. I hope this will get fixed soon, because after just a short ammount of in-game-time, it gets old and the bigs are too much too bear.PS: Sorry for mistakes, english is not my naitive language.			"

												After hundred of hours spent on this game, I finally can't take it anymore and have to leave a review.\This game SUCKS big time! This game is just too frustrating.Background: I started this franchise from Civ 5. I always played from Ancient Era and on Emperor/Immortal difficulty.Reason:1. The A.I. has no ""personality"" at all. In Civ 5, you can sorta guess which civ is more aggressive, which civ is more peaceful. In Civ 6, all civilizations will declare surprise war on you, even Gandhi will join a war against you. All A.I. act EXACTLY the same!2. The barbarian spawn rate is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Early game it's very hard to one-shot barbarian scout. God help you if barbarian spotted your cities, because the barbarian camp will spawn horsemen, horse archers non stop. I once had a game where barbarians had 4 horsemen, 2 horse archers at TURN 30! Even if I had the tech at the start, I don't have to production to produce them so fast! And ♥♥♥♥ you if you say ""just build 3 slingers at the start of every game!"", you think your 3 slingers can defeat horde of horsemen?3. Which brings me to this point: every ♥♥♥♥ing game I have to go ""Animal husbandry -> Archer"" route, talk about diversity of build! In Civ 5, I can go Pottery, Sailing or Archery; but in Civ 6 I have to do the same route every mother♥♥♥♥ing time because the neighbour civ all acts the same and the barbarians are on steroid.4. The AI Civ's forced preference is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Why would Rome hate me for having smaller territories than him? Shouldn't this make him happier because he got more room to expand? Why would France say ""I don't like the look of what you've been up to. What would your friends think of this information?"" when she denounced me for not having espionage? This makes no sense at all!5. The pacing of this game feels so ♥♥♥♥ing wrong! It takes forever to build a district. It's ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating when you tried to build a harbor for a coastal city with little wood tiles nearby. The time needed for science/civi research compared to time needed for production just feels so mismatched! I reach Medieval Era when my second city haven't finished its first district!6. Everything feels so rushed! On higher difficulty, the A.I. almost always finished everything before you. Beliefs, Wonders, Great Persons... You have to ♥♥♥♥ing beeline to your objective. Trying to play a religious Civ and rush for Great Prophet? Good luck not getting spotted by any barbarian scouts!Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME!			"

												4 / 19 / 2017Firstly you can see that I have devoted over 700 hours to this game, so believe me I have played through multiple campaigns looking for something good to report. There are many things that this game does well... specificaly the civic tree (goverments and policy cards), great people, districts, etc. Unfortunatly, this game fails to pose any challenge to an experienced civ player or even an unexperienced one. At the moment the AI is downright awful. It is unable to negotiate deals, move units effectivly, form allies / be friendly towards human players, defend its cities, conquer users cities, settle meaningful cities, etc. It starts out with a huge tech advantage among numerous other things on deity difficulty. I thought I would go over how EVERY SINGLE GAME GOES DOWN (Standard Speed)...Turn 6 - 10:Meet AI opponentTurn 12:Denounced because I dont have a string enough military     (Keep in mind at this point in the game I could at most build two warrior units)Turn 15 - 20:AI declares war on meTurn 20 - 40I build two archers and easly defend the ai's ""attack"", which Is no more strategically planned then what I would expect out of a two year old.Turn 30 - 50:I finish building a small army and commence to easily conquer every city in the AI's empire despite it having stronger units (due to its MASSIVE tech and science advantag), more units, and stringer cities.Turn 50:Denounced by EVERY SINGLE AI for being a warmonger once I conquer the cities.Turn 50 - 200:I conquer the rest of the ai and get annother world domination vistory with no strategic planning at all on the hardest dificulty.If you are getting this game because you like strategy and think that you will be challenged then DO NOT get this game. I am a major civ fan, and am deeply saddened to see that in 2017 we are being charged 60 dollars for an ai that is beyond terrible. The more I play the more I feel that the ai's moves are random. This is completly unacceptable for a major company to be releasing tsuch an incomplete ai. "

												This game is utterly broken.Some will like the new features, some will dislike them, that's a matter of personal preference.When I say the game is broken, I mean game breaking crashes. I have read the forums, and the best fix for the 'crash to desktop at the next turn' bug is to declare war on everyone. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. At turn 300 when your game becomes unplayable no matter what sequence of events you try to stop it crashing, it gets pretty frustrating.Wait a few months before buying, wait until the bugs are ironed out. This game is still in beta.Absolute waste of money, and now I have multiple save games 'stuck' at particular turns, which means I've wated my time too.			"

												Game is currently plagued by horrible AI and Diplomacy. Those two things make the game very bland after first play through to put it simply. There is no diplomacy victory condition in the game yet, guess for a good reason. However it does feel like that feature was cut out from the game to sell it later in some expansion dlc. For example city states have relationship statuses already. They are rather pointless though as they do practically nothing ingame currently.There are many other smaller issues that the game has, but these two issues already make the game more bland than civ 5 was at launch. Yet here they don't have the same excuses because civ 6 uses many resources from civ 5. Transition isn't anywhere near as big as it was from civ 4 to civ 5.  There probably won't be any fixes until new expansions. They haven't even touched em so far in this game's life cycle. Only more dlc to sell out in form of new civilizations.  Therefore I recommend to stay away from buying this game. Maybe proper time to do so is when the eventual goty/complete edition comes out in far away future. It is rather sad as some new features in this game could be great and show some promise if expanded. Maybe the modders can fix many of the smaller problems, might be a while as they were just released though.			"

												I really tried damn it. I really tried to give it a fair chance after the disastrous launch.But months later, after the release of paid DLCs the game is still riddled with scripting and AI bugs. It speakes volumes about the developers and publisher's priorities.What’s really sad is that the horrid AI and bug pretty much invalidate what would otherwise be a great product. The devs really didn’t cut out much content form Civ V and its expansions. They brought almost all of it back and improved upon it in some areas. The visuals are – in my opinion – appealing, the music is outstanding, the leaders are great.But what does it matter when the game constantly throws hissy fits at you, starting sensless wars, making AI think you did something other empire actually achieved etc? It’s been months and the issues persist. Terrible example of negligence on the part of the devs. Even at the end when I was trying to quit an uninstall it it managed to force me into hard reset.What a shame :(. Better buy Civ V or play Endless Legend. Much better games. "

												This game is simply unfinished. Civ is an amazing game. When developers fix countless bugs and include features like multiplayer teams and production queues. Also after paying £50 for a game that isnt finished. Developers are apparently working on additional DLC which i have to pay more for. I sincerly hope this issues are resolved soon			"

												I do not recommend this game to players that are new to Civilization games.Things I like;1. I love the art style, very simple and easy to your eye. 2. I like the district concept, learning how to optimize your city using district is fun. District will likely make you play again. 3. Barbarians are fun to deal with, they are a challenge even though I would prefer more options to deal with them. Like declaring a joint war against them or actually interacting with their leaders (king beyond the wall). 4. One more turn urge, early eras are fun. 5. Sean Bean doesn't die, at least so far in my game.Things I hate;1. Freaking A.I spamming denouncing button on you, after I finish this review, I am going back in the game to nuke every A.I to teach them some manners. You will get denounced for no reason, you build a military to protect yourself? ♥♥♥♥ you I am denouncing you. You dare bring your units to close my borders even though they are in your terrority ♥♥♥♥ you I am denouncing you. 2. Trading with A.I is pointless, I wanted a luxuary resource ""Salt"", and this******* Tomyris of Scythia wanted 4 luxuary resources of mine plus 100 gold per turn. I mean like what the ♥♥♥♥? I nuked her later3. A.I can't fight period. Just get close to their city during and they will take off their clothes and give everything to you. Russia declared war on me for no reason, I was scared as I didn't know how much army he had. Turns out he had 2 horses and 1 chariot, 2 warriors. Well it will be understatement if I say I killed them, as I approached to his city with my mumulk (knights) and catapult and archers he♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants and gave me 300 gold per turn with 3 luxuary resources and the control over the city I was approaching in exchange for peace. Once the peace ended I declared war on him to finish him off.  4. Spying wasn't that fun, maybe I didn't explore that enough. But I would like more depth in espionage, in previous Civ games i remember you could start revolution through espionage, poison city's water supply, and etc etc. I like more options other the current options of stealing funds, art work.5. Can't trade technologies, can't trade maps, can't trade units (This one i am not sure, because I got no allies, forever alone). 6. A.I spamming missionaries, if I don't have open border deal with them, they shouldn't be in my territory. Tomyris of Scythia has been sending 5-6 missionaries to my territories even though there is no open border deal and they block your units, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that seriously. She had 6 missionaries surrounding my city, I nuked my own terriority in frustration to kill those *******. There are other things that are frustrating, it is so frustrating that we get our video games like this full of buggs. Shame on you Sid Meier for releasing a game in this condition. Doesn't matter if you patch this game (you better), this is not acceptable. This is total rip off, I don't see how anyone can defend this game. I would give this game a 2/10, is this game unplayable? no it is not. You can play the game but the intended mechanics of the game don't work. The reason why I give 2/10 is because if you are going to charge me premium price for the game then you better have something more than just a playable game. Just one note on technical issues, I haven't been able to exit the game properly. Everytime I quit the game using ""quit to desktop"" the game just freezes and I have to mannually restart my PC.			"

												I have clocked around 30 hours so far and I really wanted to like the game but to be honest I am struggling a little. It's such a shame because I am a huge fan of the series but I have to say this one is a backwards step from 4 and 5.First of all I shall go over the pros (in my opinion):1. Love the builders; they are an improvement on workers who just became annoying after a while on Civ 4 and 5.2. Love the trading! It has more depth to it than 5, which was a bit easy, and I like that they build automatic roads. A good improvement.3. One of the best improvements for me is the city state interaction. Sending envoys is an interesting and easy way to ally with city states, a big improvement on 5, which, unless you were Greece was pretty hard to maintain relationships with city states. 4. I really like the districts and how they work, it makes for a more deep and meaningful game, where city planning is of the utmost importance. Fantastic addition to the game. 5. The civics are also a good improvement in my opinion. Having such a diverse government system means there are hundreds of different ways to play the game and now you can really tailor a government to suit the needs of your empire. 6. Barbarians are now much more of a challenge and so have more meaning within the game.7. Absolutely love the fact you can create your own religion! That's about it for the pros. There is very little change in the battle systems and how scouting works, which is good because they were fine anyway. Right, now onto the cons, and although there are only two big cons they basically make the game much worse than 4 and 5.1. Map sizes have deteriorated badly! If you do a huge map with 12 civs then you will be on top of each other from the start. I have tested this time and again and I am usually 4-5 squares away from at least two other civs. There is no room for expansion and so wars are rife. It is impossible to play this type of game unless you plan on conquering the civs closest to you, which could easily back fire and means sacrificing religion, science and culture just so you have an army big enough to do the job. The civs will always put a city next to your capital before you have a chance to. Basically if you try and get a settler you'll sacrifice an army and the civ next to you will invade. Gandhi, Roosevelt, doesn't matter. They WILL invade and if you have a small army then you'll be wiped. Therefore the game is pointless being played on a huge map with 12 players, in fact, after much testing and comparing with 5 I believe that the huge map on 6 is roughly that of a medium on 5. If you want to play a similar experience to 5 (e.g. having space to grow your empire) then I'd suggest having six civilizations on a huge map. Any more and it is too congested. It's a great shame because I loved having all of the civilizations involved, not just a few of them. I can only guess that they have done this because of the new graphics engine, which does look good, but I'd have preferred 5 graphics with larger scale maps any day and I think most people would agree. 2. The civilizations are mental. By which I mean they will declare war on you for no reason whatsoever, they denounce you for being poor etc. even though you are richer than them, they will build cities next to yours even though it is hundreds of miles away from their capital. Basically the AI is massively flawed and must be tweaked. I have played three full games now and never had an ally. They always dislike me due to one of their agendas clashing with mine. It doesn't really work and just creates war. 3. You can no longer choose how many city states to start with! 4. After the renaissance era onwards the game slows down so much it becomes hard to play. I have a gaming PC with 32 GB of RAM and yet I am waiting roughly a minute between goes, sometimes longer! Again, this is down to the updated graphics.5. Still have the same issue as on 5 with iron not spawning in the your borders. However, on 5 you could avoid wars by being clever. On this one war will arrive within the first 100 goes EVERY TIME! Therefore army is key. If you have no iron then you will struggle and in my three goes so far I have had just one iron on my continent! It is such a shame that the game has these fatal flaws because otherwise it truly would be the best one of the series. I hope that they iron out these flaws but I am not sure whether they will be able to because increasing map sizes will just slow the game down even more. Therefore if you do get this game then take it for what it is: a war game. The flaws mean that wars happen all the time. In all my games so far there has been nonstop war from the ancient era all the way through. Most civs get wiped out by the renaissance era, normally leaving me and two-three other civs to fight it out the rest of the game. It is the same every time and it is for that reason why I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I will stick with it for a while longer and see if there is improvement but I can't see me playing this as long as I did 5, and I can even see myself going back to 5 sooner rather than later.			"

												It's a decent game. Not great...yet. Keep in mind that I have almost 1,400 hours in Civ V, so I may be a wee bit biased. I just finished my first playthrough of Civ VI. I played on Prince difficulty and specifically focused on growing my cities, optimizing districts, and investigating the Tech and Culture trees. Out of nowhere, without even trying at all, I won a cultural victory. I don't understand the Tourism mechanics yet, so I barely paid any attention to it throughout the game. Obviously neither did the AI. I played as Gorgo who has a unique Theater district which I built early so MAYBE that had to do with it. I had a few policies in the beginning that got me Great Writers, put the works in the slots, and around year 1800 I got a policy that gave me +100% Tourism. Boom. GG everybody. So let's start with the good:-The graphics are bright and pleasant and the leader screens are really beautifully animated. Just incredible character work went into these leaders. -The sound effects and music are very nice and atmospheric (though not as good as Civ V)-The culture and tech Eureka bonuses provide a whole new level of strategy and planning. Early planning will definitely have huge optimizing effects down the line if you know what you're doing. -Barbarians are a much greater threat in the early game, which is great. This allows you to farm experience and build an army to use against your neighbors if you want. -City State bonuses are fantastic and very well explained. Maintaining allied status with specific City States that suit the Victory condition you're aiming for will be very worth while.-I love the new policy system. Being able to change your government and swap out your policies is a very gratifying level of management. -I like the district system well enough, though I don't think I planned my districts optimally. They take a lot of time to build and production seems really hard to get in this game. Maybe it was my start.-Religion is more complex, but not well explained. I'll check the Civilopedia to better understand it. -All in all the game succeeds in providing that addictive ""One More Turn"" feeling that we all expect from Civ.   The Bad (There's a lot):-Bad programming! I did a standard map size with 6 Civs I think. One of the AIs was my same Civ! When there's 19 to choose from! Come on!-Fewer options. Not even an Earth map! That's a Civ standard!-The new movement system is just frustrating and makes the early game drag out way too long. You really can't chase down barbarians because the damn Terrain is just too difficult to traverse.-The UI sucks. It provides both too much information and too little. For instance, you keep building these improvements for your districts, but there is no way that I can tell to check if they actually improve your yields! You can;t seem to easily check the yields on either your districts or Wonders! And they removed the City Screen completely! Instead of having one nice informative screen that tells you what your City is doing, they make you click through small icons at the bottom of the UI that are a pain to work through.-AI seems pretty weak. The only Victory they seemed to be aiming for was Religious (though they were very aggressive with that). Otherwise they completely left me alone.Never declared war. Never sent a spy. Nothing.-The Amenity system. Ugh. I don't know why Happiness got such a bad rap. It was much better and more strategic than this mechanic. With Global Happiness you had to consider very carefully whether or not to start new cities or start wars. With Civ VI it's just a pain to keep ammenities rolling in, and it requires the very expensive Entertainment distrct.-City growth...maybe I was not playing well but it seemed really difficult to grow my cities and get enough production to feel like I was truly progressing. I seemed to always be hitting a ceiling and could not figure out how to optimize my cities even with fully loaded districts and trade routes. Gold was the only thing that seemed easy to grow.  -As bogged down as I felt, I was light years ahead of the AI! They don;t seem to have any good strategies for city growth or scientific advancement. I feel like the AI does not know how to take advantage of the Eureka boosts. I know I was playing on a low difficulty but some of the AIs were still stuck in the Rennaissance by the time I hit the Modern Era. I never felt remotely challenged.-Buggy. I have opened this game 4 times. I have had to force close it twice.-This is a small complaint, but the cultural borders are straight lines and hard angles that hug the hexed map. Remember in Civ V and IV they were nice organic curves that grew and changed as your culture expanded. It was way mroe immersive and dynamic. -The art style makes the map cluttered and chaotic. It is much harder to keep track of your units and way easier to click on the wrong thing which just makes gameplay less fluid and enjoyable.-Overall, even though there are a lot of new complexities added to this franchise, the game somehow feels more hollow than its predecessors.I don;t know what to say, it just doesnt feel as satisfying to play as any of the Civs before it.With all that said, I will keep playing it. I bought the $ 80 Digital Deluxe version, so I am expecting the game to vastly improve with expansions and updates. It just seems like what is there is not tuned well enough to expand on yet. The game needs serious tweaking, and frankly I will not be uninstalling Civ V anytime soon. And because of that I cannot recommend this game to seasoned Civ fans like myself.			"

Posted: October 23, 2016
												So I played my first game to a Domination victory on King level (Pangea, Standard Map, Marathon) and I am not impressed. I feel much like I did with the Beyond Earth one … bored. I hope they fix a lot of things, because I only played a few games when Beyond Earth was released and deleted it a few days a later (reinstalled a few weeks ago, but couldn’t play an hour before deleting it again.) Civ 6 is looking like a good candidate for that.So the first thing I notice is that I can’t modify my civilization / ruler name and can’t rename cities. This bothers me a lot. I know not everyone feels that way, but I recall that always being an option. I would rather lead the people rather than a leader that the company selected for me. I mean they allow you to customize the religion so why not the other stuff? I remember playing hot seat with my brother with Civ 2, 3 and 4 all the time and we both did it. The other thing I noticed was the lack of map options. Seriously I can’t stand city states and I want them off, and I know I am not the only one that feels that way. I also noticed that I couldn’t even set how many of them popped up. So I started and had one right north of me, south of me and two my west. East was water so I am sure if it wasn’t there would be another there.Here are a few notes (and these are my opinions not an attempt at insulting anyone):1.	Terrible AI!a.	The AI can’t seem to take my cities even when they are barely defended and swarmed by the AI units. They also can’t defend cities very well.b.	Unescorted settlers keep coming to my border. “Thanks, again for the free city!” I swear the last game on a standard map I build 4 or 5 cities from settlers I captured. I wasn’t even looking they just popped up near my units!c.	Diplomacy is like playing Axis and Allies with a bunch of ten year olds. So instead of playing nice I found that domination was the way to go.d.	Strange expansion. Cities all over the place or settling places that is rather poorly suited for a city.e.	Barbarians are tougher than the nations!2.	Districts Fail!a.	Nice idea, but it just makes building take even longer. I get they want to force people to specialize cities, but it doesn’t work in my opinion. This was really something right out of the Endless Legend game which isn’t installed on my computer anymore; it didn’t work for that and I don’t see it working  for Civ without major changes.b.	They look terrible. If they are built next to the city center can it look like the city and blend together? To add to the terrible look the trade route roads get really messy especially playing as Rome. (and borders are terrible)c.	The cost scaling is harsh. I don’t understand that just because one city has a port then why does it cost more for the next city to build one? If history went with this then the US would never have left the eastern seaboard!3.	Wonders – not feeling it.a.	Them being outside of cities doesn’t always make sense.  Some don’t justify needing the entire square because they are not really that big. Pyramids I understand, but Eifel Tower, an opera house taking up essentially the same space as a metro downtown? b.	They are pretty weak. That is a lot of time spent making something that just doesn’t have much impact especially since I take up some usable plot of land.4.	Civilian units get more expensive for each one you buy / build. I can’t fathom why it should matter that because one city built some improvements that another city would have to pay more. This really slows down the empire building aspect of the game I like. It took so long that I decided to just send my Army on the war path and forget all those fancy things like farms, mines and luxury … that stuff is for the weak.5.	Build queue? Why is this thing missing? I mean does it make sense that when the crap hits the fan that the city says, “No sir you can’t train a slinger, we are building a cultural district that will be ready in a few centuries and we can’t stop working on it for anything.” My response .. “Uh, you want to tell the barbarians at the gate that?” Iknow in previous Civs I used it a lot. Usually when I needed to churn out troops because Nuclear Ghandi has decided that he wants my land  so I need to pause all construction and focus on a war economy. I know that sounds like fantasy and that stuff never happens in history.6.	Border growth … how long and which tile is coming up. Oh and why do borders take so long to grow?There is probably more (UI, and confusing unit scroll), but I think that is enough of a list. I know when 5 came out there were a lot of issues and they worked it out, but still needed a lot of work.  I am now debating if I will play 6 again or wait for some fixes. I know it sounds silly, but being able to name the ruler, civ and cities is the one that doesn’t make me want to play. So what if I want to be Gozer the Gozerian of Gozeria? Oh, this had better be in a patch, if they make us pay for it then I am done with Firaxis games, after all the game was expensive enough. "

												Steam won't give you a refund after 2 hours of playing this game, so I am writing this review to hopefully save anyone else from wasting their money and not being allowed to get a refund. Because it takes more than 2 hours to see how bad this game actually is.On first glance, this game looks really good. The visual style is neat and well executed, and even if you don't like the cartoony look it's impossible to say that it looks bad. The music is great, and bringing Christopher Tin back was a brilliant move, as the opening music is superb. It's only once you've played the game for a few hours that you notice all the cracks in the makeup.The AI is *horrible.* They will parade units through your land while at war and never attack you. They will keep their warriors until the modern age and never upgrade them, and send them to their deaths against your strongest units. They almost never settle new cities, even when surrounded by land, so as long as you build settlers you are guaranteed to win. They make promises and NEVER keep them. Every AI will happily promise not to convert your cities, then send in 5 apostles the very next turn to convert you. It makes it so the only way you can possibly play is to declare war on your neighbors, for which they never, ever ever forgive you.The game is buggy. It doesn't seem to be able to close without crashing. You will recieve declarations of war from yourself at random during the game. (When playing as Rome, Trajan will appear and declare war on you, even though there are no other Romes in the game.) It's almost impossible to use the city bombard feature, as every time you click it realigns the viewport. The absolutely insane unit selection process will cause you to accidentally right click on distant parts of the map with the wrong unit, sending them off in the wrong direction. When you promise not to convert AI cities, but the city gets naturally converted on its own, you get a diplomacy penalty and a warning for breaking your promise.But worst of all, the game is boring. AI can be improved. Bugs can be fixed. But the game itself is a tedious slog. The problem of having too many workers bogging you down in earlier Civ games has been eliminated, but the same problem was reintroduced as trade routes and spies. Once you enter the atomic era, almost the only thing you do is re-assign spies and trade routes each turn, each of which requires multiple clicks just to get them to keep doing what they were doing. With the AI so bad, very little goes on in the late game except sitting around and reassigning these units.They did a good job of fixing the features in Civ 5 that weren't great, but they didn't really add much to the game. Religion is virtually the same, but slightly more interesting than before. Governments work different, and are one of the genuine improvements on the game, but still feels a little shallow. They didn't really bring much new to the game, but it feels like much has been taken away. It feels very similar to Civ 5, just with much fewer leaders. And with the Aztec civ being released as DLC, it sounds like they have come up with a nasty way of making DLC content -- nickle-and-diming you for leaders and civs. Despite this being number 6 in the series, it has a pathetically small number of starting Civs and leaders. There's a decent representation from around the world, but why must Civ restart with less than 20 Civs at ever new version? It feels like taking a giant step backwards when there is such a long tradition that they could build off of.If you're a die-hard Civ fan who was playing Civ 5 up until the moment this was released, you will probably see it as an improvement (once the attrocious AI and the bugs have been fixed, anyway). If you're a general 4x/history fan, you will probably be sorely disappointed, as there are much better games out there. Civ 6 doesn't innovate, it just reinvents the wheel, and doesn't feel as complete as the previous game in the series.			"

Posted: November 4, 2016
												I played few games, and I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. After only three games, I was starting to get bored with this game. There are some good changes made to it, and it seems more complex, at least when comparing to Civ V, but something just seems to be missing.Pros:- The science-kind of Civic-tree is nice, where you use culture to ""research"" causes, which give you these cards, that have different kinds of bonuses and perks. The new government system connected to this, in which you get to choose your government from classical republic to fascism and communism, is a neat feature.- Districts. These are a new feature, that instead of building every building inside your city center, you choose a tile where you build a certain district, like campus or market. This is good, because it makes the cities look more realistic and good-looking. It gives the cities the feeling, that a city in reality is more than just the city center. It's also about it's surrounding towns and suburbs.- Graphics style is a bit two-bladed sword: other like it, others don't. I like the new fog of war, where instead of the usual fog or clouds, the map actually looks like an old map. Otherwise, though, I don't like the graphics that much, the cartoony style doesn't just fit, especially the leaders, and the actual map is kind of bland: all civs look alike and the units look all the same. Diversity is missing here.Cons:- Pretty much everything else. The game still feels like the old Civilization V with some good features taken out. There's no diplomatic victory, no UN, no World Congress. Cultural victory is laughably easy. City-States don't seem to matter at all. After 200 turns there just doesn't seem to be anything left to do, other than press for next turn, and hope you have done the required things for your favored victory, as in the end, it's just about turns, and who started doing it first.- Barbarians are made more aggressive and hard, and in most cases, too much. At only 10 turns the barbarians are already attacking with horsemen against your warriors and slingshots. And new barbarians seem to spawn almost like every turn. The first minutes of the game is just about fighting the barbarians and you have to focus your science and civics to military, just to get by. And sometimes the computer players are stupid enough to lose to barbarians right at the start of the game.- Which leads to the stupid AI. They have no logic and seem to be denouncing you all the time with no apparent reason. In one game, I had good relations with one city-state. Then, a random player started a war against it, then suddenly all the other computer players denounced me for being a warmongerer - I mean, seriously?Only good things about the AI is trading: you can actually haggle and try different deals, and get somewhere with it, unlike in Civ5. But that's about it. Talk about the civs' agendas, the Norway seems to hate me all the time, just because I can't be bothered to build few ships, and Cleopatra hate me because I have a weaker army (even though sometimes I have even greater than hers). And Peter of Russia seems to first wonder why I have no science and arts, but the next time he idolizes how much I have science and arts, and this goes back and forth the whole game. I just don't get how they coded any of these lines.In short: I think the game feels incomplete and rushed. They just added some cool things and took out other, without ever properly testing the game. Everything sound and seems great and cool at first, but nothing really works actually. Like the warring penalties, that if you suddenly out of no reason start a war, you get penalties, and when you get things that justify a war (like finding a spy), they don't work or affect in any way.Generally, I would not recommend: if you're a true Civ-fanatic, or otherwise love TBS games very much, give it a try once it's on sale. In any other case, I'd recommend to pass on this one.Thanks for reading, and be sure to check more reviews at http://radioaktiivistajatetta-en.blogspot.comEDIT: Another minus I have to add - no official mod support or even a map editor! Sad.			"

												For all its new bells and whistles, Civilization VI isn’t all that different from Civilization V. Gameplay elements introduced in Brave New World, such as Tourism and trade routes, make a return while new elements like the Civics tree and AI agendas provide new challenges and opportunities for playing the game of history. It’s a shame that Civilization VI is so fundamentally flawed that these new elements feel ill thought out, and basic mechanics are suddenly far more clunky and annoying than before. As of right now, at launch, I would not recommend Civilization VI.Civilization VI is undoubtedly a very pretty game, especially when there aren’t any battles being fought. The level of detail is some of the greatest I’ve seen in a 4X, with your city centers growing and evolving with the technological era and units looking civilization-appropriate. The strategic map is gorgeous; the colors are bright and vibrant while the terrain and resource drawings are lush with detail. The leader portraits and animations, as well as the victory movies, are very pretty and much more satisfying than Civ V’s stiff images and animations.Unfortunately, Civilization VI doesn’t know how to pace itself. Researching technologies and civic policies is simply too fast. Part of the problem is that the standard Civilization tech tree is now split in two, and researching both at once causes you to advance at a far faster pace than your economy can take advantage of. With the new Eureka mechanic, it’s astonishingly easy to start researching Future Tech before you get your first nuclear weapon. Resource yields from tiles, improvements, and buildings are so ♥♥♥♥♥rdly that you’ll probably spend most of your time focusing on gold or faith so you can just buy everything instead of wasting dozens of turns building them. I suspect the decision to make buildings give flat yield bonuses was so that policy cards and strategically placing districts and wonders would have greater impact on the gameplay, but it was a dumb decision because production now takes forever, meaning you can easily skip over entire eras of buildings and units and end up with Crossbowmen and Jet Fighters in the same war.And even if you buy an army, moving units is far more difficult than it needs to be. Often times you’ll be told your unit lacks the movement to go up a hill or through woods, and no unit can cross a river tile if they had moved previously in the turn, no matter how much spare movement they have. It slows exploration and warfare down tremendously, and it shouldn’t surprise you if you cannot uncover a full Standard-sized world before you reach the Atomic Era and get access to the Earth Satellite national project which reveals the entire map. It doesn’t help that you can’t build roads without an expensive unit, making moving within your own empire just as difficult as moving in the wilderness.The end result is that Civilization VI feels both very slow and very fast. You’ll race through history, snatching up technologies and civics far ahead of the AI, but struggle to build an empire as your production queue bottles up thanks to low yields, even with helpful civic cards. You could easily, and will probably be forced to, bypass most unit and building choices to focus on achieving one victory condition. And in a single-player game, it will probably feel like a completely undeserved victory.The single-player AI is terrible. There’s no other word for it. It can’t make strategic city placement choices, it can’t match a player in terms of technology or civics, it can’t even fight a war despite outproducing most players in terms of units because all it does is throw outdated, obsolete units into range of your cities and wait for you to kill them. And in every game, there is at least one AI player that thinks it’s a city-state and focuses on pumping out units to protect its capital, even if it produces a settler. It’s a terrible AI, and the only way it could possibly be competitive is by cheating at yields to increase production, but since it would still make terrible strategic choices it would still be a horribly easy opponent. Surprisingly, early-game Barbarians are more of a threat than the AI civilizations. By default, they behave like Raging Barbarians in Civ V. They keep the Ancient and Classical Eras interesting to play through if you can’t find other civilizations to pound on. It’s a shame that they never improve though, and it’s a hassle to find that they continue to spawn outside owned tiles throughout the game since they’re just a nuisance by Medieval. Speaking of owned tiles, spreading your borders is incredibly slow and the art for districts and improvements is disappointing. You’ll never see an Endless Legend-like conurbation, densely packed with buildings and sprawling across entire regions. Everything will be squeezed together, and it will look like a small town until it suddenly springs skyscrapers in the Modern Era, amidst fields and mines and wonders. Culture growth is slow no matter what you build, and even now I’m not entirely sure what causes borders to spread. You’ll always be wondering whether you should cannibalize an improvement or resource, or spend gold to expand. This is probably to balance the fact that cities now sprawl out over all tiles, so that you have to focus individual cities down to a few districts, but it means your empire will rarely expand to an impressive scale.A lot of Civilization VI’s new mechanics aren’t explained, even if you set the advisor level to “New to Civilization VI” in the options menu. Besieged a city? Great; why and for what purpose? So defenses and defenders don’t heal, but nothing explains it, not even the Civopedia. Not enough amenities for your city? You have no idea where they went and little idea which ones they’re benefitting from. Civilization VI holds your hand through the most basic mechanics, but won’t explain any of the more complex ones it introduces.The UI is a major factor in obscuring information useful to the player. While it is a little cleaner than Civ V’s, it gets rid of a lot of information and shortcuts to more detailed information. Wondering how many amenities you have and if you can trade any of them away? There’s no list of them. Trying to see the attack range of your ranged units? Unless an enemy is actually in range you can’t see it or see the effect of any terrain on it. Getting told your cities are getting unhappy because you’re lacking amenities? The actual information as to why and the rate at which they are approaching rebellion is hidden behind several buttons because the devs didn’t want it cluttering up your city screen. Actually building things in your cities, telling your trade units to move between cities or start new trade routes, and even switching between selected units is a chore. Buttons for lists and views are spread to all four corners of the screen, forcing players to focus on all the farthest corners if you need more detailed information. And most of the information is too wordy and dismayingly uninformative. It’s hidden away because it clutters the screen, but most of it is so much empty numbers and statistics that finding the data relevant to you in any given turn is more difficult than waging a war. People say that vanilla Civilization V was a mediocre, stripped down game compared to Beyond the Sword Civilization IV. I actually enjoyed vanilla Civ V, and the expansions only made it better. Vanilla Civilization VI is a legitimate mess. The AI is like a child, the UI is a chore, and the game’s mechanics actively fight you when they’re not hidden and unclear. And that’s without touching on the game’s sense of humor, which injects itself into every sequence of text longer than seven words. It might or might not be to your liking, much like the game itself. But I would say it’s not worth the price.			"

												This game is not ready, AI is broken and game is not worth playing atm.I was so happy, finally Civ 6 is here, I played Civ 5 for more then 1000 hours and add all the other Civs on that... Just one more turn :)Biggest problem with Civ 6 is the AI, it is completely useless.Today I played Rome on Deity, hardest possible level.I never had more then 5 troops, 3 archer and 2 legionnaire but I was fighting 10-15 enemy troops in almost every battle.I only lost one legionnaire in 3 wars against Greece and Norse, On Deity!Later I attacked Greece capital Athen with only 2 crossbowman and 1 legionnaire and I took it with no problem, Then Greece wanted peace and they gave me everything they had, all city's but one, all resources and all their money, all they had left was one little city and one worker.Don't pay full price for this game, wait a couple of months, price will drop and hopefully they will fix the broken AI.

												So, obviously before i begin i should mention the the dlc's for this game are ridiculous and that i feel a little ripped off for paying the extra 20$ to get the first 4 expansion packs. Regardless of the money its the gameplay that makes or breaks a game so lets get into that. So, is this game worth your money? Short answer, no, Not in its current state. The Ai on anything less than emporer is downright laughable, they will declare war for silly reasons like you having luxury resources they do not, or a smaller navy. I wouldnt necessarily be apposed to this, if they actually did anything with their wars, obviously their tactics leave a little to be desired, but, not only are they unable to capture city's without a significant tech lead on you, they will often lose 2-3 city's in their wars, that THEY declared, they seemingly dont prepare at all, and then YOU will be labeled as the warmonger because they are terrible at wars THEY declared. It is fixable with mods, but no game should get a positive review if it is described as ""fixable with mods"", so i wouldnt buy until its at a significant discount.			"

												It has been tough for me to admit to myself that Civilization 6 is, in its essentials, a fundamentally broken game.  I have been playing the Civilization games since Civ II/ Alpha Centauri.  I have also, in between releases, played many of the turn-based strategies that clearly owe a lot to Civilization, including the Galactic Civilizations series, Age of Wonders, Total War,  etc., all since the early days (I realize that I am betraying both advanced age and a misspent life here).  Civilization always felt like the original and for that reason special.Ironically it has taken a lot of work to break this game so completely.  The root of the problem lies in a slow progression of intended improvements to the game that have both totally outstripped the abilities of the AI and have erected impediments in the ability of human players to do things which used to be straightforward.  Many of the core problems arise from the decision, in Civ 5, to de-stack units in an effort to make combat feel more tactical, and then impose this tactical combat framework on the strategic map.  That decision created loads of obvious and basic problems that many others have already commented on in the context of reviewing Civ 5: e.g., tactical battles that stretch over hundreds of years, a confused crowding of the campaign map with units, etc.  Because there was a lot to like about Civ 5, I had hoped that Civ 6 would find a way to improve some of these issues.  Unfortunately, they seem to have gotten worse.The first and most obvious problems with Civ 6 relate to the complete inability of the AI to play the game.  Computer players in Civ 5 were dumb, but in Civ 6 now they are beyond dumb- they simply cannot function in a way that is rational at the most basic levels.  With respect to discrete tactical battles that involve more than a couple of units, the AI is utterly helpless.   It neither exploits advantages or guards against weaknesses- not even to the limited extent the AI could do these things in Civ 5.  The AI is even worse when it comes to managing armies at a strategic level.  The AI is utterly unable to mount an effective invasion force even between two neighboring cities on the same continent, let alone on a broader scale.   Adding water tiles to the mix completely flummoxes the AI, as units without escort repeated kill themselves by hurling themselves at your naval units and well-fortified coastal cities, without support or the slightest possible chance of success.  Forget the significant overseas naval invasions that the AI would sometimes surprise you with in Civ 4: that is completely beyond the capabilities of this game.  I have played  Civ 6 quite a bit already have yet to have an interesting tactical engagement with a computer player (fighting of hordes of uncoordinated horsemen is not interesting).  On top of all that, for some reason, the AI in Civ 6 seems much worse than ever before at advancing itself technically, and seems to prefer spawning hordes of older units to mindlessly throw at you.  I am not saying that I am some genius and that I am so much smarter than the AI.  Rather, I am saying that a lobster is smarter than the AI.  In sum, the dynamics of turn-based tactical combat on the hex-based strategic map are just too much for any AI to handle.But the problem goes beyond just the AI and the Computer players' inability to play.  In essence, I can understand why the AI has problems, because I too find it exceedingly difficult to assemble and move even a modest-sized mixed-unit force from one place to another.  Because units can no longer be organized into stacks, each step in the process of mustering an army, moving it, transporting it, supporting it, and attacking with it, is a horrid logistical mess.  And because of that, each step takes multiple turns, so if you try to do it in an organized way, many years will pass (hundreds of years if you are early on in the game), units will obsolete, etc., all of which is just dumb.  And again, Civ 6 exacerbates rather than alleviates these problems by adding layers of additional technologies, structures, and districts needed to recruit and organize a mixed-unit army.  For example, I used to enjoy putting together a solid force of land units supported by a navy, and move them over to assault coastal cities.  That was fun in Civ 4, a real pain but doable in Civ 5, and torture in Civ 6.  At the most basic level, Civ 5's experiment with attempting to overlay mixed-unit-tactical combat on the strategic map has failed on multiple levels, and Civ 6 has amplified that failure.  The AI can't handle it, and although it can be fun in very limited circumstances, for the most part it doesn't work and is more of a pain than a benefit.I'm not sure what to recommend.  An improvement in the AI would be a big help, but given the complexity of this game, I am not sure that is possible for any AI to handle it.  Another option would be to allow a partial or total stacking of units, which could not only help the AI, but solve a lot of other messes created by the hex system.  Regardless, something needs to be done, as the game really does not work as it stands.			"

												So unbelievably boring, simplistic and poorly made. I've played Civilization games continually since the mid 90's, and while I have stopped playing games of Civ IV due to slowdown creep, making it eventually unplayable and stopped playing Civ V games due to unavoidable gamebreaking bugs, never before this game have I stopped a game out of pure boredom.Designed like a mobile game, so that anyone could pick it up and play immediately and not have to worry about making poor decisions. There are no decisions to be made anymore. You're driving down the railroad that Civ VI has laid out for you.Also, Civs and leaders are now fully specialized towards a specific win condition, so no more will you play any civilization through the ages with the same goal in sight. No. Now you play civ A if you're doing scientific victory, because the game is designed that way, OR you play civ B if you're going for conquest, because they're got the vastly superior and useful units and war buildings. No choice, just follow the railroad track.Gameplay-wise, you never do anything but wait for building countdowns. You never have any grand plans, overarching or even sub-goals to achieve. You fight some barbarians here and there, wait for workers to make a field here and orchard there, wait some more for another stop on the dumbed down research railroad track to finish, then wait for some building or other to finish and on and on. There's not once a feeling of excitement about pressing the ""end turn"" button to realize some goal you're trying to achieve. You're just going through the motions, quickly seeing through the game's illusion of choice and just as quickly losing interest.Visually, the game lacks any progression through the ages. This is something Civilization has managed to do since the second game, where you clearly see your empire grow and develop. In Civ VI, everything looks the same, like you are the leader of a fisherman's village, a shepherd's hut and a farmer's community. Your cities never really change, they never really grow or develop with the times. They look like the same huts in 4000 BC as they do in 1000 AD. If you are a fan of the previous Civilization games' freedom to forge a story out of your own designs and choices, you will also hate what Civ VI has done to ""streamline"" the gameplay. It strips every possibility of you making the ""wrong"" choice, and in so doing also strips you of any agency to make your own destiny with your civilization. It's Civilization light, a high-powered mobile game based on real Civilization games.If you're craving a turn-based strategy game, any turn-based strategy game, pick up Civilization V with expansions instead. If you've played literally every other Civ game and still want more, ONLY pick this title up at 60% off or more. It's a poor excuse for Civilization and is utterly uninspired and forgettable.			"

												So far I've been through two full games, and I'm finding myself regretting that the only choices for this review are ""Yes"" or ""No""... Let's say that until the game goes through thorough testing and adjusting, I'd have to go for ""No"".It's a Civilization game, just like its precedessors, and as such I've having fun and not regretting my purchase. But my god is the game trying to make it as unfun as possible. The AI goes out of its way to ruin whatever you're trying to achieve, and pushes you toward an aggressive / military game even though you may not wish to.What I like in the Civ franchise is that, contrary to most 4X games, you can have a complete game without ever having to focus on war. In this one, as far as I can tell, it's going to be hard. All other civilizations, not matter what kind of agenda they're pursuing, tend to act irrationally:- their opinion of you swings unbelievably fast from one turn to the next (I assume it happens when you're too close to some behavior threshold and oscillate around it), resulting in an artificially schizophrenic behavior- when you're bargaining and asking them for what they'd like several times in a row, their demand sometimes goes up, sometimes goes down llike a druken-man random generator- barbarians and religious missionaries do only one thing: swamp you. Even when you're first in Faith generation, another civilization will have 4-5 times more missionaries than you and invade your whole territory with them. Even if you're only at turn 10, two barbarian camps can pop next to your only city and produce 2-3 units each to lay siege to itAll games in the series made the AI behave unfairly because the devs have never been able to make it actually strategically sound. But here it reaches new heights of irrationality and stupidity. The game goes from challenging to frustrating, because you see the AI mismanaging its own civilization in order to make you have a bad day, and nothing else. Generating frustration inside the game is good, but outside the game, not so much.Everything related to interactions with other civilization tend to be like that. Perhaps they're so much driven by their newly-added ""agendas"" that they're too busy to care about whatever diplomacy you're trying to do. Perhaps it's the reason why they removed any form of diplomatic victory?This aside, some of the additions to the game are really nice. Managing a town in its full glory, with districts and forcing you to care about the terrain and adjacent buildings, is really pleasant. The UI gives you a much better access to a lot of info than Civ V's UI (with a few strange exceptions, which become noticeable when you're managing a wide civlization and need a thorough overview of all your cities, or when you're having many trade routes).Technically, on Mac the game is good without being great. On a HD7950, it really slows down in the late game, and even went unresponsive a couple of time in the civ leaders cinematics. It also seems to slow down after a few hours, with short freezes after many actions, but comes back to normal after you quit and relaunch. And it's unable to close itself when you click back to desktop, and must be killed.All in all, I'm not too worried: Civ V was a disaster at launch and ended up being a very good game. This one is not a disaster, but it certainly could use some gameplay testing and some bug fixing before it can seriously be recommended to everyone. :)			"

												""What's for dinner?"" my kids asked.""I'll pick up some pizza,"" I responded.""When?"" they asked.""In just one more turn. I promise.""6 hours later the lights are off in the rest of the house. I think they gave up and fed themselves cereal. Or maybe my wife packed them up in the car and left to go to her mother's house. I really don't know. I'll go check after this one more turn. Or maybe after the next one.(Seriously, who does that? I only made them wait an hour. I'm not that heartless.)Because the Steam Awards requires an update... a couple thousand turns later, my wife is back home, the kids haven't starved, and I still enjoy playing this game. Civ VI is very deserving of the ""Just 5 more minutes"" award! If it was up to me, I'd rename it to the ""Just 5 more hours"" award if I could.			"

												Saying I do not recommend this game really pains me, I wanted to like it, I wanted to love it but I just can'tI am not a part time player, almost 900 hours on Civ 5 and around 30 in on civ 6 thus far The AI is idiotic, completely inept and does the most stupid things over and over again giving far too much ease to the human player to steamroll them.The CONSTANT denouncing for very minor things, I got declared war on by the 2 AI, they never came to attack so I took the offense, took some cities, got denounced by several civs for being a warmonger... WHAT?  AI asks you to join a war with them, I do and they then denounce me for being a warmonger! lol  come on now.. Wonders are now mostly eye candy in most cases not worth the effort or tile loss to build them other than the odd exception, which is a pity as they made a big difference in Civ 5 The turn times seem more tedious than civ 5, watching their 27,000 relgious spawns running all over the map, had to turn quick movement on to save my sanity of each turn.BE was bad, this is not too much better :-( please fix, I want to love this like I do Civ 5.It does look very pretty though once used to the graphics change.

												TL; DR: Doesn't feel finished. Well it's not finished. I'd wait a few more months before buying it.Many said this, and for good reasons. But I'll only talk about cons. Tech tree: It's even worse than vanilla Civ 5's tree. Yes. You can get your Fighting jets to fly without researching wheels; It's poorly made, weirdly long (why do I have to scroll horizontally for 3 seconds just to see 4 techs?); Lacks of informations. If it wasn't for my advisor set to ""New to Civ 6"" I wouldn't know I could increase the Food output from my farms by 1 by placing them near each other, though it is specified on the ""Farm"" log on civilopedia; It's too fast! The eurekas (Which get you a boost of 50% on a technology if you do certain things, like building 2 galleys, or killing with an archer, or building a world wonder) are a nice idea that needs to be reworked, but the techs themselves are just too fast to discover, making the entire game unbalanced. GUI:No. The GUI is 2 steps back from Civ 5's GUI. Other people got into details (Like food output, food surplus) so I won't because there's too much to say. Districts:While I really like the idea of spreading a city into more tiles, the districts (it's NOT explained why or how, or when, or what) get more and more expensive. On a marathon game it took me 127 turns to finish a Commercial Hub. Combine it with the fact techs are too fast, and the game becomes even more unbalanced. After some turns (depending on game speed), wonders become much more cheaper than districts. General unbalances: The IA, same for GUI, took 2 steps back from Civ 5; Trading. The IA loves to think (even while being an ally to an IA) your items are♥♥♥♥♥♥and worthless. So when you want a copy of their luxury resource, expect to give away half your gold income per turn and a luxury resource. Terrible; Exploits. There are many exploits caused by poor developing, like trades exploits (where you can, by tricking the IA, get anything you want while giving them pretty much nothing), or workers exploits (Again, they took 2 steps back from Civ 5) which need a detailed explanation:1. Workers, when sold, are incredibly high valued. So, use two of their three charges, and you'll have another worker for free by buying it;2. Workers get no penalties from harvesting (ie: chopping down a forest) resources to get boosts to production/gold even if they're outside your territory and INDEPENDENTLY by the game speed or distance from any city. So you can potentially go on multiplayer on online game speed, agree on open borders and chop down the victim's forests to boost your cities. Enough with exploits, let's talk about the Civilopedia. Completely lacks of informations about pretty much all units. It's full of historical infos, but it seems to forget about many strategic bonuses, or future requirements, etc. Definitely feels incomplete.So... what else?  Maps are small, ""huge"" size is really small. You need space to develop because no more happiness system, but developers don't give you space to; Auto unit-cycling system (can be disabled via editing files though); Resources are hard to see and/or distinguish while on fog of war, forcing people like me to active the ""Resource Icon"" feature that's just annoying; Features are hard to distinguish. I cannot see the difference between a Banana resource and a jungle resource unless I hover on it or have the resource icon active. Or, I cannot distinguish plain tiles from hills tiles, because textures are meh.Even if I talked only about its cons, I ultimately like the game and I'll keep playing it along with Civ 5 and 4! It's different from older titles and has a good potential. I enjoy the government system, the trade routes and city-states, and much more. But it needs to be balanced, because it's obvious developers didn't give a total♥♥♥♥♥♥about going into details (Just look at those exploits with workers, or civilopedia, or game settings OR THE DAMN TECH TREE JESUS CHRIST).Anxiously awaiting for a good fellow fan for making a mod to give a better tech tree to this game. And for someone to tell my civilization how to launch jets from airports without cliff-diving.			"

												I've spent $120 on Beyond Earth and Civ 6, and that's enough. I regret the time I had to put into this botched attempt at a Civ game in order to come to this conclusion.The first 100 or so turns seems cool, but as you progress it becomes apparent that there wasn't a lot of thought put into making the game compelling, but rather meeting deadlines. It just doesn't seem like the developers put much pride into this beyond the shallow and cosmetic. The mathematical underpinnings of the game are fundamentally flawed, and it shows through painfully once a game gets going. I got bored before way I won or lost every game, because nothing seemed to matter. I have 966 hours logged on Civ 5, but I was bored with Civ 6 in under 50 hours. This game is a big step backward from Civ 5. I'm not into the mobile/WoW graphics like many others, but further there's a real feeling of laziness behind the graphic assets. There is no real variation between units or buildings of different cultures. Everything is uniform. China looks just like Mexico beyond the early game. It's homogenous, and that's disappointing for a game that costs $60 and supposedly celebrates all these various cultures and epochs. There are mods made by hobbyists for Civ 5 with more depth diversity. It's just shallow and very low-effort on the part of this supposed AAA studio. They subtracted a TON from Civ 5. For example my infantry went from musketeers in breastplates to WW2 troops to mech. They removed the United Nations, and replaced it with a diplomatic system that is impossible. Everybody will hate you, and if they don't it means they are about to declare war on you. The elegant diplomatic solution that made Civ 5 so interesting was just removed, as if they had made a mistake with Brave New World. The diplomacy is brutal and stupid.I do like some of the features like city districts and...well I do like the districts. The fog of war artwork they did is cool.The AI is so bad it might as well be totally random, which might actually be an improvement. It is so disappointing to be anticipating a big battle, only to have the enemy force disperse for no reason. I'm sitting here frustrated by an opposing army as if they were my own crew of ♥♥♥♥-ups. There's no sense of accomplishment in defeating an enemy that defeats itself. Almost every AI algorithm in the game is straight up broken, and that sucks when you put a bunch of effort into it for nothing.I would say save your money, and maybe buy it on sale, but even then I'd say save your time and invest it in a game of Civ 4 or 5. This is the junkfood of Civilization titles, and I'm really sad to have to write this negative review. Maybe it will mature with DLC, but after a week I'm playing Civ 5 again to scratch my empire building itch.I dunno, maybe since Civ has gone ESPORTZ I should play some multi-player stuff before reaching a conclusion. Playing against the computer is just too dumb for this to be a PVE game on par with its precessors.			"

												My first experience with the AI was amazing. A barbarian hid in one tile of another nation's territory when it was declared that we no longer had open borders. As I was chasing it with a melee unit it was now impossible to reach. No matter what I did it stayed there out of reach. I finally managed to get open borders and kill it but that encounter really raised my expectations. Unfortunately the rest of the game was trash. Similar to Civ V units shuffle around randomly with the added feature of sitting in your territory on the same tile forever, waiting to die. I'm guessing that this is actually what the barb was doing but I had just interpreted some higher level of intelligence that wasn't there due to lack of experience with the game.The AI nations all hate you and denounce you as a warmonger even if you've never declared war on anyone for the entire game! The whole diplomacy side of the game can be completely ignored. Religion can be completely ignored. Wonders can be completely ignored. I never built a single trade route.However, I won that game easily by attacking the nation's that declared war on me because the AI is so terrible.By the 1300's I had nukes and infantry and machine guns for city defence that would 1-shot absolutely any unit type that approached. Strangely, the default city defence machine guns could attack 2 tiles away but the machine guns I upgraded to from archers (archers that also had a range of 2) only had a range of 1 which made them worthless. With the new movement restrictions and roads that don't seem to do anything most of the time you'll find that units take over 100 years to travel from one side of your nation to the other (20-30 turns 2 tiles at a time even on roads). Because unlike other games you need the full 2 movement points to move to a hill or forest and any leftover movement points are always wasted. Want to move to grassland then finish on a hill? If you've only got 2 moves per turn this will take 2 turns.For this reason ranged units are clearly OP. All the units are stuck in the mud and you can take pot shots at them to your heart's desire. This is also why helicopters are so powerful in the late game as they ignore these ridiculous movement rules (though for some reason they turn into boats when flying over water - perhaps because that game actually lists them as light calvary). Once you have helicopters you can just delete your other units as they are the first flying unit in a strategy game that can capture a city. In most RTS/TBS games you can wear down the city defence with any type but always need infantry to perform the capture. Not here, just fly in a sole heli or heli army (3 helis stacked) a few turns and the sole unit can wear down and cap the city by itself. It may take 1-2 damage from melee ground units (I'm not sure how they can reach the heli in the air but again maybe because the game thinks it's a light cav unit).The game only ever crashes upon exit but it also freezes for 5-10 secs at the start of every turn for no reason. All of the AI nations and barbs have made their moves and the indicator is letting you know that it's now your turn but you can't do anything because it's frozen. I tried turning off the autosave or setting it to every 5 turns instead if every single turn but it made no difference.There's lots of other things wrong with the game like the terrible luxury system that assigns luxuries randomly to cities. Additional luxuries after the first do nothing as before but this doesn't work as happiness is now local instead of global. So if you have 2 instances of a luxury then which cities benefit? What happens if one is pillaged or lost? Who knows? The game tells you nothing in this regard you you can either guess or completely ignore yet another core Civ feature.With the long list of core features that make a Civ game all being non-existent,  unexplained or indecipherable in this version you just end up taking a few cities every few turns and that's about all there is to the game.Civ 2 is a better game than this.

												Limited and poorly construed maps are the thing I find most irritating about this game compared to version V.  It really feels like they shipped out a product they ran out of time to finish.  The computer players act irrationally and often without any decent strategy.  If you select a small map, fill it up with civilizations, you'll discover you ended up with a large map (after playing for a while).  The setup wizard is lacking appropriate settings to make the game a joy.If you play the one map and size avilable of ""Earth"" you'll never find yourself starting anywhere other than in the Americas.  I'd love to know what it'd be like to play in Eurasia or Africa but after restarting 20 times I always started in South America and on occassion North America despite trying several different civilizations.The setup tool never remembers what you selected previously so if you have to click everything to get what you want.There are NO scenarios!  Unless you play online in multiplayer.  NOT A ONE.  But, I they just released the Vikings for an extra $5.  How ridicules.  You can't create your own maps, scenarios, or mods.  There are a lot less civilizations as well.I will say one thing for this game.  Because of the limitations and what I spelled out above you will not find it addciting as earlier versions.  I'd wait to buy it until after all their B.S. of trying to ring extra money from you for something as petty as a single civlization (e.g. Poland) is over with.  This game feels unfinished and the lack of maps, ability to edit and make maps and scenarios makes it a bore.  Maybe in a couple years it'd be worth buying. "

												TL;DR: It's so much worse than Civ VDon't get me wrong, there are good things to this game, but it needs major patches, or an expansion, to be an experience comparable with Civ V.Eureka moments for tech and civics are great. Districts are a great idea. Bringing back governments, and making it impossible to have cities that are all things to all people are great. However, there's big problems.My least favorite part is the changes to religion. The idea of religious combat sounds fine and all, but in practice, it's horrific: You are in a religious war EVERY TURN OF THE GAME, healing units requires going back to a city, and you have a whole 3 kinds of units to wage this war with. This makes religion a huge attention drain that you can't ignore, because an enemy AI will be going for a religious victory. Let someone else take over your religion? Great, now they must be your primary target for military war, because otherwise, a military path might just hand the other player the game!There's also no way to really get anywhere without a large empire: Culture? You won't be able to house enough great works to matter, as the maximum number of great works per city is tiny. To increase that, you also need religion, going back to the paragraph above.Another mechanic that makes us need huge empires is military: An extremely large majority of units require strategic resources to be built. Nobody is ever going to trade you for them, so you must expand wildly. Lacking an iron mine in your starting area? Congratulations, you have to rush forward in tech, and hope the strategic resource is anywhere near you.But let's not forget, that science makes things more expensive: Yes folks, moving forward in the science track makes creating districts harder, so you can end up being unable to do very much because you moved forward in science too fast. Nothing like creating a new city, and seeing that it takes 70 turns to build anything.So my veredict is that it's way too easy to get yourself in very unfun situations for the game to be worth it today. I'm sure it'll be fixed eventually, but right now, I can't recommend the game.			"

												An ocean wide but a puddle deep.There's only one word to describe this game, broken. Not only does it crash ALL the time but it crashes at the worst of times, just as I'm about to win a domination victory for example, the game crashes just before I win the game. but the crashes are not what make this game uniquely bad.I could list hundreds of individual reasons as to why this is a bad game but the main and most important reason is game balance. Absolutely no thought or dare I say effort has gone into balancing this game, it's about as balanced as a clown on whiskey after an all night bachelorette party. Do I mean the game is too hard? I wish. No the game is too easy because the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the broken game mechanics allow you to cheese the game in ways you couldn't even dream of in a civilization game. For example there is no downsides to having too many cities in your empire, you can literally spam or conquer as many cities as you like and the game will just keep giving you more science and culture. you'll often find yourself steamrolling science and culture so fast that you're in the atomic era before you've even built the most basic buildings like water mills.The AI is mindless. Often they will have horsemen and catapults in the modern era who proceed to throw themselves at your units, killing themselves. The same goes for diplomacy. If you want an idea of what diplomacy is like in this game then let me give you this as an example, I once got denounced by france 3 turns after meeting them because I WASN'T spying on them. The AI will constantly freeze the game to ask you for all your luxury resources in exchange for nothing while denouncing you for every irrational thing you can think of. You'd have more luck engaging in diplomacy with a Walker from The Walking Dead than you would have with the AI in this game.Something else to keep in mind, the game is as non intuitive as a game can possibly get. You can't automate builders in this game which means if you want all your worked tiles improved you have to manually spawn or create a builder and improve them all yourself. and considering in this game you're going to have at least 30 cities(50 is a more reasonable number) that means you constantly have to go through a bunch of menus for every god damn city to check which tiles need improving. In fact unlike civ 5 all important info requires going through a bunch of menus wheras in civ 5 you could just click on a city and it gives you all you need. Don't worry though through city spam you won't need tile improvements or EVEN BUILDINGS. Just by spamming cities you have enough science and culture to go over 2 eras ahead of all the ais even on the highest difficulty.Wonders are worthless. Remember in civilization 5 how completing a wonder was a big deal and had a huge impact on the game? Here wonders aren't even worth bothering with. Since the key to winning civilization 6 is to just keep getting more and more cities, wonders become completely pointless as they take too long to build and often give you small worthless bonuses. One time I built a wonder for the hell of it on a city with fairly high production and by the time it was finished I had already advanced an entire era ahead. The game advances so quickly that building a wonder is a pointless act. A settler gives you more bonuses than a wonder and that is just pathetic. Why spend 80 turns building the eiffel tower when I can build a settler in 5?This IS NOT civ 5. In fact I don't think the people who designed this game understand even the most basic aspects of a civilization game. Nothing works the way it's supposed to in Civ 6. Diplomacy is broken, the game mechanics are broken and it's tedious as hell to manage your cities. There's only one way to play Civ 6 and that is to spam units and settlers and nothing else. That's not a joke or an exaggeration. There's also religion if you can be bothered with it the AI is too stupid to stop you from winning a religious victory apart from occasionally attacking your religious units with their own if they get too close. You can literally have your apostles idle on a religious site and the enemy apostles will just suicide at you.How this game got pushed out to release in this state is beyond me. Nothing works and the game is broken and unbalanced. I keep seeing all these reviews from people who have only played a few mere hours, even I'm guilty of thinking this was a good game within the first few hours. But the truth is this is an unacceptable level of quality and I expected so much more from Firaxis. I haven't seen a single games journalist have a deep look at the mechanics of this game outside messing around for a few hours.If you do not listen to my review you're going to see the cracks in this game eventually. They really have some nerve to charge so much money for this crap because they know that fans of the series will pay for it. I will think twice before buying a firaxis game in the future.			"

												I really wish steam offered a star rating system instead of a black and white option for this game. Die-hard fans of the franchise will likely be disappointed, yet also understanding, and new players will likely find the game underwhelming. Below is my reasoning why, starting with the positives.1. Graphics. A lot of people think the graphics are too cartoony. While I agree with this assessment, if you have your settings turned up high enough, absolutely everything is animated. It certainly looks cool and makes the game seem very attuned to detail (if only this carried through into bugs).2. Trade. I really appreciate how they've redone trade, road construction is far less tedious and contains much less micromanagement. However you don't have control over how the roads are formed, so sometimes city connections are skipped over, requiring manual control. It's still an improvement. I really wish they would make total trade routes city-based rather than a set quoata per empire, but thats just me.3. Espionage. This one is a really easy one to call an improvement. The depth of epsionage out of the box is far more nuanced and available compared to previous games. You have excellent, practical options for cities, as well as depth through escape routes. There are no counter-espionage buildings like in civ VI BNW, but this could be added later.4. Resources. Nobody seems to be commenting on this, but the game returns to Civ-IV style resources where instead of quotas the game uses blanket production resources (meaning you only need one to build all units that use it). This is an improvement I certainly welcome the return of.5. Even More Depth!!! The gameplay is certainly more nuanced than previous versions, with the so-called ""Un-stacking"" of cities. I'm sure everyone understands how districts work, but I have a few complaints about them as well. This certainly removes the realism of previous games, but also in some aspects installs new versions of it.7. No More Missiles! This Is something I see overlooked in most reviews, so I'm happy to discuss it here. Nuclear Devices and Thermonuclear Weapons supplant traditional nukes, which were Atomic Bombs and Tactical Nukes in previous versions of civ. Once they are constructed, they can be easily deployed from any nuclear-capable unit, whether that be a ""Missile Cruiser"" (The in-game model is actually a Soviet Corvette), Nuclear Submarine, or Bomber. Nuclear submarines are also now capable of land attack, and fire cruise missiles without them having to be constructed.Now on to the negatives:1. Diplomacy. This is what everyone is talking about, and I completely agree with everyone else; you can more or less ignore this aspect of the game entirely. Nobody seems to care about anyone else, and everyones' conflicting agendas are interesting, but they only serve to perpetuate distrust in practice. For example, Qin Shi Huang of China hates it when you build a wonder. ANY wonder. So please don't plan on making friends with China if you're even remotely ambitious as a Civilization. Some nations seem to appreciate nations that are smaller than they are innately, which seems cool, but this really doesn't serve well for winning the game. Diplomacy victory is also gone... so don't waste your time.2. AI. They really missed the mark on this one. AI don't upgrade units, and instead simply move them around, allowing them to be mowed down by superior technology. 3. Game Pace. This one might just be me, but it seems like everything just takes longer to do in this game than in previous versions. Movement is a complete mess, with roads only working half of the time, and units taking forever to move across oceans, tiles, and other things. It can take ages to deploy an army in the face of a surprise or joint war, and it takes decades for nuclear submarines to cross oceans. Buildings, especially late game, take a ridiculous amount of time to improve and recreate, especially if buildings were pillaged. Units are very costly.4. Wonders. I'm not sure why, but they completely nerfed the importance of wonders on a global stage. Tile specificities leave ancient era wonders unconstructed into the Industrial Era. They require a considerable investment of resources and time, and do not provide huge benefits (to score, and improvement-wise) unless you meet very specific conditions, some of which only come out of pure luck. Score calculations have also been completely reworked, and wonders no longer count as largely as they used to for score.Im giving this one a hesitant recommend. I love the series, but I have trouble convincing myself to get back to the game and play some more given how tedious play is now. I'll probably give it another go, but I'm waiting for the workshop to be opened.			"

												A little bit of background. I've played Civ-Civ VI. I've played Alpha Centauri and Civ BE. I'm trying to like this game, but as it is now, I'm thinking of uninstalling it. The Cons have been said ad naseum (bad AI, mid to late game slow down, random unit selction, ect...) So I'll add my two cents. First no matter what size map and no matter the difficulty, the game insists on putting a ton of AI civs directly next to you. As I got sick of AI civs next to me, my new strategy is to take their territories ASAP. (Please note: I don't want a domination victrory). In the latest game, by turn 21 I had an American scout, Russian scout, and Brazilian scout show up. I kill off Washington (about 15 tiles away, mind you, on a huga map), then Russia and Brazil declared war on me. I take them both out by 860AD. But, Norway  has this huge army. So I know how bad this game is for AI city spam and I ask them to stop settling near me. They say OK. Then they spawn a city between two of my existing citites. As China I was superior in technology against their warrior horde (I had many promoted units), but why keep playing? Domination isn't fun for me and yet I'm being forced into that playstyle. Can we please stop having AI next to each other every game? There are 5 AI civs next to me, yet other parts of the world are largely empty. No thanks.Second: Informtaion notifications need a bit of a overhaul. I'm having trouble seeing what ameneities and housing are needed. We still have the issues of auto explore with units who will happliy walk into 3 AI units before calling my attention to it. These same units will stop 3 tiles away fromt he goody huts.  Make it so units within three tiles warn you of AI enemies. I could go on, but I think you get the drift.Bouns issues!City states spam units and just move them around endlessly. Maybe give us some IRL time per turn back by just having them fortify unless they have a need to move.Why the hell does the AI spam so many religious units? They are ultra aggressive in spreading their religions. Also on the lowest levels they seem to be able to spam missionaries and apostles in mass quantites. This needs to be fixed.Conclusion:At this stage of the product, I think you should hold off for a patch. There are a few bright points, but IMO, it's a ton of frustration right now.			"

												There's just no magic to this game like there was with Civ5. - Districts are annoyingly tedious- War isn't fun due to movement mechanics and boring units- Civ bonuses seem confused and over-complicated- AI is incredibly inept at formulating strategies- Religion is over-complicated and unfunThere's alot more I don't like about the game but you get the point. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												First: I like Civ VI and think that it has the potential to be the best in the series. However, there are a few reasons I can't recommend it right now.1: The AI is godawful. You thought the AI in Civ V was bad, next to the Civ VI AI however, it looks pretty smart. I think part of the reason the AI is so bad is because they fleshed out the cities into districts. This requires a large amount of planning, something the AI is incapable of. You often find the AI settling in places where they won't be able to take advantage of their district placement. In the event the AI settles a city in a good spot, they place the district in random (it might actually be a RNG controlling this) places where it serves no purpose. When you get into wars with the AI, it is PATHETICALLY easy to fight and EXTREMELY predictable. The AI is only a challenge in wars when they have a sheer numbers/tech advantage, and I don't mean one civ, I mean like a 3v1 where they have one tier unit above you. In higher difficulties the AI units deal more damage, which doesn't actually make it any harder, it just draws out wars because the AI is so stupid in the first place it won't do anything with them. The AI also doesn't get rid of units, so if it never gets iron, you can bet there will be warriors attacking your infantry.2: UI/tips are awful. The UI, while cleaner, is more confusing because you have to click 3 buttons where you should only have to click 1, and the tool tips are absolutely no help. I had no idea how to mannually open my government tab until the medieval era. The tool tips offer no help. Oh, you put a city under siege. Ok, what does that do? Oh, the garrison won't heal (I had to look this up online, it wasn't even in the civlopedia).3: Wonders: I HATE how the wonders take up a tile now. This seemed like a cool idea in theory, but in practice it is just bad. Espesially now that you have to build districts, you are REALLY pressed for tile space. Oftentimes, the wonder isn't worth it anyway.4: The split of the tech tree into science and culture. Again, something that sounds really cool, but was poorly implemented into the game. The rate of advancement can be rather...skewed sometimes. With the eureka moments, you can often get almost all techs in half the time if you plan it out, which is crazy.I have no doubt that the game will become more streamlined and simpler after some patches and maybe and expansion or two, and the game is really fun as is. However, I cannot recommend it in its current state unless you are a big fan of the civ series.Verdict: 6/10, not enough cowbell.			"

												TL;DR: Broken AI, Broken DiplomacyMy first negative review.Please do not judge my hours, I play my games off line as I ""work for travel!""Do not get me wrong, you will have a ton of fun building and managing the empire. Unfortunatelly, there is no challenge when it comes to diplomacy.I have played all Civs (from the original one) and witnessed a lots of progress when it comes to graphics, empire management and gameplay. The new release brings slightly different gameplay, but unfortunatelly the AI has not evolved. I would love to see smarter AI, not cheating AI.So, what is so bad about AI?Broken AI and diplomacy; some examples include:-AI settlers travel unprotected-AI settlers hesitate to build cities, just roam-AI DOW when much inferior-AI unrealistic peace negotiation offers when loosing-trading resources deals do not make any sense (sometimes you get great offer and 30 turns later bad offer for the same resource)-player penalty for broken promises (keep units away from border, building cities close to AI), when in fact the promise was kept-no penalty for AI broken promises-AI does not upgrade units-AI comments on my empire sound like riddles that I really do not understand or actually care about.It almost feels like AI makes lots of random decisions.One moment they are impressed with my navy (I have only two ships) and then 20 turns later I am denounced for having a weak navy.

												So the main question most people looking at buying this game would ask is whether or not it is better than Civ 5.There really is no simple answer to that question but I think to a large extent the answer is yes, here's why:1. The atmosphere is amazing. At first I thought I would hate the graphics, but since I've been playing they've grown on me (not in a weird fungal way). Yes, they do look less reallistic then Civ 5 (possibly even a little bit cartoonish), but they build an atmosphere for the game in a way that is just as immersive as the realism of Civ 5. The music is great, definitely superior to that of Civ 5 (maybe not as great as Baba Yetu, but then again what is). I also love Sean Bean's voice (no homo).2. The city building is far deeper than that of Civ 5, and more strategic. You actually have to plan out how you will use each tile and where you will build improvements. You can't build every single building you want to in each city, and that forces you to specialize each city.3. The combat is a lot more tactical than in Civ 5. The new movement rules make a large impact on planning out your assaults as well as your defenses. Also bringing back stacking from Civ 4 in a limited way makes you make decisions about where you want to focus your strength. I also love the fact that it takes walls for a city to bombard; it gives you a reason to actually build walls.4. Each civilization is a lot more deep and it feels like each leader has a personality. I know that agendas are getting a lot of flak right now, but I actually really enjoy them. For example, I fought Gorgo to a standstill early on in one game, and after the war ended we actually became friends because she beleived I had fought honorably. It actually felt like she was acting like the historical figure actually would. Now of course the agendas need some tweaking to make the Ai behave normally but overall I like the agendas. Oh and as a side not Civilizations don't have just one bonus now, they actually have several, which makes each civ a bit more detailed and unique.5. The early game can be challenging if you aren't prepared. This especially applies to higher difficulty games, where in the early game you will more than likely have to deal with a neighboring civ or barbarians. You actually have to build units early game in order to protect yourself. Now admittely the ai does need to be fixed so it can attack effectively but I will talk more about that later.6. The eureka and inspiration boosts definitely take each game a different dirrection. The choices you make in game actually effect how your civilization progresses. For example, if you have a very peaceful early game, then chances are you won't be researching stuff like archery or bronze working for a while just because it is easier to go down other routes first. It feels like your experiences in game are actually connected to your technology and culture.7. I also really like how the civics tree functions. The whole card system feels a lot more fluid than the old social policy system that inevitably came down to going tradition and then rationalism. Again, it feels like you are reacting to your game, not the other way around. I also really enjoy the government types and the bonuses each one gives. The governments actually give you an interesting early and mid game in terms of culture and its bonuses.8. I know this is a small thing but I really like the fact that there are actually casus belli now and that warmongering penalties increase throughout the ages.9. Housing should probably go with #2 but I'm kind of lazy so..... I like the realism of being essentialy forced to settle around fresh water. I'm a history nerd so I absolutely love civilizations rising around major waterways like in the neolithic era and there being an emphasis on looking for water sources for new cities.10. The new and expanded victory types are defintiely a welcome addition. It is good to see that there a bigger benefits for focusing on relgion than there were in Civ 5. I'm also grateful that city states now function differently which has also lead to the removal of the diplomatic victory type, as it was just annoying to see other civs having infinite amounts of gold and overwhelming you with it in Civ 5. Also, I feel like the science victory is more meaningful, as it feels like you aren't just building parts for a spaceship but also trying to settle a new planet.The list of great changes for Civ 6 could go on and on but I think I got most of the major ones. Here are the few negative parts of this game that aren't an improvement over Civ 5:1. The Ai can be a bit wonky at times. It has a very hard time attacking cities properly, even with the overwhelming numbers it always has. The Ai can also have trouble upgrading it's units, although often times this is due to a lack of resources for certain units. However, if you are planning on dominating the world in Civ 6, it isn't actually that much easier than in Civ 5 (not that it was that hard on Civ 5), as the Ai will actually build updated units and it usually has a ton of units so it can be difficult and a bit of a meat grinder to get through them all. The Ai will probably be patched up to working condition within a month, so it really isn't that big of a deal.2. The Ui could use some amount of improvement, mainly in the way lists are sorted and making it more clear how your amenities are being used. This is relatively minor and will be a rather easy patch or will just require a mod or two to deal with if you are really that OCD.So in conclusion, while the game isn't perfect, it is already just as, if not more, fun than Civ 5 all while offering a  completely different expereince from Civ 5. I see no reason to wait to get the game, as it is already very much a fun and enjoyable experience, even without expansions (which could not be said of Civ 5 on release, despite it now being one of the best strategy games of all time).

												In general after several rounds you end up just playing by yourself. Like playing a tabletop game against your parents who always lose because they don't understand what they have to do. And gets boring real quick, the motivation to keep playing or end /defeat the game, dies. Cons:Getting spammed with leader screens just to say trivial things is very annoying.  Performance past turn 200 goes downhill. A.I. is the worst. Denounced and suprise declaration of war of friends all the time for no apparent reason. Resources scattered in a non reasonable/unfun way. Districts are something new and works good, but... MEH, not really a good Idea.Civic Cards is the most pointless feature in the game. They don't really ADD anything notieceable in game. Again, annoying prompting. Advanced options when starting a game are really mediocre.I am a single player, so I'm not interested in multiplayer.After 30 hours I don't think I can refund this game.I hated the worker mechanics you can only use them 3 times and then they dissapear.Religion doesn't seem to work for me.. I don't know I just ignore religion completelyPro:First hours are interestingI like the graphics and leader animations.nice wonder mechanicsnice trade route mechanics... although its annoying it keeps asking for new routes (automatization would be great)This game is not good and not really bad, but broken. Not recommended.I'll wait for some time, maybe it gets better like CIV V and will try it again, for now i just wasted money. Don't buy even on sale, you are not missing anything. "

												I'm giving a very uncertain and conditional no. There's this usual deal - if you make a sequal to game, it's only logical people will compare. And in case of civilization, the game is always exactly the same, just features change. So if you come with a sequal, it should be better then what the players already have, no? Obviously no. It's better then vanila Civ5 - but only because it incorporates features added in datadiscs. Sadly, with some of them tweaked and some removed, the whole game doesn't work nearly as well as its previous incarnation.WARNING: Wall of text ahread. If you want a conclusion, seek the last paragraph.I'll start with the good. Active research is pretty good, it keeps you active. Over a few playthroughs it gets rather repetitive, because it's usually just build 3 something or something else, but still, cool idea and it works. The districts are not bad at all. They are a tad too complicated for the difference they mean, but they are a fun decision and add dilema to the game, since a city typically won't have everything it wants now. Placement of wonders also feels pretty good, you finally won't have pyramids built in jungle and three gorges in desert. Nice touch :)So the two aspects the game was marketed with work all right. Still the bright side I kind of like how great persons now have slightly different abilities that change thematically with progress through eras (early scientist can bring belief for example). Only kind of though, since for most great persons, the dilema known from civ5 was removed. Do I use great writer for one time culture boost or great work? Should my great prophet go on conversion tour, or should he become a holy site? Not here - the role of the character is given and while merchant/scientist/engineer differs at least a bit, the only difference between writer/artist/musician is name of their works and slots they fit into. Thumb down.The removal of dilemas is responsible for a lot of my dissapointment. City states are now gained by sending ""envoys"" into them, envoys being gained via quests (like infulence in civ5) or via a separate ""influence"" resource, which is used solely for this purpose - there's no other use for it. Using money was definitely much better, addign the decision whether they should be saved for unit upgrade, used for boosting city development or invested in city state.Similar thing happened to tourism. In civ5 late game it's an important asset, because it sways other powers towards your ideology and so it matters even if you don't go for for culture victory. Not so here, it again has sole purpose and if you intend to win via diplomacy or religion, you can safely ignore its existence.Remember how you couldn't wait for your new civ5 cultural policy to be finished, because they were all strong and super useful? How every policy branch supported different playstyle? Ok, so you can forget about it. There's a policy tree similar to tech tree now, so you're more or less forced to invent everything. You get policy cards that go into government slots. There's a lot of cards and very few slots. So you'll be using maybe 5% of what you've discovered. Baaaad idea. Actually one of the worst I've encountered here.Above issues are conceptual - they are part of the game, I assume they will be tweaked in datadiscs and one just has to take them or leave them, because it's what makes the game after all. Then there's technical side though.UI is definitely a big step back. I'm constantly struggling to find information which is either hard to reach or not available at all (not even in civilopedia!!!). I was used to getting a comprehensive breakdown on almost everythign by right clicking - it's comfortable and it helps the learning curve, because it helps me understand why do the numbers look the way they do. Here I struggle with finding out what's on individual tiles, what the tile yield is, why are my people unhappy. I can't find my units - they are difficult to spot, the ones that already moved look the same as fresh ones and there's no unit list that would help me find that archer stationed in some backwater colony I've already forgotten about. Attacking from a city is an annoying minigame where you first try to move camera so that you see the attack button hidden behind city garrison and then you wave your cursor around, hoping the attack arrow will appear. If you click too soon, bad luck, it's back to step one again.The idea of chaining escort/support unit to military was good, but why the hell are they not melded together into one unit? If you get artilery with observation baloon and great general, it's two ""skip turn"" and one attack every turn, that's just crazy. It has also often happened to me that my ranged ship sailed right towards the enemy melee, because I had escorted admiral selected instead of main ship and didn't notice. Graphic is personal opinion, but units are less detailed and their attack animation much less interesting for me, the same goes with AI leaders who are... rather unimpressive looking and bland. But really, this is the first thing I'm willing to forgive if everything else works.AI leaders and AI in general - it really really need a patch. I can more or less put up with fact my tanks are meeting club armed warriors someone forgot to upgrade. But then there's England boldly declaring war on me. Driving 18 heavy chariots to surround my city (defended with a musketeer, ok, England is a bit backwards). And then it probably realizes attacking would be futile and just stands around, driving back and forth, doing nothing. I suspect that with such high number of units, it might even be able to break through the defenses eventually (losing 17 of them and maybe getting a city). But no, it just watches how fire from the city massacres them and that's the point where I'm considering just dropping the game till a few patches, because there's no challange in it and no fun.To give a final point - it's a good game, which is hardly a praise for a sequel of a marvelous game. It urgently needs AI patches. It would benefit from redesign of UI. Features are... okeyish. There's the feeling of novelty and there's the promise of datadiscs making it grand again. But so far it's merely good.			"

												While this game offers many improvements over Civ5.In some ways it's a big downgrade.Let's start with the UI problems.The UI for city view looks like this[i.rdthrne.com]. I can click a few buttons and then it looks like this[i.rdthrne.com]; which, in my opinion, should be the default view. Every time I open up the city view, I have to click those buttons again. I have no clear overview of my cities or what I can do with them.When I hover over tiles I want to see immediate results. I can't do that in civ6. There's not even a setting for changing the popup speed. There was one in civ5. I can't understand why this was removed in civ6. Makes zero sense to me.When I'm in the leaderscreen it takes a second or so for the buttons to appear. I read faster than they appear, so I end up getting annoyed at it because I have to wait for the buttons to appear. Pretty annoying.The gameplay problems.Sometimes I select a unit before my turn starts with the intention to move it somewhere. Or sometimes I want to click on a unit after I've moved another unit. This game doesn't want me to. Because it automatically selects another unit that is in need of action. I've lost a settler to barbarians because of this.Barbarians. Don't get me started on the barbarians. I didn't like barbarians in civ5. They had little impact on the game beyond forcing you to build a few archers. They were annoying, but that's it. I could play with them enabled without being really impeded in the game. But in civ6.. they ruin the game. It feels like I'm constantly at war. Barbarians are literally everywhere. My scouts are all dying because they're literally surrounded by barbarians.[i.rdthrne.com] I am forced to turn them off. And that makes some civs obsolete early game. That's poor core gameplay. Workers. Each worker can only be used a finite amount of times. 3 by default, and 4 with pyramids (which require desert). I understand this is because you have to pay more attention to which tiles you improve and which ones you don't. I get that. But now I have to make workers for each city.. multiple times.. that's a lot of turns. Wasted, just on making workers. Diplomacy. I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what I'm doing. The tutorial didn't tell me♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the UI is unhelpful. I seriously can't figure this out. (Though I didn't play past the medieval era due to frustrations, so it might've been more obvious later on.)The tutorial. It tells you too little. Much too little. The only things I learned from this tutorial was the basic stuff; which is good, and how to attack/kill a civ. It told me nothing about diplomacy, nothing about natural wonders, nothing about sea resources or how to improve them. Next to nothing about city states. I went through the tutorial and I still spent most of my time in the game being confused. In the end it just tells you to look at the civilopedia.In the end, I spent most of my time not understanding what I was doing. And that's after 4 hours of gameplay.I can't talk about anything past the first 100 turns. Because I never went any further than that. Right now the game is unplayable to me. There are too many small annoyances.But, there are good things. And I'll mention a few of those. These are all improvements over civ5 or otherwise good or unique additions.You can link non-combat units with combat units so they move simultaneously. This is great, I only have to move the units once, and there's no room for ♥♥♥♥ups.The unit promotion system is way better. You can clearly see what path your unit can follow in terms of promotions, and when you promote the unit it also gets healed. No more being forced to get a healing promotion because your unit is dying.The fact that you have both a tech and civics tree, as well as the government policy system with cards. This allows for a very fine customization of playing style. This is great. (Though, this added complexicity might be confusing to some)The district system and other city building/planning mechanics. This makes you slightly less reliant on good spawn positions.There are more good things (and more bad things), but I can't think of them at this moment. Great overall game, but has some really glaring issues that could ruin the experience for you. I recommend waiting until this game has some patches. (don't you dare make fixes in gameplay a paid DLC, firaxis. You don't fix your own game and then ask money for it.)I recommend you don't buy this game in its current state. The game's too much of a downgrade to be worth the 60 buck price tag. I regret buying this. I'm sure it'll be a great game 2-3 years down the line, with expansions and fixes all there. But right now it's pretty frustrating.			"

												I cannot in good conscience reccomend this game in it's current state.+ The game has a lot of cool systems that are fun to explore- The systems are VERY poorly balanced.  Your cities produce FAR too little production to pay for the incredibly expensive districts, and the improvements to production come in the form of +1 here and +1 there.  Not nearly enough.- There are a number of bugs I've run into that ruined my plans- Missionaries of neutral parties block ALL military units when they walk through a warzone.  SERIOUSLY?  How are religious units not on their own stacking limit separate from military units?  An english missionary wanders into the only road over a river which stops my entire advance for two turns, then another one comes and does it again 4 turns later!- The interface and tooltips are missing a lot of information.  Some information just appears to be blatently wrong, while others are either nonexistant or incomplete.- No queue for buildings, really?- AI is at least as bad as Civ V AI, and might even be worse (I watched an AI settler wander in circles for dozens of turns despite being 4-6 tiles away from 2 different prime city locations...on emperor difficulty!)If they provide robust modding capabilities it might be salvagable, but I don't think I trust firaxis to fix these problems.  They'll make a half-hearted effort and call it done like always, and rely on the modding community to make it playable by anyone other than the most casual players.			"

												The Civ series should return to the basics.  I loved civilzation I-IV because the gameplay was quick, snappy, strategic, and complex yet wasn't weighed down by multiple layers of micro management.  Civ VI plays show and is laggy in between turns even with an extremely fast machine.  I like how the developers added layers of complexity to the game but I feel they sacrificed gameplay enjoyment for features.Please make Civilization fun again.			"

												Needs balancing, diplomacy is a nightmare.Diplomacy: ""The art of dealing with people in a sensitive and tactful way.""The ai is neither of these things.Example of ai diplomatic sensitivity.-Your ONE man scout nears yours friends, or not friends (doesn't make a difference) borders. ""What the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing with that army man!? Do you plan to invade??? You better tell me!"" They'll say.-Your good friend invites you to join them in a war to defeat a common foe.. You accept.. Denounces you for warmongering...........*facepalm*Example of ai diplomatic tactics.-Declares war on you for virtually nothing. Sends army so large you weep. Will 8/10 times acomplish nothing. Have maybe 2 out their 30 unit army get killed by your outdated one man bow man. Offers you their unconditional surrender along with practically everything in their posession.""Oh i out tech you, out man you 10 to 1, have them at your borders.

												Pro's:-Plenty of eye candy, didn't even mind the cartoonish civ leaders-More flexibility for the 1-unit-per-tile rule with the escort and corp/army system-THE WONDER MOVIES yes! they brought it back from Civ IV... awesomesauce!-Governments and civic ""cards"" make it more flexible to govern your civ-Love the districts and ""un-stacking"" of cities-Actually playable with a steam controller (ok, I know I'm probably in the minority, but it's a nice touch that they pre-defined actions that you can map to different buttons)-Religous war is neat, fight with your apostles / missionaries instead of swords and guns-Return of city-based happinness, yay!-Like the re-working of city states so Civs can't just buy them all off-Loved how trade routes built roads, makes sense reallyNeutral:-Combat: didn't experience much of it (played a cultural game first) but it doesn't seem much changed from Civ 5-Music is ok, pretty much what you'd expect from CivCon's-Plenty of micro-management: city building selections AND citizen assignment (NO city governors; seriously, I would have thought this would be one of the most requested features), can't automate workers / missionaries-UI needs improvement: it was not shown how many luxuries were going to a city, just a generic ""uncover more luxuries"" when you have negative amenities-The whole amenity system seemed like an unnecessary change... made more sense when it was happy / sad faces-It was a bit confusing about ""envoys"" at first because it was hard to see the little arrows to increase them at each city state-Would have been nice to have something like ""trade route"" range because I didn't really get how to increase that other than just wait for the modern era-There are a bit too many notifications, gets overwhelmingOverall, I like it better than Civ 5 with the HUGE caveat of the missing city governors. I would definitely recommend as long as you don't mind some micro-management near the middle-to-late game. Now that I've finished my first game, I probably won't play again until they patch some things.			"

												Single player is borderline unplayable. The AI is completely broken; the agenda system is a complete mess that leads to the AI making descisions that are entirely unreasonable. They are ALL extremely aggressive, yet merely defending yourself (something you'll have to do multiple times every game completely out of the blue) results in every AI denouncing you for ""war mongering"" while you can't even negotiate peace with the AI, even with ""peace keepers"" like Teddy Roosevelt. The AI will settle RIGHT NEXT TO your cities and then demand you move your troops. The AI completely skewers resource values and makes absurd demands for even relatively trivial resources, yet will not pay you more than peanuts (a few gold and open borders usually) for extremely valuable resources rendering trading essentially nonexistant. Tall playstyles have been gutted thanks to many poor design choices like wonders and districts taking up tiles. The tech tree actually allows you to do things like make Infantry before Musketmen. Half of my starts are completely unplayable, either by getting overrun by 3-4 barbarian encampments right around my start or by desperately lacking vital resources- and this is with balanced starts enabled. The difficulty is also fairly artificial with things like AI units being stronger baseline instead of smarter AI. Religious victories are also dumb right now, even taking an AI's holy city won't stop their progress. Autocycle. Jesus christ autocycle.It's like they didn't bother to beta test single player at all. Mindblowingly bad.			"

												I was so hoping that this game would deliver and it does not :(  I can only give the game a rating of 4/10. so disapointing.I am a fan of the CIV games and this one fails in so many ways:Pros:1) Graphics look good (if you like the style i do not)2) it is a Civ game3) I like the idea behind the governments cool concept poorly implemented.Cons:1) Graphics - the style feels like it is for tablets, low Poly count and overly large units and icons for the touch screen players.2) The maps are tiny!  The huge map is smaller than the Standard maps in Civ 5.3) you cannot zoom out in the map overview (guessing it is to hide how small the map is)4) The map for explored but out of site is hard to read and the art choice does nothing for me (overly complicated pencil sketch5) Tech tree unfinished, by this i mean that the descriptions of teh individual techs are lacking, the background is uninspired and i have no idea what the numbers that appear at the bottom of the tech tree are for.6) Culture tree - same as tech tree.7) While i like the idea of tailoring the government style, it again feels unfinished, there are no images for the cards, just a colour. their is no commitment requried, everytime you get a new culture research stage you can change your government style for free.8) Religion, as soon as you can create apostles you can max out the religion, no sense of developing your religion.9) Diplomacy - as already mentioned the animation can not be bypassed without cancelling the whole interaction.  the AI does nto seem to take into account your current situation when threats are made, identifying when promises are kept or broken keeps getting it wrong. I declared war onmyself 3 times in one game!10) many little glitches, that should not have made it into the final game, an example I built two different buildings for the 3rd building in the religious district.  do do this start buildign with one religion, change the religion of the city and quick build the second building, you end up with a red exclamation mark and the two buildings overlapping, but yopu get the bonuses for both 11) The combat AI is terrible, I ecided to go for a domination victory on a small pangea map, as suliman i was able to capture all teh capital cities while still in the BC area, rather than defend their capital cities the AI sent all the forces to attack my capital, or atleast they left my attacking forces alone, then dissapeared when the city fell.  The combat AI for the Apostiles is better than for the aremd forces, at leat they track down and attack enemy religios units.12) game is too easy.I will give this another 3 months before trying to play the game again, to see if it is playable, in the mean time i am going back to Civ 5			"

Product received for free
												A couple facts: Im old, been gaming since 82. I've been a writer, a coder, a tester but above all else a gamer. My favorite type of game is strategy and i've spent many thousands of hours playing every sid meier game that has ever came out. From pirates, railroads, sim city and every civ. I got a copy of this game for free, which was neat because I was about to order it but I have been on a mailing list since like 92 and I guess it was my turn. First time heh.What I liked:Game felt very familiar right away. I didn't struggle to understand anything that was going on. The districts are explained very well and actually make sense. I never did like being able to cram every single wonder into one city in previous civs, i mean it made for a great city but really, where were you putting all those things? Depending on which civ you choose you can have anywhere from 5 to 6 districts per city from a selection of arts, entertainment, industry, science, faith etc etc. Each of those districts can house many different types of buildings specific to your civ and what direction you are trying to go in with that city. Also Wonders are linked to districts and by land formations you can't just build them anywhere so city placement, tile purchase and city layout are very strategic.Diplomacy. I read alot of negative comments about this. How the AI is insane and makes no sense. In fact i'd say 75% of the negative reviews are about this. However, I can say that 100% of the people complaining about the diplomacy simply don't understand it. Civ VI diplomacy is insanely complex and deep, every leader has his/her own personality matrix plus 2 agendas, one public and one hidden. The public agenda is always the same, lets call it the civ agenda. The hidden agenda is more like the leaders personal goal, looking out for him/herself not so much their nations interest. You have to get close to a nation through gifts, trading, etc to be granted 'secret' access to their policy to see their hidden agenda. If anything you do goes counter to any of their agenda's they become erratic and paranoid. Think south korea and north korea, they co-exist but barely. Or china and taiwan. Civs take their sovereignty super serious in this one, even the HINT that you are making an aggressive move makes them paranoid, build a settler, fine, move that settler one hex towards empty land near them, they freak. Remember, they are hipocrits too. Oh and gifts are your friend, give them small amounts of gold every so often.Units and Combat.The combat in this version is about the same as in the last, you do have some support units and there is a whole faith based combat system but honestly most of the refinement can be had here, its not great but its not bad.Fit and PolishI do wish they had gone a different direction than the cartoony graphics, of course one of the first mods i used was the westeros reshade filter which helped a ton, another issue is when playing a 12 AI map turns take forever to resolve, sometimes 2 minutes which is crazy. But overall its a solid base game and I think it will only get better as they patch and refine.*edit* I wanted to edit this to add a couple things. First off I have had alot of people saying this game was buggy. I have a decent PC: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 14393) (14393.rs1_release_inmarket.161014-1755)  Language: English (Regional Setting: English)  BIOS: BIOS Date: 10/20/10 09:47:36 Ver: 08.00.10  Processor: AMD FX(tm)-8120 Eight-Core Processor            (8 CPUs), ~3.1GHz  Memory: 16384MB RAM  Available OS Memory: 16330MB RAM  Page File: 6269MB used, 12724MB available  DirectX Version: DirectX 12  Card name: AMD Radeon R9 200 Series  Manufacturer: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.  Chip type: AMD Radeon Graphics Processor (0x679A)  DAC type: Internal DAC(400MHz)  Display Memory: 11218 MB  Dedicated Memory: 3053 MB  Shared Memory: 8165 MB  Current Mode: 2560 x 1440 (32 bit) (60Hz)  Monitor Name: ViewSonic VX2770 Series  Monitor Model: VX2770 SERIES  Driver File Version: 21.19.0137.0001 (English)  Driver Version: 21.19.137.1 Anyhow, I have not had one crash, one bugged UI, hang or any other glitch other than the long turn times mid-late game. Sure the game needs refinement, sure it has some bugs, but to label it as a glitchy, bug laden pile of garbage as so many have is outright false. I suspect they are using mods, perhaps incorrectly, or edited files themselves, maybe their systems need more memory. I know alot of people try to game on laptops now. That is simply something that won't fly in this game, not unless you sprung for a 1600++ gaming laptop with 12+ gb of ram and a dedicated GPU.Just saying...*edit #2*Wanted to edit my review to add my current favorite mods I am using that makes the game well, perfect imo.

												I'm not one for leaving reviews, but I feel this game deserves some praise.  While the game isn't perfect, I feel the amount of negativity surrounding other reviews isn't a fair assessment of the game.  There are some loyal, passionate and long-time customers of the franchise.  Civ V being regarded as such a fantastic and well balanced game, shouldn't cause negative reviews for the newest installment in the series.I think the developers made some fantastic changes to the game, while sticking to it's roots.  Districts are an interesting addition to the game and I like the way Builders are used in this installment.  The Technology Tree and it's Eureka moments add another layer of strategy not found in it's predecessor.  Some of the Government Policy cards could use some balancing, as I often tend to use the same over and over.  However, as I've played with other civs and altered my playstyle, I find myself using cards that I hadn't in the past.  Sure, the AI behaves a bit odd and is something that can be easily beaten as you settle-in to the new mechanics.  They also have some strange behaviors.  These are not game-breaking issues and something that I'm confident that will continue to be balanced in future patches.  I honestly think these minor annoyances are the reason for the negative reviews.  Just because something isn't perfect, doesn't make it bad.  Patches have already been introduced to adjust AI behavior while in the meantime, Steam Workshop mods have been opened up (one of which is an AI improvement mod).  At the end of the day, the game still gives me that ""one more turn"" feeling.  I'll make a mental note that I want to wrap things up, and 2 hours later I'm still playing.  If that isn't the qualifier for a solid game, I don't know what is.			"

												This game has really lived up to my expectations.  It fixes a lot of the problems with Civ V from what I have seen so far.  The AI is much improved and it has really made Civ fun again.  I had hundreds of hours in Civ V and I can already tell I will have the same if not more hours in Civ VI, great game and worthy of the Civ name!  It's one of the few games I trusted enough to pre-order and I haven't been disapointed, hoping this game makes game of the year.			"

												Steam really needs a ""Not Yet"" button.First, I am a Civ veteran. I've been playing since III was released. I know my way around. This time, the game just seems off. I don't mind the unstacked cities. In fact I like the concept even if the excecution feels weird. I could learn to love it.  As others have mentioned, the AI is insane. I can have the largest claimed area and Rome will still make mention that I haven't expanded. The barbarians need tweaking. Even on easier settings, I am spending most of my early game just building units to protect my one or two cities as wave after wave almost instant spawn from camps. Cleared camps will be replaced by new camps a few squares away within a single turn and then the cycle starts over. I'm pretty happy with the near complete elemination of unit automation, but it makes exploration a chore as most scouts end up ""exploring"" by running from the overkill barbarians. The flip side ofthe barbarian issue is that the game is boring without them, so turning them off is a bad option.Now, the technical issues: There are sound issues: the music and voice clips will stutter randomly. Clicking the ranged attack icon on a city with walls will flash the ranged attack targeting before needing to be clicked again (sometimes repeating the problem. The camera resets to the capital all the time: we need persistant unit focus. Every-so-often the mouse just doesn't seem to function completely. The cursor can moved, some UI elements can be clicked on, but not others. Switch mice and keyboards didn't resolve input issues on both PCs that I encountered these issues on.Finally, the praise. I really like the art style.  I don't really want the hyper-realism that so many people have been clamouring for. The colors are bright and interesting plus the models are different and well animated. The UI is forgetable, but it stays out of the way.EDIT: After buying some of the DLC and letting the updates settle in and smooth things out, I am finding that the game is downright forgetable. I am not engaged in the game, just bored with the bad war mongering AI that offer no real challenge. Civ 6 is boring, and I hate that, but it doesn't change the reality of it.			"

												I will update my review as I play the game more, but these are my honest initial impressions.  At present, I would not recommend this game to my friends because I don't see a compelling reason to play it over Civilization V.  In many ways, I find that game to be considerably more fun than this one.I was definitely very excited to play Civilization VI.  I did not watch any of the videos or read any of the reviews before purchasing this game.  Considering how much I've enjoyed this franchise, I did not expect to dislike the newest iteration and I did not want to spoil any of the fun.  Unfortuately, I don't presently feel this game has lived up to its awesome reputation.  After five years, many of us still happily play Civ5, which says a lot about how excellent Civ is.When I started my first game in Civ6, I immediately found the UI unattractive and the game world unimpressive.  The graphics seem almost infantile, as if they belong in Civ4.  It feels like a huge step backward and this will likely harm my enjoyment of this game.  I was also unhappy with the available options for creating a game.  There are very few maps to choose from (which I'm sure will be expanded with DLC) and very few customization options (fog of war seems to be not only persistent, but also pervasive -- you must at all times have a unit in the area to remove the fog or it comes back.)I haven't played long enough to get beyond the initial era, and this in itself is kind of saying something because I've played thousands of hours of Civ5.  I just did not feel compelled to continue in this one.  So with that said, there's much I haven't seen.  The concept of districts is appealing to me.  I'm curious about many of the changes in mechanics.  Hopefully with time I will come to enjoy it more.  But for now, I just don't consider this a substantive improvement over Civ5 and in many ways find it far less interesting than its predecessor.For those who like this game, you might feel compelled to attack my review on a number of different counts.  I ask that you be respectful of the fact that everyone will have a different opinion and different impressions of the games they play.  If you like it, great.  I'm not really trying to discourage anyone from purchasing it, but it would be dishonest to recommend a game that I may very well not play much myself.  Civ5, to me, is still the champ; we'll see if that changes in time.One positive note: The Steam Controller works great with this game. I really enjoyed being able to use a controller.			"

												Civ VI has alot of potential, they had so much success to build off of after Civ V. That said, sadly I cannot recommend this game at the moment. Graphics- So, okay, Civ V had some amazing graphics I thought for its age, as they were made to look realistic down to the buildings, units and improvements. Then they released Civ VI and I was just like WTF happened, its almost a step back I think as everything looks cartoony and units are only a standard 4 per? This makes no sence to me and is one of my big pet peeves with the game at the moment.AI -  Civ V AI could sometimes even predict you after all the expansions came out to bolster them, but once again it seems like we have taken a step back, even the BASE Civ 5 AI was better then this. One word pretty much explains how they seem to act, illogical.Tech tree - Little to no info on it and progression seems just kind of, Blah, now.  All in all I think the game had some great intentions behind it but it falls short by a mile of the standard of game I expect from Sid Meier now a days, I mean even Beyond Earth is better then this at the moment and that should of been DLC, not a standalone game since it was just reskined. In hindsight I would not buy this and would continue playing Civ 5 with or without mods.Thanks for reading, hope this helps.			"

												As a pretty big Civ V fan, I was really disappointed. (TL;DR: at the end)Terrible AI. Had to hunt down barbarians for my first 50 or so turns, and someone declared war on me after the 30th turn (seriously, he only had 2 archers, why tho). As soon as you start winning the ""war"" (i.e killing both of his troops) it instatly starts spamming trades in order to negotiate peace, and gives up all it's resources. Bad interface. I was a really big fan of the Civ V interface, where everything looked more.. Clear, per se. I think the production menu looks horrible, you don't really get a sense of what anything is, unlike in Civ V, where you could actually see what you where developing. That might just be a minor issue for me though.Last but not least, the graphics. I just can't get over that it looks like a mobile game. It just doesn't feel immersive to me. Some people like it, I hate it. TL;DR: Bad AI, terrible user interface, graphics looks like it was developed for iPhone back in 2013. Basically Civ 5 with some new graphics and worsend AI, and a couple of new features that you might or might not be a fan of.4/10.			"

												I don't know what I can say about this game that hasn't already been said.  Personally I love the game, but it appears the devs don't love the players of the game.  I pains me so much to give a negative review to a Civ game, but game companies gotta start realizing that chopping games up into pieces is a major tun-off and sooner or later its gonna bite them.

Product received for free
												I don't know how to review the final nail in a coffin for a company.I recieved this free when I purchased a video card, mostly I let my dad play it- he mysteriously stopped a day or two in and for the last couple months its sat in my library, unplayed. Myself curious as to why that was. You see, my father has been playing civ since year 1. He introduced my brother & myself to civ. I once had a settler win an engagement with a bomber in Civ 1 (am-i-right?). Anyways, my point is he doesn't stop playing 'one-more-turn' simulator for no apparent reason- as it might be said at a lan party as a means of reverse psycology when certain memebers claim they're too tired to go on; 'Mr. Penney doesn't ♥♥♥♥♥ out on an all nighter of civ'- which isn't exacltly true. He doesn't play Multiplayer & I've never seen him play civ past 5 am. Unlike myself, whos gone at least 24 hours once or twice- smoke breaks included but I digress...I've watched the franchise evolve since I was a kid, I hated some things and learned love most. But this, honestly I've only gotten to turn 80 and I totally want to uninstall it and go vomit a bit. I'm simultaniously playing a game of Civ 5 Brave New World with a friend right now- besides  the onslaught of barbarians it's a lot more enjoyable. ""I'm having so much fun having 3 new game mechanic menus being thrown at me that have almost no relevence as I continously have to rework everything inside of them every 8 turns."" -Me, with the utmost sarcasim on turn 36.Honestly if you love civ and are unsure, take what I just said with a grain of salt. Theres tons of interesting avenues to unit progression and city progression in this new game. But personally I'm finding everything quite overwhelming right off the gate- with 'new to civ 6' hints that dont seem to be even noticable in contrast to the 'in-your-face' tutorial approach with the previous title. It's cool to see a game from '91 get a 6th reboot I guess, but then again this products been presented in several 'ripped off' forms that might be more enjoyable all over steam.I feel this is just not a good replacemenmt to Civ 5 + BNW., its a fun game and I'm not saying this particular title is bad; just not better then its predicesor, which is what it makes me want to play more immedietly.

												Just a pretty quick review here, more of a ""my personal addendum to most other reviews"" than an actual review.Basically, I can't say I disagree with many points for most of the negative reviews currently on Steam. There are certainly some problems, some frustrations and some things just plain lacking. I don't disagree with any other those complaints. Likewise, there are some really cool features in the game that a worth experiencing for yourself.I find it a hard line to draw between those things that just don't work as I assume they were intended, and those things that are just different from what I'm used to in Civ 5 and I haven't learned to take advantage of yet.What I'd like to differentiate from all those negative reviews is that I would still recommend this game. There is some fun to be had, and I've enjoyed most of the play time I've spent in-game. Maybe hold off and see what the first major patch brings, but I don't see any reason why someone couldn't buy the game now and enjoy it.Fall Patch Update:Some improvements in some areas, but AI is still lacking. Played through a game since the patch, but haven't really noticed any of the changes from the patch notes.			"

												A poor and disappointing game. The games shortcomings have already been spelled out very well in other reviews, but here are some points that make me imagine my £50 and feel a little sick in my stomach:* No real diplomacy. Just a sense of trying to placate a bunch of children. Children who stamp their feet and threaten you when you refuse to give up 4 of your luxuries in exchange for open borders and 5 gold. Everyone will hate you by turn 150.* The districts and some of the other additions are just fluff. Just something added to make it different from Civ 5. They don't make the game more enjoyable. They are like mud on your boots, weighing you down as you try and progress.* The other Civs cheat like ****. No attempt to make them clever or interesting. They are just whinning, cheating, overly aggressive bullies. Even on King, they will settle right next to you and then tell you not to expand so close to them ...A disappointing year for PC games imho. Do not buy this game yet unless you are the whitest of white knights or the most tunnel visioned of fan boys....just saying.			"

												At first, I was very skeptical of the graphics.  Everything looked very ""cartoonish."" Once I started playing, however, I immediately fell in love.  The graphics actually make the game very playable by not taking too much processing power.  Sometimes 5 and even Beyond Earth became too frustrating to play those larger games with more computer/human players.  The Civ team was very smart in not putting too much effort into the graphics by making sure this is playable on most hardware, even making it simple enough to easily put it on a mobile platform.As for game mechanics, this version introduces a lot and re-introduces what we love about previous versions.  New to the franchise, they brought districts to the map, limited actions for builders, policy card decks, envoys, super enhanced diplomacy, and culture ""researching."" Then they made sure to include features that I love about previous versions like religion, choosing government, rebels, trade, and natural wonders.  This makes the base game already feel really complete.  It's hard to imagine what they might include in the expansions, other than new civs and maps. Or maybe I'm just blindsighted at how awesome the game already is.For long time Civilization players, this is the game we've always wanted.			"

												The entire game just feels completely unbalanced in nearly every aspect compared to Civ 5. While Civ 5 had a tech/building path that progressed in a way that made since from ancient to future era, the split between some buildings and wonders being in the research tree and half in the civics tree really screws up the balance.Its nearly impossible to be in the same era in both, and while this does change up how tech progressing is in the game, its not in a good way. Every victory path seems literally not fleshed out in a logical, or balanced manner. Science requires exceptional amounts of production end game, which is fine and not the worst of the win conditions in terms of balance.Religious victory requires every civ to follow your religion. Which is completely do-able, as in general, faith is really easy to amass in Civ 6, but this victory is rather straight forward as Apostle units can combat each other and act like inquistors when used on religious cities.Culture is extremely easy on all singleplayer game-modes as in general, the AI is terrible at any district based victories. Furthermore, there is legitimely not enough great works of writing slots in the entire tech tree for a decent number of great writers which seems absolutely insane. I had to literally expand and plop down a theatre and ampitheatre district for 1 great work of writing slot. Furthermore, they removed the themeing on great works of writing. Culture focus always makes you incredibly ahead on the civics tree which on singleplayer lets you get nearly every wonder you want in that tech tree. Theres no real counterplay to stopping civics victory of other players except to conquer them i believe.Domination. Straight forward, but with the new encampments and movement system, war weariness and etc. War sucks. Its insanely hard to take cities and virtually impossible against a competent oppenent unless you get extreme tech timings on them. Factor in the insane encampment positions terrain can allow and hill visions and you got a recipe for failure on this win condition. Unless your versus AI, as they are still horribly inept at strategy beside spamming units.--the most notable addition in warfare however is the new support units which are an amazing thought, but only really come into effect in the modern era,  which is dissapointing, plus the complete lack of hammers it feels you have regardless of how good a city is.In all, i feel like Civ 6 just put in a bunch of new features without playtesting them enough to make the balance needed for a Turn-Based Strategy Game, especially when compared to its predecessors. Great People are in general useless and gimmicky, as a few can be really strong, but in general most have very limited effects. Districts are amazing ideas put into terrible action as in general the balance of how much hammers/research/culture techs/buildings/units need seem horribly off. Cities never seem in a ""GOOD"" position, even if you have amazing tiles, amazing district placement, and tons of trade routes. I feel like its just a result of really bad balancing on the part of the game designers.Furthermore, in previous civ games i was only ahead in time historically by a few hundred years at max. IE like 1400 and im in the modern era in a Civ 5 game. But in civ 6, i am literally always ahead by at least that much time, even WITHOUT building a single campus. Its insane. The lack of playtest and balance is just horrible, and i just hope they polish it up so it can actually be a good successor to Civ 5 "

												Eh... not really a great game but its certainly not bad.AI still suffers from mild case of retardation by declaring wars thats its unable to win even against city-states.You can still block AI settlers making them unable to progress with building more cities.Theres also some problems with UI making it hard to tell apart different icons at bottom right quickly when you select unit, atleast for now but ill probably learn them eventually.Other problem with UI is that it doesnt tell when your cities/encampments can attack and the icon for their attack command is really small and hard to click forcing me to click it multiple times before it recognizes that i clicked on it.Also sometimes your garrisoned troops ""flag"" make it impossible to click it because the icon is behind the flag.Small edit after playing for few days now: AI keeps denouncing me for stupid reasons like theyre settling next to my border then complaining that i need to move the troops that have stood in the same place for 1000+ years.AI also declaring more random wars, most recently america declaring on me at around year 1200ad for no reason at all without even denouncing me and being best friends since like 1000bc despite me having superior tech and equal number of forces.City-states seem to have problems upgrading units where i just saw one cultural city-state have 3 of the very basic warrior that you get at start of game still in 1950ad and nothing else and no they havent been in situation where they would of lost those troops.Game has also frozen on the screen after i quit 2 times now forcing me to restart my computerEdit 2: After 52 hours of playing i can say that this is without a doubt the worst civ game ive ever played, the anemeneneneties system makes no sense to me still after 52 hours and it seems to be wayyy too influential on other parts of the game and i think its even worse than civ 5's happiness system. At this point i cannot even guess how the ♥♥♥♥ they could ever fix this game no matter how much patching or dlc's theyre gonna bringOverall id recommend waiting for sale or if you cant wait that long then atleast wait for patches			"

												I LOVE CIV....always have and so far im still excited to spend more time on it and feel it out. I cant say the graphics changes are too bad and the hud like icons thrown in are also fine.What I CANT take are the slight differences meant to ""immerse you in the game"". The instant builders whom are spent in a few improvements.  The combat system is pretty broken. Ranged is extremely OP. Every game is like raging barbs. They are EVERYWHERE!!! (although I later found that there ARE ruins and auto buttons for exploration)Basically it feels like a failed attempt to improve on V by yet again changing the entire feel of the game as opposed to continuing to build on it. By forcing one to be ""fully immersed"" in every hex revealed on the grid...you're making me fall asleep with the tedium of nuance best left to automation. Im trying to conquer the world, not go sight seeing.Civ V gives you a clear feeling like you are creating and managing an empire..... Civ VI feels like a hot mess all over the map with no clear boundaries as to who's who or whats going on. It really feels like they took away the ability to navigate the game or control its flow in any tangible way. The removal of workers building improvements and the shift in tile improvement methods (even though the districs part is a decent concept, if not poorly inplemented) seems aimed at attracting new players who might find CIV's learning curve daunting and prefer a dumbed down ""mobile-ish"" version of things in order to keep their attention... a.k.a. ""be more immersed""....In a nut shell Civ 6 feels like yet another game made by game developers that dont play games. Seemingly more concerned with ""immersing you"" in their baby and pushing the concepts they feel are noteworthy from a design standpoint than actually looking at what the player is asking for/complaining doesnt work in the current model. I hope to see some improvements as time goes on. Civ V certainly improved over time (and expansions) so who knows. I just hope Civ Beyond Earth wasnt the begining of the end of a once mightly game franchise....but hey...at least we can still play V.			"

												Do not buy CIV 61.  It *starts out* 'streamlined' - meaning removal of features.  No give or take in diplomacy, no way to negotiate a cease-fire between other civs.  no unit list.  2.  It takes for freaking ever to load.  Like nearly two minutes from an SSD.  That's when it loads - for some reason after the first day I bought it it starts locking up on the load screens.  As a matter of fact, 'slow' is the best way to describe everything in the game.   You know how DVD's love to have animated menus that force you to wait several seconds before you can do anything?  You know how those are neat the first time you see them and a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for the rest of your life?  Yeah, these aren't even neat the first time you see them.  Just arbitrary delays before menu options appear.3.  The AI is broken.  No, I don't even know if its broken - I think its mainly an RNG with some slight modification due to leader traits.  I've got guys telling me I'm a cultural backwater when I've got the highest culture rating and am a third of the way to a cultural victory and they're not even a blip.  Another guy keeps telling me to be careful about debt - when I have a large income and a massive treasury.  I get attacked by one guy, then when I don't agree to his piece treaty immediately everyone denounces me as a warmonger - the guy who hadn't fired a shot at anyone in 250 turns.  None of it matters anyway - they're all going ot hate you if you start winning.4.  The animated leaders are a marketing gimmick.  They add nothing, you can't do anything until the animation is done playing and then wait for a long pause before the options menu comes up.  Turn them off.5.  Turns start off slow and get slower.  Seriously.6.  The options menu does not pause the game - seriously.  I was trying to change a setting and kept getting interrupted by leaders telling me what a horrible person I was for defending myself.TL;DR - there's a few neat ideas in here, but the series peaked at CIV4 and has been going downhill.  I blame consolization.Verdict:  Not worth it, even on saleEDIT:So, I've put some more time in and . . . nothing's changed.I just played a Huge game on Normal speed, Hardest difficulty.  6500 years and a single war.  And that war was declared, 10 turns later 4 units showed up, i killed them, 5 turns later they sued for peace.Have had one Leader (the Greek Female) *constantly berating me for 'backing down and giving in' - when I had done no such thing.  Ever.  Never a reason to because the only agressive people in the game were the barbarians.I've had a guy tell me off for running a debt - with 5000 gold and a 500 gold/turn income *and* not not having bought anything at all for at least 10 turns.Guys thanking me for fighting off barbarians - when the last battle I had had with the barb was 30 turns earlier.Trading?  Way screwed up.  These guys are willing to give you 30 - 50 gold a turn for a luxury item.  And its easy to game the system as it will tell you exactly what they will and will not accept.  What they offer is so low-balled compared to what you can get them to go for its disgusting.This is just a bad game.Oh, and it has that ♥♥♥♥ing annoying 2k thing where you get the 'do you want to log on to your 2k account now?' popup.  Screw you guys.  Frankly, this is it for 2k as far as I'm concerned.  You're going into the 'do not buy games from this publisher' bin along with Ubisoft.  I'm tired of your♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												So, you've probably seen a lot of hate towards this game because it's different.  If you're on the fence, let's be realistic.  First, sequels are different.  If it was the same, we'd just keep playing Civ V.  Second, the art style is a matter of taste.  I personally love it.Now, if you're still on the fence, go back and read about Civ V when it first came out.  People declared Civ IV as the Alpha and Omega of all strategy games and Civ V was a diseased mongrel that just soiled your grandma's rug.  Now, Civ V is the golden child and Civ VI has the AUDACITY to try new things.  I think you can see how 99% of the complaints are by people who were never going to like Civ VI out of the gate.Finally, remember that satisfied players are out PLAYING.  We're not on the forums complaining because that's time that could be spent crushing the AI.  Is Civ VI perfect?  No.  Is it crucially flawed?  No.  A small number of people have technical issues that are unfortunate but are part and parcel of PC gaming.  Games not working sometimes, that's a risk we all accept due to the inherent difficulty in programming for the PC platform vs. consoles with standardized hardware.Now, if you're new to the series, this is a very welcoming entry.  On lower difficulties, the AI is a declawed house cat.  Come to think of it, on higher difficulties you're still kinda playing against yourself.  The AI gets more aggressive but they're still tactically feeble in combat.Should you buy it?  Absolutely.  It has everything you could want from a 4X game and no matter what anyone else says, the Civ series is still the 800-lb. gorilla in the room compared to everything else.			"

												I've been playing Civilization for 25 years, and there are no other game that I enjoy more to play. I'm perfectly aware that all civs have problems on release, and over the time they always made it perfect, I'm counting with it too on this one, and I believe that Civilization VI will become a great game, but at this point, the game is not yet playable, it's very nice in the first hours, but soon, the lack of a zoom out and the huge icons bad designed and placed over the units will turn it into an annoying experience. Wait a few months if you want to play it, but at this point it feels more like a good game in an early beta test with an awfully childish design.			"

I have to say DO NOT buy this game in its current formBad:1) Unbearable AI, there is no characteristics whatsever and the AI is even much worse than CIV5 IMO, the entire diplomatic aspect needs an over-haul.2) AI just attack you (or stop attacking) for no reason at all, and this stupid act of war just lasts none stop.3) The spy system is broken IMO, you simply cant defend enemy spy attack in a reasonable way4) Enemy AI is beyond stupid, entire army of catapult and range attack units just move back and forth for no reason, and I can take them all out with 2 archer.5) Wonders are simply not wonderous at all, way too plain6) There is no way to defend Nuclear attackGood:Like the new district settingNukes are finally being deadly in the right way "

												My English is not very good, if there is a wrong statement, please forgive me. I am from the Chinese game player, I'm from Civilization 2 started the game, I love this game, but in the China basic play is pirated, because you won't find genuine games, there is no Chinese version, only piracy only, Civilization V also is my favorite. I'm really sorry. This time to play the Chinese version of VI Civilization, really very grateful to 2K and steam, the game experience is very good. I will definitely support steam in the future, but also hope that some of the Chinese version of the game, once again thank you.………………                       Officially announced as a member of the steam it WOW			"

												I have been playing Civ since I was in 7th grade, when I played the original game and Colonization all the time.  I have spent about 2,000 hours total playing Civ 5.  I enjoyed Beyond Earth and Starships for a bit (not as good as regular Civ, but still fun).  I pre-ordered Civ 6 and vocally defended it.At this point, I believe I am going to give up on the game and go back to playing Civ 5, though not very much because honestly I am mostly burnt out.  I probably won't buy the next Firaxis game that comes out.My reason is that I believe that this game is broken at its core - I don't believe mods or expansions will fix what is wrong with it.  I feel that this is a trend that has been going on in the gaming industry, and I am feeling saddened by it.Let me start off by saying I love the aesthetics of the game.  I think the art style is brilliant; the animations are great, and I just generally love how it looks and feels.  I had one game that I won through a Culture victory and generally enjoyed it.What I really don't like is the ""task-list"" based game play.  Each game is basically the same: you are given a list of tasks to do, and you need to do these or else suffer.  This is primarily from the Eureka/Inspiration stuff, and from the way the AI works now.  The AI is based on these arbitrary things that they love you or hate you for, rather than the more organic feeling from previous games.  In the past, AI generally hated you if you were expanding too fast, if you were competing with their city states, if you broke your promises, etc.  Now they hate you really fast for silly things.  I think it was a great idea as a concept, but I don't believe it was executed well.  In Civ 5 it was better with the Ideologies (it was great how game-long friends suddenly become enemies because they are Autocrats while I am using Order, etc).I am not enjoying warfare in this game.  It's just about spamming units, and I don't like the way the promotion system works.At first I liked Districts, but now I despise them.  They look beautiful and really enhance the visuals, but I just don't like the way they work.  This game is now all about micro decisions to maximize benefit, rather than the organic fun that previous games were.There are small things that I think expansions could fix, such as the lack of information.  I am having a hard time figuring out Religious Pressure, culture border growth, Barbarian expansion, etc.  I can't find a unit list to figure out where all my units are and to find idle ones.So far I have 1 completed game and about 10 abandoned games, because they just weren't fun for me.  I am still glad that I pre-ordered and if I had to go back in time I would do so again.  I get a bit teary-eyed thinking about this, since for the last almost 25 years Civ has been my absolute favorite game franchise and a big part of my entertainment life, and I am feeling that perhaps the magic is gone.  It may be gone for good.			"

												Quick and Dirty Review:PROS:Soundtrack is amazing.Gameplay is fun. Better job in middle ages. Less boring times. Cities never feel like they lack for things to build or grow.CONS:Absolutely hate the housing system. I dont like having cities growth hampered by having to build more housing. The game setup prior to starting is atrocious. Can no longer remove city states. Etc.... Not enough customization.Turns take too long to process even on Normal sized maps.No clarity on what happened when you lose. How did I lose? How were they able to beat me?The victory conditions are clear as mud and dont make sense sometimes.  You will get a message saying that another power is about to win on tourism and you look at them and you see a very pedestrian culture and you have more touriusm than them. ??? wth? "

												I actually can not understand all the bad reviews here. I played Civ 1, 3, 4, 5, BE. And I think that Civ6 is very good. It's not perfect but it's much better than any Civilization right after release.Pros:Since Civ3 there was a very nasty tradition that each next part of Civilization is worse than previous one with DLCs because many feature were cut in new version. And Civilization 6 breaks this rule. The only important gameplay feature which was presented in Civ5 but has been cut in Civ6 is UN. And also Civ6 introduced many new features!City districts is pretty interesting feature. It still should be polished but I already like itWonders which takes it's own cell are very good. It make game much interesting. You don't have a one city with all wonders in it anymore. This feature requires planning and thinking: do you need this wonder? Do you actually need benefit from this wonder? Are you ready to take one cell from your city (people won't work on this cell anymore)?Builders are also great idea. It helped to avoid tens of them on later stages of a gameCasus Belli - is a very interesting conceptNew tree for 'culture science' is also interesting idea which makes game much more diversifiedSean BeanCons:Broken balance. That is most awful thing in the game. It is okay-ish right after release but it SHOULD be fixed and I hope developers will fix it as soon as possible. Especially diplomacy. It doesn't work as it should. Also map generator requires some tweaking (having 10 cells of tundra followed by two cells of hills and then followed by 10 cells of desert is not look good)Some features requires too much micromanagement (spies and 'gossips')Bad AI (but lets be honest - Civ 3, 4, 5 all have bad AI as well)No editorNeutral:New UI. It's not so bad as people are saying, just people get used to Civ5 UI and it has been changed hereNew graphics style. Before release I was against this new style. But now I think it's not bad. It is not felt like indie or mobile game. Maps and fog of war are pretty nice and stylishActive progression (aka eureka's) are good enough but requires some tweaking in my personal opinionGood soundtrack "

												Many new features that need exploring, and different concepts are a big advantage, but historically, I can't help but be extremely disapointed with the Civ VI.As a Portuguese, I was already upset that my great nation wouldn't be present in the initial game, even though I'm expecting it to be available in the next download.Even further, I don't understand what the Kongo, Scythia, Brazil and the Aztecs did, in historical reasoning, to deserve to be in the initial game and a nation like Portugal, who actually was the first and longest world empire, had the biggest navy, best sailors and most well known doctors, didn't get a spot in the top20...What shocked me the most was Spain. The Spanish leader, one of the least memorable in historical terms (he was the one who actually lost the invicible armada vs... a storm), it is a HUGE DOWNGRADE from Isabela in Civ V.Not only that, but the leader presents himself as ""the king of Spain, Portugal and..."". Seriously? For a nation with 900 years of historical background, the 60 year period when we had Spanish rulers was the chosen one?I agree that changing the leaders is good for the game, but why change ones and not the others? Ghandi is still around, and with good reason, why pick a 3rd tier leader from a country to represent that nation?Played this game for 2h and, due to this and a few other features, already have the will to uninstall it... Certainly not worth the 60 euros, specially if taken into account that the developers are targeting the product to underaged people (as one can see from the incredibly anoying baby graphics) and teach them the most useless caracters in world history.Thanks Sid Meier's, you actually gave me the worse surprise in my gaming history, it actually topped Beyond Earth for 1st place.

												Played my first game through multiplayer. (At King difficulty) I have to say the first 100 turns are the hardest yet most entertaining. You really struggle for expansion especially with Rome as your neighbour. They have managed to tweak the AI perfectly. The new AI use most if not all advantages against you to really test your skills. The game itself runs pretty smoothly on ultra settings (i7 6700k; GTX 970; 16GB RAM). Overall, it was what the people wanted.			"

												Hard to understand some of the negative reviews. No, at the present time, this is not as complete of a game as Civ 5, nor as balanced. It certainly has some issues. BUT this is the biggest single overhaul of the Civ franchise so far. They've introduced a lot of really interesting and innovative concepts that admittedly do need some tweaking, but are not inherently flawed, and in fact really make it a unique and fun product.There are some big cons that need to be addressed, but as I will get to, all of the negatives are fixable problems. The core gameplay is as good as any version of Civ, and will only be built upon.Now let's get to the breakdown.PROS+ The district system is excellent and makes you think a lot more about how you want every city to play out+ The concept of builders really removes the tedium of worker management that has plagued every other version of Civ+ NO GLOBAL HAPPINESS. The worst concept of Civ 5 has been thrown out the window in place of a localized amenity (happiness) system, and for the better.+ The return of large empires. A lot of people seem to see the fact that you're encouraged to expand more as a negative, but to me it's definitely a positive. You now feel like you're building large, sprawling EMPIRES, but it's not just settler spam everywhere. That said, victory paths for building tall are still available for those who wish to play that way.+ The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Yeah, I know people miss the realistic graphics of Civ 5, but I find the graphical style of 6 to be far more aesthetically pleasing. I love the colors and the way the maps look.+ Better-designed maps. Movement across maps feels more natural and the maps just feel less crowded.+ City-states are better. In 5, you could get by without significant city-state diplomacy unless you were going for a diplomatic victory, but they feel like a much more important and impactful part of the game now. Suzerain bonuses were an excellent addition.+ Early game pacing also feels better than in 5+ The religious victory is a great addition, and religion in general just builds off of what 5 gave us and turns it into a more dynamic, impactful feature. The most fun games I've had have usually focused on religion.+ Tech tree specialization encourages different play-styles and advancement paths. Splitting of tech tree into science and civics is a cool idea.+ ""Card-style"" civics system to replace social policies is great for adjusting play style to current conditions.+ Love the idea of leader agendas, although there will be more about this in the ""cons"" section.+ Spies are so much more useful and flexible than in 5.+ Can combine units into corps and armies in mid/late game, which is excellent for unit management.+ Combination of civics cards, tech tree branching, and district usage encourages alternative play-styles and long-term strategic thinking to a greater extent than in any previous version.+ Most importantly, it still has that great ""just 1 more turn"" Civ feel.CONS- Diplomacy has been nerfed. Aside from luxury trading and war, there's not much reason to contact the AI. Deals often feel imbalanced as well (although the 2 patches so far have helped somewhat). There's no World Congress or diplomatic victory in general, which makes the late game feel a bit empty.- Diplomacy is especially bad when it comes to the ""leader agendas"". It's impossible for every civ to like you because I think the diplomatic bonuses/penalties are too weighted towards agendas. The AI denounces you far too often. In 5, when you were denounced, it was a big deal. In 6, being denounced just happens all the time. This is made worse by the overly long diplomatic animations (the animations themselves are great, but they're too intrusive).- AI is mostly incompetent when it comes to warfare, especially when it comes to taking cities. They're too passive, cannot use siege/ranged units effectively, and don't upgrade their units often enough.- The pacing of the late game doesn't feel right. You blow through the tech tree too quickly, and production times just get too long in the late game. It's possible to advance far along on either the civics or science tree while leaving the other behind, and there's far greater tech disparities between civs than ever existed in previous versions. I often finish the tech tree before properly utilizing late game units.- Tech tree is TOO branchy. There's too many dead end techs, and some missing prerequisites that allow advancement along certain tech paths to be too OP/simply not make sense.- Missing a few key notifications (such as a notification for city bombardment) and some of the UI feels incomplete or cluttered (city screens need an overhaul, for example, and trade routes really need to be sortable).- NO TEAM GAMES. Come on Firaxis, what are you doing here? This is one of those things that feels generally inexcusable.- No Workshop support yet (not a huge deal for me personally at the moment, but something that is definitely vital for the community).That may seem like a long list of cons, but the thing about the cons is that they're ALL FIXABLE PROBLEMS. Firaxis has created an excellent base game, and a wonderful set of features that gives 6 the potential to be a very deep, consistently compelling game. I have faith that they can fix the AI to at least reach an enjoyably competent level, and that further patches and eventual expansions will add additional diplomatic options. Some big-time balancing is needed in the late game especially, but again, that's a fixable problem. People want to compare it to Civ 5 with all of its patches and expansions. Honestly, 6 is a more complete game than 5 was on initial launch, and I remember people complaining about a lot of the same things.I have no problem with any of the base features of the game. The cons all have to do with the AI, diplomacy, and balance that I have faith will be sorted out with time!Currently would give an 8.5/10, but there's the potential for a 10/10 game here. Still would recommend, ESPECIALLY if you aren't going to compare every feature to the complete edition of Civ 5.			"

												Not sure why there are so many negative reviews here.  I'm not an expert at Civ but have played a little of Civ 5 and I'll be honest, I liked it but didn't really understand the fuss.  Civ 6 is a more user friendly game (for me) and one that has already imbedded its claws.  I want to understand the different units, find my rivals, build trade routes, hunt barbarians, discover new inventions, build bigger cities etc.  I never felt that with Civ 5.  Maybe it's 'New car smell' or maybe it really is that good.  Only time will tell.			"

												This is good now, but I think it will be great eventually, so I suggest giving it some time to cook. At launch, the game's meta rewards all-out domination in almost every situation with some civics (like one that creates horse units 100% faster) being incredibly over-powered. There is a lot to like, but huge balance issues and really aggressive AI with ""personalities"" that are illogical and silly like a civilization hating you because you don't have a large navy or because you aren't evil to city-states so it is incredbily easy to manipulate the AI to become an ally or to provoke them into a war (and defense still has an advantage so counter-punching is still very effective). Finally, they still have the AI for higher levels of difficulty just get ""cheats"" - basically the AI gets bonus resources that players don't get but what would have been nice is if they'd taught the AI player strategies and made it actually smarter instead of just letting it cheat.

												Buyer BewareThis game is a LONG ways from being a finished product as of ""release"". Balance is meh, tool tips for practically everything are missing (even alert popups, when I mouse over most it just tells me the tile behind the alert), map navigation is a pain and about 100 different events snap your camera to your cities forcing you to start over with the move. Watch for a major update / patch and re-think buying then if you can find some fresh reviews. Right now this feels like a pixar movie, ported to tablet, ported to PC. It's fairly pretty, music is par for the Civ experience, gameplay is a train wreck. Most of my frustration probably revolves around a really clumsy UI that makes it SUPER easy to do incredibly stupid things with your support troops. Like, I just spent 2 hours in a war trying to get an admiral to stay attached to a fleet. Because there's a button for that, now, but damned if I could get it to actually work. They'd move together for maybe one whole turn then the admiral would decouple and start walking across the warzone on foot. Stuff like that.. the game just isn't done. I'd say the game is just about ready to demo at E3.			"

This is one of Civ that you don't have to wait for a couple of expansion packs to make the game great.However , it seem like the information feedback seem to be worse than Civ 5. Information is overwhelming and might take time to optimize every little details to your cities. Policy cards system are great to customize your way of playing yet you have to keep remember and read them each time without graphic indicator to help you remember them. Yet, with this many factor and details. The game feel obviously much more deeper and pleasing for hardcore players.			"

Posted: December 29, 2016
												For a new edition to the Civilization franchise, Civ VI is very welcomed. (For a quick list of pros/cons, scroll down)A lot of the recent negative reviews come from the recent DLC release with the deluxe edition of the game that promised the next 4 DLCs released to be included with the purchase. Being that the first two DLCs have been released, many people are displeased, but the very simple solution is to not buy something until you know what you are buying. Rather, wait for the DLC to be released and/or wait for a sale to buy it at a cheaper price. Anyways, in terms of the game itself, Civ VI has a lot to offer. Since Civ V, Firaxis has decided to make Civ VI more complex and thoughtful in their approach. Unit stacking, district placement, government styles, new civic tree, and much more all add to the more intricate nature of the game and add many more elements than what was found in Civ V. Civilization VI also swapped out the Diplomatic Victory, arguably the most anti-climactic (aside from Score Victory), the new Faith Victory expands on religion and makes it more prominent. Considering that this is the base game, Civilization VI also offers much more than Civilization V did on release, but it also has just as many if not more bugs than Civ V did on release, as well.And that's the major downfall for Civilization VI: The bugs, clunkiness, & the AI. While a decent chunk of bugs and exploits have been removed with the most recent patches, there's still more to be found, as is typical with Civ releases. And other clunky aspects, such as auto-unit cycle only being able to be disabled through manually digging through configuration files, needing to fight with the city attack button to actually work, not being able to get rid of the hundreds of notifications both on the right and dead center of the screen that blind you in war, some odd menu interfaces, etc need to be desperately addressed. And of course, the final sticking point for anyone looking to primarily enjoy the game for Singleplayer use, the AI is very odd and not so intelligent - getting mad for the tiniest things, unreasonable trade deals, etc. Overall though, these are specific parts of the game that can be dealt with, either by growing accustomed until a patch releases or through mods. But the game is hard to ignore for its great innovations with this new edition to the series and will surely be an even better one as patches (hopefully) roll out soon.PROS:-New Civics Tree-Expanded Espionage Capabilities-More Easily Able to Expand With Cities; Local Happiness-Replaced the Tedious & Anti-Climactic Diplomatic Victory of Civ V with the Faith Victory-Unit Stacking-Unstacks Cities via Districts-More Interesting Science Victory-Better Diplomatic Options (Although still room for improvement)-Increased the Importance of City-States-New Government System-New Policy System-Includes Much More Content At Initial Release Than Many Previous Civ Games Have Had-More Options / Less Reason to Go Down the Same Civic Tree / Tech Tree Every Single Game-New Game Speed for Multiplayer Games-Interesting New Cassus Belli system (Even if it only affects Singleplayer, it's still interesting and fun to use against friends)-Allows for much more early warring-Much MoreCONS:-No Production Queue-Fair Amount of Dead-End Techs/Civics-Clunkiness (Discussed Above)-Cities Can Be Completely Razed in 1 Turn (Regardless of size)-Map Generation is a Hit or Miss-Bad AI-Awful Notifications System-Etc(Items listed in the Pros/Cons lists are not limited to what is written, they are just major points that I personally have noted or experienced.)

												Updated 9/11/2016So, yet another installment of Sid's Civ franchise, i was hyped, VERY hyped. And I must say, after quite some confusion in the first attempt, I quickly learned, and adapted. This is definitely the best Civ to date, and I say that on release. First of all, the city screen is almost gone, and it annoyed me, untill i realised how simple it could be and still work, it's quite amazing honestly. Everything from the new mechanics to simple cosmetics such as the aqueducts, they actually look and graphically function as such. Warriors.. Saladin got curved sword, America, does not. Headgear changes too. Skincolour fits the civilization, aswell. It feels like a great new milestone for Civ to go for, lots more to do now, yet without more stress, a good eye for where to place things later on is the hardest, no doubt.Second, Bringing back stacked units, Corps and Armys(i believe it was), support units, even more leader choices for , so far, one Civ, Greece, either play as the wise old Pericles(did i get that right?) or as Gorgo, the Queen of Sparta. Theres many more things id like to add but honestly, i want people to experience all the new sweet♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves.All in all, im horrible at writing reviews, but this is simple an all-out amazing game. Pros: Everything except 1 con.Cons: I wish it was easier to find out what tiles benefits from what districts.So, go buy it! You will not regret it, it has a TON of new features that are just amazing, any old Civ player will be pleased.Added: I must also say, the new Great Person system, ALL of it, is simply amazing... Absolutely!Added 2: I see a lot of negative reviews on the AI, but i must say, after many hours in Civ, i learned how not to♥♥♥♥♥♥the AI off, or how to.. you will never please everyone tho. It is just that people dont understand the system, they make a bad review.			"

												I have owned every version of this game and its offshoots since Civ I.  (I used to have to make space and unzip civ I to play it, then rezip it to have room to do anything else on my computer!)  I have well over 10,000 hours invested in civ V.  I have played this version now for 300+ hours and have REALLY tried to like it, but I just can't.  I like the empire building and spreading across the map, greedily taking all available land.  I less enjoy the micro managing of cities.  I miss my build queue and my automatic builders.  DIplomacy is a mess.  I despise the trade centric road building and being forced to trade with less profitable cities just to get a road, and the culture tree doesn't feel like culture anymore, it feels like tech tree v.2			"

												After putting a combined 300 hours between Civ 4 and Civ 5, I just dont see how this is the best Civ game let alone game of the year? To begin, you simply can not suave over any AI. Going to war or trying to trade, almost all AI's end up denouncing you for one thing or another. Whether that be too little or too much expansion (under 25 turns mind that). You are guarenteed suprise war under 50 turns by atleast 2 AIs (Although a plus for game mechanics, the AI actually Attacks you..) Once a suprise war is declared on you, the AI is not penalized by any other AI for warmongering and is almost always friendly with every other AI. If you take just ONE city from an AI who DECLARED war on you, the game is over diplomatically. For you. This Holy War or Formal war, the penalties are most certainly not moderate but just as Egregious as ""Surprising"" your enemy. In my honest opinion, the AI mechanics are as sporadic and uncontrollable as Civ 2 back on Windows 2000. You simply cant talk to an AI.Secondly, Im running an i6700k with 16gb ram and a gtx 1070 (on decent Max resolution but not ultra) and this game by turn 100 just slows... to crawl. Im talking 30 to 60 second turn time waiting After reading the forums and googling, it looks like im not alone. Lastly, Religion has still not been ironed out fully but just expaned on since Civ 5. While i will give credit, they have come along way since Civ 4 and by not automatically founding Judaism.Sadly, ill probably end up playing more of Civ 5 still to date then i will Civ 6. Unless i see some more AI resurfacing.Unfortunately, this is the first Civ game i will not recommend.			"

												Before I delve into this review, let me just say that I have logged 488hours on civilization V and have been playing civ for the last 15 years.-- Overall Score / TL;DR -- [8/10]Overall I give this a score of 8/10 as it feels as innovating as a new iteration of a long-time award-winning serie should be. Looking at the history of Civilization, and especially comparing this to Civ V, I feel that this is gonna be a great platform for future generations, to introduce them to the world of Civilization. The 60 euro price tag, can seem a bit daunting for some, but I'd recommend buying this game if you are a veteran of Civilization, and if you are new player, wait for a sale, at which time, most of the bugs that are currently in the game will have been fixed.This is what Civilization: Beyond Earth should have been, A complete game, that doesn't feel like just another dlc with a high price tag. Best Regards,Yilmas - Staff of the Unknown Borders communityWebsite Link[unknownborders.net]For a part by part score, look below-- Music / Cinematic -- [10/10]Right of the bat, we are met by some really astounding cinematic, a bit doe eyed characters though, and background music, This of course doesn't change the game, but makes us believe that they actually put some effort in to the game. But lets head on into the review worthy parts of the game, that we all want to know about.-- Graphics -- [9/10]From the very beginning when the first gameplay videos surfaced on youtube, we were all met by a dramatic change in the style choice, which at first glance looked a bit plastic-like. Many was upset about this aspect, but I personally decided to reserve my judgement for when the game had been released.After a full standard map game on Prince, (research victory), I've come to a bit of a bland feeling about the new look. It definitely looks great on my 4k running at max settings. But does it change the gameplay in any good or bad way ? No. As the game progressed I found myself using the strategic view more and more, as the screen was cluttered with unit and information. However, this was something I was expecting as it was the same for me in Civ V. In the beginning of the game, I did feel though that the style was pretty to look at, but after some time it was the gameplay that caught me and the graphic was ignored. Which is just the way I believe Civilization should be. This game should not be selling itself on its graphics.-- User Interface (UI) -- [7/10]The user interface is very clear cut, I didn't feel they were wasting the space they had, and for once the UI scaling worked great on 4k.We have all the information we need, and the rest is found through ease-of-access menu buttons, located where you would expect them.One a side note, I was very much annoyed that you couldn't right-click out of a town interface, but had to click on a unit and then right-click to hide the info-cards. -- Builders -- [8/10]The changes with the mechanics behind builders I felt to begin with was quite drastic. And as the game progressed, I've come to feel that 3 uses of a builders is a bit too little. I think 5 would be ideal (7 with policy card). But overall, it didn't change too much gameplay wise. Though the point of killing the ever-living builder principle worked out. -- Districts -- [6/10]All right, so this is probably the biggest difference between Civ V and Civ VI. The districts. Even after a full game, I still don't know whether or not I like them as much as having multiple buildings. Because let's face it, they are basically just buildings. And with the builders mechanic change, the districts is just a way to fill out those improvement slots that are left available now. Can you dedicate a city for one or two purposes, yes. Could you do it in Civ V, yes. Does it feel different after a full game, no. Sure the cities looks much nicer than Civ V, with these new districts. But I just don't feel like it makes such a big change in the game as it was promoted to do.I decided to bump this sections rating, by ""1"" because of the aesthetic aspect that the districts definitely brings.-- Civic / Policy -- [10/10]The civic or policy aspect of the game has been changed quite drastically compared to civ V. But I really love this new iteration of it. I feel you have so much more power over the customization of your nation's policies. And the use of the governments are perfect. Especially the ""legacy"" attributes are a nice idea.-- Relations / War -- [8/10]I love the new relation window, as it gives you much more useful information about the other leaders. And the feature of each leader having a secret and known ""policy"" was integrated perfectly in my mind. Though it does take some time to get used to it.I expect Firaxis will be releasing a patch (once all the crash-fixes are done) to boost the AI's strategies. Now of course, I only played it on Prince difficulty, but the AI compared to Civ V was a bit dumb at times. Moving too much around instead of attacking, and misplacing the encampment districts.			"

												I don't recommend this game because:1. The map is too crowded2. The AI is illogical (even more than in Civ 5)3. The graphics is kinda cartoonish 4. The graphics in the diplomacy screen are inert (which is ridiculous in 2016)5. Certain game mechanics are simply bad. I mean what on Earth were they thinking when they made the Worker a consumable unit? It's completely unimaginative.The only positive aspect is that they made the Barbarians much smarter. But that's it.Bottom line: you want to play Civ? Play 5 & 4. They are far, far better.			"

												I completely forgot I owned this until it popped up on sale.That's a bad sign.   It plays like all other Civs but fails to address the issues other Civs have had.  It's basically Civ V with shinier graphics and more of the same.As with all Civ games.... you're better off waiting 2 to 3 ""versions"" before buying.  Don't waste your hard earned money if you already own Civ V.  Wait until Civ VIII if you're expecting change.			"

												I love the overhaul of many of the game mechanics. Found a couple issues that I would like to see resolved but they haven't been game breaking so far, but other Civs declaring war on you before they've even met you is kinda dumb. I see a lot of people complaining about the graphics of the game but they knew what they would look like before they bought the game so shut up. Also, love the new districts addition because it actually makes you focus certain things in each city, not every city can be awesome at everything.			"

Posted: October 27, 2016
												It's difficult to truly judge a Civilization game this early for more than a few reasons, but among them include the level of depth in the game that makes first impressions difficult to accurately form and the fact that Civilization games tend to start out of the gate significantly weaker than they end up being weeks, months, and especially years post-release.That being said, I would like to throw a strong recommendation for anyone on the fence about this one while still outlining a few issues that may or may not convince you to at least wait it out.Right off the bat though, the biggest question - does the game feel lacking after playing Civilization V with both expansion packs? Surprsingly no, it doesn't. In fact, I was very impressed with how many mechanics were not only carried over from Civilization V, but dramatically improved upon.Faith was a neat add-on in Civ5, providing nice perks that made it worth the effort to get involved with religion. However in Civilization VI, religious benefits aren't dramatically different, but the whole religious warfare aspect is much deeper. There's something incredibly satisfying about being able to fight a religious war with units, without the bloodshed of a full fledged war. The unit variety is smaller and religious units obviously can't attack anything but other religious units, but it provides a surprising amount to do, especially during the mid-game.City states feel much more fleshed out. You actively compete for their loyalty without needing to constantly run around completing quests that may or may not either go out of your way or worse, result in unwanted war or hatred from other civs and/or city states. This was improved upon in Brave New World, but Civilization VI absolutely tops it by making the loyalty itself a mechanic you can directly contribute to, while keeping ""quests"" as an alternate way to gain loyalty.Great Works and culture feel just as fleshed out as they did in Brave New World, making Great People such as Writers and Painters feel valuable by contributing Great Works. Added too are relecs which work much the same, but just goes that not only was nothing lost, but a little was gained.The World Congress isn't in Civilization VI right out of the gate, but if Firaxis is to be believed, this was due to not being entirely sure how to best add it. Just brace yourself and don't be surprised if it's in a paid expansion pack.The new mechanics work very well and give you a much stronger sense of control. City districts are surpisingly strategic, especially later in the game when you start buffing their output, specifically via adjacency bonuses. Even something as simple as builders building instantly but having limited charges makes the act of improving tiles feel more meaningful since you're actively seeking improvements with a finite resource.However this is also where one of the biggest issues of the game start to glare their ugly head. Transparency, or a lack there of, is a major concern. The new mechanics add a huge amount of depth and breath of life into the game, but the mechanics, both new and old, seem to have taken a major step back in terms of ease of visibility for important stats. Information like district output, housing/amenity income, great work locations, etc, are difficult to find, assuming it even exists, and is often burried and consolidated into generic numbers, making it unnecessarily difficult to keep track of and micro-manage them. It's almost as though the game treats these mechanics as less important than they really are. And tooltips are a lot less helpful than you'd expect them to be, either displaying generic information, seemingly useless information or relevant information, or just not displaying anything of value that you can't already see by just looking at it.The game also has a surprising number of glitches or AI quarks. I've seen cases where certain overlay features will get stuck on - such as traderoutes, cluttering your view. Trade deals seem very broken in that on more occasions than I can count, I've asked AI for a deal that they thought was better, only for them to actually ask for less or even offer me more. I've also been actively either dismissed or praised by other civilizations for not having a high gold income when my profit margins are very strong. I've even encountered an issue where a civilization will declare friendship with me - only to declare war on me two turns later.All and all, the game holds a remarkable amount of promise. I have little doubt that these issues will be ironed out in Civ6 just as they were in Civ5. That being said, it can't be emphisized strongly enough that this game released in what feels like a far, far more ""complete"" base game than Civilization V did when it was first released. If Firaxes trend is anything to go on, it's very easy to imagine that this game has the potential to be the absolute best Civilization game yet.			"

												Civ VI is hardly good even for a tablet version.I was super excited while awaiting this game. Civ fun since Civ 2, I can't survive such a huge disappointment. I spent 2 hours playing singleplayer campaign and comparing my impressions with Civ IV and Civ V experience.The conclusion in unforgiving. Civ VI is less interesting, beautiful and attractive as previous titles. The whole look of the game is disgusting. Low resolution models on a maximum graphics, horrible cartoon unit animations with ""KABOOM"" effects and so on.The interface is cheap and icons are rude. Ah, too much pain writing this.The development of the city loss the handy interface from Civ V and becomes clunky. This can be appealed to all mechanics. I just can't understand, how this could happen.AI is just stupid. Barbarians captured the worker and leave it be. He was just standing few turns, I skip few more, nothing changes. Also, they don't like to pillage. Other Civilization start a war with just 1 catapult and warrior, that was standing still. Other Civ starts a war with tons of chariots, that need to overcome like 25 hexes. Only one can managed to do it. Unfortunately, it seems for me as a degradation of the series: graphics, gameplay and optimizations seems much poorer then in previous titles. So sad. Maybe, they made a tablet version and somehow sold it as full PC release.Refound.			"

												I am thoroughly happy with my purchase. It feels like a streamlined version of Civ 5. Some people are complaining that it's simpler but I don't think that is a bad thing. A lot of overhead removed and the new builders I like better than the old workers. Limited uses is better than late game having 100 random extra units everywhere. Trade routes auto building roads is just another QoL improvement but people are complaining about their skillcap. On that note, you can still manually build roads later in the game so nothing has changed besides improving the trader unit. Graphics style is great to some people while others prefer the old style. I personally like the new one and the interface is definitely improved. I am sure there will be some things later that I notice or miss about an old version but right now, if you are a Civilization fan, I highly recommend.			"

												Well Well Well Fireaxis you had to do this.I've been quite a fan of Civilization in this last year, as I started my first Civ 5 campaign in late 2015 and I'm now closing in on 700 hours in game. I know every civs flavours, how to exploit AI, how to most efficiently build cities, pushes and completly crush the AI in every game I play against them (diety obv). This took me over 300 hours to learn, while much of the remaining time i used on mods  and scenarios. I follow r/civbattleroyale religiously And I can still boot up civ 5 and have  a fun game where I try out mods, do gimmicky strategies or play on unique map types. I feel I have enough experience to talk about the pros and cons of this game after my 50+ hours of gametime.Postives:-The game looks nice. aesthetics can be a big turn off to begin with but you get used to it fast. graphics are beyond art pretty nice.-Districts change up the game and makes you think twice about your city placements. -we have a decent enough list of starting leaders with unique playstyles. -music if d*mn near god-tierNegatives.-It took me 20 hours to learn all about AI and game mechanics, 40 hours to beat diety.-AI is easier to exploit than Civ 5 (how did they even make this happen)-The AI rarely upgrades units and charge me with knights in the modern era-The most aggressive expanders dont gobble up land and AI like in civ 5-Playing tall is near impossible because of how science is not held back by city count and how districts are built-Build times are much higher for units and buildings, which make the game more of a drag (thanks to a drop in %-modifiers and an increase in raw modifiers for prodution)-District hold back gimmicky strategies like building cities on islands and expanding near water-Religious combat is a mess-The AI is super reactionary and can go from friendy to denouncing in mere seconds-Some flavours are f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Montezuma hates you if you get luxuries he does not have (aka always). Saladin hates you if you follow your own religion intead of his crappy religion, how barbarossa will war you if you accidently complete a city-state mission. etc etc-RELEASE THE MOD TOOLS ALREADYright now, Civ 6 is nothing but an inferior game to Civ 5 in any matter. . Its not like this game has no redeeming features, but its far from worth the pricetag it currently holdes. unless the game drops in price signifigantly or gets a couple of much needed tweaks (included extended mod support because that drives the game)If you're interested in a good Turn-Based strategy geme, just go get Civ 5 complete edition for half the price with tenfolds the content and extensive mod support. If you've played civ 5 and want something new, just go download a total conversion mod for it. I'd even recommend civ 3 and 4 before this despite how poorly they've aged.4(?)/10. There is potential for it, but as for now, its not worth its price			"

												Civilization VI is an interesting game, it released with more content than Civ V did, it has new mechanics that allow more customization to your empire, and it still keeps that same feeling of ""one more turn.""  I was frustrated by Civ Beyond Earth, from technical bugs to issues with progression, maybe because it was foreign to me I just couldn't get into it in the way I expected.  I still had some of that anxiety going into Civ 6, maybe it wouldn't be the game I wanted it to be, that it would be a step backwards from Civ V which is one of my favorite games of all time.  I think Civ 6 has the bones to be the best Civ yet, every aspect has some new level of depth or thought put into it, from great people having unique bonuses, to limiting the typical wonder spamming cities by requiring tile placement of wonders, to city state bonuses being more unique and having that race for Suzerain.  I love when you find a great spot for a district with huge adjacency bonuses, setting up a great holy site or harbor really feels better than just adding a building to a production queue.That said, there is still a lot of frustration for me as a classic Civ gamer, barbarian encampments that spawn high damage horsemen or ranged ships within the first 20 turns, movement penalties being changed from Civ V, some unit autocycling problems, and even AI bugs like not upgrading or spamming too much of one type of unit.  I think most of those faults are overlooked by the core of the game being much deeper.   Along this line, the first fall patch to Civ 6 addressed many issues, and has me excited for future updates to improve quality of life for the game.Also, as a new father, Civ 6 is one of the few games I can play while holding my baby.  I often play with the steam controller so that I can set up all the mouse actions to be controlled by one hand while I cradle the baby in my other arm.If I had to recommend one Civ game to a newcomer, I’d say you can’t beat Civ 5 with all the DLC, it has everything I love about civ and isn’t working through any bugs or UI issues, but if you have played Civ before, Civ 6 is a great addition to the series and I can’t wait to see what more they bring to the table.

												Cut to the chase: Don’t buy this full price, wait for the sale or patches/expansions to improve it. They are banking on Civ fans buying this game with little regard to the mediocre design, particularly the AI-don’t succumb, it is not worth your time/money. Play Civ 5 with some of the awesome mods for a  better, more polished experience.I have never written a game review, but after the debacle of Beyond Earth I’m hoping to save other fans of Firaxis/Civ games the money with regard to this game.This does not feel like an evolution of previous Civ games, this feels like the designers asked themselves “how can we make it different from Civ 5?” not “how can we make it better?” Some of the changes are well done, including traders constructing roads, the “card” system for government…and that’s about it. The districts are a nice idea, but really feels like an artificial road block,  rather than a realistic gameplay element—how about a limited number of buildings in the city before I have to construct a district?  The graphics change seems unnecessary and I have read other reviewers complaining about slow turn speed, which I have also experienced, whether or not that is because of graphics or the horrible AI, I can’t say, but the end result is the same, a game the feels clunky and slow even in the early going with few units/areas revealed. Also it was much easier to get a sense of where and what was happening on the map in Civ 5.The most glaring reason not to purchase this game is the awful, horrible, stupid AI. I played a few games for a brief number turns before starting a huge map on Emperor Difficulty with the intention of playing to the end. Despite a huge map there is very little viable land not in close proximity to other city-states or Civs, indeed I managed to found two cities before Spain founded a city immediately next to my capital. Spain’s main empire was about 20 tiles away. So I decided to attack this city with what I thought was a modest size army, 2 hoplites, 1 battering ram and 2 horses. I steamrolled this city as it was isolated and had no reinforcements as  I expected. What I did not expect was to take every city Spain had on the map (4 remaining), as they had little to no army and what they did have was poorly managed. I can’t image this is an isolated incident; they had developed their cities but no military. My next nearest neighbor had done the same thing essentially waiting for me to steamroll them as well. It’s clear as in initial releases of previous CIV iterations the AI has no idea how to wage war, and now it apparently has no idea how to balance the development of cities vs. military. So now I am already bored, I’m in first place by score and I suspect I could steamroll my next neighboring city, but given the low turn speed it sounds like the only challenge will be keeping my patience as the turn counter spins.

												This is the first review I've ever left on Steam, and I feel compelled to do so because this game is an absolute atrocity when it comes to the Civ franchise. I feel as if I would be remiss if I did not attempt to persuade potential customers not to purchase this game. As a long time fanatic of Civllization, I can only say, that, I feel completely, and, utterly, disappointed in the most recent Civilization release. To be completely blunt, it is a total pile of garbage. To begin, the graphics are a complete joke. The best aspect of the Civilization games, is navigating your army through a massive/beautiful terrain, and that aspect is completely lost in the most recent abomination released by Firaxis Games. The graphics are choppy, and, ""cartoony,"" to say the least. I can barely tell what building improvement occupies my tiles due to the horrendous graphics incorporated into this game. The mechanics of the game almost seem stubborn, and unilateral at times. A simple task, such as, switching between troops, seems like a strenuous task to say the least. The game, overall, looks outdated. It is hardly worth a fraction of the praise it received pre-release. I, woefully, made the mistake of purchasing this game, as I am a huge advocate of the Civ franchise. Despite negative reviews, I opted to waste my money on this game. I can tell you, now, after playing the game, that money would have been better spent as material for a campfire. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PILE OF JUNK. Rather, I would suggest, that you hold out hope for the next Civ release. Hopefully, Firaxis gets their act together, and they release something, that is, at the very least, playable, and, somewhat, enjoyable. To summarize: this game is completely unfinished, no amount of updates can fix the insurmountable flaws with this game, don't waste your money, and, please, do yourself a favor; if you're planning on burning $60, I would encourage you to, literally, burn $60, as that would likely provide more entertainment for you than this worthless excuse for a, ""game.""

												First Impressions:   This review is for less then 30 mins of gameplay, Will revise it later after more playing.I have been playing the civilization series since more than 8 yrsGame runs stable and smooth so far on my old PC with Windows 7 and with AMD Phenon X4 CPU , R7700 HD card.  Most new systems should be able to run it very smoothly.Players who have plaved civ 5 and are familier with the other games in the series will find this game to be a marked improvemnt in 1) smoothness of gameplay-- this runs smoothly and with more FPS than Civ 5..  improved Multicore support of CPU with Direct X 12 also certainly helps.2) Visual graphics are much better.3) the game has some improvements in gameplay.. will write a detailed review on that later after more gameplay.  It has improvements in the number of resources, different types of resources, barbarian units have started scouting also,  Goverment type screen and associated bonuses has been introduced and its much more streamlined (replaces the     earlier screen of culture based bonuses) , they way to interact with city states has changed. Research tree is much better.Cons 1) One thing I did not like was that it is not easy to Auto explore as earlier. Also could not find the button to promote a unit after it gains experience easily, the developlers should  do something to fix it in the patches.2) Game is overpriced as with all sidmeier games, that also prevents me fro playing many other games in the series. 2 K game/ Firfaxis should have priced at atleast 35 % lower. Also I can bet that the DLC's coming out will be sold seperately and at a high cost.  Also its unlikely that this game wil go on discount anytime soon.For players who are new to to Civilization series.This is one of the best Turn based strategy games out there.  The learning curve is also not very steep.In short: Go for the Game, if the price is not a deterrance.Will write a more detailed review later.			"

												I have about 700 hours on civ5, will probably rack up quite a few with this one.It is a good game, however i am a little dissapointed in some areas that i hope will be  patched.AI, is very poor at this stage. I think the problem is 1upt, the AI can't use it effectively.Even as a human player, it is difficult to juggle around units like you are playing some digital puzzle game.city states get a lot of extra units. Creating huge traffic jams.I don't think their AI can handle 1upt, this was a problem in civ5 and was meant to be somewhat solved by merging units.However in my game so far, this has not helped much. I had two city states, smack bang in the middle of a fractal map, between them they had some 40 odd warriors, chariots, archers and catapults, jammed up blocking the entire area, no one had set up a city there for the entire game, as no faction could even get there. City states are much better in this version, though the devs need to patch in an option to lower their number (or set to zero). Personally i did not mind the city states, as long as i could set the number low.Too many (as it is now) clogs up the map, eats up space for cities and because of their bonuses they get alot of units. They even create settlers for some reason. Overall, i would not recommend at this current stage at this price point.However it is worth picking up if on a sale, but i would suggest you wait for more patches and a sale before buying.Get the ""yet not another map pack mod"" if you do purchase, as it gives you alot more options and Europe/Earth/ect maps.Also: Custom faction and city names are not in the game currently, this should be added in the next patch as a must!

												love this game.. BUT, ive noticed the AI gets insanely hostile for no reason. i was playing co op with my brother he was south of me and to my right was japan my left was brasil and russia. about 50 turns in they all decided to talk some♥♥♥♥♥♥ then 10 or so turns later all 3 plus the 2 city state right next to me who ive been trading with decided to go to war with me. i go from working on my science and production to halting everything and drafting ♥♥♥♥♥es into my last ditch effort to defend my turf. they throw waves up on waves of men at me so i sit tight in my cities picking them down. i win. then thirty odd turns later they all declare war on me again rinse and repeat 2 more times. ive done nothing to them. all ive been doing was building on my tiles settling new cities as far from other civs as possible and yet i manage to♥♥♥♥♥♥all my neighbors off just for existing. if the AI is going to be so hostile as least make them smart♥♥♥♥♥holes instead of stupid ones. i love a good war but when it becomes spammy like someone throwing pebbles at your face over and over its becomes an annoyance rather than a kick♥♥♥♥♥war between 2 or several factions. oh and my brother was laft alone entirely probably because i was closer to these guys than he was but not by much. its as if these other civs have some sort of aggro circle around their borders to where they say ♥♥♥♥ it and throw everything they have at you even if its only one eyed stan and his three legged mual by god will they try hard to murder you.

												My wife and I love playing Civilization Five together and were looking forward to playing Civilization Six. I have a PC and she has a Mac, so before I bought two copies of Civilization Six I checked to make sure cross platform play was available.  In the Steam store page and under the Mac system requirements is says “It is possible for Mac and PC to become out of sync during updates or patches. Within this short time period, Mac users will only be able to play other Mac users.” For the first few weeks my PC had the “Winter 2016” update and her Mac did not have that update available yet. We were disappointed that we could not play together but understood because we were informed by the store page that this could happen.  The “Winter 2016” update has now been released for Macs, we are on the same version of the game, and we still cannot play multiplayer together. This is extremely frustrating.Looking through the Community Discussion Boards, the Developer on Jan 11th said “We COULD have attempted to get cross platform going with this patch, but … our priority is ALWAYS content 1st, x-platform 2nd”.  When I bought this game I was under the impression that cross platform was already implemented and that was a major factor in my decision to purchase multiple copies of the game at full price.  I have not yet been able to enjoy the game with my wife and I feel mislead by Steam and the Developers of Civilization Six.I look forward to the day when cross platform multiplayer is “going” and do not find this delay to be a “short time period” as described on the Steam store page. Until cross platform multiplayer is working I would not recommend this game to anyone with friends or family using different systems. "

												Civ VI is really good. It playes the best over any other Civ game. There are many thnigs going on besides basic research, such as Civics research, Great Poeple recruiting points, building Districts, Espionage, Religion, Housing, less tile terrafroming but it is still important, Tourism. City States. Barbarians. ... and Deer.Just one thing: The AI is Very Cut Throat. NEVER give open borders or you will be Surprise Attacked and DOOMED. Also, your Capitol needs Walls as early as possible and a military Ecampment or you are DOOMED. ALL cities need a full time Garrison.I played all the Civ games except #4 and this is the best one yet.			"

												Huge Civ fan since the beginning. I hate the characterture look of the AI leaders, and the buildings in general. Its too comical in appearance and the bright colours make it look like disneyland.  Wonders shouldn't take up an entire hex. the scale of everything is strange. Both the civic tree and tech tree are poorly mapped out and far too military focussed.   I don't like the districts idea. I would rather just see the city expand into adjacent hexes, and each hex can only hold so many buildings, and thus making it harder to capture if the entire city needs capturing. AI is very poor. This is the worst aspect of the game. Militarily the AI is dumb, and it declares war on you with no plan at all. There are spelling errors throughout. Last one I saw was on the victory screen for a team multiplayer conquest victory. Really? Is it that hard to get the spelling correct?I had high hopes for this game but alas it failed.			"

												As someone who has spent countless hours (thanks, Steam counter, for making that irrelevant) playing Civ 5, there doesn't feel like enough of a change between the two games in regards to gameplay, to make me want to play 6 over 5. The differences in the tech trees and civic trees are different enough to be interesting, but not different enough to make me want to re-learn a whole new system. That, and the ""round vs. truncate"" movement system change makes moving units seem painfully slow.I approached the more cartoony-style of design with caution, and it feels like that just takes away from the immersion of the game that you're taking one city from scratch and turning it into the civ that conquers the world. The art of the map is a nice touch, but from a tactical standpoint it's very difficult to look at the world map and tell what's land, water, undiscovered, etc.I so wanted this to be an improvement over Beyond Earth, but it feel like the series has only taken a baby step since then.In the end, Civ 6 makes me want to do nothing more than play Civ 5 more. Can I aptly say that this game is worth playing or not for someone new to the series? I really don't know.			"

												I started playing just from CIV V, that I enjoyed a lot, even if everybody hates it (maybe because I didn't played the previous ones?) I was expecting a lot for this one, but at the moment there's a lot of things broken with the AI. Just played it once and I'm not planing to play it again until some months later to see if something was fixed "

												I'm a longtime Civ fan, and it breaks my heart to give this a ""no"" recommendation. Rather than rehash the negatives listed by the previous reviewers, I'll just suggest you read them. I've played quite a few games - and have only finished one. Why? Because towards the end of every other game, I reach a point where I realize that I'm not having fun anymore.Here's what I'd like to see fixed in a patch - and buying version 0.1 of one of their games seems to be the way Firaxis does things.1) Provide an option to automate workers. Yes, workers have ""charges"" but the AI still suggests tile improvements, so it doesn't seem like it would be much additional work to allow you to automate them. This change annoyed me because it was Firaxis telling us how to play the game - I'm a filthy casual, and I hate having to micromanage the damn workers.2) Provide an option to turn off Espionage, as Civ 5 did. Espionage continues to be based on discrete units which have to be built, moved around, and assigned a new/ordered to repeat a mission every several turns. Just a nuisance, especially now since spies can't just be assigned to cities, but must be assigned to specific DISTRICTS. So even if you just want to park a spy in each of your cities so you're not bothered overmuch by other nations, you've got to decide which tiles in what city are going to be protected. Why would anyone think change would be a good idea?3) The tech/social trees are terrible. It's much too easy to beeline to specific techs and skip techs that would logically be required - explain to me again how I can build infantry without learning Rifling or ever having used gunpowder?4) I was about to list #4 as ""make the AI better"" but if they've not been able to do it on the sixth iteration of the series, I'm assuming they are unwilling or unable to do it at this point.Deeply frustrating. So much potential, and yet another product where we wind up buying what should be a late-beta version of the game.			"

												This is a soft ""No.""Civ 6 has a lot of interesting new features. In previous titles, units with 2 movement could move across one flat terrain tile and then move to a hill tile. In this game, each tile now has a movement cost associated with it. A unit with 2 movement points could move to a flat tile, but must wait until the next turn to climb a hill as they only have 1 movement point left. The movement point pool is a compelling feature that drastically affects combat and scouting.The new 'Builder' unit is also a compelling wrinkle. In previous titles - and in most strategy games - 'Workers' could be built to improve tiles in your empire. They were permanent and lasted throughout the game. Firaxis chose to make the new tile improvement units limited in scope; they can only improve three tiles before being expended (four with Pyramids). It's a neat feature and forces players to break up production lines.An upgrade to the grid overlay is a much needed improvement. Players can visualize the tourism and religion effects of their civilization, as well as other civs. There is even an overlay to show the value of certain city areas and where cities can be built before you send out your 'Settlers' (who have 3 visibility now, WOOT!).The game is mostly a callback to Civilization: Revolution which is both good and bad. Everything is much more cartoonish and, despite the efforts to put detail into the unit models and the leaders, represents an infantile recognition of the game, and our, history. Catherine de Medici has the strong features of Asuuna Yuuki (Sword Art Online reference). There are landmarks that offer bonuses when discovered, which is good encouragement to scout instead of building up a massive army. I liked Civ:Rev - especially the random unit promotion feature and landmark naming - but this interpretation does that game no justice.Even the characters are given anachronistic and inaccurate treatment. Hojo Tokimune, a man who is credited with formalizing the establishment of Samurai and Bushido, who dominated his government, who lived during the mid-1200s, is equipped with a feature titled 'Meiji Restoration.' The Meiji Restoration began in the mid-1800s and effectively destroyed the Shogunate in favor of incorporating Western ideologies and technologies.The UI is beyond bizarre in its design. Civ IV and Civ V were special in that the player's access to systems interaction were large and obvious. In Civ 6, all of these buttons got the Harry Pym treatment and are incredibly small. Even their placement is the product of some deluded mind. If you want to check on your political standing with another leader, then check one of the aforementioned map filters, you are going from top-right to top-left parts of the screen. In previous games the left side fo the screen was most frequently interacted with: it contained research, city lists, unit lists, and unit information. The unit information sits beside the 'Next Turn' button, which can be convenient for finishing a turn but detracts from the management of your Civ.Units can't enter an 'Alert' state, which fortifies them until they see an enemy, in Civ 6. This was a valuable tool in protecting against barbarians and other attacks in previous titles. It's beyond annoying that this feature is gone.Oh, and want to set up a production queue? That's gone, too. Really, of all the things Civ 6 thought to ""improve"" upon, it was removing the building queue. How ridiculous. Now I have to sit down with a pen and paper, writing down my queue and scratching things off as they're created. Dumb.All-in-all, not the worst sequel. Firaxis jumped the shark with Civ IV, but this game is a nice addition to the series.			"

												I've been a lifetime Civ player ever since Civ 2 came out and reluctantly write this review. Civ 6, while having a fantastic set of concepts and tools, cannot overcome the totally useless AI built into the game as it currently exists. Once the player discovers how incompetant the AI is at war, even on Deity level settings, the game quickly loses all interest and fun. I do not recommend buying this game until the developers either figure out the AI on their own, or develop modding tools to let others fix the significant mistakes this game has.			"

Posted: October 23, 2016
												Having played a few games including a multiplayer game, I feel I can give a fairly honest review about the latest civilization game: Pros:Feature additions:  - Districts add a new level to city management and restrict rampant expansion. You can now build ships even if your city isn't on the coast.  - New Civics tree puts a nice new spin on culture and allows you to customize your gameplay differently each and every    game.  - Roads are now built buy trade routes, cutting out the annoying road-building mechanic of previous Civ games  - Builders are now charge-based instead of turn based, allowing you to quickly build tile improvements early on  - The changes to great people are welcome and the randomness of each great person itself adds a further element of replayability. Furthermore the uniqueness of each great person (specifically artists/musicians/writers) is highlighted by the works of art they produce  - Religion has been expanded upon, adding new units such as apostles which can help you achieve the new Religious Victory (earned by spreading your religion to enough cities) - Number of new features in Diplomacy, such as Casus Beli (war justifications) - Espionage has also been expanded upon; You can now choose what missions your spy goes on, such as sabotaging enemy districts, stealing gold/ techs etc - Promotions for units are more distinct, allowing you to further customize your military - Military units can now be joined together to form a group (2 for a corps, 3 for an army) this saves space but does produce combat penalties - Wonders are now things you really have to consider as they now take up a tile (instead of just being inside the city). This allows everyone to get their hands on wonders, especially as a lot of them are location specific (eg has to be next to a commercial district and a river etc etc) - New mechanics of housing and amenities further increases the importance of city management and again prevents rapid expansion - Eureka moments are a god-send especially for military-based civs (e.g killing a unit with a slinger will boost your understanding of Archery, reducing the number of turns it takes to research). This almost acts as a mini-quest mechanic, though many players will find themselves getting boosts from just normal gameplay.  -Multiple leaders per civ; eg Greece has both Gorgo (Sparta) and Pericules (Athens) with different leader bonuses.Game:- The multiplayer servers seems suprisingly stable at launch. In the one multiplayer game I played we only encountered one crash and 2 accounts of de-sync. Multiplayer was fairly easy to start.- Main Menu has been simplified, with a lot of options for gameplay customization and optimization- Music and sound is just as good as ever, though there are occasional sound bugs (e.g the constant wheel noise from siege units)Neutral:- Graphics Overhall; some people will love it, some will hate it. Personally I quite enjoy the cartoony art style. The leaders look human but are more like charactatures. The fog of war is great but some might find it confusing. - War weariness, the mechanic nobody asked for, has returned. On paper war weariness is a good idea, preventing militant civs from just stomping everyone into the dust within 30 turns. However in reality war weariness serves no other purpose as to just cripple your empire anytime you go to war. Although the new Casus Beli do negate some war weariness, many of these are later on in the game and/or can't be applied to your civilization (e.g the enemy civ has to be two tech eras behind you). In multiplayer war weariness is exceptionally broken. If you declare war on someone you'd better end it fast because they can simply turtle out until your entire civilization collapses as they just REFUSE peace making you spiral further and further down until you literally can't win. Then if you do look like you might take them over, all they do is just build some awful city miles away, keeping them in the game and further fuelling your misey. In some cases the DEFENDER gets a ridiculous amount of war weariness- where's the sense in this??? I suspect and HOPE this gets patched soon either officially or with mods.- Optimization; the game runs perfectly find on my pc and I haven't crashed once; however other users on steam are reporting issues both on lower and higher end pcs. Something to keep in mind.- Sean Bean voice over; I personally like it, again some people may not. Although the narration does change as techs have multiple flavor texts, often I just find myself cutting poor sean off as he repeats that we can't go around arresting the thieves guild we'd be here all day YEH I GET IT!Cons:- The big one, and I'm sorry to say, the AI are just as bad as ever, although they have improved in a few areas. They no longer spam awful cities everywhere (though sometimes they do make questionable settlements), they play their characters (e.g norway declares war on you for having a tiny navy) and they do make good decisions when they meet you (e.g send gold, try to be nice). This all goes downhill later on. I find myself CONSISTENTLY declining GOD-AWFUL trade deals for 1 gold. ONE SINGULAR GOLD. The AI have no qualms with asking for multiple luxuries/cities/younameit for ONE GOLD. Yet good luck trying to get anything from them other than open borders as they just downright refuse most requests, insisting they can 'never make this work'. The AI have the same problem in previous Civ games where out of NOWHERE they just declare war on you without reason.I haven't seen the AI use a Casus Beli once. Then they just send a bunch of low-tech troops, lose, then throw in the towel. For some reason the AI seems to shy away from upgrading their units, despite easily having the gold to do so. Heavens forbid if an AI neighbour is going down the religion route as your cities will be BOMBARDED by a never-ending wave of apostles that they somehow pulled out their♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yet if you try and do the same they get riled up and denounce you immediatly. At higher difficulties the AI don't change but do get boosts to certain things, same as in previous games. I'd personally recommend King for most players as Prince is too easy.- Multiple bugs and glitches that, while are to be somewhat expected from a new game, are still nonetheless frustrating to deal with. Save regularly- Governments are the same as usual, if you don't want to go to war then democracy is your only choice.- Barbarians pose more of a challenge. This is good to an extent. However a game I played had two barbarian crossbowmen and two horsemen camp my city TURN 15. FIFTEEN!!!! Considering how your city no longer starts with the bombardment ability, this just consigns the game to an early restart.- Rebellions are absurd. I understand that if my city is a complete DUMP I should have repurcussions. So when I'm in the medieval era and my city spawns some rebellious swordsman, that's totally acceptable. But when I'm in the modern era and my city somehow spawns HELICOPTERS??? what do I actually do here- The game grinds to a halt late game even in small games. Late game the turns take ages HOWEVER oddly enough this only happens every so often and not every game. I don't know why my game with 6 players on a standard map lagged but my game in a huge map with 12 players didn't.- randomness of great people sometimes leads to just worthless units. If I get a scientist who gives me a science boost for every mountain nearby, and I have no mountains anywhere, I've essentially just wasted a great person.- Civ placement seems a bit off in some games. On a HUGE map with only 6 players I somehow started right next to 4 of them.Is the game worth it at launch? I think so. It is still a fun game. I'm excited to see what dlcs will bring as the game feels complete as it is. Mod support is also something to look forward to. However, AI still awful and there are bugs.			"

												Civ 6 is a great installment for the long running 4x series, but even with the steps it takes forward to evolve its gameplay, it also takes a few steps back. This review is after ~50 hours of game time.Full Video:


YouTube™ Video: Sid Meier’s Civilization VI - Logic Review 

			Views: 602		

			Sid Meier’s Civilization VI is a 4X in the long running Civilization series. Review copy supplied free of charge. Game: http://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/ About the series: Logic Review is a...		

lets get the bad sorted... And this is mostly contained to two areas, that do impact the game quite a bit, these are AI and the Interface.The Ai is bad. It makes illogical choices, it uses it's resources badly and even on higher difficulties and with the cheating the Ai does, it still doesn't make sense. On top of the cheating Ai, it also tries to keep up with tech by just skipping entire trees of research. Which is very frustrating when they are somehow landing on the moon, without having done any of the research. which also makes your spies quite a bit less useful.Secondly - the UI is pretty sub-par. Information is often hidden behind several screens and tabs and even explanations on certain features (how do cities without amenities rebel game? HOW?). in their quest to show us the damn pretty graphics and animations, they have stripped important information away, and in a game where every bit of information matters, that is not cool. I hope mods will fix this problem asap even if the developers don't, as most of this information is available in the game in some form. Thankfully we do have mod-support from day one and that's a good thing. As i said, there are 2 main drawbacks, and those are it - if you can deal with those this game is damn good. The removal of global happiness for a multi- faceted system is great and gives more ""local"" controls, the addition of district is also a nice change and provides more choices to the player and information they have to weight in.I even like the switch with the wonders taking up a physical tile and the builders having limited actions.The one aspect i'm still divided on is the tech tree, as while i love the new civics system and government options, i don't like that the tech tree feels quite dressed down due to the splitting into two segments.Overal, i like the game quite a bit and find that the major issues are very annoying and frustrating - but for me at least, not game breaking.

												If you wonder why the stream rating is so low, there are mainly 2 reasons:1) The developer made quite some radical changes and people tend to hate change (""OMG!!! I CANNOT EMPLOY THE SAME STRATEGIES AS IN THE LAST CIV. THE DEVS ARE HORRIBLE PEOPLE AND EAT BABIES!!!!!"")2) The AI is currently pretty bad. That's a fact. And it is indeed an annoying one. (Update: After the patch the AI got a little better. Still it is far from being strong)After a few mods and tweaks, this will be the best CIV in the series. I don't see any way around that. It is already a great game and the changes they made over the previous CIVs are amazing!  Everything fits neatly into place. The only reason for me to pick CIV4 or CIV5 over this is the AI.

												Beautiful visuals, the music is great, some of the mechanics changed over from V are neat and add a new twist to the game, but the AI and Diplomacy is so horribly broken it is almost pointless to even attempt to ""make friends"" since they will denounce you for no discernible reason 3 turns later. Countless cycles of war between the AI and also having war declared on you, though hostile units will come to your borders and just chill for the most part before someone decides peace is a good idea. But god forbid you try to start a war because well then you're just a warmonger and everyone that didn't denounce you before is going to immediately after. Pretty much everything in regards to what the AI do and how they play is simply broken.			"

												While it has its A.I. flaws, it certainly is more interesting with the personalities that they are improving upon.. the A.I is smarter, springing surprise wars when you are weak.. and generally is a great opponent.Upsides:Downsides: No idea what are in expansions, besides Poland, but hopeful. Some things are unclear on descriptions.. like melee typically means just warrior-types, not spearmen.. though sometimes it does.. so.. *shrugs*. And as said, some A.I. flaws. Some obviously better starts (forests add a net 1 industry to all, jungles a net 1 food).Easy to get some overpowered combos, and no real science or cultural penalties for having a ton of cities.. and easilly managed.. so if you go on a take-over-spree.. it's really easy to keep them all in line.Upsides: more interesting A.I., clearer personalities and why than other games. Districts are dynamic and offer a lot of variety in making unique cities and using their terrain more than simply having higher numbers.Unique city states with wonderful boosts make them viable for use.. can war a rival players city states to eliminate their advantages.Better army and city management with gold costsNatural wonders are more spread out in their abilities, rather than a single really really good tile.I LOVE the instant gratification of doing quests (for city states which new ones come clearly each era.. most relatively easy to get to compared to civ5, and faster.. no 30 round wait to see who wins).. and the ones you get for techs.. which is really fun like mini-quests, get 2 crossbows.. and it's half cost, for example.Oh! and there are a few less wonders right now, though more are likely to come.. but so far almost all of them have rather specific land requirements, being next to certain districts.. which makes a lot more fun in designing your cities to provide for certain wonders.Overall it's good, will be better.. and provides a very unique experience with each civ in their area-play.

												I have 674 hours logged in Civilization 5, and what made that game great was the constant refinement provided by WORTHWHILE DLC content. The expansion and development of that game in comparison to this one is a complete joke. If you were to pay the same ammount of money there are FAR LESS features in Civilization 6 as compared to 5. I paid for the digital delux edition expecting the same product I recieved with Civilization 5 which (when paired with the DLC) was a masterpiece in my humble opinion. This is not the case with Civilization 6. There are amazing features in this game, like city development, the districts system, expanded cultures, and a seemingly more expanisve end-game. I am also not opposed to the art style, and felt it did not detract from the game in any meaningful way.However in stark contrast, the AI is absolutely apalling, the diplomacy/warmongering is game breaking, many Civs with military focus are insanely powerful when compared to Civs with religion focus, the lack of world congress, and not to mention that the game is EASY. Here is a guide on how to win at nearly any difficulty:  1) ♥♥♥♥ culture, religion, and diplomacy, and throw that♥♥♥♥♥♥right out the window 2) Have AI declare war on you/declare war on them 3) Have your military chill in your cities with plenty of ranged units 4) Slaughter the AI's army as it throws itself mindlessly against your walls 5) Counter-attack the now militarily inconsiquential AI with a mix of mele at the front backed up by a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of ranged units 6) ProfitWhat the ♥♥♥♥ is happening Firaxis?? Civilization 5 was AMAZING and it showed in your reviews of the game. Then Beyond Earth? Which many people choose to forget as a blemish worth overlooking in the series because it was reasonable to ""try new things"". And now Civilization 6?? Some of the things you did with this game were amazing, and many people love it. But, it's painfully obvious you spent far too much effort on developing very specific aspects of the game while completely neglecting CORE elements of what made running a civilization in previous games fun. It pains me to see all of these new and wonderful ideas sit idle, and grow stagnent while you release DLC that pales in comparison to your previos efforts instead of balancing that with further refining.In summary I am NOT a satisfied customer, I am so dissappointed by the product I have recieved thusfar, and will most certainly NOT be pre-ordering any Civilization game ever again (let alone this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I have been served as digital ""delux""). This makes me so sad Firaxis. I have LOVED your series since first purchasing Civilization 3, and have since pre-ordered every one of your games plus any available DLC/digital delux content in the Civilization series. I will no longer be doing this.Thank you so much for the good times I had, and I am perfectly willing to change my opinion, and this review of the game if it develops into something I am satisfied with. BUT SERIOUSLY FIX THE BROKEN STUFF, ADD RELEVENT CONTENT, AND STOP GIVING ME 1 OR 2 CIVS EVERY MONTH. I DONT WANT MORE CIVS I WANT MORE FUN./rant			"

Product received for free
												When I bought the deluxe edition, I thought that I was going to get at least some worthwhile DLC for the 20 Dollars of extra cost. I would have thought it would have been The  two civs and a scenario/or map pack as they did in Civ5.... Apparently hoping for something small and simple like that for a first DLC was too much to ask for. INSTEAD, we get this; a single scenario, three natural wonders, and six city states. I especially like how they mention ""Includes special art assets for leaders."" (Who, aside from Harald, are only available within the scenario and not out of it may I add.) As if having art for the leaders is something special, and not something that you should just get by default. Oh,  and aforementioned Scenario only lasts a hundred turns. So, let's list what you get: 6 entire city states. (Arguably the only thing of worth in this, though I use worth thinly here.) One civilization.A single scenario that only lasts a hundred turns.3 natural wonders.Three leaders!.... Two who can only be played in the scenario. Each of which they were ""Kind"" enough to give actual art like all the other leaders already have. So, what you really get: An entire three tiles.A custom scenario that has custom leaders, but lasts only a hundred turns.Six city states.One civilization.This is a flagrant and obvious attempt by Firaxis to give small ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC's to those who pre-ordered. That way they do not have to make any actual effort until after three more  of these pitiful excuses for DLC's. Where after, Mark my words.... They will suddenly go ""Oh look at all this cool new DLC! A pack containing several new leaders! Here's a  DlC the size of brave new world, or beyond the sword! here's a scenario pack that contains a leader, several scenarios, and a new map type!You all just wait for it, because that is   EXACTLY what will happen.

It is not only the lack of a decent AI in CIV VI, is also the bugs, crashes, several lack of features and unbalanced gameplay. CIV VI has a lot of potential to end up being better than V, but that could happen in a couple of years, there's lot to improve right now, too much.About the new art style, a step back.			"

Posted: October 30, 2016
												Let me start off by saying that civilization 6 made a lot of changes in the right direction. I like the new movement system, barbarians, districts/wonders, agendas, eureka, great people, the government system, the tech/culture tree, local happiness/housing and the envoys for city states. All of these are very good ideas and given some balance they can become great new mechanics  to the Civilization series, but as it stands now a few things listed have some major problems.Barbarians: I really love the fact that barbarian camps now send out a scout to find your lands and then go back to their base to send an army to attack you. The problems with these is you get incredibility unlucky and get three camps or more attacking you at once or you might have a game where you have no problems with the barbarians at all. It’s not that consistent from game to game. Another issue is that these barbarian camps spawn horse units sometimes if they are near a house resources. Again the idea is good and makes sense, but it not really fun to be attacked by these units when you can still only build slingers and warriors.An example would be I just played to test something else. On turn 8 my city had a horseman unit near it. Turn 11 I had 2 horseman units and a horse archer unit. All three units camped my city tiles and did nothing the whole time. They did not attack my city in 6 turns that I let go by. They just camped near my city and did nothing. While they can be dealt with, it feels very frustrating doing it and can put you behind if it gets bad enough. And if that not enough another issue is sometimes a barbarian scout will find my lands, but instead of going back to where they spawned, they just move right along to another location.Eureka and Tech speed: Districts and Eureka's are both personally my favorite new additions to Civilization 6. I liked how the Eureka might make you take a tech you might usually ignored until later and how you can plan your action to try to complete the Eurekas and Inspirations to get that tech fasting. The problem is you start to fly through the tech tree really fast at times because these Eurekas and Inspirations cut the cost of a tech by 50% it’s base value. Not only that but the base cost for some techs are too cheap without even getting the Eureka as the game goes on and here is where the problem with districts come into play.Districts: Districts scale not on how many cities you have or how many districts you build. Districts scale based on how much tech your empire has and given how fast you can go through the tech tree, it makes the cost of districts ridiculous as the game goes on. Some of my cities which are pretty well developed and have a lot of production from improve tiles in the early game are still taking 16-26 turns to build the District. For that amount of turns you have to wait, you are better off just attacking someone who build a district themselves to get it. I have tried mods that increase the tech cost of tech to see if it solves the problems, but even with them the base cost of districts just seem to be way too high.I feel the proper solution to these is decrease the cost of districts by 20-25%, decrease the Eureka and Inspiration to 25%-30%, and increase the tech cost of some of the later eras. It does make me wonder what direction they want to take districts in terms of how many a player should have at a given time in their cities, when I’m getting policies that give me more housing when I have two districts when most of my cities barely have one. By the time most of my cities get the two districts to even benefit from that, it gets replaced by a stronger version that requires three districts. Like what?Agenda and Diplomacy: The Agenda system where each leader has one primary agenda that they have in every game and a hidden agenda sound amazing when I first heard about it. It sound like it was really going to change how the game was going to be played between the different AIs from game to game with all their different personalities and change a player’s approach in interacting with the different AI. The problem is the agenda system feels like it’s not even working at all. For example  America with Teddy Roosevelt is suppose to be friendly with people that don’t declare war on his continent and dislike people who do war on his continent but in one of my games he attacked a friend I was playing with when Egypt just declared war on him. He was not mad at Egypt at all or even denounced them.Next is the diplomacy values. In a lot of my games when I check to see why someone hates me I have had things like +12 for unknown reason and -6 for unknown reason and with a +6 they do not like me at all. Like does that make any sense to anyone? And why more than 99% of the time am i getting -3-10 for “unknown reasons”. Overall The agenda system and the values for diplomacy is just flat out poorly done and need major work.UI: The UI in some areas is just lacking. An example would be when picking a civilization it will list one of their unique districts and tell you what districts it replaces, but it will not mention unless you go to the civilopedia on what that unique districts does. That is just a quick example, but there are others.Casus Belli System and Formal Wars:  The Casus Belli System also have some pretty big problems. I was under the impression the Casus Belli System was suppose to help a lot with warmonger penalties, but that does not seem to be the case. I can do a formal war in the medieval era and yet doing a formal war in the medieval era givens me a huge warmonger penalty. That is just not right.I envision surprise wars being fairly common in the ancient and classical eras with little to pretty much no warmonger penalties. As you progressed to the medieval era and further surprise wars should start to give medium to huge warmonger penalties why Casus Belli wars and Formal war give none to medium warmonger penalties. Maybe give huge penalties later in the game or when you declare war too much too quickly. But as it stands now in the base game it’s nothing like that at all.Overall Civilization 6 made some pretty big improvements from say Civilization 5, but a lot of the mechanics in the game are at the moment are very poorly implemented and until most of these gets addressed in a patch I can not recommend it at this time. But once all these issues do get addressed, I’m positive civilization 6 will be a great product.			"

												Huge fan of the Civ series, and Civ 6 is a major let down. Animation and leader screens are cringe worthy. Diplomacy and trade is horrible. Agendas, while a good idea, are not executed well. For example, things that make the game unplayable:- Turn 28, just met Rome and I get denounced for not having a big enough empire despite us both only having one city.- My entire empire is landlocked, yet Harold of Norway pops up every few turns in an unskippable leader screen telling me that I need a bigger navy, and then denounces me.- I get attacked in the bronze age, retaliate by taking and destroying one minor city, and get branded a war mongerer all the way through to the space age.- Turn 20, I just met Cleopatra and she denounces me for having a 'smaller' military than her.- Spawn on the same continent as England, and she denounces me simply for existing.- The AI agendas make it so you'll spend the whole game getting denounced and dealing with leader screens where dignified world leaders of history freak out like children and grunt and scream at you. - Religion is broken. Either rush religion and dominate or turn religous victory off.- Mulitplayer is horrible. You can't play on the same teams against AI or others.- Late game wonders take too long to build, even with the fix.- AI cannot fight at all. Even at harder difficulties, there is no match.Buy this game in 2-3 years when everything is fixed, and play Civ 5 in the meantime. Otherwise play on a huge map with low AI count so that you don't meet them until late in the game, because AI is what is worst about this game.			"

												Best Civ Yet. PROS: Extremely enjoyable and smooth. The Standard map size is much larger than previous Standard sizes. Or perhaps growth is scaled. Either way, very nice. Fog of War is the best I've seen in any game. The Policy interface allows for varied growth styles and customization in civ tactics. The cartoonish characters really add to the appeal to the game.Creating corps and then armies is an ingenious solution to stacking. The ability to transfer Great People and traders between cities breaks removes slow, laborious moving of these assets around the map. It allow you to help cities when they need it.The city-state interface leaves no guesswork as to ranks highest in their eyes.Notifications by AI players on why you are being denounced makes the game fullerCONS: AN OCEAN LINER IN A LAKE: The AI still funnels the game towards wars. War is easy, peace and stability... impossible (so far) Seemingly random, unprovoked denunciations with no notification as to why. I really deflates the all-around depth, forethought and fullness put into the game. Its like building great ocean liner, then making sail in only one or two lakes, but never the sea and never for long.  "

TLDR:I have 42 hours played in the 3 days after the release of the game. I have played every Civilization game and this is my favorite one. I recommend it if you are a fan of the series or looking to try the series out. It's especially good for new players since it has a tutorial based on your experience with the Civilization franchise. My Impression:Civilization is such a complex and in depth game and to feel so intuitive to play is impressive. After all that it stays a game to that remains fun, exciting, and unpredictable after hundreds of hours of play? That’s joyous.Positive:+ The music of this game, especially the start screen is beautiful and powerful+ Voice acting is on point and is throughout the game in every aspect+ AI is realistic in the personality of the leaders. Certain leaders will spread the religions they are known for. This wasn't the case in the previous ones. The leaders act how they would if they were still alive, so very realistic.+ Amazing strategy game that defines the 4x genre+ Steam Achievements+ Steam Trading cardsNegatives:- Initial Civilizations introduced with the release, I was hoping for more leaders and some specific ones that were not included- Some people find the graphics cartoony, I like the graphics.- I don't like the way they do the DLC of releasing new leaders- This review was written 3 days after release and the game can still use a few balance patches to get to perfectionVery Very Good Game: 9/10P.S. Civilization 4 was my favorite until I tried Civilization 6. I can only imagine it gets better with mods and DLC.			"

												Civilization 6 is perhaps not as huge a makeover as the transition from 4 to 5 was, but in my opinion it still brings with it a major overhaul of the core game mechanics over civ 5. Of course, there are the headline new features such as the policy tree and city districts, but I think the biggest changes to how the game plays are elsewhere. The supply of money in the game is much more generous than in civ 5. this allows for more flexibility in gameplay by giving you the option of reacting to surprises or simply jumpstarting progress towards your goals. Additionally, build times for most units have been decreased relative to the previous game, which means you can build more units and field larger armies. Limited unit stacking has been added back in this game, but it has been done so in a way that preserves tactical gameplay. Spies appear to have gotten a boost in usefulness over the previous game too, and they can be devastating against an opponent who is trying to win a science or culture victory.Sadly, there are currently some balance issues with the game, and these balance issues that negate a lot of the advantages of the reworked mechanics. I think the first issue is the AI in the game appears to be based on the Beyond Earth AI, which means they are largely too peaceful and universally hate conquerors. I have yet to play a game with a warlike AI who pursues a domination victory. It seems the AI will pursue science, religious, or culture victories only. This is unfortunate and it leads to a certain predictability and lack of variety across games. Finally, it seems the effort required to achieve various victories is not quite balanced. Until the most recent (Dec 20, 2016) patch, science victories required both a tremendous science investment and a very large industrial investment, which meant someone might win another victory long after you have completed the research tree, but have yet to build and launch all the rocket parts. I believe the latest patch is meant to address this issue. However, the religious victory is still the most out of balance of all of them. This is largely due to how the religion mechanic works in civ 6.In civ 6, religion is a core feature of the game, not an added feature. If you want to pursue a religious victory, you must decide to do so at the very beginning of the game, since in each game there are fewer religions allowed than there are civilizations. This is I think the core failing of the religion mechanic. You must push to get the most religious points and buildings early, so you can found a religion. If you do found a religion, you can spam religious units who can ignore borders and convert cities in any empire. Any civilization who does not have their own religion must resort to physically blocking their cities from being converted by constantly keeping their cities surrounded by units or going to war to capture/destroy the invading religious zealots. If you do have your own religion, you can build units to defend with. However, religious warfare is not all that interesting, since there are only a handful of different units and only one that is capable of offensive religious warfare against other (religious) units. This basically comes down to who can spam the most units wins. It seems that in many games, there are usually two major religious players and if you're going for a religious victory, your major challenge is defeating the other major religion. all the other players have no defense, which is different when compared with other victory types where every civ can be at least somewhat competitive or at least have a credible strategy for countering a win.A science victory can be held off with spies, as can a culture victory or a domination victory. (sabotage factories and spaceports, steal artefacts). A domination victory can be held off by simply holding your capital. However, I have yet to see an AI anywhere close to a domination victory. A culture victory, as with a science or domination victory, can be achieved by simply out-producing your opponent at the relative metric. You can use conquest or production to fuel this rise in power. However, a religious victory cannot be rolled back largely because there is no mechanism to de-radicalize your own cities or the cities of others if you have already been converted. If you have yet to be converted but were not lucky enough to get your own religion, it is only a matter of time before someone converts you. Once that happens, you can convert cities to that religion, but that doesn't help you. that helps your opponent. I suppose in theory you could try to interpose your religious units to prevent an opposing religion from becoming too dominant, but if whoever converted you is already dominant, there’s basically nothing you can do short of militarily eliminating the civ that spawned the religion. However, this option will incur a heavy diplomatic penalty from every other leader in the game. I think that leads into my final complaint with the AI in this game, which is an unfortunate side-effect of a rather interesting feature of the personalities they imbued each civilization with. Essentially, each civilization respects strength in specific areas, and your strength or weakness in those areas will provide diplomatic bonuses or penalties with that leader. For instance, Cleopatra respects military might, while Harold respects a strong navy. The trouble with this, is that many leaders respect strength in areas that they themselves are strong in, leading them to like leaders that are in direct competition with them. Other leaders don’t have this problem, but there are quite a few who do. Separately from that issue, no leader appears to recognize when a leader is nearing victory in a specific area. Thus, a leader might continue to respect your strong culture and like you for it right until they lose. There does not seem to be a sense that they are in competition with you or each-other. Thus, if you act to prevent a civilization from winning through war, you will incur a heavy diplomatic penalty even though other civilizations should instead be backing your play.At the time of writing, I hesitate to recommend the game to someone who has civilization 5 with all the expansions and DLC. That game has more balance and diversity of gameplay than this game does in its current state. However, if you haven't played civilization before or simply haven't played in a long time, this is a fun and refreshing game that has tons of replay value and still preserves that ""one-more-turn"" addictive fun. I am going to mark recommended, because I have played 100 hours of this game and have enjoyed my time with it. I will probably put another 50-100 hours in before the first expansion comes out, and then I will likely play it for several hundred more hours.			"

												I want to like this. I want to say this game is flawless.But its not, there are some major issues Civ6 has to adress before it gets my aproval rating.Lets start with the mechanics.Most of these are without a douth an improvement over the previous generations.Districts adds a level of city building beyond the point of mere field improvements by your builders.the limited charges of builders makes it so they are a lot more valuable to your civ it also prevents large cities from just constantly spaming out military units as it will sacrifice a bunch of their econemy.Diplomacy at the current state is quite botched as the value of limited ""rare"" luxury resources are considered 1 gold each.but since you can only obtain them from great mechants or certain city states. the value should be trough the roof instead! your also unable to spark a war between 2 factions for some reason or i just could not find out where this was.Every faction is likely to stab you in the back multiple times while you get branded as a warmonger when you defend yourself and retaliate against your agressors.several times i was in high standing with the empires around me untill they started to surprise war me for no reason.Military score is misscalculated which makes agressive nations more likely to fight you because of ""weak military""my military units were by far stronger but because i did not have 30 of these my enemies decides to just invade and dance around my cities without actually attacking them. i had 10 ""army"" type units which are a whole lot stronger. not to mention that my tech advantage was signifigant.There are a number of bugs here and there that get quite anoying.for example. starting this game mutes my audio for everything besides the game itself.i cannot listen to vods or music on my secondary monitor while playing Civ 6 which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Sometimes units dont deselect when you end your turn. with traders you will constantly see the trade routes over the whole map even while you already selected a path for it.had some units being unable to end their turn which softlocked me on that turn itself. i had to reload the previous autosave to fix this issue.Diplomacy will make it so every faction hates Everyone by the mid to endgame times.there is no ballance between like and dislike ratio. since every faction has their hidden agenda you will constantly do something another dislikes.Build wonders? china hates you.recruit great civs? Brozil hates you.Not enough military? Egypt hates you.Its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to please everyone even when you dont go to war and only build your econemy.Simply said. the game is a bit unfinished in its mechanics but certainly solid enough to try it out.i hope some patches fixes this but right now. ya can better wait for a sale.

												Still less than 30 turns in but enjoying the new mechanics so far. Haven't had time to test the AI yet. No crashes, runs smooth, looks amazing, especially love the style of the stratgic view. Best recent Civ at launch so far. I've spent too long out of game so I'm off to have one more turn...			"

												Ok... First I have over 5000 hrs playing Civ V... I absolutely love Civ games... and yet, I am so very disappointed in the release of this latest game. I purchased Civ VI with all the DLC content available, it was an $80.00 purchase. The good... 1. City Districts - nice addition to the game.2. Distinctly new great people 3. Policy selection has been improved upon greatly.Now, what has ruined the game. 1. The cartoonish looking leaders, I know, its lame... But I dont understand the flip from the past games here. 2. The map - It looks nice, but very difficult to distinguish country boundaries from each other. There needs to be enhanced boundaries between countries.3. The AI is the worst I have played against compared to any previous Civ game. This is the main reason that I simply can't play this game any longer...I am writing this with a heavy heart, I was so looking forward to another great game... Like watching your child falling off their bike... It seems this may be the last Civ purchase for me.Without Mods - There will be no CIv Future! "

												Only enjoyable as a casual game. - Terrible AI that isn't a challenge even on Deity- Terrible unit balance, cavalary is heavily favored- Terrible mechanics like War Weariness- Lack of production overflow cap making it very exploitable- Lack of strategic variety, every game everyone does the same with little deviation+ Online is way more stable than in Civ 5 "

												It's not worth the money until the expansions come out. This game is completely barebones and follows the typical civilization model. It has some neat ideas, but basically feels like a neutered version of mods available for Civ5. It takes an eternity to start a game, the framerate chugs on the lackluster leader clips that lack the depth and feeling of the Civ5 character models. This whole game is a downgrade from previous games and I wish I had stayed strong rather than wasting money on this pile of disappointment.			"

												The new DLC is inexcusably minimal.  A rip off for $5 to get one race and one (albeit very simple) scenario.  When did pre-order DLC become inbox fodder?  This game is still good, still fun, but the poor AI is now the staple trademark of Civilization, limitting the replay value, especially since the DLC doesn't include any  new mechanics.  Also, religious warfare got no tweaks in the major patch.  EPIC FAIL.  I demand a refund.			"

												It's everything we've come to expect from a Civ game - including a broken AI. The game is good, a little dumbed down in some areas, a bit more complex in others - the perfect degree of change from V, but the AI is, once again, broken. Not only is it functionally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but it also once again suffers no consequences for failing to meet the game's maintenance expectations - unhappiness or negative balance do not affect AI as usual. In addition to that, the Spy system is broken almost completely - you can get spied for money (basically a high powered money theft directly from a city) but the enemy can steal more money than you have. This will immediately plunge your empire into chaos, with no indication of how much longer you still need to survive with 0 gold until this imaginary debt has been repaid. Add to that the fact that it is impossible to defend every district of a city from spies, and that this game encourages you to have more than 4 cities, and you end up in a money draining fight against yourself. Your empire crumbles, revolutions happen, units disband, and you lose. All because of a single spy.Until this is fixed, I cannot recommend the game as it is simply not enjoyable. It would be another thing entirely if spying could be disabled like in V, but that option does not exist this time around.			"

												You might as well just get civ 5 with the current state that civ 6 is in. The developers seem to be dragging their feet on the modding/map making tools, which is the exact reason the civ franchise (especially civ 5) has done so well in my opinion. The core game, which has improved a little since release, is still not at the point in which the game is worthy of the price. Until the developers decide to release the tools and allow the modders to fix some glaring issues that this game has, this game will not be worth the money.If it weren't for the random 5 dollars (and a bit of blind faith) I had left over from Christmas, I wouldn't own the Polish DLC. The fact that only ONE CIVILIZATION and ONE SCENARIO are what the DLC offers was most dissapointing, and I refuse to spend anymore money on this game unless the price actually makes sense for the product. If the DLC had maybe included 2 CIVs and a Scenario, I could stretch that for being worthy of 5 dollars in my own mind, but that wasn't the case. If you want to risk the money on this game, just remember what I've said.The earliest Sid Meiers game I loved was Civ 3, and I thought Civ 5 was pretty good as a final product, and a few minor mods to fix some bugs. The handling, release, DLC, and lack of communication I've seen for this game has left a pretty bitter taste in my mouth, and now I'm more than hesitant to purchase anymore DLC or games from the Sid Meier or even the Fraxis brand. I'll check in on the game for hopes that the Devs turn it around and listen to the community, but until that day comes, this game is uninstalled.			"

												Only played the game for 16.6 hours for now.I loved Civ 4, but I didn't like Civ 5 as I thought that it was not balanced.Now I can say that I think Civ 6 will be the best Civ game so far!!!I was a bit sceptical about Civ 6 as I saw that it would be based on Civ 5, but I think they took out the bad parts and introduced some very nice new features.Pros:1. Ambient. Grapfics are much better than Civ5. The graphics are cartoonish, especially the battles, builders building, but in general it is much better than Civ5. The map is much clearer and you can see what is happening where, the terrain, etc. The resources are not that visible so you have to play with the resources icons turned on, and also for the beginners it is hard to distinguish the districts on the map.Day, dusk, night and dawn cycle is simply beautiful. Ambient is amazing. When the view if above the marsh you will hear frogs, if you are above the forest you'll hear birds, if you are in tundra you'll hear cold winds, if you are above a city you'll hear a bustling city, etc.Music is very nice. It seems that it depends on the civ you are playing and also the era. Only drawback is that it can be overly dramatic sometimes and also it tends to repeat a bit too much.The new map style is very nice.2. Districts. The new district feature seems to be very nice for now. some of the building that used to be in the city centre are now in these districts. Library and University are in the Campus district. Barracks and Armory are in the Encampment, etc. Very nice feature. districts take a tile space. also wonders take a tile space. you have to plan ahead a little bit. Some districts and wonders and buildings can be placed only on specific tiles (e.g.: next to the city centre, next to the river, away from the city centre, desert, coast, etc.). Also, there are quite a bit bonuses when the districts are next to each other, they get higher output in comparison if they would be surrounded by just fields. Also, the harbour now acts as a harbour! When the units are embarking, they tend to use the harbour and they get no embankment movement penalty points.3. Roads are now quite tricky. They get built by themselves in the beginning. actually they get built on the trail of the traders. They cost nothing. Roads gradually get faster as you advance through the eras. Later in the game you can build roads as some of your cities will not be connected initially but it costs a lot.4. Tech tree. Tech tree is considerably different than before. First of all, you have a tree for your techs and you have a tree for your civics. You get techs by acquiring science and also by doing stuff. E.g.: If you engage in battles, some military tech will get considerably cheaper. If you have an iron mine, iron working will be much cheaper. If you have been fishing in the sea, sailing will get much cheaper. So this adds a much nicer and natural dimension to the game. Tech development depends a lot on the surroundings and the environment and circumstances. If someone declares war on you, you have to defend yourself, but you'll gain a bunch of military tech along the way and you'll be more than ready the next time. The civics three is very nice. You develop civics by acquiring culture. Your government and policies depend on the coulure development of your country. I really like the new government and policies systems! It is different than anything seen before and it is working great. It adds much more flavour. It makes you think about the culture much more than before. This and also the borders expansion.Not so sure:1. Diplomacy had been redone. I'm not sure if it is better or worse. AI is more aggressive and all the leaders are unhappy with me even though I haven't done anything to them and I give them anything they ask for.Cons:1. Bugs and twitches. The game has a lot of bugs and twitches. I noticed a lot of things are not working as it should. I hope this will be taken care of in one of the patches.2. System Requirements. Even though my laptop is slightly higher than the minimal requirements, I started the game on medium settings. The game was painfully slow. It was just loading for 20 minutes. Only when I put all the settings on very low can I play the game. Even now the game stutters every now and then. For anything more than low settings you'll probably need the recommended requirements.Gonna continue the review when I play more.			"

												This game is a total disappointment for me. I have been playing this series since Civ1. I can say that Civ6 is so far away from being a Sid's games.: game lost her character and fun. Now it’s like a hard copy of Endless Legend series . Also it’s like a mobile game it's so linear and basic there are some victory conditions and if you follow the guides you can be successful at deity anytime. Religion , politics, battles have no challenge at all. If an experienced CivFan plays this game for 5 times I am sure that he/she or shemale gay or an Elf whatever will be bored in the middle of the game.  So this game is rubbish for me I will continue to play civ5 with mods (BNW) till new updates and DLC come up for this. (I even tried to play with best modes still boring) I still have a hope come on guys (devs)  be yourself don't copy other boring strategy games...			"

												I've been playing Civ since 5 inch floppies and this will be my last.  There's no ""Wait"" ""w"" key function no fortify until healed ""h"" hotkey.  In fact many of the keyboard shortcuts you've come to love since civ 2 are simply gone.  They finally made a Civilzation title that introduces practically zero new fun game concepts and in fact has less units and gameplay than the previous version.   No more worker automation -- they only do 3 actions then die.   I would recommend getting Civ V as it's a far superior game and you really aren't missing anything with Civ VI.  If you thought missiles weren't fun, then this is a great game for you!  If you thought that Civ 5 was too hard to play and the AI was too smart, then this is the game for you.  Everything dumbed down.  This has the complexity of a mobile game with the price of a desktop.  What a waste.There are some frustrating gameplay omissions from Civ 6 which were present in Civ 5. I have listed some of them and also suggested several features which would be nice to include on a new game. The most frustrating is the technology tree essentially ending at Cold War era tech and not even progressing to the modern era. There's nothing new and exciting about this game, if anything it's Civ 5 with less features.You should be improving upon Civ 5, not removing units & gameplay. There are units which are implied, but simply missing. There should also be no excuse for not including MODERN Military units Example:•Missiles (for Missile Cruiser, Nuclear Sub, etc.)•Stealth Bombers (why is the highest bomber unit a B-52, this is unacceptable)•Stealth Fighters•Multiple Warhead ICBM's•Two tiers of Carriers, Nuclear Powered, and not. More air units in the modern carrier•Marines•Paratroopers•A-10 Ground attack aircraftMissing feature(s) which were essential to gameplay:•Airdrops•Automation of workers was nice, but I can understand the changeSuggestions for future units:•Missile Company•Floating Fortress (1984 style)•Mechwarrior future infantry•Hover Tanks•read a sci-fi novel and get imaginativeSeriously though unless I missed something, how is my civilization able to goto outer space, but they can't figure out how to have paratroopers.

""I'm just going to lead a peaceful game and win through science or culture"".....10 turns into the game.....Russia has launched a Surprise War on you! UPD1:With the new patch, I was playing on King difficulty and one of the turns the pop-up rumors said that Norway progressed from Classic to Renaissance era, while I was only moving to Medieval era the next turn. HOW?!I spent my anticipation for Civ6 playing Civ5, which I like a lot, so my review is going to be mainly based on comparison to it. Start off with the good things:Districts system. It's a very good approach to have a new way of city management in Civ series. A lot of Micromanagement. At first it seems too much, but then you get used to it. I love tweaking. Wonders. I love the way wonders now have requirements for the location it's built in. This prevents the style of a game where one player gets all the wonders. Animation. Units combination. It's really great to be able to combine units into corps and army, so you don't need to keep and control every single one of themMilitary support units. These guys add a whole new dimension to tactics in warfare. Game loading time. The initial loading takes much less time, which is great. More tasks for spies. Now they can do a lot of things like sabotaging production, ruining districts, stealing money, science, whatnot. Enemy spies can be incarcerated and later traded in.War weariness. Some may think it's a bad thing, but I think it brings balance to the game and makes you seek the way other than the war. But somehow this doesn't stop the AI. Now to the bad things: No ways to protect from nuclear weapons. There's no UN Council to ban them, no laser satellites to shoot them down, nothing. This forces a player to lead a military gamestyle only. I played multiplayer and was 3 turns away from cultural victory and this a***ole just nuked me. Your own spies in your city don't protect whole city, but only one district. And every few steps you need to reassign him, which is annoying when you need to protect your science endlessly. Edge-Scrolling. Because of the new bar at the top of the screen, you can't just move the point all the way to the top and  the map will scroll, but you gotta precisely point it slightly below the bar.All of these are minor flaws compared to what I'm going to write nextThe AI I dedicate whole paragraph to this concentrated essence of as*holery, programmed to ruin your day. The first two times I played the game, I wasn't really paying attention to AI behavior because I was busy figuring out new things and because I thought AI couldn't be worse than in Civ5. I was wrong. In short. The AI is very dumb, full of double standards and forces you into military play style. Yesterday before the patch I played as Norway on Prince difficulty (In Civ5 I played on Emperor pretty well). I founded a settlement on the coast next to the borders of city-state Kabul and another city not too far off. After 3 turns I come across Russian warrior who seemed like a nice guy. 15-20 turns later Peter conquers all nearby city states. (No way you could have an army capable of capturing a city state so early in Civ 5). So I was moving around my units WITHIN my own borders and Peter tells me I should move them away. In 3 turns he declares a war and he has a sh*tload of Horses. Luckily thanks to dumb AI tactics with units and good production I made enough units to match his powers. I was liberating Kabul from his occupation, but at that time Peter already had 4 of his own cities and 2 conquered city states. When he knew I was almost done, he offered some sh*tty exchange for Peace treaty. Only after I liberated Kabul did I agree to them.I already knew the AI is dumb so I kept army not far from his capital, which was swarming with barbarians due to low amenity after war. Neverthess, he brings a bunch of Apostles and destroys my religion. This was the last drop, I conquered all of his cities and in the end liberated one city-state. Yet still everyone except Scythia called me a warmonger. Not simply called me once, they keep spamming this ALL the time I play. Where's the logic in this?? Why the double-standards? He fights me, he's ok. I fight back, I'm a warmonger.Next, how in the hell can AI on Prince difficulty have EVERYTHING better than me?? Army 3 times bigger, far advanced science, religion and culture? It's okay, Classic and Medieval times according to history were indeed full of war, but there's no way to explain how AI can develop that far in such a short time. This is not a real challenge! I feel like developers were just lazy to write good tactics for AI and just multiplied score points by 3. Now, I've just played the game with a new patch and AI... AI never changes. I was on a lonely island enjoying peace when I met ships of Aztecs and Norway sailing by. Guess what? In 5-10 turns they declared war on me for no reason, both at the same time!!!. They sent troops from their islands to screw me up. 5-7 units from each side, while I had 1 warrior and 1 scout. Even if I wanted, I wouldn't be able to have an army equal to theirs by that time. And along with the army, all of the tiles in their territory were improved. Impossible! This game is simply imbalanced in terms of AI. This was when I gave up and decided not to play Civ 6 until it gets better. I hope...			"

												I realy wish Steam had a ""Medium"" Review choice.The game itself is amazing and fun. It did many things better than Civ V did. Read the positive reviews to see what's good. But now, I'll point out many things that bother me.- You can't rename cities.-You get no response when a new round begins.-When you enter a new ara, it only says the name in a small font.- There is no earth map.-Major problem: The AI is completly broken. You still can't trade with other Civs. I can't point out enough how broken the AI is. They'll denounce you for no reason. declare war on you, don't do anything for 10 rounds and then wish for peace.- City states will almost never upgrade their units, so they got archers while I attack them with tanks.- The UI is rather bad.- The minimap is completly useless and you can't see anything on it.- I don't like the new system of the social politics.- Fighting particles are a joke.- Some units only consist of 1 seeable unit, so about 3000 soldiers are represented by 1 man and a dog.TL;DRWait for a patch and then buy it.EDIT: The patch fixed some of it, but still not all of it. But now I reccomend it even more to you.			"

												1: The AI is cripplingly bad. Among other things it is overaggressive, mindless, and easily angered. Diplomacy is a slow burn of ""The AI all get madder and madder until it's war forever."" It's far worse than 5's, where you could form lasting alliances and didn't need to worry about braindead agendas such as ""Never ever ever touch a wonder or I'll hate you 5ever.""2: There's a myriad of UI and quality of life issues. The game is horrid at presenting information, some options and buttons are hidden by bad interface, and the Civlopedia is extremely poor compared to other titles. There's a ton of needless micromanagement with spies and trade routes, as simple things like ""put previous instructions at top of list"" from 5 are absent.3: People who bought the Deluxe edition are ripped off. Two of their 4 ""free dlc's"" were eaten up by Poland and the Viking Scenarios pack4: Steam SDK and Worekshop tools are missing. People who want mods, as well as modders in general, are frustrating on Firaxis' notable silence with regards to community support tools. Toss in other issues like no multiplayer teams and no LAN support			"

A good Game with flaws where it mattersTLDR: This game is good, stay away though if you hate bad AI, comic graphics or tedious repetetive actions in late game on huge maps.Positives Nice amout of features even without DLC yet Interessting over the top animations for leaders fitting the theme of the game It got more complex with more options to play and fiddle around with other than civ 5 which got dumbed down. Tons of valid playstyles and victory options that can lead unexpected outcomes A lot of fresh new ideas on how to make the game more dynamic, like agendas for AI a good overview of how interactions with the ai benefit you or not with a lot of potential (once its fixed see negatives) Nice music and a bunch of it Plays smoothly if you take the time to optimize for your hardware which can be done through the main menu 1 Unit per tile on steroids, a better system where you can combine units into groups that become basically a stronger version of the same unit type plus you can have support units on those units aswell. You have medics, generals, ramms and so on Beautiful city building idea with the district system that allows for optimization and planning your cities out like a maniac if you like to do so... :) if you dont, dont bother you can still get a decent city without all the perfect placement. Trading is fun, traderoutes create roads and tradeposts which can benefit you later by adding gold to traderoutes that pass by.  New road feature (this seems highly subjective) i like that you cant really build a road EVERYWHERE anymore. you have to plan. And its nice that the traders actually create those roads. Makes sense even today many roads in europe, asia and africa are based on ancient traderoutes.  Good ideas with the AI: Mass attacks on invasions, attacking in joint wars, helping out friends in need with war declarations when most needed to support, warmongering angers the ai and harms your relation with themNegatives AI !!! (there need to be way more ! behind this actually it is horrible to the point where it wont upgrade units at all, it wont delete outdated stuff to build more modern stuff, it just uses archers and warriors a LONG time. And i mean a long time, i have seen atomic age civs use warriors besides AT Crews. So they CAN build modern stuff but decide to keep 80% of their troops low tier. Spies: must be the most annoying feature in gaming history. And i am not exaggerating here. Example: Imagine playing a civ with 10 cities. Each city has a couple of districts spread unevenly around the city so not all districts are directly beside the center. Now a spy can cover only 1 field + its surrounding fields. Which means you need 4-5 spies to cover a city with a spread out district system. Or at least 1 for the center if you are lucky. Now that makes 10-50 spies just for counterspying. Now imagine the game forcing you to give each of them an order EVERY GOD DAMN TURN. Yup, thats how it works (i think its bugged but even every 10 turns is  too much) The way it should be is: Never ask for new orders unless told so. Graphics: no fan of comic style, but i can deal with it. Diplomacy is a mess. The ai has no clear concept of stuff that happens at their doorstep and stuff that happens on the other side of the world. On huge maps thats just lame. Why would China care about Germany on a regular Worldmap situation again? During Renaissance or before? Right they wont...but in Civ 6 they do as if they are your neighbours. Just bad!All in all it plays really fun. Its a smooth experience and its a solid release version with a couple of issues and bugs and some major gamedesign pain like spies. However if you tend to be the player that needs a PERFECT Game stay away. If you take a more relaxt stance its already nicely playable, fun and a good timekiller.Edit : 18.12.2016 ---After the patch the game got a lot more enjoyable. Yet the AI still is a piece of rotten garbage. It takes a little longer to steamroll it now, but if you really know what you are doing, it doesnt even matter too much. However for a casual approach to the game it should be some decent time killer now. Still the AI does not yet know what to do with its troops, it just doesnt.And thank god Civ is not one of those games where the trailer at the end matters... it is utterly utterly dissappointing.Oh yeah and spies are still a horrible mechanic, but you dont have to give them the same order over and over and over...any more. They seem to just sit where you send them. Which is good. Place and forget is about as much as you should be forced to do with this horrible spy feature			"

Product received for free
												I loved Civilization V. It was a great game to just casually waste time and think of new and inventive strategies that would enable your empire to the number 1. Unfortunately for Civilization VI, even Robbie Rotten can't teach you how to be number 1. Civ VI adds a lot of new ideas that change the way you look at a Civilization game compared to Civ V, but most of them fall flat. Pros:-The Graphics are greatly improved upon compared to the previous entry. It has a distinct cartoonish artstyle that suits the game well.-Districts. The district system is one of the few new systems that actually works well. It adds more variety to all of your cities, and allows them to make up for shortcomings due to placement. However, each district requires a certain amount of population, and for each district you make, the cost of the next one goes up.-Civic Tree. This system replaces the policies of Civ V. It works much the same as the tech tree, but with culture instead of science. You can unlock units, buildings, policies and new governments through this, and it adds alot more depth to the game.Cons:-Pacing. Due to the system of Eureka moments, granting you a boost to a certain technology or civic, you can discover new things far too quickly for your cities to keep up. It is a great idea, but it is implemented poorly.-Religion. Religion in Civ VI is the worst thing about this game. You are forced to make religious units to combat other religious units. There is no penalty for attacking the units with other religious units, and you cannot capture them with normal units. You can't even attack them with normal units without being at war. The aforementioned religious units will affect the religion of nearby cities based on the outcome of these religious engagements. This would not be a problem if you could attack the units with your own. It also takes far too many spreads to convert any city to your religion, regardless of wether or not it had a religion to begin with.-Balance. When playing Civ VI you have a choice of 4 civs: you can pick from Rome, Germany, China, and Poland(if you have the DLC). There is no reason to choose any other civ unless you are specifically going for achievements. These 4 civshave bonuses that completely unbalance the game in their favour.-UI. Civ V's UI was elegant and easy to understand. Civ VI's UI is a cluttered, complicated  mess.    - The Minimap is all but useless. It is far too small and offers little information. Cities are portrayed by large squares in        the territory, which block most of the already limited view you have.     - Religious view is just about as annoying as the rest of the religious system. When you try to move your religious unit, a filter is placed over your screen. It makes tiles affected by your religion white. When this is active you cannot see where your unit can go, because the movement indicators are a very similar light blue colour.-Movement. Civ V's movement system was fine. It worked. Civ VI's is annoying. there have been countless times where your unit has 1 movement point left, but it cannot move because of the terrain around it. You expect it to just end that unit's turn automatically because it has nowhere to go. but you will have to come back to that unit and tell it to skip it's turn. The same goes for roads. If my unit has 0.25 of a movement left, it should end the turn. In Civ V your turn ended if you went into rough terrain, like a hill or forest, because it used up all your movement points. In Civ VI you can move one tile normally, still have 2 movement points left, and no be able to go on a hill, forcing you to either go around or end your turn without using up all of your movement.In conclusion, Civ VI makes some very large strives in the name of innovation, but as with all innovation, most of it falls flat on it's♥♥♥♥♥ Maybe it will be up to par with Civ V after some much needed patches and DLCs to fix the many issues.This passage of time is what allowed for Civ V to be so great. In it's current state however, it is an unintuitive, overly complicated mess of a game. Only buy this if you are a hardcore Civilization fanatic.  "

												The game feels like it was rushed out.  For example, units have always had nuemerical value with their attack and production costs,  yet the descriptions we get are ""This is a unique land unit"".  The civilopedia  is a shell of its formerself; if you want to see what unlocks armadas or grants builders the ability to plant forests your best bet is to use Google.  The interface needs to be reworked;  if you want to cancel a move function you have to press escape twice (once to open the menu, once to close it).  Why can't we just simply press 'M' again to toggle off move? Not to mention the countless bugs. The game has an infinite gold exploit that most users will discover by accident.  The ai is easily manipulated and baited accross all difficulties.  There is no Earth map.  The only saving grace is that the new district feature adds a lot of fun to the game.  If you are on the fence about Civ VI spend your money on something else; atleast until they finish the game because right now it plays like a beta. "

												Really disappointing game.I've played every Civ and believe this one is the worst by far. AI is simply unplayable. Everyone is hostile to me regardless of my actions. In previously games diplomacy was interesting, whereas now I simply ignore it and accept I'll be attacked randomly even if there's no way the opposition can win.Units and building stop in the modern day, I miss having futuristic units.Cities are pretty boring to build now. I'm not a fan of neighbourhoods and find they really clog up the maps.Such a shame as I was really looking forward to this game. Hopefully they'll fix the AI at the very least. "

												The game is very disappointing. First of all, the interface is horrible. On the main map the tooltip system is just a misunderstanding. You don't know if the tile is improved or not and need to wait far to long for a tooltip. City screen, nightmare. City states menu, nightmare. Auto selecting units leads to many misclicks. No, no, no. Sometimes you need to click ""X"" to quit the screen, sometimes esc is working. To finish this missery, no ""start again"" button.  Second, the game. The pace of the game is much slower than before, I would even say lazy. Strategic resources? I played for 12 hours and don;t know what are they for. Religion? Useless. AI? Stupid as never before. Barbarians? Tons of them, but don't worry, they mostly just wonder around the map and run away if are hurt. Wonders? Mostly useless.Any goods?I would say that the new district system may have some potential, leading to more specialization of cities. Best news?They will probably publish a lot of patches and dlcs, so the game might change. "

												Civilization V and its two expansions have been widely embraced by both critics and players with good reason. The game is easy to pick up compared to other 4X strategy games yet it offers a rich ceiling of complexity that can occupy you for months. With Civilization VI, the long-awaited sequel, there's a natural question that comes when following something deeply beloved. How can it improve upon what was already so great? The answer is that Civilization VI doesn't needlessly throw out everything that worked in Civ V. Instead, it finds a brilliant balance between bold new ideas and a smart foundation built from previous games. These elements combine to produce not only one of the best strategy games of the year, but one of the strongest base games in the series.There's a surprising warmth baked into many elements of the game's aesthetic. The leaders of the 20 different playable civilizations are all distinct, charming, and occasionally humorous. Rather than strict and serious interpretations of historical greats like Teddy Roosevelt and Montezuma, Civ VI uses affable caricatures. While this has generally been the case with past games as well, the leaders are even more endearing in this iteration. Even simple interactions such as a condescending glance from England's Queen Victoria or a hearty greeting from Norway's Harald Hardrada give insight into their personalities. The grand cities you build up and the land you explore also look fantastic. There's just the right amount of splendor present when you uncover a natural wonder like the Great Barrier Reef or Mount Fuji. The ever-likable Sean Bean reads a quote about your discovery and the screen sparkles to indicate its grandeur. The wonders you build yourself such as Stonehenge or the Great Pyramids are even more remarkable. A short movie plays showing the structures being assembled bit by bit, making them feel appropriately special compared to your other buildings. In the modern era, skyscrapers glow in the night and various hubs shine with numerous buildings both helpful and magnificent. Progressing from a lowly prehistoric tribe to an advanced society is one of the hallmarks of the series and it's even more spectacular here. Yet it's not just a fresh coat of paint that makes Civilization VI worth playing. Overall, it's a more active game that encourages a high degree of deliberation from players. Perhaps the most monumental change is the addition of districts. Instead of simply tacking new things onto the city center, many buildings must now be built in the appropriate district. Each district has a particular focus, like a campus district housing buildings related to research, a holy site meant for religious constructs, and so on. What makes districts appealing are their bonuses. Depending on where you place a district, it may generate resources such as extra science or faith. All of the districts follow different guidelines for getting such bonuses. You'll often have to worry about whether the district is adjacent to a city center, mountains, other specialty districts, and more. Because these bonuses are so specific, it's important to be mindful not only of the current things you're building but of future development plans as well. It's a difficult thing to get used to and may intimidate fresh players, but districts ultimately make Civilization VI a better and more interesting game. Where you build something is almost as important as what you're building. Squeezing every bit of efficiency out of a city gives an appreciable advantage and it's satisfying to see your civilization skyrocket ahead of your opponents' as a result.What's going on outside of your cities is just as vital as what's happening within. Barbarians are no longer a mere annoyance but rather a significant and persistent threat, even on normal difficulty. These aggressive AI units spawn frequently and often have no problem raiding and pillaging the projects you've worked so hard on. Since barbarians can be so troublesome, you may regularly have to change your plans in order to address them. It's one of the many things in Civilization VI that can prompt a pivot in strategy, making the game unpredictable and engaging each turn. Barbarians can also be invaluable tactical tools. If they're at war with another civilization for instance, it may be best to leave them be in order to slow that civ's development.Culture has seen a dramatic reworking in Civilization VI and now it more closely resembles technology. Culture even has its own branching tree where players research new civics that can offer powerful benefits. Civics pave the way for new policies to choose from. The number and type of policy slots available depends on the type of government a player has. Something essential about policies is that they can be changed almost on the fly. Constructing a particularly time-intensive wonder? Slot-in a policy that will decrease the time it takes to build. Much like other aspects of Civilization VI, policies encourage you to pay close attention to what's going on and react accordingly rather than merely barreling down whatever plan you cooked up at the start of the game. Culture as a whole is more digestible and immediately impactful, making the reworking a very wise decision overall.It's possible to boost your progress with both specific civics and technologies by 50 percent through completing a variety of small tasks that feel akin to side quests. For example, in order to earn the boost for the early technology Bronze Working, a player has to kill three different barbarian units. It's obviously to your benefit to boost as many things as possible, but depending on your situation or starting location, that may not always be possible. You'll constantly have to decide which boosts are worth going out of your way for. These micro decisions may not seem all that significant on their own, but collectively they can shape the course of an entire game.Not everything in Civilization VI is as polished as it should be, and the AI can be the most frustrating failing. Each opposing civ has multiple agendas that guide their behavior. The first agenda is visible and consistent in every game while secondary agendas have to be uncovered by the player. To its credit, the AI follows these agendas closely, so it's not all that difficult to determine the reasons for its actions. The problem is that it will follow these agendas even when they’re illogical and unfavorable for the situation. Maybe this wouldn't be such an issue if the AI was better at fighting wars. In many combat encounters, it seems like the computer has absolutely no idea what to do, employing strange strategical moves or remaining alarmingly passive in the face of certain death. In spite of the numerous deficiencies, there were also times where the AI caught me off guard, such as sending in a legion of religious units to convert our cities to their ways and aggressively settling new cities in an effort to acquire valuable tiles. There’s enough to these AI opponents that I was never truly bored. It’s just after awhile certain erratic behaviors become more noticeable. Those who want to tax themselves against even greater opponents can dive into either online or hotseat local multiplayer.I could easily get lost talking about the details and systems of Civilization VI, but what's essential to take away is that this is absolutely a strategy game worth playing, regardless of your experience with the genre or series. Rarely are Civilization games so fully featured at launch. Future updates have a strong foundation to build upon, and there’s so much to explore in the meantime.			"

												A true strategy sequel that includes and builds on the strengths of the previous installment.Didn't plan to leave a review on this game, thought others already flooded this game with positive ones... I'm surprised.If you haven't played or know much about Civ V, then this review won't be much of a help.. most of the others won't be either.- There is Tourism and Religion in the basegame, which were monetized DLCs in case of Civ V.- The graphics changed. Some people make a big deal out of it, for me it depends on my mood... sometimes I prefer Civ V, sometimes Civ 6 (I recently played both games, and probably will as well).- The AI is questionable for sure (just like in Civ V), but it's not impossible at all to find challenge in defeating it. Just because it doesn't act the way you'd want it, or even logically, that doesn't mean it isn't serving its purpose.Regardless of what some other reviews imply, Civ V, Endless Legend, Endless Space and any similar game's AI can be really annoying, or can be abused hard. Humanity still sucks at creating AIs, deal with it.- The card system for Policies is actually pretty awesome, although it can be intimidating at first. You have to commit for a few turns, but it still remains flexible throughout the game.If you know what you want to do in the next 10-15 turns, the icons make is easy on you to find which card you need.- The new Culture-tree is also a nice addition...- ...especially with the Inspiration and Eureka moments which intertwine with every aspect of the game.There have been serious changes made regarding how you build your empire, I'll probably get a bit technical here:- The district system spices up the gameplay, city planning is more important than ever, which can be frustrating for new players and for everyone without experience.- Add to that the new Builders which I consider a huge negative. During development we were told that Workers would be changed in a way that they won't require extensive planning on how improvements should be built, which was a nice idea. Except with the new Builders you basically have to plan for the whole game, since they're expended when used. This also forces you to plan ahead (or risk wasting resources).- Certain Districts, Buildings and Wonders have serious pre-requisites (more so than Machu Pichu or Neuschwanstein), which guess what: forces you to plan ahead.Overall as good as those mechanics are in the last 3 points, combined they make it really hard for unexperienced players to play to the max, or even just try certain things. However they work really well if you know how and when to do what. These things go from very frustrating to awesome when you start paying attention.Additional thoughts:Extremely unlucky for Firaxis that their old game is still competing with their newest release. Look at it this way: they can't NOT develop a Civ game for 10-15 years, but it's also really difficult to make a clearly better game than Civ V.And it's impossible to meet every player's expecations.For Civ V lots of people paid 100€ or more, while they obviously can't charge that much for Civ 6 on release, yet players expect the same depth and possiblities... which the devs actually delivered. They implemented new mechanics, kept the old and good ones (from Civ V AND its 2 extensive DLCs) and made a game that might look very similar, but offers a quite different experience. That's the best they could do on a basegame release, and MUCH better than most other copmanies would do.It's yet to be seen whether we get TRUE DLCs, that aren't just new civs. No verdict on Digital Deluxe yet.Even without knowing those I recommend the base game.

												I made a joke review about this game a while back,so i decided to make a new one which is more serious. At the moment Civ 6 is very unbalanced. Remember how broken civ 5 was at launch, the same thing is happening with civ 6. I have been seeing alot of bad reviews and i simply must say this. Of course it's not going to be like civ 5! Civ 5 has got 2 expansion packs, 3 dlc bundles and 19 DLC's. Of course it won't have the same amount of content. Now i will adress some of the problems i've had encountered.                                                                                                             Problem 1: Civilizations declaring war and not sending troops (or sending only a small amount). This has happened 2 or 3 times to me, but that doesn't mean it's always going to be like that. Most of the time i see nations that don't like me moving troops next to my borders. Problem 2: Warmongering. Even after 1500 years of not declaring war i'm still denounced by almost all nation's i've met, because at 500 B.C i destroyed germany and france. It's just so dumb and frustrating as you can't even trade with them, because if you want 1 luxury resource they'll want 50 gold per turn , because they don't like you.Problem 3: AI comlimenting you for no reason. Ok so this isn't a big problem, it's more of an issue, but i just find it strange. Norway hates me, i build 1, i repeat 1 ship and they compliment me. Aren't they supposed to have a big navy? I've encountered this '' issue"" alot.Problem 4 : Call for aid. So in my playtrough my delcared friend asked to join his war against Spain. I utterly destroy him and Capture his cities, everybody including my delcared friend denounces me because i'm warmongering. It's just so dumb.And those are the major ( or at least what i think are major) problems.But it is still a fun game to play. If you don't want to spend 60 euro on this it's fine. And trust me when civ 7 comes out than its going to be the same. People saying buy civ 6 rather than civ 7, because it has alot more content, and civ 7 is broken. "

												First, I would like to start by saying I personally enjoy the game very much. Yes, the game has its flaws but what game doesn’t. Another thing I remember very well when Civilization V came out, gamers were complaining about that game too. But now they are telling you, you’re better off playing Civilization V and yes Civ V also had flaws per some gamers and supposedly you were better off playing Civilization IV, so you see the pattern. We as gamers are never happy and always complaining about a game. Civ VI is getting better, the developer is still tweaking the game. They haven’t abandon it. So yes, it should have been fix before launch, but the game is out and let’s just hope the tweaks they are doing fixes the flaws the games has which aren’t as bad as some people making seem. In short, the game is enjoyable and playable and if you love or are new to the series than I recommend you purchase Civilization VI. Good luck gamers!			"

												I have to say, I really wanted to like this game.  Between the AI issues that others are remarking upon and the difficulties associated with the new wonder placement rules, I just can't get into this.  The game steals and modifies the district placement rules from Endless Legend, but still restricts the size of city to the traditional Civ 24 plots.  The result is real difficulty growing your cities.  It isn't that the game is too difficult, it's that its more boring than previous Civs.  And I even liked the Beyond Earth game!  I do like the new culture tree innovation, though, and that the game takes so much less load time and has fewer spam messages from the AI.  Beyond that?  Meh.			"

												Very similar to the last Civ games,  they removed some features and added a whole bunch of others, and it only made the game more enjoyable, still wish they could add more pictures for lazy players who don't want to read a lot, and fix the menus by having bigger buttons to click on and stuff, as some buttons are a bit difficult to see.

												Civilization VI is a direct sequel to 2010’s Civilization V, a turn-based grand strategy game where diplomacy and managing your citizens is just as important as fielding a strong army and defeating your foes. It certantly lives up to it's name and with the improved gameplay mechanics and different graphical setting it's definetly worth picking up.It has a very big potential and already exceeds what I expected from it, in the end it's worth it.

												Things that i've noticed playing civ 6 so far compared to Civ V:-Looks so much ♥♥♥♥ing better, can adjust settings in game.-Government/policy system is entirely different.   -Instead of small individual policy trees it is one massive one unlocking policy cards   -You can use these cards as your government system it seems like you can have different systems that have different numbers of types of cards.   -This ""Civic Tree"" also unlock different things such as units, buildings and districts.-Both the Tech Tree and the Civic Tree have ""Boosts"" which majorly speed up the time to unlock them, for example if you find a natural wonder it makes Astrology faster.   -Seems like this will make the game much more strategic because you can use these to rush different techs.-City building is much more complecated (I think its better).   -Uses districts that are built on tiles, buildings are then unlocked an built on these tiles.   -Seems like cities expand faster and larger.   -There are more ""Appealing"" tiles to build on, don't know how this affects stuff.-Trade routes build roads as they travel to other civilizations.-The AI when you meet a civ is greatly improved and you have a short conversation with them-Different continents with somewhat randomly generated names.-""Lenses"" which allow you to see the map highlighting: Religion, Continent, Appeal, Settler, Government, Political, Tourism.-Happiness is different and is city based not empire based. I think its sort of renamed into ""Amenities""-""Online"" game speed which it says it 2x as fast as a normal game.-You can put pins on the map have some kind of strategetic advantage but I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what it is.-Religion is enhanced but I have only gotten a pantheon so far.-Loading times are infinitly better, no load into the main menu			"

												A game that, if it fixed the one major flaw, would be an easy recommend. Main issue: A.I. is beyond braindead. Each civilization you meet has an agenda you can see. It tells you that a certain civilization likes it if your science is superior to theirs or if they hate warmongers. The problem is, these agendas don't seem to matter. I've gotten declarations of friendship from civilizations I am directly going against their agenda while civilizations that SHOULD like me more for meeting their ""likes it when..."" agenda denounce and declare war on me. Now, this would be acceptable IF the AI understood what ""war"" is. My last game, I had both the Kongo and China declare war on me on the same turn with no actual provocation. Ok, however, 30+ turns later, I finally see China has sent its' army to attack me, still no sign of Kongo's armies. The problem goes even deeper here as China's ""army"" consists of two warriors. I easily repel China's pitiful display of force and they negotiate peace with me by giving me lots of money. During the same game, Russia declared friendship with me and one turn later declared war on me. The A.I. doesn't seem to have the ability to properly pursue goals so it blindly and almost randomly makes decisions. What little the AI actually pursues, it seems to pursue counter to what it pursues. Washington hates warmongers, so it declares war on me and not the guys with a warmonger penalty. IF Civ6 fixed the AI's issues, I would easily recommend the game, but as is it just isn't fun playing against an AI that is easily the worst AI I've seen in years.The less bad issues: UI The UI is alright, it's nothing stellar. I've still not found a good screen that shows detailed info about my Cities and I seem to run into problems as such. Diplomacy is needlessly slow (Leader says something, then slowly another menu appears in the lower left of the screen, then slowly another menu appears). Shortcuts for toggling the different map filters (showing best places to settle, etc) are placed in submenues (was a better system in Civ5 imo). The UI is hardly a deal breaker, it's functional, but it does have room for improvement. The good:Relatively few bugs. I've yet to really run into a noticable bug. Civilization 6: Complete edition! Civ6, unlike Civ5 or Beyond Earth, doesn't feel like a game that needs two expansions to make it a complete game, it's its' own game that will be improved by expansions rather than rely on them. Sound! I love the music in the game. It's just good music. The voiceacting is good (miss Nemoy though...). The indifferent:The art style. I'm not entirely sure how to feel about it. It's nice in some ways, but sometimes the art style makes it hard to differentiate certain terrains imo. I don't think it's bad, I don't think it's good. TL;DR: Don't recommend solely due to the braindead AI that doesn't know what it wants or how to obtain what it seems to want. Overall, a great game ruined by a single issue.			"

												A lot of steps forward, but as many or more steps back. AI is absolutely terrible, and will either be utterly steamrolled or pump out insane numbers of units and hate you from the start based on one 'step' up or down in difficulty. Entire difficulty comes from AI production bonuses rather than any sort of 'ai'.I like the way cities work, I like the unit selection (each unit gets a decent span of time where it is relatively dominant, etc.), but the game itself kind of sucks.Ignoring 'game' things, it is really lacking in UI and quality of life polish, though this may of changed in a patch since I last played.A very poor showing based on the pedigree and price point.

The total lack of realism takes a lot out for me and has overall been a HUGE let down in this game. To add on to that they seem intent on treating a loyal fan base like♥♥♥♥♥♥by chopping everything up into 5$ DLC. I will not be buying any more from this franchise until the Earth scenario is an option. Also do not intend on buying each civ for 5$...on a positive note; religion, trade, etc. has NOT been chopped up and appears all present in game.			"

												I feel like I should play this game a bit more before reviewing however I just cant. The game mechanics are somewhat good but have many severe problems as is evident by the many other reviews in this section even if these mechanics were great there is still one problem that persists. The god damned AI acts like no rational human being or a ♥♥♥♥ing living thing would ever act ever. Now I know people complained about the AI in civ 5 but it wasnt this bad and it was still playable and civ 5 had many other redeeming game mechanics that made up for it civ 6 apart from the government system, active science, and districts is essentially a direct downgrade to civ 5 and many of the redeeming features of civ 6 can easily be added as mods to civ 5 which by the way if you havent heard in its current state civ 6 cannot be modded through the steam workshop (this statement is now false as a recent update was released that included modding tools hooray!). The game has serious potential however like most games that follow the DLC model the developers purposefully have withheld content for releasing it in overpriced DLCs these arent new ideas sold in DLCs they are things that should be included in the base game. What developer can justify not only not releasing modding tools on launch but planning to put them in a DLC?   Conclusion: I ♥♥♥♥ing love the new mechanics however the rest of the game is a direct downgrade from previous versions and the game is being hurt by money hungry developers adding useless DLCs of content that should be included. Im gonna have to say no for now. If you really want a great 4x strategy game that releases sensible DLCs, communicates with its fanbase and takes regular suggestions from the community along with nearly monthly updates jam packed with content and one with a great modding community there is one game on the market for you, Stellaris which in my opinion is currently the greatest 4x strategy game currently available on steam, wait 2 or 3 years for these developers to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and play stellaris in the meantime I gurantee you will not be dissapointed in your choice of spending, also stellaris costs 20 dollars less and has much better content which gets constantly expanded through free content along with sensible DLCs containing meaningful additions so theres that too.

												A decent Civ game with a lot of room for growth (Definitely better than Vanilla Civ V).The more I play of this game the more I'm starting to realise that this game has quite a lot to offer, from the start the UI and Graphics may put some people off, but this game is still worth checking out.While there are a few systems I don't agree with such as the Micromanaging involved in cities (Housing and Amenities), Ruthless Barbarians and the Always Angry AI, I would still implore any fan of the series to give this game a fair chance before writing it off.From what I can tell the always angry AI issue does seem to fix itself later into the game, granted the majority of them remain unfriendly throughout the entire game, a few do seem to ease up and stop being less anal about small issues as time goes on, but overall I do feel the AI does need some improvements in order to make the game feel like a step up from the previous installment.This one might just be me, but the game does seem to have slight issues with the optimisation and issues do start to arise the longer into a session you get, but other than that the game runs rather smoothly. (There have been a few crashes for people I play with and the game does seem to desync a lot, however I'm not sure how common an occurance this is for other players, so keep that in mind)I really am a fan of the Government system, I personally feel it adds quite a bit of depth to the game and allows you to get some unique benefits such as being millitary units with faith that can really help to make a playthrough feel different than others.The Civics tree adds to this, by mostly giving you new Government policies to use, but can also get you new units or buildings similar to the tech tree. This is another welcomed addition due to the fact that it does add another aspect to the game that will differ from each playthrough.While I do have some gripes with the game, such as not being able to rename cities and having to micromanage each city you make, I do feel like this game provides quite the experience. Being around 30hours in right now I can safely say that this game is definitely worth checking out, while in some areas it feels a little lacking, in others the game has been expanded in a way that almost makes you forget about some of the issues. As well as this, a few of the issues I have with the game do seem to sort out the further into a game you get (such as Barbarians and the ever-angry AI).There are still quite a few things that this game needs to make the game feel complete, which is why I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price unless you're a diehard fan of the series as in its current state you'll really feel the need for more to be added to the game, however when hasn't this been the case with a brand new Civilization game?TL;DR - Great start with a few new systems to make for interesting gameplay, but definitely still needs a few more updates / DLCs to surpass Civ V with Expansions.

												The game re-introduces a lot of mechanics from the previous Civs, but is well balanced. It has also been slowed down, to better enjoy each era and its features. Game art is beautiful in all aspects: Map, cities, units. City-planning is now required due to the districts mechanic, meaning you have to make tough decisions.Overall, Civilization VI is a worthy sequel, as it has everything from Civilization V and more, furthermore, it's bugless.

												Civ 6 is DEFINITELY worth a purchase, just not quite yet. The GoodThe game has undergone massive improvements and built on the previous Civ's in only positive ways. It's visually pleasing, well voiced, intuitive in its interface and has resolved many of the previous idiotic issues the series had in the past - such as global happiness. It is by far the best state a Civ was released in the recent years and certainly a solid foundation to build on.The BadUnfortunately many of the - one would think - mandatory and essential mechanical informations about certain buildings or agents (even wonders) are only accessible through the in-game civ-pedia, rather than a mouseover and many of the early placement and development decisions will have late game consequences, which you will only learn about in the late game - in that aspect it requres a few playthroughs before you can fully optimize everything...The Ugly..But you really don't need to quite yet, the AI is the absolutely and utterly worst to date with regards to diplomacy and warmongering. Much like in early Total War games, your long-term friend and ally can decide - after a thousand years of peace and cooperation - to declare a war, despite there being no relation penalties. The wars and denouncements come out of the blue and seem to be largely tied to the difficulty, rather than any logical or reasonable system. It's not tied to the numbers the game shows at the relations screen, nor is it tied to personalities. They will demand tributes from you, as you are infinitely ahead, they will denounce you despite long lasting friendships and they will declare wars..And then the AI will get slaughtered due to complete ineptitude at actually handling their units near ANY terrain difficulty, be it a shore, a mountain or a city. To beat the game on deity, marathon in the first try is the testiment of just how moronic the AI is, the main difficulty of the game are - at the time of this writing - the bloody BARBARIANS.The first issue is easy to patch, the latter and more important one - AI - will probably take some time. Once that is done, you will have by far the best CIV to date. Before that, it unfortunately doesn't feel quite like a CIV, and more like a tower defense against bloodthirsty and mindless hordes with a broad research and development tree.			"

But everything else I might have said is overridden by discovering that I paid $80 for a game that's apparently going to ""$5 me"" to death for every new Civ that gets added...ESPECIALLY when the game still lacks some of the basic features that previous versions have had for 10 years.I'd really been looking forward to seeing the game progress and develop; now I'm just irritated and disappointed re: the money-grab.

												This game needs either so much work, or to be scrapped in favor of a new title. The Civ series is one of the best running game series in history, but this title is an absolute flop for me. Gone are the days of building empires and actually developing your nation before immediate aggression by asinine AI. Every iteration of the game the AI has grown more ridiculous in it's logic and arbitrarily gamified. Nations attack you for no reason at all, and when you try to appease someone someone else is completely hateful towards you as a result. Development of your empire is gone in favor of building little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nations of 5 cities. Oh and if you want to expand you're apparently a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥for building towns anywhere on the map. If you take offense and fight back against jerks, you're labeled a warmongerer. I swear the devs have found a way to inject the most skeptical interpretation of history and politics I have ever witnessed in game form. I'm all for a challenge, but this game simply isn't fun and has forgotten it's roots. I know we all want innovation and change, but Civ Revolution is what this steaming pile of garbage is modeled after, and that is the wrong direction for the series.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game. And one day I hope I can rewrite this as one. But as the game stands right now, I just can't. Let me be clear, this is still a fun game. I do enjoy it. But it's not worth $60, because there is one major flaw that severely impacts gameplay. That's the diplomacy. It's just god awful. As soon as you go to war, every other civilization in the world will hate you. I get war DECLARED on me, I take one or two cities from the aggressor, and bam. I can't deal with anyone for the rest of the game. And at war, the enemy AI is very stupid. I've never had a challenging war. The rest of the game IS fun, but the diplomacy just detracts so much from it. It makes it a flawed product. I'm sure it's going to be fixed one day. Do yourself a favor, and wait for that day. Or wait for a sale :)			"

												Civilization 6 has all the fun of Civ 5 but its base game this time, it definitely makes the harder things of Civ 5 look easy, which is good I'm always looking for a Challenge. I love the art style for Civ 6 and I've only logged 2 hours so far.. 200 turns would be mid game in Civ 5, but in Civ 6 its only getting started. ;) This game add so much to the Civ series GG Sid Meier you did it again.

												I'm pretty surprised that there are any negative reviews for this game. We've lost basically nothing from Civ 5 and gained some really fun features like districts and eureka bonuses. They totally change the game in a good way. I haven't noticed any bugs, annoyances, or problems either and I play on a mid-range laptop.This is a great game, and it's only going to keep getting better as new content and updates come out.			"

												     The game isn't that bad and at least now, with multi player, you don't have to play against one of the stupidest AI ever programmed.     On the other hand, the ""Deluxe Edition"" pricing is a total scam. I saved a full $1.49 and got 4 DLC I wouldn't have bought cause there's nothing new in them, just civs and maps.    And now they add a new ""bundle"" where yous save 0% on both items. Wow! Do you understand that a bundle means price reduction or extra content !    So unless you can get a real rebate, I recommend you play Civ V, at the moment it's better and even with all extra content cheaper then Civil VI "

												I rarely leave reviews but I wanted to leave a review for this game. I really tried to like this game and I think it COULD be a good game however in its current state I cannot recommend this game. My main issue like everyone else is the AI is really bad and overagressive. I've been denounced for just minding my own buisness and I've become a warmonger for defending myself against having another civ declaring suprise war against me. Every playthrough I just raise an army to defend myself because I have never played a game that I didn't have someone declare war against me, even if I was following their agenda which is supposedly supposed to make them like you. I've actually never even finished a single one of my playthoughs because the constant onslaught of units towards me just gets repetative and boring because I'm usually much stronger than them. Again, I think this game could be really good, they just need to fix a lot of issues with the AI also as well as bugs I've encountered here and there while playing. But until they address the issues I cannot recommend getting this game and honestly, I really just want to get my money back so I can buy a much better game.			"

												so i really liked civ 5, and i say civ 6 was on sale, so i got it. really stoked i booted it up, and started my first game. i put it on settler of course, since there were a lot of changes and i figured i should learn those changes in a peacful enviroment. oh lord, was i wrong. on settler, the easiest diffuculy i would be at war within 100 turns. civs would either bombard me with troops or apostles. this made the game almost impossible with civ 6 having just vicious barbarians. they flood into your country without mercy. this makes it almost impossible to deal with keeping your civ running smoothly, with wother civs riding up your a$$, and barbarians running around with battle ships. of course if this wasn't god damn settler, then this would be fine. when i play settler i want the ai to be equal to a brain dead monkey, i just want to learn the game pls without someone blasting me by turn 50. this was my biggest problem in the game. the ai is just stacked on the ♥♥♥♥ing settler. plus deplomacy is messed up too, all the civs seem to be on a hair trigger. one of my biggest gripes about this system is there is no way to tell other civs to stop converting your population. i was sitting there trying to get a science victory, then a army of apostles flooded into my country, ok ill just tell france to quite it. nope, there is no option to say stop, but the dumbest thing is, they can do it to you. i dont know if this is some weird glitch oir bug, but its really frustrating. besides that the game is pretty good, the level of detial is insane. every little thing is constructed with so much care (except the ai diffuculty). the music is great too, when i played as peter i was plesantly met with kalinka playing. but as you go from era to era, the single instrument diddy turns into a monstrous orchestra. fix the broke ai, besides that, its a great game.

												I don't like it...And it's not because it's magically got less content then the Dlc's of Civ 5... No it has that kind of content...It is still less than Five...for a number of reasonsThe Huge map... is probably about as big as their either medium or Large on Five... The Civs are all Clusted Together in such a way as to cause Conflicts almost right off the bat (even removing some civs doesn't stop this). You Can't built outward in a good way... IE you can't have the 3 Square limit on your cities usually unless you're on an island by yourself (which happens rarely), because the AI... LOVES plopping cities down within 2 squares of each other.... and WILL do it aggressively. You are almost never positioned optimally so that you can grow, you are almost always near a desert. Oh and the other Civilizations will ALWAYS hate you, at least in 5 they don't hate you unless they live next to you, you're a war monger or you built wonders they want...and the Wonders are a lesser issue. in 6 China hates you because you build ANY wonder, Barbossa of ahem ""germany"" (which Barbossa is NOT The King of Germany but the Holy Roman Empire at a time when it included not just Germany but Italy, the Dutch/Belgian Lowlands and and the Czech Republic.) hates you if you envoy a citystate.... and it has more with you than him or at all, which happens AUTOMAtically.... Cleo if you have less armies than her, Russia if you aren't ahead of them in Science and Culture (which they try VERY hard to stay in front) Arabia if you aren't of his Religion... Spain if you're on another continent OR not of his religion...Rome if you have less armies than him... They always have two reasons to like/dislike people and you'll always at least have one, probably both, and if they don't like you they wont accept your embassy so they can't be raised higher.			"

												Micromanaging in Civ5 was fun, Micromanaging in Civ6 is complete frustration.The game is just not fun, no matter which race i pick or what start i get something will either get so tedious its not worth the effort anymore or just become so slow and boring that you have nothing to really look forward to and just keep spamming end turn until you win, no point rushing a certain building/unit//policy because they all feel useless with no game changing benefit that couldn't be replaced by another tile improvement, same with distracts, i would rather have the resource that coincidentally is in the only viable location.The only decent buildings are end game but i can't keep putting in 200 turns of torture for 50 turns of fun, it just is not rewarding enough in this game, i feel like i am wasting my time every game. Wonders look pretty good but seem a lot less powerful and if you are building one and someone else builds one YOU DO NOT GET THE HAMMERS REFUNDED THIS TIME meaning you really do just wake 20-30 turns.Everything about this game is just designed to be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥rather than fun, i hope to god mods can fix this catastrophe.

The core new ideas are very solid, but this was not ready for release.			"

												It's like the other Civilization games, except with a cluttered, messy map and UI. Some people are talking about it having 'mobile' game graphics, which is pretty unfair, but I can see the point. I just think the art style and interface design kind of works against you as you try to play. The esthetic is almost an obstacle to the actual playing of the game.All the familiar stuff we like about Civ games are here. It's a pretty faithful iteration of the things we enjoy about the franchise, but for reasons I can't quite explain, it left me wanting to play earlier versions; and then it left me wanting to play Stardew Valley's new patch. I'm not trying to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥about it - but on the face, I'm not sure there's enough innovation here. Full disclosure, I have like 500 hours logged in Civ 5, so I'm not just trolling...I'm going to keep hacking at it to see if there's some hidden charm  that justifies the hefty price I paid for this, but for now I honestly can't recommend it.*EDIT*Well 15 hours in and I think I'll stick with my original assessment. This isn't a bad game, it's just not a must play at release game. If you've played the hell out of Civ 5, you're not going to find much wow factor in Civ 6. I'll try again in a few months.			"

												This is by far the worst strategy game i ever played. I have been playing Civ IV and V for a long time now, and i really must say this is dissapointing. i started playing civ VI on a laptop when i was 8 years old, and it was my favorite game for a long time. then, some years later i picked up on civ V, which is  one of my favorite games today. I bought Civ VI in digital deluxe prerelease bacause i hoped it would be a great game.when i played it, this is what happened: i spaned in, got accused by all the AIs for things i did not do, got invaded (which ended with 2 AIs dead) and won a science victory by flying to mars. besides the fact that this is basically the same game as Civ VI, except more boring and repetitive. the one thing i hate most is moving units. in civ V you could just ""use"" terrain to cross hills without a real movement penalty (going  over an open tile to a mountain). In civ VI, even the scouts get major movement penalties simply for walking through a forest.If your looking to buy a great strategy game, buy civ V, civ VI is barely a strategy game. its a build-a-city-and-get-denounced-radomly-by-AI game. seriously, i wish i could give this game a better review. Huge dissapointment.			"

												Well, here it is... It is a good game after all.Pros:- pretty graphics- more decisions to make (2 Tech trees)- settlements have to be well planned, due to future improvements (wonders and districts ""eat"" a tile)- easy to learn if you already played Civ VCons:- KI declares war too fast and for almost no reason- the camera doesn't follow the units on automatic movement (as in Civ V)- unexpected camera-hopping leads to a lot of misclicksSo far it's a nice improvement compared to Civ V. It is a bit more complex but not too much. I hope there will be a KI fix.The base game should be enough to test it.			"

												A good Civilization game, evolved from Civilization V, with great mechanics on a bad implementation.I liked a lot the addition of districts, cards and differentiation of social and science advancement trees. I also welcomed the new religious victory condition (even if it's kinda flawed, will write about it later).On the other hand the new graphic style and the lack of “penalties” for large empires (the game actually forces you to rush creating new cities in your empire, will write about it later) dragged things a bit down for me.So, in detail, the overall mechanics of this new Civilization game are very good, overall positively evolved from Civilization V, but since the game forces you to rush on city building you get a few very bad side effects:Capturing cities feels like a joke, for example you may end up capturing 10 to 15 cities in just a few turns with no real side effect on your empire.For the same reason (too many cities) religious victory condition is a mess, you will see 3~4 priests per city battling (yeah… that is lame) for religious supremacy which is beyond annoying.Again for the same reason it's just easier to colonize to get certain resources rather than initiate trading with other empires or trying to acquire influence over state-cities.To get you the idea, totally forget about Civilization V Enrico Dandolo play style, it's just impossible with the current state of the game.Something I was worried about, because so many people pointed that out, was bad AI, but I have to say that in my 2 games AI was quite good, just a bit too aggressive, in everything (e.g. Teddy building a city in a tile between two of my cities, ending up with a oblong, space crippled city or Hojo declaring war just to move through my territory).Finally I have to say that at the moment leaders offer you a little bit of variance only at the very start of the game, middle and ending phases of the game are more or less the same whichever leader you get to play: huge empires, fought at least two or more wars, fairly high in all compartments (science, culture, etc).Would I recommend this game, yes, no doubt about it, but don't get it right now, wait till a few DLC are out (or even better a GOTY edition “final” pack) because there are both “flaws” and lack of diversity at the moment.

												I've played Civ series since the first one and it used to be my favourite game. Now I can tell that it doesn't get any better, actually even worse. New great graphics or 1 good new mechanic does't make the experience any better, when the AI is probably at the same level of development as it was in 90's. To put it simple, the game is very unchallenging, boring and I think it is the first one I actually felt that I am wasting my time playing it when I could be doing more interesting things. Everything comes down to terrible AI.Thanks to the awful AI, Civ 6 gives you only an impression that you have many different tools and that there are many layers in the game but in reality you could be playing against a one arm bandit machine with the same results. AI is basically taking out all the fun from the game. Civ 6 is like a very old laptop put into a new case - new look, with some extra bells and whistles but it is the same old engine. Therefore I feel cheated after paying for this expensive game that doesn't bring much new to the table.Pros- Great new graphics- Newly introduced districts mechanic is very refreshing and I liked it a lot (however it does require some fine-tuning)- City-states mechanic feels better than the previous one (not sure if people will agree though)- New division between social policies and science discoveries is also refreshing and interesting- Regular trade system feels ok (through traders)Cons- All of the above is ruined by terrible AI. The  difficulty level doesn't change much and is the same as it has always been (read: pointless, not working as intended, i.e. not increasing difficulty). It doesn't matter how many guns you will give to a blind person, he/she is still blind!-  The game doesn't feel like tested or balanced. While playing you realise that all the excitement comes from the new cover and there is no real new content (with some exceptions that don't change the overall experience).  - AI during  war is suicidal  and doesn't mater how big army it has. It will send at you any random units, in any random order, disregarding everything that happens around. You have a huge navy parked near his city? It will embark land infantry to sail to/near your battleships. Sometimes I got an impression that AI actually tries to fight my navy with embarked land units (like cavalry). AI will almost never build planes or use them. The usual problem with AI developing in such a way that it is very hard to have a proper war using units from the same era. AI seems to never upgrade units, so expect the usual nonsense battles between pikemen and tanks. Changing speed of the game didn't really help with that (maybe unit queues are still too long? or it just comes down to stupid AI).The whole concept of diverse military units is broken, when AI doesn't know how to use artillery, air strikes, close combat units etc. It just doesn't care what it uses, in which order and how. AI will come into my territory, get hit, pull back, come back unhealed, die without reaching a target. Honestly, it is very hard to imagine what the target could be, because AI moves seem so random. It will randomly embark and disembark units continuously when trying to defend its city (?). It disregards everything: position of my units, their type, number, strength, the target they are hitting etc. I could go on and on giving many examples but the bottom line is that fighting against AI is boring and gives you no satisfaction whatsoever. - Diplomacy is as bad as it used to be. Absolutely pointless part of the game, filled with ridiculous mechanics. Doesn't matter how hard you try, you will almost always end up being hated by almost everyone around. Deals? If an AI player doesn't like you (soon or later it will happen), it forgets about any economy logic and offers so ridiculously expensive deals that they are not worth it. I understand ""good"" vs ""bad"" deals, but AI seems to be going off the scale like a lunatic. It will have 0 economic power, 0 army and ask (demand) many valuable resources for free. Why? Because it doesn't like. Why? Because you haven't built any plane yet, or something stupid like that, or because you got involved in a war, for which it will hate you for 1000 years. Luxury resources seem to be an important part of the game (keeping society happy) and I see how diplomatic deals could be important here but in the current state diplomacy is almost useless. Alliances bring no benefits, except for some minor trade routes bonuses.-  City placement is as bad as it was. Again, AI ignores geopolitical situation. It will build a city, which wont develop much as it is taking those few hexes in the middle of my cities. It just doesn't care that it is settling its people in the center of my lands, i.e. the area surrounded by my cites from each side and while doing so it cuts me off my road. Later I cant transport my units, because AI decided to build a city blocking any road to it. Maybe create 2 different levels of settlements?, so that razing (removing) one doesn't cost you ruined diplomatic relations for the eternity. However, fixing logic when creating new settlements should take the priority.- Spy... so you can have only few spies in the game and when they get caught you have to pay (make a deal) to get them back. Otherwise your ""spy slot"" will be occupied for the rest of the game and you will never be able to replace it with a new spy. So all you need to do is to catch all enemy spies and never let them leave your prison. Catching a spy is not such a hard thing to do and even if it was, still this mechanic is plain stupid. Catching a few spies = no espionage ever... oh my, so real. There should be a price for losing a spy but keeping him in a prison for eternity is a stupid idea. - Culture victory usually happens much before you can profit from modern wonders and buildings era bonuses.. well unless you set the starting era to be much later.- AI seems to be spending fortune in gold buying Great People. It seems to be obsessed with them and rarely waits for the points to accumulate.There is too much of this stuff, so I finish here... - very disappointed civ fan. "

												For me, the thing killing the game (we're all used to the awful AI during warfare, common to all civ games) is the small map. Even on ""huge,"" the map is nothing compared to the vastness of all the preceding civ games. For me, the large map made gameplay and exploration much more interesting and varied.  The second thing I don't like--the barbarians. OK, it's cool that they scout out your territory and come back in force if you don't deal with them in a reasonable time. But nothing will match the barbarian civilizations that occurred in Civ IV--I guess a feature never to be repeated, they just squat in their tiny camps and grow military units (except for the occasional 'builder' you can capture.  The city building, with districts preceding construction of buildings (like you must have an entertainment district before you can construct an arena or an industrial district before you can construct a workshop, etc) is a good feature and makes the city growth more interesting.  Still, the maps and the barbarian implementation kinda kill Civ VI for me (a little less than 200 hours playing), making me think I'll just return to Civ IV and Civ V for my periodic civ fixes.			"

												So I played Civ 5 for a long time, more then 600 Hours. After nearly a year I finally managed to get my hands on Civ 6. But after nearly 100 Hours I can safely say that i'm going back to Civ 5. I started playing casually on Warlord (easy) difficulty. As I expected the AI was dumb and simple, declaring war only to never follow through with them and asking for peace when I show any sign of retaliating. So, seeking a more interesting game I switched to Prince (normal) mode. Before long I faced an endless barbarian army that seemed to be spawning every turn, and AI leaders that declare war on me for mostly no reason. I am not some hardcore gamer and enjoy a nice and relatively simple game that Civ 6 simply doesn't have as it only has no challenge or unbeatable opponents. So if you wanted some simple challenge that you can enjoy while still needing to be thoughtful, I would not waste time with this one.			"

												As someone who has put in almost 300 hours into Civ 5, I was very excited to play the next installment of Civ. When the initial gameplay showcases were released, I was instantly against the art style and the direction that the game was taking towards looking more cartoony and the exaggeration of the leaders. The change in art style actually led me to wait to hear from the community and friends if the gameplay was good enough to overlook the art style and if the game itself was an improvement from Civ 5. After 30 hours, I can honestly say it is. It took a couple of hours for me to finally get used to the art style, and a large reason for this is because the actual game is good. Nevertheless, the game is not perfect. The UI, in my opinion, feels more disorganized than Civ 5 and it does tend to clutter the screen, especially in the later eras of the game. However, the game is overall an improvement from Civ 5 and I do not regret my decision to buying this game. TL;DR Pretty good 7/10 would buy			"

												Its some what fun but also frustrating at the same time.Pros, I personally enjoy the new art style I also really love the new mechanics with distracts and various other things makes you rely on strategy and future planning of your city. I LOVE the new city state mechanic its such a big improvement. The barbarians are also more of a risk early game and I love that as well. Con, AI is terrible I don't understand how we can go to CIV 5 to CIV6 and take a step back.Also they starting positions of Civs near you even on a huge size map it really ridiculous however you can edit in the game file. *They start insanely close* Most likely to speed up the game.

 I had 4 Civs go to war with me over litterly nothing some of us were even Allys.Meh- I really don't like the new research tree where you can boost it by doing various things, again they most likely did this to speed up the game but I can get over it. They also don't have very many options when it comes to selecting #number of city states and ect.If they fixed the AI then I could probably recommend it but seeing as I play single player 99% of the time this is a big issue for me. Hopefully they fix the issues with the game although I expect to save this game they will do what they did with Civ 5 and throw a $DLC$ with all the changes we want.			"

												It seems releasing unfinished games at full price is the new business plan for major gaming companies.This guy is a buggy, unbalanced mess looking back now I should have listened to all the reviews saying buy civ 5 with all the dlcs instead of this one.Everything wrong with civ 6-Broken game: Been playing perfectly for 3 days and now all of a sudden civ 6 crashes my entire laptop randomly during games and yes I have turned off windows defender and windows firewall.-AI: This has been mentioned already by quite a lot of reviewers so I wont go into this too much but basically dont play singleplayer if you are looking for a challenge.-Multiplayer: If you plan on playing multiplayer with randoms be prepared to never finish a game or only strive for domination victories, also when searching for games you can only see games in your download region instead of the whole world, I think this is a steam thing though.- Balance: Religious victories might as well not exist since when facing competent players you will need to use domination strategies to spread your religion and faith in general is one of the least valuable resources in the game.- Melee is the weakest class in the game right now since cavalry is has everything melee has and more and ranged units have range [suprise,suprise] and dont suffer retaliation damage.-Razing vs Capturing: Unless you cant hold the city or dont want to suffer war monger penalties[which are not that high btw] there is no reason to raze a city you captured.-On that note it is much more beneficial to spam a bunch of cities than to have a few really strong ones. [Wide vs Tall]General Issues: Why does a game that looks worse than civ 5 take up more of the cpu?- Why can cavalry use siege equipment?-Why does the game constantly hide information from you. Example: The eureka for irrigation is to farm a resource. For a player new to civ this was one of the hardest eurekas for me to get until I looked it up on the internet.What it should be ""Farm a BONUS resource"" simple easy fix.-In addition to paying 60 Euros/Dollars for this game you will also need to spend 5 more everytime they release a new leader/Civ or what Firaxes calls ""dlcs"" and since it seems like each civ can have 2 leaders, thats a lot of 5$ ""dlcs""I can go on and on but you get the point.The most infuritating thing about civ 6 though is that this has the potential to be the greatest strategy game of all time yet it seems like Firaxes doesnt give a damn about this game.I got this game at 50% off, I still think I was cheated buy civ 5 and wait until Firaxes gets their crap together before buying this.

												I love Civilization, and have played hundreds of hours across IV, V, and BE. I was extremely excited for Civ VI and started playing just after the game was available for download. I started on the Earth map which looks pretty good, but not great, and got to experience the amazing new districts, the pleasant environment, and a very in-depth diplomatic environment with the new agendas feature. The only immediate problem I had was the interface not always responding when I click on something, i.e., telling a unit to move to a spot and the line showing his path just stays there, while the unit doesn't actually receive a command. I figured these bugs would be solved with time and I could bear playing with them.But as the game progressed, extreme issues became prevalent. Any war at all meant everyone hated you for the rest of the game. This goes for the AI civilizations as well, so by the time you reach Swordsmen, everyone hates everyone and will declare war at any time. There is no diplomacy, at all. Spies can steal money you don't even have yet, causing your military units to disband while you watch helplessly as your next turn is still loading (even if your net income is positive). There was a lot of hype about how this game wouldn't require that you plan ahead so much like previous Civilization games, but that you could build your empire as it flows with the game's progression; that is not at all true. With the heavy production costs of districts, the population limits on districts and the need for both housing AND amenities, and then the careful usage of land space, specialization is practically required.Overall, I look forward to the future of this game, but I judge it unplayable as of now. When the Steam workshop comes out, I hope some mods will help what isn't already patched by then. I would highly recommend not purchasing this game until a later date, or unless it has a really good sale.			"

												The UI is incomprehensibly bad. I've never seen so many different screens and overlays with so little information. Also, like a lot of big budget games, this suffers from long loading times and bloated sluggishness all around, regardless of hardware specs.I'd really really like to love this game, as I have Civs 1 through 5. Like its recent predecessors, maybe this will also improve with another $50 worth of expansion packs and DLC. Still, the bugs and poor design choices make me wonder if anybody actually tried playing this game before they sent it out the door. The AI is pitiful. On the harder difficulty, there are just more units and more cities, bu making the same facepalm decisions. The wealth of new diplomacy options just makes the AI deficiencies more apparent. And for all the detail poured into the animated leaders and foreign language voiceovers, you'd think somebody would have noticed that the actual gameplay sucks.And c'mon, isn't it about time we had an 'undo' button in case I accidentally march my garrison out of my capital just as the enemy surrounds it? What with the buttons scattered all over the screen, this is not so uncommon. Actually, I'd rather just let em have it than load the autosave and have to listen to Sean Bean go through that exact same intro yet again. A lot of the mechanics are new and interesting, yet poorly documented. Be prepared to spend some time on civfanatics.com if you want to differentiate between the ones that are truly broken and the ones you just aren't understanding properly. No small number of government civics just flat out don't work, but the descriptions are so vague, you'll have to wade through pages of forum posts to figure that out for sure. Maybe I'm just getting old, but it feels more like a chore than anything else. Occupy yourself elsewhere for now and check back next summer.			"

												I'm pretty astonished at the kind of stuff people leave in Steam reviews.The AI is no better or worse than Civ V.  It's definitely not great, but it never has been.  On the whole this iteration seems like Civ V vanilla plus some improvements, I'm honestly not sure what the complaints are about...The new city building mechanic is great, the districts are a nice addition as are the changes to happiness.It really seems like the only thing people can find to complain about is the AI or the graphics (if you watched literally any trailer on the game before you bought it, why would the graphics surprise you?)People with 100+ hours giving the game a ""do not recommend"" ?

												Unfortunately Civ VI has proven to be yet another step backwards for Sid Meier. The AI players are completely irrational and bipolar. Even on Settler difficulty every Civ I encounter declares war on me!! Even Gandhi declared war against me (on Settler) and he was on a completely different continent!! I didn't even have any units or cities on his continent!The graphics are also very cartoonish.			"

												Civilization VI has the potential to be a great great game. Maybe the greatest one. A lot of welcome new features and gameplay improvements. Beautifull. And that’s the reason why there are so many good review. At first glance it’s very good.But… it has a major unacceptable flaw : a totally messed up AI. I won’t make a list here of all the problems noticed, but it totally breaks the game. The AI is completely uncapable of wagging wars, sends 10th of unit at you. But they are not upgraded and move around your cities without attacking. (this is 1 flaw, there is much more…).You can easily win at the highest difficulty level, just knowing that you have to build early a decent army (archers), resist the first attack of enemies (easy if you built the archers because the AI doesn’t know how to attack). And then it’s finished, it’s a walk in the park till the end game…So here I have to give a negative review because the game is broken, no challenge at all, uninteresting.			"

Its so crappy compared to 5. It feels like this game was designed for mobile or something. It feels lazy. I REALLY wanted to like this game. I was so stoked to play it at first but here I am requesting a refund. "

												The best 'Civilization' game  - since 'Civilization II' (that is, to say nothing of the bugs). And that easily means the best strategy game in 20 years!In my opinion. with the sole exception of 'Sid Meier's Civilization' of 1991 itself, 'even' Civilization projects seem to be far superior to 'odd' ones. 'Civilization II' was just great - it still plays and even looks much better than many modern strategies!'Civilization III' had some interesting gameplay ideas, but terrible looks and tiny and colorless units and everything.'Civilizaition IV' featured excellent visuals, but stripping usual features in favor of separate add-ons was really a bad idea.'Civilization V' had the most innovations in the series, but here we again had a number of paid DLCs and addons - and that plain black style of the graphics and the interface was quite ugly for my taste.What I liked in 'Civilization VI':* The visuals. They are now as bright and cute as they had never been before! You feel as you'd want to lick the buildings and the units :)* The leaders. Yes, they are best-looking (and even almost historically true-looking) since, well, the first and probably the second game!* The completeness. No major feature is stripped down in the original vanilla edition, wow!* The districts. Great idea, actually - even if it is the only major innovation. Not just seeing a city growing randomly, but laying out its urbanizaton by hand is extremely satisfactory.Well, bad things:* The bugs, of course. Yes, it is a very big game, but it still could have been tested and proof-read better. I had my load of CTDs and freezes, and some Russian texts surely need some editing. Still, I have no complains of AI - some leaders are stupid, some are treacherous, some are plain weak. Just like in real-life politics, you know.* Some interface drawbacks. Where is the good old list of all my units?! I have a crowd of writers and painters who are waiting for the next amphitheatre to be built - and how am I supposed to find them scattered all over my little big empire?! And when Pericles declares a sudden war on me - how can I gather all my military who have not fought anything else than idling for many centuries? I am not even sure they will add it in future patches...* Well, this complain relates to every 'Civilization' game since II, but I would still love to see something like 'Palace' from 'Civilization I' or 'Throne Room' from 'Civilization II' again! Much better than just a boring statistics screen. And what about getting back screens with real people rioting or celebrating 'We love our Ruler' days?! Oh, forget it - they will never give us back that joy unfortunately.Of course, it would be blasphemy not to recommend 'Civilization VI' to everybody - especially if the bugs would be finally corrected!

												Having played all the games in the Civilization franchise, I've never been as disappointed or frustrated with a Civilization game before as I am with Civilization VI. I had expected something more from a game that claims to have a new game engine and add a lot of features on top of Civilization V.Not only does the game completely fail to add anything, that wasn't a part of Civilization V, it even keeps all the frustrating elements of Civlization V. In some respects, I think, the frustrating elements have only gotten worse.For example, I've never enjoyed City States and routinely play Civilization V without them. Starting a game without them in Civilization VI is not even an option. I strongly disliked them because they were too easy to farm XP on for units, and the bonuses you got for courting them were far too strong. The XP farming hasn't been fixed and the bonuses are now even more powerful.Another example is the Diplomacy options: While animated leaders with native voiceacting could have been a nice touch, both Civilization V and VI fails to follow through, since the audio doesn't match the text on screen. That the other world leaders are even more random and psychotic than in Civilization V, does not help either. The illusion, that you are negotiating with a human, fails horribly when wars are declared or ended for no reason or any reason and the animated leader you're talking to is saying something different than the subtitles (or is saying nothing). Furthermore the world leaders will nag you incessantly for any reason they choose. You can decline their offer of peace for a 100 times in a row, but they will still nag you for peace every 5 turns (no kidding!) if they're loosing the idiotic war they started for no reason.Third example: Religion still functions in much the same way. The different beliefs and their mechanics are even identical to the ones in Civilization V, as are mechanics for spreading the religions, actively with preachers and passively through proximity and trade.Actually, to be fair, the game does bring a little news to the game. The mechanics with city districts and wonders being placed on the map makes the city building a little more interesting, but in my opinion it gets completely drowned out by the fact that the worst elements of Civilization V is still around. Or more precisely; that you're still playing Civilization V.Because that's the truth of it: Civilization VI is the same as Civilization V.The AI unit control is just as horrible. The City States are just as overpowered. The AI leaders are just as random. Religion spreads the same way. With very few, and forgettable, exceptions the game is the same.I would recommend against this game.EDIT: (Above was written on 6-7 hours of gameplay.)Allright, now I've played through the one and only game of Civilization VI that I will ever complete. Huge Map, Marathon, Standard difficulty. Game is way too easy and it's all too obvious that the game engine HAS NOT changed, even though it was a selling point.Just like the very forgettable Beyond Earth, Civilization VI will go straight to the dustbin of failed games. If anyone startes a petition for refunds, let me know.The AI will happily declare war against you with it's rag tag army of mediveal henchmen, even though you have Modern Armour Armies (note the plural) in striking range of their capital.The game is balanced wrong. You NEVER need to build Theatre og Campus districts. As in NEVER EVER. You can get all the culture and science you need from Monuments, Population and Trade Routes. Never waste production on a district if it isn't Harbour, Commercial, Aquaduct, Recreation, Residential or Industrial. On the other hand, you are going to spend the entire game starved for production, so build Industrial Districts ASAP and use gold whenever possible to rush construcion, and thus save production for those things that can't be bought. (Wonders, Projects, Districts)Basically, Districts are a no-brainer. There is never need og use for doing anything other than producing Industrial and Commerce/Harbour first and then Aquaduct/Residential/Recreation when the city grows. Never build a Campus, Encampment or Theatre. You DON'T need them.No-brainers are bad game design, basically.Also; infinite city sprawl is back. Since happiness is now a purely local affair, you can and should cover every square inch of the map in cities. There is no downside. Even though you pay a little upkeep per city, the expense is insignificant comparet to the per-city income that acrues from the +1/+2 trade routes you can maintain per city (through Commercial/Harbour districts).More no-brainers. More bad game design.The extreme lag that Civilization V suffered from is still around, which means that for the last 100+ turns. I've waited 3-5min per game round, even on a high end gamer PC. The game took >40 hours, but I'm sure I could have completed it in <10 hours if it wasn't for the extreme lag.What the actual f***?			"

												Updating this review after playing for several hours.I still love it but I will say that, unless I just happened to get really lucky starts, the game is significantly easier than Civilization V was on Prince difficulty.I struggled to beat Civ V on King difficulty and generally just played on Prince.  I've only played full games on Prince so far in Civ VI but in the two games I've completed I completely steamrolled the AI.I was also able to enter the Industrial Era in the 1400s, which is pretty freaking ridiculous.This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I can't comment on the higher difficulties, but once you learn to ropes and learn how to optimize the district system it seems this game isn't as hard as it's predecessor on the same difficulty levels.Also there does seem to be an issue with the AI, especially the city state AI, not upgrading their units as they progress.  But again, I can't comment on how prevalent this is on the higher difficulties.All that said the game is really fun and I like pretty much all the changes they made, and I'm looking forward to bumping up the difficulty and playing even more.  But it would be foolish to suggest that the game doesn't need any work to be even better, and I'm eager to see what changes the devs make over time.			"

												Civ VI, for me, is a step up in strategy. It has all the classic features from previous games, and Civ V players can jump straight in. But Civ VI forces you to make real choices. No more building every improvement in every city - districts really matter and their placement really matters. Even the map itself and how the AI / other players play against you will shape the game.In short, your choices matter more to the outcome of the game.Other than that, an enjoyable gameplay experience with great music / narration and a real sense of achievement winning a game against difficult opponents.....just one more turn!

												103 hours played. Would not recommend. The AI is absolutelty useless. Unless you're planning on only playing multi-player, don't buy this. I have 1000 hours in Civ V and have only beaten Immortal twice. I.e. I know Civ games well but I'm not that great at them.In this game, I beat Immortal on the first attempt. The AI is completely incapable of fighting a war even with overwhelming force. They'll just waltz around my cities an let their units be picked off. Also, half of the AIs will never be a military threat because they'll pick a strategy (e.g. religious) and run it deep into the ground. Buying this means endorsing half-finished crap.			"

												If you're looking at reviews to determine whether or not you'll buy this game, I'd suggest instead moving to youtube and looking up videos of people playing it for the first time. This game is complicated. I myself have played Civ V extensively and even then, this game is still a little confusing for me to start with. People that have played grand strategy games previously will be able to pick this game up and get into it relatively quickly, but new players might want to take their time and really consider whether they are willing to dive into this deep, dark enigma of civilization management.If you're looking at reviews for opinions on mechanics and such, then let's talk about that a little in not any particular order.+ Main Menu is easy to use with a catchy background score that might even have you stopping for a moment to simply enjoy it!+ Setting up games and utilising mods/DLC is streamlined for efficiency and ease-of-use.+ Game works well on Ultra settings with my rig; GTX 970 + i7 Processor.+ Sean Bean's narration is exceptional. Thankfully he doesn't die in this game!+ Movement and Combat animations are pleasant to watch. The sped up variations are also nice.+ Multiple tech trees to explore simultaneously; Actual Technology and Civics! The design of each boasts a high level of individuality, depth and unique paths that one can forge for themselves. Very easy to play differently every game.+ Civ personalities are much more pronounced in this game and their triggers are more relevant; some civs will dislike you talking to city states while others will make your people wish you'd never warred with them in the first place as some examples.+ Map is beautiful to view, strategic view also quite pleasant and informative. The difference between them is not as large as it was in Civ V, allowing people to utilise it more frequently and easily without the jarring differences.+ Districts allow you to enhance your cities uniquely and make the map seem less sporatic with cities and more akin to a real map which would house many different types of areas between cities and towns.+ New movement system that forces more logical thinking in terms fo both exploration and warring. With roads now only available once trade routes are utilised, it is much more important to consider positioning and reactionary thinking when choosing to war another civ or state.+ Influence over city states is now decided by Envoys which are given to you at a trickling pace, allowing for variety in your decision-making and giving you a much broader idea of how to distribute them out, along with the information of what other Civ's choices are.+ Barbarians have been reworked almost entirely, their new AI quick to identify weak Civs and send a raiding party into their lands. This rework forces players to adopt a more defensive or offensive structure to their early builds, not only making it more tense when deciding between building an additional warrior before a wonder but also giving you the initiative in creating a small force to defend from early warmongering Civs and players alike.+ Flat Happiness bonuses in Civ V have been replaced by Amneties, which is a combination of luxuries found across the world and quality-of-life buildings and civic policies that influence the growth rate of your citizens. This is now coupled with the Housing counter, which determines a cities maximum size relative to the cities current housing potential. Your cities will no longer grow infinitely without proper usage of buildings, civic policies and the terrain itself to keep them well fed, worked and sheltered.+ Very easy to get lost within your city management. A surplus of buildings, districts and other such things will always be nagging at the back of your mind. ""Damn, I really want a holy site. But I need a library too! But what if someone attacks me?

												TL;DR - Don't buy this game, it's broken.Sadly I didn't believe the reviews about this game being a dissapointpent - well, now I must admit it.First i liked it so much, been playing a real long game on marathon speed for a week now, got a civilization with all techs in the beginning of 19th century, +150-200 everything every turn, 25-26 population cities full of food, houses and amenities with ecstatic citizens, going for the big win.Seems that the game didn't like it very much, so i got suddenly a war declaration from 2 other nations, that's ot a big problem, but then i look at my metrics and see that i got -20 amenities from war weariness, all cities stop generating gold, i get my giant army disbanded completely from bankruptcy in like 20 turns and i get barbarian tanks spawned all over my cities every 2-3 turns because of a revolt in every city. And guess what? As a patient player, i tryed for like 100 turns to get out of that mess, but it's simply impossible! With every gold producing tile worked and zero units i still got negative income from my cities, despite all policies focused on gold production. I can't even build a unit to go to the other continent and try to kill any unit from the opposite civilization to force them a peace agreement and there is no option to ask for peace in the diplomacy menu. Any units i produce just get disbanded from bankruptcy half way to the other continent. This is just completely broken!So I need to support the other downvoters here with my own - I am not recommending this game, it can't be played completely and fun because no mather how successfull you are - the game can screw you beyond revovery any moment.Such game breaking things need to be fixed ASAP - escpecially considering the high cost of this game, it is actually 2-3 times more expensive than most of my other games.

												Honestly, I find this game incredibly boring. The AI doesn't seem to interact with the player in any meaningful way, and even on the Quick mode it takes forever for anything interesting to happen. Buildings, tech etc take ages to complete. War makes things more interesting, but I'm sure there are many players like myself who prefer a more peaceful approach to strategy games like Civilization. There are a lot of improved aspects to the game such as districts and changes to combat, technology, religion, and other core mechanics, as well as the colourful visual style; but it somehow just doesn't come together in an exciting way for me. You really have to be willing to put down a minimum of 6 hours per match in order to get anything out of this (in other words your entire afternoon), and you have to be okay with knowing that you may get nothing at all out of it, either out of loss or because you just get so bored that you go back to playing Civilization V or something else. Even the 'one more turn' mechanic doesn't hold much value for me anymore, because pretty much nothing happens in any individual turn, so there's no real rewarding feeling from it, especially when it starts taking so long for turns to complete processing. If you have a superhuman level of patience then this game may be for you, but as it is I just find it incredibly dull.			"

												Civ 6 might have a shiny surface but is quite unfinished underneath!I cannot recommend Civ 6 at the moment! The game as it is now just is not fun due to the state of the AI and diplomacy. I sugest to wait for a sale - 60 $ are a disgrace for the current state of the game. Nonetheless the game has a lot of nice features and intersting new ideas. If the AI was at least somewhat OK this could be a great game,.The AI is a core feature of every strategy game and here Civ 6 fails miserably.Reason:The AI is really crap - Much worse than I have ever experienced in any of the previous titles.With the current state of the AI, it  just isn't fun to play due to a significant lack of challenge. Only the first hour of a game is interesting but afterwards surpassing the AI in almost every manner is inevitable. The sadest sign of the AI's inability is it's combat behaviour- it is really sad. Diplomacy also does not work like advertised by Firaxis (agendas). Moreover the warmonger penalties are insanely high (I guess Firaxis did it on purpose to hide the AI's weakness concerning combat and make leading war less attractive to the player.).There are also several UI bugs and missing UI features which were already standard in the previous iterations.

												At first my impressions of Siv VI were positive. However the more you play the more flaws you spot. The technology tree is completely broken and you fly through eras, meaning you rarely get any balanced conflicts against the AI. This also results in city states being completely useless, as they will be stuck on starting units the whole game due to them not having the necessary resources. The mini-map is confusing and is a shadow of the former Civ V map. I am sure Civ VI will be brilliant a few patches and DLC's down the line, but right now I fully recommend Civ V over Civ VI, as its a better and more polished game at the fraction of the price.			"

												Civ 6 does not make enough of an improvement over civ 5: brave new world, as the ai is still horrible, the earth map basically can't be customized, barbarians are rampant even the ai has a problem dealing with em, most civ specfic traits are pointless as domination is the most effective way to do things, as the ai expands without building up a military to defend,  every few turns the ai bugs you with pointless messages, diplomacy is still horrible, at least in civ 5 and and the total war games like shogun2 and rome 2 do a better job with the ai, i can make deals with the ai which are reasonable and if need be force them into submission. i rather be playing Civ 5 as it is a game which is playable unlike civ 6, which has one saving grace, at least the soundtrack in civ6 is good.

												The game does provide fun for a while, but there are several elements that make the game less powerful than its predecessors. Actually you might start suspecting this when you realize the Hall of Fame is gone. A very sad development for the genre, and something of a shock really, to see it lost. When there is no high score, a major competitive and replayability element is gone. Furthermore, as for gameplay, the AI keeps contacting you without any real reasons and that becomes annoying as well. It looks amazing of course, but that is not the point in a CIV game. Many things are good, but CIV 1, CIV 2 and even CIV 5 was far far better. I would rate this game 6,5/10.			"

												Updating this review after playing for several hours.I still love it but I will say that, unless I just happened to get really lucky starts, the game is significantly easier than Civilization V was on Prince difficulty.I struggled to beat Civ V on King difficulty and generally just played on Prince.  I've only played full games on Prince so far in Civ VI but in the two games I've completed I completely steamrolled the AI.I was also able to enter the Industrial Era in the 1400s, which is pretty freaking ridiculous.This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I can't comment on the higher difficulties, but once you learn to ropes and learn how to optimize the district system it seems this game isn't as hard as it's predecessor on the same difficulty levels.Also there does seem to be an issue with the AI, especially the city state AI, not upgrading their units as they progress.  But again, I can't comment on how prevalent this is on the higher difficulties.All that said the game is really fun and I like pretty much all the changes they made, and I'm looking forward to bumping up the difficulty and playing even more.  But it would be foolish to suggest that the game doesn't need any work to be even better, and I'm eager to see what changes the devs make over time.			"

												103 hours played. Would not recommend. The AI is absolutelty useless. Unless you're planning on only playing multi-player, don't buy this. I have 1000 hours in Civ V and have only beaten Immortal twice. I.e. I know Civ games well but I'm not that great at them.In this game, I beat Immortal on the first attempt. The AI is completely incapable of fighting a war even with overwhelming force. They'll just waltz around my cities an let their units be picked off. Also, half of the AIs will never be a military threat because they'll pick a strategy (e.g. religious) and run it deep into the ground. Buying this means endorsing half-finished crap.			"

												I have been a fan of Civ since I was a kid. It was the first pc game I ever played (Civ II) and have looked forward to every installment. Civ II, absolutely groundbreaking. Civ III is legendary. Civ IV was just as good the previous two but not as great as III in my mind. I even enjoyed Civ V, especially after the DLCs (which will most likely be the case here, and as sad as it is I will buy those)! And then like all good things, it came to an end. At first, I was impressed with this game. However, as the game dragged on I came to understand how poor it was compared to other Civ games. There are three things that ruin it for me:1. It takes too long between turns, I have never had this problem with a Civ game before. This problem does not really arise until late in the game. With Civ V, this kind of happened, but it was minimal compared to this effort by Firaxis (VI). I have a great OS and graphics. I have time to make a plate of chicken nuggets between each turn by the time we get to missles and modern warfare.2. The diplomacy is terrible, not dynamic at all. War or nothing. Which was supposedly the focus, which I love, but the diplomacy does not even make sense.3. The AI settlement of cities, their war strategy, and handling of barbarians is absolutely senseless.In sum, play a different game until the folks at Firaxis can figure it out. This game has great potential but instead is a pile of gamer scat.			"

												If you're looking at reviews to determine whether or not you'll buy this game, I'd suggest instead moving to youtube and looking up videos of people playing it for the first time. This game is complicated. I myself have played Civ V extensively and even then, this game is still a little confusing for me to start with. People that have played grand strategy games previously will be able to pick this game up and get into it relatively quickly, but new players might want to take their time and really consider whether they are willing to dive into this deep, dark enigma of civilization management.If you're looking at reviews for opinions on mechanics and such, then let's talk about that a little in not any particular order.+ Main Menu is easy to use with a catchy background score that might even have you stopping for a moment to simply enjoy it!+ Setting up games and utilising mods/DLC is streamlined for efficiency and ease-of-use.+ Game works well on Ultra settings with my rig; GTX 970 + i7 Processor.+ Sean Bean's narration is exceptional. Thankfully he doesn't die in this game!+ Movement and Combat animations are pleasant to watch. The sped up variations are also nice.+ Multiple tech trees to explore simultaneously; Actual Technology and Civics! The design of each boasts a high level of individuality, depth and unique paths that one can forge for themselves. Very easy to play differently every game.+ Civ personalities are much more pronounced in this game and their triggers are more relevant; some civs will dislike you talking to city states while others will make your people wish you'd never warred with them in the first place as some examples.+ Map is beautiful to view, strategic view also quite pleasant and informative. The difference between them is not as large as it was in Civ V, allowing people to utilise it more frequently and easily without the jarring differences.+ Districts allow you to enhance your cities uniquely and make the map seem less sporatic with cities and more akin to a real map which would house many different types of areas between cities and towns.+ New movement system that forces more logical thinking in terms fo both exploration and warring. With roads now only available once trade routes are utilised, it is much more important to consider positioning and reactionary thinking when choosing to war another civ or state.+ Influence over city states is now decided by Envoys which are given to you at a trickling pace, allowing for variety in your decision-making and giving you a much broader idea of how to distribute them out, along with the information of what other Civ's choices are.+ Barbarians have been reworked almost entirely, their new AI quick to identify weak Civs and send a raiding party into their lands. This rework forces players to adopt a more defensive or offensive structure to their early builds, not only making it more tense when deciding between building an additional warrior before a wonder but also giving you the initiative in creating a small force to defend from early warmongering Civs and players alike.+ Flat Happiness bonuses in Civ V have been replaced by Amneties, which is a combination of luxuries found across the world and quality-of-life buildings and civic policies that influence the growth rate of your citizens. This is now coupled with the Housing counter, which determines a cities maximum size relative to the cities current housing potential. Your cities will no longer grow infinitely without proper usage of buildings, civic policies and the terrain itself to keep them well fed, worked and sheltered.+ Very easy to get lost within your city management. A surplus of buildings, districts and other such things will always be nagging at the back of your mind. ""Damn, I really want a holy site. But I need a library too! But what if someone attacks me? I need an archer!"" Decision-making is once again given a broad area to work with, the player never lacking in things to do within their cities. (Though I have not gotten into the more modern eras just yet, this statement can only be made for up to Medieval eras.)+ New speed setting for multiplayer games, making it much easier to get into a lobby and get going without issue of having to spend hours upon hours in-game, wondering whether or not you'll be able to get these people back together for another session.

												Civ VI, for me, is a step up in strategy. It has all the classic features from previous games, and Civ V players can jump straight in. But Civ VI forces you to make real choices. No more building every improvement in every city - districts really matter and their placement really matters. Even the map itself and how the AI / other players play against you will shape the game.In short, your choices matter more to the outcome of the game.Other than that, an enjoyable gameplay experience with great music / narration and a real sense of achievement winning a game against difficult opponents.....just one more turn!

												It took several months but the game still has a lot of bugs. It looks like a beta at best, not a production-ready AAA-title. Firaxis has many game-designers and screenwriters which create new nations and skins, but this game is not playable as Civ 5. I'm talking about fair multiplayer game. You cant play equitable match in vanilla civ6, you need to install third-party mods that provide you better UI, better balance, fewer bugs. For example, for this 6 months Hellblazer brings much more things, features and bug fixes than WHOLE FIRAXIS Dev team. I do not literally understand what they really do. I think, Hellblazer deserves my money (i mean cost of the game) more then firaxis.			"

												This is sadly my least favorite Civ game ever made. It is disgustingly easy to sail ahead of the AI on any difficulty and the gameplay is just so stale. I lose interest whe I have reached the modern age in 500 AD and the AI is still rocking catapults. Many of the systems are too easy to break, even without trying. I am just saddened that this game was such a let down for me. Hopefully it gets fixed in the future and actually becomes the best Civ game to date.			"

												It was fun, until single player became rundandent due to the limitations of the AI.Internet multiplayer is disasterously buggy, and your game will crash if too many players join and/or leave, including spectators.  This has been a bug from the start, and Firaxis has yet to address it, which makes me think they're not going to address it.Though, it is loads of fun to play with your friends, in a private server or LAN party.  I really like the whole district concept, and think it is an improvement over previous Civs.  It's too bad that internet play is doomed.			"

												It’s a great game if you ignore all the glitches, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ logic, inability to play games with others online because the connection is lost every few turns and they eliminated the pitboss feature, oh and not to mention the game glitches out so badly when I try to shut it down that I have to restart my computer because the task manager gets stuck behind the glitched out civ six screen.  All in all, id refund this game If I could but I played a few too many hours of it because it’s not the kind of game you can spend less than 2 hours playing. 2/5 stars, don’t waste your time.			"

												The fact that theres no SDK for modding is pathetic at ths point, also noticed THERE IS STILL no way to make teams on multiplayer maps. Units are boring, theres like no real endgame unit like the deathbots in V, and the card system is cool...until you realise theres no real endgame cards. Districts in the game are cool, if only to look at they are honestly 100% useless and not to mention if they get burned down it takes ages to repair em, and they offer no REAL benefit. The AI is perhaps THE WORST AI i have ever seen in a RTS game. Not even joking lol, i offer a AI tea and truffles for one of his four wines, but apperently a 2 for 1 deal isnt nearly enough (tho in Civ5 wich is far superior to 6 it was) they attack you for no reason on top of spamming you with denounces and saying they dont like anything you do. This Civ is a failure of a game and i would advise to avoid it until it reaches its rightfull price of 5$, or until the SDK is released (if the devs ever get of their aces) so modders can fix this game.

												I am a long time fan of Civilization series, starting since the first installment.I remember playing I, II, III days and days, but this version just does not have that anymore.I also played IV and V as much as I could.I don't know whether it is the slow passing of turns, superficial novelties likeplacing buildings in neighbourhoods that do not affect gameplay, or some minor quirkslike the map visibility only being updated at the end of the unit move. Unit movement is sluggish, turns take ages to finish and somehow the game just feels sleepy. There is no ""one more turn effect"" anymore, with all previous Civs I at least wanted to win the game once or twice, here I quit while I was winning and uninstalled.The unit graphics look similar to the lightweight Civs on iOS made in China, and while those were pretty good games for the platform, this one does not capture the ""epic"" proportions of the previous PC installments of the series. I suspect outsourcing to save costs, but somehow the spirit is lost.Unfortunately I can not give a recommendation to buy. If you are a owner of Civ V and expansions, you will not find much here worth your money. The game is slow even on a new PC and there is not much really new. My advice would be to buy Civ V and Expansions when it is on offer, and skip this version entirely.As much as I love the series, I think that buying this game for full price was a mistake. It is not a real sequel to the series, it is too heavy on the graphics and too light on gameplay, you don't feel like a Emperor anymore, just moving pieces on a game board. This is an interim version, I hope that the next Civ will bring the series back on the epic track.			"

												It took several months but the game still has a lot of bugs. It looks like a beta at best, not a production-ready AAA-title. Firaxis has many game-designers and screenwriters which create new nations and skins, but this game is not playable as Civ 5. I'm talking about fair multiplayer game. You cant play equitable match in vanilla civ6, you need to install third-party mods that provide you better UI, better balance, fewer bugs. For example, for this 6 months Hellblazer brings much more things, features and bug fixes than WHOLE FIRAXIS Dev team. I do not literally understand what they really do. I think, Hellblazer deserves my money (i mean cost of the game) more then firaxis.			"

												TL/DR:  It's a good game. If you're a strategy fan or a past Civ player, buying now is money well spent. If not, when it comes on sale, you'll be having a blast with the rest of us. I'm going to write the rest of this review in a sort of Question / Answer format, just to get through the things that I think most people will actually want to know.Is it a proper Civ game?Yes. It's Civ at its finest again. This isn't a cut-down version like Civ 5 originally was. This is the whole delicious package, Religion, victory conditions, warfare and all.Doesn't the art style bother you?No. The art style grows on you as you play, I think. If you look at a lategame screenshot, you might find yourself overwhelmed with information - but if it's a playthrough you've been a part of, you'll quickly find yourself getting literate in what all those colourful chappies are. Firaxis have struck an elegant balance between distinctive, quirky appearance and enough visual clarity to tell what everything is.Is the game difficult enough?The thing that bothered me about Civ 5 was that the difficulty was entirely artificial. The AI was dumb. In Civ 6, I'm pleased to say the AI is still a moron, but it's a moron with a purpose. Rather than worrying about making the AI player a genius, which is probably nigh impossible, Firaxis have instead made the characters more colourful. They are going to give you hell, because they all have their own mini mission on the go, and will definitely feel more like living, interesting people playing the game right along with you. Glaringly obvious mistakes and all. Well. If they INSIST on leaving their tech level at the Renaissance, I for one won't feel the least bit bad about driving a tank into it...How does the game run?I haven't encountered any problems. Maybe that will change. If it does, expect an [edit] below.How does the midgame and lategame feel this time around?This game does a much better job of keeping the entire playthrough fresh and interesting. There's always something new to decide about, and because the global happiness/unhappiness mechanic is gone, there's no harm in expanding quite broadly, to fill up as much of the world as you can. Of course, you can choose to sulk behind your city's Ancient Walls if you choose, but if you insist on being a boring person, you'll probably find the AI manoeuvres you into a corner. Seriously, watch Philip of Spain. His religious build is a nightmare once it gets going.			"

												This has been an on and off experience so far. At first I had trouble with the AI simply being overly aggresive but I believe I found a nice work around. Civs spawn to close to one another initially, this creates a horrendous land grab that makes everyone hate each other quite early on but I followed this guide and I haven't been to war once in myh entire game and I'm into the Renniscance Era. Here's a cut and paste of the fix I used.Fix: AI’s starting positions are too close to your camp1. Go to \Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier’s Civilization VI\Base\Assets\Maps\Utility> open AssignStartingPlots.lua.2. Find the line with local iMaxStart = GlobalParameters.STARTDISTANCE_MAJOR_CIVILIZATION or 9. It should be in the function AssignStartingPlots:_MajorCivBuffer(plot).3. Edit the number at the end to the number of tiles you want minimally between starting plots. Change it to 20 or above.4. Go to GlobalParameters.START_DISTANCE_MAJOR_CIVILIZATION can be found in \Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier’s CivilizationVI\Base\Assets\Gameplay\Data/GlobalParameters.xml. Set this value as well, setting it to 20 or above.I found this here: http://windowsreport.com/fix-civilization-6-issues/There's more fixes if you like :)Fun game once the AI are moved to even footing			"

												After playing more than 800 hours of Civ 5, I was really looking forward to this game. Iv tried civ 6 over and over again, hoping that it will be decent. But it isn't. It is horrible.There are several bugs, even now months after release. The AI had no improvement at all since civ 5. AI spam units, while throw them at you for free experience. The game has way less content than civ 5 overall. The victory types seem unbalanced, especially religious units that can easily be picked off by military. Your choices seem to make no difference. Diplomacy is either random or illogical. The new amenity system and how more cities increase district cost meens u have to make cities in stacks of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16 etc) and with no posibilty to arange amenities yourself. Worst off all i find how overpowered military is. This is especially true versus AI, as they can't controll their units at all. But also against players, the fact that cities have no defence, and even when upgraded they can be taken down by just a pair of soldiers. Also while districts become more costly after number of districts you got, units is always same price. You will have a hard time going all out for science, while you can produce millitary in every city with no problem at all.All games are done in king or higher difficulty			"

												What can I say that the reviewers that made the bad reviews for the game haven't said before? I didn't enjoy this one. All this time I was waiting for so many things to be updated so I let my civ game sit there in a dark corner of my library. CONS: Why did I think that more civilizations would be added as an update? It's severly lacking in the amount of civs compared to Civ 5. I am not paying $5 dlc for a single civ that should've been in the base game in the first place. There's also no teams amoung civs prior to gameplay, the AI sucks, Diplomacies suck, I feel I can't take any action without a civ hating me for stupid reasons; the smallest of reasons! I miss using workers as a unit and not having them be disposable. I hate the district system of things so so much, the map sizes are smaller, I could go on! Oh uh pros? ummmm it looks pretty I guess. ...except the chicks in the game all look like babies or like anime faces or something. Wasn't too fond of the goofy art style this time around but the graphics for the cutscenes of the civs are beautiful.  Overall: THIS GAME FEELS SO LIMITED AND EXTREMELY UNDERWHELMING. Don't get this civ if you were to get any civ game!!			"

												If you are considering buying this game, I assume you are a long time Civilization player like myself. There is a long laundry list of reasons to not buy this game, but I'll give you a couple big ones: Still broken AI that borders on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, busted diplomacy that makes everyone mad at you for no reason (before even having done anything aggressive), and weird pseudo-cartoony choice of graphics (doesn't fit this style of game at all). On the plus side you now have a Civics tree and can make districts! Woo hoo!Still, I do not recommend buying this game until it costs 10-20 dollars and includes all DLC.			"

												In December of 2014, my brother introduced me to what quickly became (and has remained) my absolute favorite video game, and one of my preferred modes of entertainment- Civilization V. As someone who has always enjoyed studying history and playing turn-based strategy games (i.e. Risk), Civilzation V was a dream come true. Because of my experience with Civ V, I was very excited for the release of this game, and (after initially restraining myself from pre-ordering) actually decided to shell out $60 to buy the game shortly after its release instead of waiting for a sale. You can see from the gigantic red thumbs-down next to this post that I was disappointed. Since I bought the game, I've tried over and over again to enjoy it or, at the very least, find some way to justify spending as much as I did on this, but I can never stick with it for very long.Other than how bare-bones this game feels when compared to Civ V (which, admittedly, has had 6.5 years not to be expanded upon), my largest issue with this game would have to be the change in the way players can interact with other civilizations. The diplomacy feels much more superficial and the interactions are much more limited- for example. you can no longer pay a civilization to declare war on another. Also, diplomacy in Civ 6 doesn't seem to be very useful- asking civilization to stop sending missionaries and apostles to your cities doesn't seem to have any effect, other than to give you casus belli when they invariably break their promise by sending wave after wave of missionaries and apostles (which are prohibitively expensive for players, but surprisingly common for AI) to convert your cities back.I understand that comparing a game that had (at the time I purchased it) 4.5 years of enhancements and bug-fixes to a (now) 4 month old game is not going to be a fair comparison. That being said, I don't believe that this game is currently worth the ~$60 that I paid for it. If you are a fan of the Civilization franchise, stick with the other installments for awhile- if you haven't yet played any of the Civ games, I would suggest paying the $45 to buy Civilization 5 Complete, which is currently a much better and more complete game, instead of spending $60 on Civ 6.Since it's 2 in the morning and I'm exhausted, I have to throw this onto the end: I do like the introduction of districts in this game and the emphasis that places on city planning, as well as the separate research trees for technology and civics. I also like the way you have to unlock governments, each of which provide unique bonuses and provide different policy card slots.			"

												This is a very good game. I have played it alot and i feel like I have the authority to have a valid opinion. PROS- The art style is great. (in my opinion)- Better mechs than civ 5... trades, religion, politicts (goverments), civs and their personallities. etc- Multiplayer mod support aswell as the steam workshopNote that you will have a limit on multiplayer games depending on where you live.Its a good game overall.CONS - the AI needs fixing. Example:Norway: Ohh hello their! I am Harald!20 turns later...Norway: thanks for the delegation you sended.10 turns later....Norway: Thanks for not settling close to me10 turns later...Norway: Thanks for....Wait a sec...you have a weak navy! I denounce you!5 turns later...Norway: I declare war on you...despite everything good you did to me...but you have no navy soooo...As you can see. The AI is thinking to much on its agenda rather then thinking about other stuff.That is Civ 6's problem. But I am happy to tell you that there is a mod in the workshop that is called AI+ or something. That mod is the solution, so I guess you can fix the problem rather easy. Overall I give this game 95/100 points. If you like the civ games, you need to buy this one. If you have no clue what this is but likes strategy, then I would recommend this game. Thumbs up!			"

												I must concur the AI is terrible. No matter what I do, even being peaceful, everyone hates me. Often times as soon as two AIs can do a Joint War they declare one on me, and I have done absoutely nothing to them. This includes Gandhi and Roosevelt. I even traded with them. I dare defend myself, capture a city, and am branded a warmonger forever more. I just don't care anymore what the AI civs think. They'll hate me eventually. It's as bad if not worse than the original Civilization game where the default is everyone hates you as soon as they meet you.Tchaikovsky is in error.

												Civ IV was the last title worth paying for.  Once you learn a decent build order in V/VI there is no point playing beyond the Ancient Era. The game will be snowballing in your favor and the AI will *never* comeback. Unstackable troops and ranged defenders allow you to easily advance through the game with a single ranged unit defending each base. The AI will randomly declare war, throw away 2-4 units and sue for peace. When two AI factions are warring with eachother, wait until a city defense is low. Declare war and annex/raze the city on a single turn. The victim will sue for peace and the attacker just moves on. Rinse and repeat. There is no punishment for these tactics. They will lead to a quick and easy domination win on the highest difficulties while producing only a handful of units.Without stackable units the only way to make the game challenging is to DISABLE WAR COMPLETELY. What a joke. Don't buy.			"

It doesn't feel as refreshing or rewarding to win, and the AI (after soo many AI fixes) is still as horrible as it was at launch. If they ever plan on patching the game properly, I can see how my opinion of this game would skyrocket.However, it's unplayable in it's current state.			"

												Civilization VI is a good game. By no means would I say it is a poor game. But it is not a great game. The graphics, sound and overall atmosphere is pretty good. The strategy can get deep but isn't a requirment to win, for the lower difficulties anyway. Once you go higher you will need a strategy. The district system is in my opinion very well done. It helps you organize and plan your resources better. Those are some of the good things. There are lots of bad things though. The AI is trash. The leaders make decisions with zero logic. For example, a country declared a territorial war on me. They quickly jumped on my land with many troops. I rushed my army to them and slowly defended my land until peace is made. After we made peace, Japan decides I am a warmonger. This makes zero sense. I defended my land and I am the warmonger!? China gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if you build more wonders then them and will denounce you. Other leaders will denouce you for petty reasons like that. Their strategy is also not that good. They don't plan districts or their placements. Overall, it would be best if you stuck with previous Civilization games.			"

												Disclaimer: Since there is no ""Maybe"" option for ""Do you recommend this game?"" I am putting ""Yes"". I really mean, ""Yes, for people who LOVE a challenge and who want to play the latest Civ game.""I've been playing Civ since number 2, which I spent an absurd amount of time playing during my formative years and I love this series to death, but I have no idea how I feel about this game. It feels like an abusive relationship that I can't escape because I just keep believing that the game will treat me right if I just do it better next time...and then it slaps me in the face again and tells me to shut my mouth.I love some of the changes and additions they made to the game such as making you think about placement of cities, districts and improvements because it has a huge impact on your future, the change to governments and the civics tree, technology and civics boosts, and the improvement of trade routes and trading posts. I especially love the changes to city states and the awesome bonuses they give you for becoming suzerain/sovereign of them.On the other hand, I don't understand how they think the AI is coded correctly in any way. They will declare war on you for no reason, constantly refuse requests for friendship even if they are ""friendly"" toward you; and once they are at war with you, they will barely assault a single city (usually just my capital so far). I've just sat there and picked off troops one by one with my city defenses as they just stand outside my city not attacking it. Meanwhile, the civs I'm not at war with denounce me because they think I'm a warmonger, when all I've done is DEFEND my cities and never once declared war on anyone!It's nearly impossible to appease any of the other civs. First impressions of you? Negative; almost always. Have more positive numbers going for you than negative in the relationship window? They're still unfriendly toward you even though the math they show you on screen should put you at neutral or above. Pumping all of your resources into culture? Brasil, who likes civs with more science and culture than they have (and hates those with less), still won't like you because you're dumb and have less science than they do. After Montezuma finally grew tired enough of waging war on me and not winning (because he barely sent any troops and they just stood outside my gates), he offered me peace and a TON of his luxuries. Which would be great, except that his main personality trait is that he hates anyone who has more luxuries than him/luxuries he doesn't have yet. So...he made peace and completely set himself up to get mad at me again later.Also, barbarians are insane. I spent ALL of my time until the medieval era trying to get rid of them and they still were everywhere; I could barely get anything built in my cities! Now if they spawn near horses, they have horsemen. And they have scouts that report back once they see your city and get the barbarians to come attack it. I only got to play long enough to get to the modern era after turning them off.All of my above experience has been on the standard difficulty. Maybe I'll try one of the wimpy difficulties and see if I can just crush the civs that will become a pain before they grow powerful enough to matter.Firaxis, PLEASE fix the AI in this game. I love this series and hate to see ""features"" that are just clearly bugs. I can't possibly fathom how you coded it so that the pacifistic defending civilization can be seen as a warmonger. If my feelings on the game change I will update my review, but for now my relationship with Civ VI remains...strained.			"

												Civilization VI is a good game. By no means would I say it is a poor game. But it is not a great game. The graphics, sound and overall atmosphere is pretty good. The strategy can get deep but isn't a requirment to win, for the lower difficulties anyway. Once you go higher you will need a strategy. The district system is in my opinion very well done. It helps you organize and plan your resources better. Those are some of the good things. There are lots of bad things though. The AI is trash. The leaders make decisions with zero logic. For example, a country declared a territorial war on me. They quickly jumped on my land with many troops. I rushed my army to them and slowly defended my land until peace is made. After we made peace, Japan decides I am a warmonger. This makes zero sense. I defended my land and I am the warmonger!? China gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if you build more wonders then them and will denounce you. Other leaders will denouce you for petty reasons like that. Their strategy is also not that good. They don't plan districts or their placements. Overall, it would be best if you stuck with previous Civilization games.			"

												After my first few hours, I can say that this iteration certainly feels more involved than the previous. The city state bonuses are a much welcomed improvement, with enough variation between them that they have a fairly significant impact on each game. The fact that envoys in city states are permanent and you don't have that annoying notification ""no longer friend/ally with city state"" that prompted you to splurge more gold to keep the benefit is gone.Combat feels much the same as Civ 5 - I haven't experimented with the new corps feature yet - only to protect settlers and builders.Having a military early game suddenly became a whole lot more important. Where I used to just sit back and build wonders, you can't do this any longer because you will either get stomped by an aggressive opponent (surprise war) or barbarians will just amass and sack you.The 1-more turn feeling is very much alive.

												Just from playing one game in Civ 6, i am bored and probably going back to Civ 5.  I wasnt planning on concurring the entire continent but the AI is just annoying.  I was able to destroy 7 players with 2 cannons, 2 rifleman, a machine gun team, and 2 tanks.  Thats it.  It was ridiculous.  Like many others i found the lack of information about each city annoying, the housing, amenity, food, combo was also annoying.  I enjoy the wonder finish videos but like many others, you have to have special tiles for each wonder.  Just let me build it wherever i want!  There is more and many others have already stated what is good and bad.  But, at this point, i cant give this game a thumbs up.			"

												All the mechanics of civ 5 + more. It took civ 5 plus all dlc to get a complete game. Civ 6 builds on ease of entry that civ 5 had with a layer or two of complexity forcing players to not just rely on automation. Finds a nice middle ground between the recent easier civ versus the more complex older ones.			"

												The workshop tag was removed after launch. As the SDK is withheld, the modding scene is nowhere as big as it was for previous titles.Months after launch, and the AI has not been fixed.I don't see a reason buying this over Civ 4, which I found much more compelling in terms of diplomacy, AI behaviour,  culture and religion mechanics, and policies (""civics""). Also, there is more content in the Civ 4 GOTY edition than you will encounter in Civ 6 for the next few years of DLC milking.			"

												Game is as good as V but the way Firaxis treated Polish customers is a disgrace. They put winged hussars in the Civ6 launch trailer, and finaly didn't give Poland as playable nation in base version, which was a pure lie. Than after ppl buy the game and don't get what they were supposed to get they offer us 13mb ""dlc"" that unlocks Poland for only 5 euro. If I bought Civ6 for 50 euro I will pay that 5 for their damn ""dlc"" to make Poland into space and they knew that many Poles will think this way. This is the last time they get my money...			"

												It's not BAD, but it's not great. They might as well call it Civ 40K because in this game... there is only war.Seriously though, AI will go to war with you at the drop of a hat - then take it back in 5 turns. Then call you a warmonger and go to war with you again. Then will declare peace after 30 turns. Also you might not even see an enemy unit in that entire time, lol, which makes it all the more absurd.If you can ignore the AI nonsense, it's a pretty good game but damn do they need to fire whoever was in charge of their AI system, as they dropped the ball in a massive fashion.

												I haven't played the game too much as I have Civ V complete. What I found interesting though is they had the chance to take a look at what made Civ V + DLC's and Mods great, like Vox Populi/Community patch for example, and they didn't learn much. Things like diplomacy from Civ IV, not in the game.Like Civ V, you can only hope that in a year or two after they've milked the game dry for DLC's and Expansions that it lives up to Civ V. Then it would be a pretty good game I suppose. Also it asks you if it can spy on you every time you start up the ♥♥♥♥.ing game. I typed this out so I could give it a thumb down (for now).			"

												I would not recomend this game in its current state, the AI is horrible to say the least, you get punished for having a large civilization where you are forced to micromanage to an extent where it kills all the fun in the game, doing university mathematics is much more enjoyable then this game when it reaches that stage...And nukes has been nerfed quite heavily...The graphics is cartoon like, and you get accused for warmongering with the same amount of logic that you usually can find in a cartoon.

												This game was released way too early, once again. It has a lot of nice new features, and not a lot is missing from previous ones, but the game is way too buggy on all fronts to be enjoyable for anything other than just the first few hours of exploring new mechanics.AI is so poor and broken, that it keeps declaring surprise wars it can't even hope to win. The agenda system is a cool idea, but it just makes the AI seem crazy when it declares wars over completely trivial things. The AI still can't handle or understand 1 unit per hex tile either, and it's already the third game in the series to use that feature. Higher difficulties rely on cheating, again, but even that doesn't help now since the AI just doesn't understand the new mechanics at all.Multiplayer is riddled with various exploits that are in the game. There's all kinds of production and unit selling related exploits, and also just overpowered strategies that are impossible to counter when playing normally.This game is like it was not tested at all. And it probably was, but they just went ""♥♥♥♥ it, they'll buy anything we put out anyways"".It's a travesty that this game gets 90%+ score on ""professional reviews"". It COULD be a great Civ game sure, EVENTUALLY. That's not how reviewing should work though. Firaxis failed to fix the AI in Civ 5 as well, and didn't fix it all for Beyond Earth.Not recommended until the massive list of problems is fixed. I'm putting it on hold to wait for better days.			"

Civilizations will rise & fall, but this 4X strategy game is sure to stand the test of time. Firaxis devs have gone to great length to make this installment of the franchise not just different, but better. Civilization VI takes the fun to a whole new level of intensity with the improved AI, the enhanced art, & the combat systems. I only came to Civ V lately, as in this year. I’ve barely played a bit of the predecessors, just to get an idea of what I missed before the paragon that Civ V is graced my monitor. There are balancing issues yet with Civ VI. And the achievements need more challenge. But, for those who may be waiting for some of the reviews, I will just give you my list of 16 reasons I think the game succeeds as an heir to the Civilization throne.16. Multiple full color map filters: It’s much more than just the lovely map art, & the view of a map before the world is uncovered. They improve decision making just like all the other menus in the game. Pins are added to mark the map for exploration.15. Augmented GP Abilities: You can retire a GP, convert him to a collectible or unit upgrade, keep him around for passive boosts, or even pass on him altogether; saving your points for the next GP in the lineup. If you want a GP & are losing to another civ, you can throw some hard earned gold into the GP pool to steal him before they are able to recruit him. 14. Wider choice of Historical Great Persons: I loved having John the Baptist found my first religion. But, also you can view a gallery of all your collected art & relics anytime, which are also obtained as relics from religious martyrs, & found in villages.13. Movement is more intuitive & the zone of control is more transparent. Where movement is slowed down from geographical features on the map, you quickly feel more boxed in at first. But, this feels more natural because you begin to live in your own civ, not really moving out to see the world until mid-game or later. This forces you to be more aware of your neighbors than it did when you branched out all over the map. 12. Escort Bindings & Unit Stacking: This is actually going back to Civ IV &, it definitely is a no-brainer. No reason why we shouldn’t be able to bind a soldier to our settler & send him around the world. Being able to build armies & regiments takes the warfare to a new level, in terms of power on the front line in a small hex of space.11. Promotion & naming of units: Lends a greater personal investment in “The Great White Arrows,” when you know you are sending them to their death with 3 promotion levels down the drain. There is a randomization feature that is great for getting these crazy names, if you don’t want to name them Jack or Fred. 10. Roads Simplified: They are laid automatically by traders. Yet, options are still present for making individual road segments with the engineers. Military engineers & builders are like specialists, compared to the workers from Civ V who did it all. The trade routes system is simpler to use, but you can NOT tell where you last sent specific routes. Of course this doesn’t seem to be a problem, since it’s easier to see at a glance & by popping out the right side tab where you already have routes currently. 9. Addition of short term projects in the construction queue, similar to the Civ V world’s fair for late game boosts. You can boost your bank account by investing in the Commercial Hub, or beef up production, Military, or Science at any time you need an edge in a certain direction. This gives the player more control over the outcome, & certainly allows for serious strategy.8. Graphics are without perceptible flaws. This makes the game even more engaging... immersive! Wonders are bigger. Also, you can see the great works & trade them. Camera orientation during combat needs correction. It is necessary to edit game files to gain certain optional controls that should have been in- game, like spinning the map & stopping the infernal unit auto-advance. It does have the appearance that they weren’t quite finished with this aspect of the game at release. The art & graphic changes add greatly to the experience. For example, you can hover over districts in other civs to spy out what great works are hidden in which buildings, if you are planning to steal some art. 7. The City/ States are color coded, providing bonuses for suzerain status, which is hard to maintain for any length of time, since there is much competition. Conquering a CS removes those resources & the protection buffer they provide from the other civs. You also have the ability to conscript their military. So, it’s more to your benefit to keep the CS intact.6. Espionage: You have a choice about whether or not to invest in training spies. You can choose what action they take; steal art, siphon money, sabotage production by burning buildings, etc. Or, you may use them as counterspies, protecting specific buildings & their adjacencies. Roleplay is enhanced by choices for escape when detected. If you capture an enemy spy, you may trade him back to the opponent, or not. 5. Developing a culture feels more like an integrated part of your civilization, rather than an optional sidetrack. Not only are the wonders showcased on individual tiles, but they’ve made the details more visible, like mine cars zipping around the track. The art & music become a part of the world around you, with increased abilities to place & move works physically.4. The religious combat is great! Before, you had little options for dealing with those missionaries wondering into your civ, tearing apart the fabric of your culture. You couldn’t attack them or remove them with a unit without a war dec. The inquisition is more realistic, & dying apostles leave behind relics, which can be placed in temples, or traded as valued great works or stolen. I did find it unfortunate that I can’t rename my religion to a certain denominational name if I choose the Christianity symbol. You are able to choose a generic zodiac symbol & give it a name of choice, but that really is illogical. You should ideally be given more choices in personalization, not less than in Civ V. 3. Though a diplo victory is not yet in-game, it is possible to achieve a Science or Culture victory truly by diplomacy. Alliances are totally expanded, allowing you to form relationships on different levels. It’s possible to convince the AI to change its plan to attack. The AI is more responsive to diplomacy, behaves more rationally & gives you feedback on how you are meeting their agenda. You are given more options for holding the AI accountable, as in being able to denounce them, or make them pay for spying on you. Sometimes the option appears to ask them to remove their units from your borders. But, this is not yet consistent. 2. Combat: Increased barb difficulty has upped the challenge. Over time, they fade from the game as you begin to encounter other civs. I don’t encounter pirates in international waters. A slider to increase the appearance of barbs would be great. Either way, the combat is definitely one of the best improvements in the game. More siege equipment is available. The improved landscape features allow for greater defensive power. Fighting is more visible & realistic looking. 1. The system of civic progress has been streamlined.Some are pulled from the Tech tree, the ideologies, & policies of Civ V. Taken together with the Tech tree, it adds a masterful touch to the gameplay & just makes more sense. With the system of card slotting & governments whichever you choose, you can reach the victory of your choice. This expansion gives more control over boosts, & allows you the chance to steamroll your game, if you are wise enough to “lead your people well.” Comments & questions are welcome.			"

												Cartoony graphics and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI make the game completely unplayable. It's impossible to get any meaningful information just from looking at at anything at a glance like in Civ 5. It's now impossible to tell the difference between a tile with hills on it and a normal tile, and the new gimmicky fog of war graphic means you now can't tell the differences between different tile types. The insane levels of saturation make me feel like I'm going to vomit, and the unit models look like something out of Clash of Clans. Do you want to actually be informed of notifications you receive? Forget about that! Do you want to be able to see tribal villages when you ""discover"" them? You're out of luck. This piece of garbage is a downgrade from Civ 5, and I woudn't recommend anyone to waste their money on it.			"

												Buyer beware…This is a great game in the making as most CIV games are. It feels completely rushed to market in its current form.*** If Your copy crashes a lot (program not responding) – Add an Exception in Windows Defender for the Entire CIV installation folder***Pros:1) Linked Units - You can now link a military unit with a non-military unit. It makes sending settlers and workers across the battlefield so much better.2) Workers - Workers now only last for three tile improvements. This can be upgraded to 5 but its 3 to start with. At first I thought I would hate this because I am so used to auto improving my lands while I focused in on conquering and expansion, but I must say it’s refreshing to know what I am building and where. 3) Districts - The districts idea is also cool. It gives you a greater appreciation for the intricacies of the map. Certain features of the map will boost district output so it matters where you place them within your city limits.4) Unit Promotion - They laid out the promotion fields so you can see what promotions are doing for your units. It’s a lot better.Cons:1) International relationships - Diplomacy is all kinds of screwed up. First they overhauled it so that World leaders have petty reasons for liking and disliking you. For instance, France likes countries with a heavy spy presence and dislikes those with no spies. Well if you meet them before spies are available to you then they automatically dislike you. Two turns after meeting them in the classical era they denounced me and five turns later declared war on me. The frustrating part is that Kongo who was friendly with me also declared war on me. I started a second game with another civ to see if it was any different and again I met a country (Norway and Rome) and within 5 turns was at war with them over something else completely petty. It doesn't break the game but it just doesn't make much sense. With Diplomacy broken as it is the game is just frustrating because you cannot form even the most basic of alliances. 2) Graphics -  This is more of a taste and preference than an automatic Con but the graphics are way more cartoony than in Beyond Earth or Civ 5.3) Complexity – There are various changes on gameplay from CIV 5 / BE that make it difficult to pick this game up and play. For instance, fishing boats are no longer a unit you train but rather an improvement that you add to a tile VIA the builder. This isn’t explained and your advisor never suggests you build builders (no strategic resources than).  Then there’s the entire overhaul on the government system with a slew of new policies that you can select and various other aspects that have little to no explanation attached to them. Don’t get me wrong these will be EPIC one day, but until the various complexities and nuances are understood it will be frustrating. 4) Technical issues – Besides having issues with windows defender, the game also seems to have a slew of minor technical glitches. There is a problem with clicking on tiles behind units or cities and the game sends your unit to the wrong spot. The game has also crashed randomly (thank goodness for autosave) and when in windowed mode suddenly stops receiving mouse input. Another technical issue is that when closing the game it suddenly becomes unresponsive. I guess this could be more of a feature and not necessarily a bug, but nevertheless it's incredibly annoying to have to force close the game.OVERALL Overall If I could go back I would not buy this game today. I would have waited until the first round of DLC came out and then maybe picked up the game on a sale. It’s just not worth the $$ today. I love the CIV franchise and it pains me to write a negative review but the game just isn’t where it needs to be for the price tag.			"

												Great game, love playing it.  Delux Edition was a waste of ♥♥♥♥ing money with the 4 free DLC being money grabbing extras.  Had they all been decent extras like the latest one with 2 Civilizations and a Scenario, would have been fine, but with 2 being 1 Civ and 1 Scenario, and the first having only a scenario in it, rather ticked off.That said, I'm going to keep playing because it is a great game and I am enjoying it, but it has however put me off buying anything but Complete editions of Firaxis games years later.

												This iteration of Civilization is overall mediocre. There are many new features, but at the end of the day the AI is still terrible (worse in some cases) than previous versions, the graphics are just abysmal kiddie/mobile/freeemium garbage, the game feels incredibly slow due to the way research finishes so quickly vs city production, etc. etc. The constant spam of nonsensical AI leader messages (ex. repeated messages about you being bankrupt when you're not) and ludicrous AI really raise my hackles while I'm playing. I'm not kidding; it's very annoying, and in tandem with the awful kiddie graphics it's a testament to my endurance that I can still play it, though I can tell that my time with this game will not be anywhere near what it was with Civ I-IV. Honestly not worth one penny over $20.00.			"

												Overall, the game is very well made; more or less all the features from the Civ 5 expansions have been implemented right from the start, and they made quite a few additional improvements here and there such as the new Casus Belli system (copied from EU4). Furthermore, the soundtrack is among the best in video games and succeeds in breathing life and personality into the game.If you were expecting a revolution in the 4X formula, I suppose you may be disappointed, but I wasn't looking for that at all in Civ 6 and am satisfied with how the game turned out.Oh, and multiplayer actually works properly this time and is a lot of fun.

												This game is a massive dissapointment and is in a pretty much unfinished state at the moment. I've played the series since Civ 4, and this one is probably the worst. However it does get regular updates, so if things do change i may change my mind. I dont normally post rant type reviews but this is an exeption.Pros- Nice graphics- Runs pretty well, even on my 5 yr old slow as ♥♥♥♥ mac- Some nice new additions, like districts and a political system- Regular updates- DLC. Although its overpriced, the actual content is good.- Genuinely nothing else i can think of to add to this list...Cons- Although there are regular updates, the game is still ♥♥♥♥ing broken and all the big problems are just ignored. For example cross platform multiplayer is completely broken, and even though the devs have said they are working on this, they been saying this since release and nothings happened.- Diplomacy is broken. Literally the AI will declare war on you for no reason, even if you are playing on a huge size map and they're on the other side of the globe and have absolutely nothing to gain, and also if they can't even win. They will also denounce you for no apparant reason and give no explaination, and literally no one will be your freind. Your worst enemies will also ask you politely if they can have access to all your resources even though they know you won't accept.- Districts and tech trees although they are a nice addition are really complicated and hard to get to grips with.- As i said before, you're buying an unfinished game if you chose to purchase it. For example, im pretty sure they were planing to have more than one leader per civ, Greece has two different leaders to choose from, however this is the only civ currently with this feature, and there are a load of hints that suggest that the devs were planning to add this to more civs, although havent for some reason. Some unique units for example are only unique to their leader and not their civ.- Poor choice of civs. I can't seem to find a single civ i enjoy playing, even the ones that i played in Civ 5, this is just a personal opinion though.- Poor mac support. I get most users are not on mac, but seriously not having a working cross platform multiplayer almost 6 months after release is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and the fact that DLC are released for mac over a week after they are on other platforms.- Loads of minor bugs. Water sources for rivers for example, dont actually count as a fresh water source, which is incredibly annoying considering that water is vital for building a city.- The game is just ♥♥♥♥ing boring and ragey. The whole pace of it seems far too slow, even on quick speed, and you'll either be wandering round the map for ages trying to find people, or be attacked by about 5 civs at once, and if you fight back you get denounced for warmongering. This is partly what makes it so boring, the fact that every ♥♥♥♥ing game is exactly the same, you spawn in, wander around, get moderatly sucessful before you either get invaded or quit out of boredom.- Finally, DLC and digital deluxe edition (again). I didnt buy deluxe edition but i feel sorry for anyone who did because they've been absolutely ripped off. Deluxe edition was meant to save you money on DLC by giving you the first 4 free. However the first dlc have turned out to be £4 nation packs with a scenario and sometimes a natural wonder or two, with the exeption of the latest DLC which is just two of these merged into one. If you dont intend on playing these nations, which many people don't, they literally add ♥♥♥♥ all to the game and are just a waste of money. I was expecting actual expansions like BnW and Gods and Kings in Civ 5 to be included in deluxe. Having said that, if you are going to play these nations then the DLC are totally worth it.- oh, and its ♥♥♥♥ing £50			"

												Civilization 6 takes the excellent formula of Civilization 5 and builds upon it in a satisfying way. The new city districts system is a whole new level of management and I could not imagine playing Civ without it again. The music, art style, and leader animations all bring this alternate history to life in new and exciting ways. Now, time for the elephant in the room. The AI can act very wonky. They are unpredictable and will do whatever they please regardless of their friendship status with you. I had Rome, my game long ally and friend, declare war on me when I completely outmatched them. Their whole civilization gone because they decided they wanted some bananas. I just wish it would take more into consideration before making a game changing decision like that. Not to mention how their agendas tend to make them act like entitled brats very quickly. Agendas should add to the complexity of diplomacy rather than dictate tantrums because I have one more luxury resource than them. However, considering this is the most launch content any Civ game has ever had, I'm very hopeful these will be ironed out over time. I am so excited to see what the future holds considering we already have what Civ V's major expansions were (no World Congress though). All in all, the game is still extremely addicting and fun to play. It can only get better from here, and they are off to an outstanding start! Now excuse me as I go take one more turn.			"

												I do not recommend this game.I am currently in the process of requesting a refund.I got conned by Beyond Earth - I refuse to be again. This game takes the best elements of previous Civ games and puts them to the torch. The deciding factor for me was when the Caravan made a road between 2 settlements (lovely principle in theory, terrible execution) and not the builder. If you don't realise what a huge deal that is - you haven't been thinking strategically enough, so I'll give you a hint - you can't place roads where you want yourself. The A.I. is terrible and has not been improved. You would have thought with such a huge following and the serious time that has now been invested in it (nearly 20 years!) they would have got it right by now, but no (vivid example - Stonehenge requires YOU to build it beside a Stone resource - does the AI require this - no - thereby practically always going to beat you to it at higher levels). So stupid, it can't even follow simple protocol. This is very lazy developing and I refuse to accomodate it. I do not recommend this product.[ edit ]I have been refused refund by Steam due to time played - i.e. 15 hours (above their 2 hour threshold). There is no way that you would find some of these issues unless you have been playing for this long. Lesson learnt - wait and read reviews. A very good review within the community was written by Anamizefan in which he goes into a lot of the issues. One telling thing though is that he hasn't finished a single game yet. It just gets too boring. I stand by what I said above - Firaxis cocked it up again . . again, you have to wait for DLC to fix something that should have been right from the start. Twice bitten, both by Firaxis - it ain't gonna happen a 3rd.			"

												*January 2017 Edit*  The comments below were based on gameplay from initial release.  The AI has been fixed and responds more appropriately to the global situation.  It's less aggressive, initiates and accepts fair trade offers, seems to be wary of warmongering penalties and doesn't spam missionaries like it did.  A second go of it proved to be very enjoyable and challenging.  I also think the way civics are handled now is probably the best thing to happen to the franchise in years. It's very flexible, which allows you to modify your gameplan as the world evolves.  I totally recommend the game for fans and newcomers alike!I think this game will be great someday, but that day hasn't come yet.  There are some cool new features and innovations, like districts and culture/civics.  Unfortunately, the AI is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it dampens everything cool about the game.  If you build more cities, the AI is ready for war, if you build a wonder, the AI is ready for war and if you don't do either of those...drumroll please...the AI is ready for war.  Apparently, just playing the game is enough to cause war.  There were 6 other civs on my continent at the start and they all declared war at least once and half the time by surprise, which comes with heavy warmongering penalties, but the AI doesn't seem to worry about that.  The civs that declared war multiple times, I just had destroy or reduce to one city.  So basically I was in a constant war from about turn 30 until turn 300 when there just 2 civs left with a total of 6 cities.  Too bad the name Total War is already taken.Anyway, I'm a bit angry about this and would be ready for war had I not been at it for 50 hours this past week.  I have been playing Civilization since Civ 2 and I'm a big fan, but after all these years and all the money they must have made from it, I can hardly believe they would release something that plays like early access.  On top of that, I recall reading that the AI was updated to play better.  Hmmm, is it ""better"" when the Norway AI who I have been trading with for 200 turns and whose best unit is the Berzerker decides to surprise attack me, whose best units are calvary and artillery?  Or early on, around turn 30, China surprised attacked with 2 warriors?Every war I fought was unprovoked and lopsided because I always had the bigger army.  In previous versions, that would have stopped the AI.  But enough on that.  It's not the only shortcoming for the AI.  Unfair trade offers and refusing to accept fair trade is the rule rather than exception.  Friendly AI denouncing you because your income is too low when you have 130 gold coming in per turn.  Taunting about lack of expansion when you 15 cities compared to the AI player's 4.  I could go on, but I'm sure get the point.If this game's history has taught me anything, it's that the game usually doesn't get good until the expansions.  I probably knew that, but I have a big gift card balance on Amazon, so I used some of it.  It was good to see the new features, but for me it has no replay value as it's more frustrating than fun.  I'll try it again at Xmas to see if they've patched it, but for now I'm going back to Civ 5 Brave New World.  If you haven't already bought it, I'd wait until next summer.			"

Not very accessible to someone who hasn't played Civ before. Even if you are a veteran Civ player, it's often hard to keep up with everything they've packed into this release of the game.My advice, if you're not a fan of the franchise, wait for a sale. If you are a fan, yeah, you know you're going to buy this. And make sure you got more than 8Gb of memory. You'll need it.			"

												I actually cannot write an in depth review because I'm too busy playing this game. It's not an excuse, I just have a serious problem. Bottom line it improves upon Civ V in every way possible which is EXACTLY what I want to see in a sequel, the soundtrack might be the best in any game I've played, barbarians are more threatening than they are annoying now, Christopher Tin somehow topped Baba Yetu, the new graphics actually are surprisingly refreshing and fit the game very well, and the AI is much better! Teddy Roosevelt sending me apple pies instead of nuking me is a really nice change of pace. Overall, Sid Meier, I love you. This game deserves all the support it can get! EDIT: I would like to let everyone who's complaining about warmongering Civilizations in the ancient era that it makes complete sense. Since there is no warmongering penalty at the start your best bet for early expansion is to make use of battering rams and fight! That to me is pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥ The agendas DO work. Because I kept peace and didn't clear a lot of forests, Teddy Roosevelt became my ally. Frederick Barbarossa is unfriendly with me because I help a lot of city states. Keep in mind though that the game is a lot better with all the victory types enabled because otherwise everyone is going to be out to kill you. I don't feel like I needed to explain that but most people don't seem to get it.			"

												It's just alright. Not a great game yet, but it could be eventually. In their attempt at making the game feel more organic with concepts such as tech boosts, Firaxis has somehow made this edition feel less organic and more 'gamey'. Now if I want to remain competitive I have to play a certain way to get the tech boosts, such as building a certain unit or building to keep my tech progress up. I am forced to play a certain way to compete, it no longer feels like a living world full of competing civilizations, it feels like I am playing a very long boardgame with really stupid opponents. The new boardgame cards for government policy just cements that sense of 'gameyness'. CIV 2-4 had a sense of immersion and they felt like games that represented reality; the new editions feel like games that represent boardgames. The last 2 entries seem to be going down a very rigid path away from the sandbox feel the series used to have and I regret buying into it.			"

												Worst CIV game yet, sadly.You now have to research ways to declare war - and cannot avoid the horriic ""religion"" game dynamic.  Why does this matter? because the AI will spawn dozens of missionary units, who will just stand around your cities, blocking your units, blocking your trade routes, preventing you from building improvements..You can't attack them, you can't move them, you can't do anything but sit there and watch your cities die, turn by turn. After spending 20 or more turns unable to do  *ANYTHING* other than sit and watch my cities die, I gave up in disgust. Beyond Earth was shoddy, poor quality and no fun to play. I had really hoped that CIV VI would be more like V, with updated graphics, rather than like Beyond Earth, with essentially no fun game play.Shame I was wrong. I want my money back, which I can't get, sadly. Only in the field of computer games can you pay so much for such a crappy, no good product, and not have any recourse.			"

												Game looked really good when I started watching the gameplay videos online. Then I started playing it.So it does not appear that the games difficulty acctually does anything. When I play on settler or prince or king, the game has no real noticable changes. I don't feel settler is any easier than any other difficulty I play on. This was what upset me the most. If easy is not easy and challanging is the same as easy, why have difficulties? While the districts were a nice change, it just seems like the game is trying to do too much. You never feel like the game has proper pacing. The AI has always been a problem with Civ, mostly when trying to play on higher difficulties. In the past they received start bonuses which was bad, but now the AI is just ridiculous.I do not recommend civ 6 especially to new players. Then again, if you have not played civ v in all its glory, then go ahead and play Civ 6.♥♥♥♥♥♥tastes better if you've never had chocolate			"

												I highly recommend this excellent retreatment of the Sid Meier's Civilization turn-based strategy classic. The new Research systems for Technology and Civics are intriguing with their special bonus triggers.  The Spying system also is interesting and provides a good 'Risk versus Reward' gambling opportunity.  I like the way Great Leaders are earned in a competitive manner and their background biographies are a welcome educational side benefit.  World Wonders now are created separately from the City cores and, when completed, are given a special multi-directional foundation-through-final wonder visual presentation. Once you play Civ VI,  am pretty sure you will place this high on your ""One More Turn"" or ""Just 5 More Minutes"" list.			"

												CIv 6 has the potential to be a very fun and an engaging game, but for some reason Firaxis is fine with realeasing garbage and fixing it up later with expensive DLC's. Here are some things I dislike and like about this game.The Good: -The graphics: The art style looks very nice and the graphics are suberb. The animations to your units and Civ leaders are very well thought out and look pretty good. The art style and animations help give the Civ leaders in this game a lot of charisma. The areas around your cities look awesome.-Districts: They're really nice ways to spruce up the land around your cities, instead of having everything contained in one city, and everything else being farms or other tile imporvements.-City States: I like how they've re worked city states. Before you would put in so much work towards allying city states and get nothing for it. Now even though someone else is their ally, you still get bonuses if you put in work in becoming their friends. Spies: You get more options for spies in Civ VI, such as the ability to target specific things like destroying other civs production, stealing money, or stealing their tech. I like the wonder animations. It's cool seeing a speed up process of it getting built with your city in the background. The Bad: -The AI is beyond stupid: I usually like to play on the normal difficulty in Civ games, but for some reason the AI poses no real threat at all. One reason is that the AI doesn't upgrade their units (If me and an AI are both in the industrial age, I'll have field canons and they will still have slingers and archers). Another reason is sometimes the AI won't build up an army and if they do they feel compelled to leave them sitting around doing nothing (even when I attack they just sit there to be killed). The AI is just really stupid and broken.-The Agenda system needs to be re-worked: Basically AI's have these agendas which is what helps them decide if they like you or not. The problem is that the agenda system is way to f*ucking broad. I've seen AI who will hate you for building wonders, not being in a war (even though you started the game like 50 turns ago), having explored more land then them, allying with city states, upgrading your fu*cking rescources and many more. The game punishes you with the AI's disliking you, because you're playing the game normally. It's almost impossible to make realtionships in this game with the AI because of this. -Dealing with housing is beyond annoying: Housing basically ♥♥♥♥s with your growth since you don't have enough houses to put your citizens in. The problem is that there are very few buildings in the game where you can get housing from. It's not until the mid/end game where you can build residential districts. So until you unlock that district your Civ is fu*cked until then. -A lot of wonders bonuses suck. Sometimes only giving you a few extra faith or culture. Not really worth spending 20 turns to build. -There is no world congress: I miss being able to climb my way up towards becoming the world congress leader and using that power to fuc*k over my enemies. It was an interesting game mechanic in Civ V and for some reason they just chucked it out in Civ VI . -No diplomatic victory option.-Barbarians: Are beyond annoying because they spawn at an incredible rate. As well as when you're found out by a barbarian scout you're basically fu*cked because you have ZERO chance to catch him before he tells his comrades where your delicious city is. -Warmongering penalties mid/late in the game is too harsh: Honestly there's very little point in declaring formal wars because the AI's will take it the same way as if you surprised attacked them. Ever if you're attacking a Civ everyone else dislikes and denounces they will all automatically hate you for formally attacking them.-Everything looks like a brown blob: Areas which you havent explored yet are shown as blank brown peices of paper, areas where you've explored but don't have sight in are just brown. This makes the map and the world when you look around look like a giant brown blob. In my opinon they should just have it where in areas where you don't have sight in be darkened like in Civ V. -Poorly optimized: Civ VI also takes up a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of disk and memory space. It's hard to tab out and after an hour or two of playing when I try to exit the game the game will just freeze (every time). Honestly whenever I open Civ VI I feel like I'm putting my computer through torture. As the game developes and the longer you stay in the game, the longer turns take. Also for some reason whenever I try to place the game on ""High Priority"" to get better fps, the game will automatically turn the Priority setting to low....The Meh:The social policy tree: It's meh for me, I enjoy being able to choose which bonuses my Civ gets, however you won't be using most of the cards you unlock and instead using the same ones you've been using for ages. Also it feels like a grind, you don't really care what you unlock since you most likely won't being using it. So your just grinding until you can get different government types.Government types: I think the idea is awesome, however there are so few it's sad. I would have liked options like a socialist government or a constitutional monarchy, or some other government types. Religion: I like the new religion victory condition and how you can fight AI's religous units with lightning. However, for some reason the AI is compelled to make like 20 religious units which will often overpower your religion. (I find this beyond annoying).Conclusion: Civ VI has the potential to be an awesome game. The art style is there, the leaders have charisma, and enough peices to make every game feel truly unique. However Firaxis prefers to release the game in an very ugly and boring state and then later fix it with expensive DLC's. I guess the days of releasing games in good conditions is over my friends. I wouldn't buy this game unless it's on a good sale, or the DLC's are out and the game is actually in a good condition.			"

												Great game.One negative, but probably easily fixed.The defeat screen. I've seen it a few times now and each time, I have no idea what triggered the defeat since it just says ""you are defeated"". In order to actually see how another nation won, you have to go one more turn and look at the world rankings and then still guess who won and how. It's also at this stage incredibly easy for the AI to get a religious victory through someone elses conquests (you conquer a city and then they get the 50% requirement).I don't know if the win screen is easily broken, I haven't seen that yet.

												CIv 6 has the potential to be a very fun and an engaging game, but for some reason Firaxis is fine with realeasing garbage and fixing it up later with expensive DLC's. Here are some things I dislike and like about this game.The Good: -The graphics: The art style looks very nice and the graphics are suberb. The animations to your units and Civ leaders are very well thought out and look pretty good. The art style and animations help give the Civ leaders in this game a lot of charisma. The areas around your cities look awesome.-Districts: They're really nice ways to spruce up the land around your cities, instead of having everything contained in one city, and everything else being farms or other tile imporvements.-City States: I like how they've re worked city states. Before you would put in so much work towards allying city states and get nothing for it. Now even though someone else is their ally, you still get bonuses if you put in work in becoming their friends. Spies: You get more options for spies in Civ VI, such as the ability to target specific things like destroying other civs production, stealing money, or stealing their tech. I like the wonder animations. It's cool seeing a speed up process of it getting built with your city in the background. The Bad: -The AI is beyond stupid: I usually like to play on the normal difficulty in Civ games, but for some reason the AI poses no real threat at all. One reason is that the AI doesn't upgrade their units (If me and an AI are both in the industrial age, I'll have field canons and they will still have slingers and archers). Another reason is sometimes the AI won't build up an army and if they do they feel compelled to leave them sitting around doing nothing (even when I attack they just sit there to be killed). The AI is just really stupid and broken.-The Agenda system needs to be re-worked: Basically AI's have these agendas which is what helps them decide if they like you or not. The problem is that the agenda system is way to f*ucking broad. I've seen AI who will hate you for building wonders, not being in a war (even though you started the game like 50 turns ago), having explored more land then them, allying with city states, upgrading your fu*cking rescources and many more. The game punishes you with the AI's disliking you, because you're playing the game normally. It's almost impossible to make realtionships in this game with the AI because of this. -Dealing with housing is beyond annoying: Housing basically ♥♥♥♥s with your growth since you don't have enough houses to put your citizens in. The problem is that there are very few buildings in the game where you can get housing from. It's not until the mid/end game where you can build residential districts. So until you unlock that district your Civ is fu*cked until then. -A lot of wonders bonuses suck. Sometimes only giving you a few extra faith or culture. Not really worth spending 20 turns to build. -There is no world congress: I miss being able to climb my way up towards becoming the world congress leader and using that power to fuc*k over my enemies. It was an interesting game mechanic in Civ V and for some reason they just chucked it out in Civ VI . -No diplomatic victory option.-Barbarians: Are beyond annoying because they spawn at an incredible rate. As well as when you're found out by a barbarian scout you're basically fu*cked because you have ZERO chance to catch him before he tells his comrades where your delicious city is. -Warmongering penalties mid/late in the game is too harsh: Honestly there's very little point in declaring formal wars because the AI's will take it the same way as if you surprised attacked them. Ever if you're attacking a Civ everyone else dislikes and denounces they will all automatically hate you for formally attacking them.-Everything looks like a brown blob: Areas which you havent explored yet are shown as blank brown peices of paper, areas where you've explored but don't have sight in are just brown. This makes the map and the world when you look around look like a giant brown blob. In my opinon they should just have it where in areas where you don't have sight in be darkened like in Civ V. -Poorly optimized: Civ VI also takes up a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of disk and memory space. It's hard to tab out and after an hour or two of playing when I try to exit the game the game will just freeze (every time). Honestly whenever I open Civ VI I feel like I'm putting my computer through torture. As the game developes and the longer you stay in the game, the longer turns take. Also for some reason whenever I try to place the game on ""High Priority"" to get better fps, the game will automatically turn the Priority setting to low....The Meh:The social policy tree: It's meh for me, I enjoy being able to choose which bonuses my Civ gets, however you won't be using most of the cards you unlock and instead using the same ones you've been using for ages. Also it feels like a grind, you don't really care what you unlock since you most likely won't being using it. So your just grinding until you can get different government types.Government types: I think the idea is awesome, however there are so few it's sad. I would have liked options like a socialist government or a constitutional monarchy, or some other government types. Religion: I like the new religion victory condition and how you can fight AI's religous units with lightning. However, for some reason the AI is compelled to make like 20 religious units which will often overpower your religion. (I find this beyond annoying).Conclusion: Civ VI has the potential to be an awesome game. The art style is there, the leaders have charisma, and enough peices to make every game feel truly unique. However Firaxis prefers to release the game in an very ugly and boring state and then later fix it with expensive DLC's. I guess the days of releasing games in good conditions is over my friends. I wouldn't buy this game unless it's on a good sale, or the DLC's are out and the game is actually in a good condition.			"

												The addition of districts is a good concept. However, once you build them you need to build additional buildings in each district. I like this feature as well. The reason for the negative review is that you can really only build up about 4 cities before it is suddenly 1900. I understand Civ 6 wants the focus to be on specialized cities but in the real world, countries/cities did not each just focus on 1 or 2 things to accomplish by the 1900s. Everything in game should be able to match real world timelines because after all, the roots of this game was about progressing through history which early Civ games accomplished. I always feel rushed or behind. It doesn't matter whether you choose standard, epoch or marathon. All this provides is the benefit of more turns to move your explorers and soldiers around while the pace of research and constructing still falls behind unless you only focus on specific research paths or only a couple of districts. Throw into the mix that you have to waste turns to create builders more frequently along with everything else and you will feel like you are in the stoneage by the time you reach WW I era. Additonally, I have 3 other complaints. The AI is horrible. You meet another Civ, next turn they want open borders. Seriously, is that how it works in the real world?  You make a trade agreement and the very next turn the civ you are trading with denounces you because you have more great people then they do. My nextl comlplaint is about the starting positions. Choose continents and  you will always get slammed in between 2 other civs right next door. Choose islands and you will always start on a tiny island where you can only build 2 or 3 cities. Choose any option and you will always start in an area where if you move 8 tiles in any direction you will hit snow tiles which are totally useless. Last, when a settler is created the recommed build here option chooses ridiculous locations or if on an island there will sometimes be no recommendation at all because the entire area is crap. Civ 6 is a huge step backwards from Civ 5 which is what I am returning to.			"

												It looks nice. It has some new great features.And that's sadly where the positive stops. It's like they forgot everything that made CIV 5 a great game.Two patches in, and they have yet to adress or fix anything really. But hey atleast they added overpriced DLC :P- Core features are missing or bugged.- AI is an absolute mess, completely unable to play the game.- Very few ""ways"" to play. The higher difficulty you chose, the lesser choices you have if you want to win ( cause of the insane bonusses the AI gets ). My advice, forget about this game for a year or two. If it goes like civ 5, it will be great by then. And much cheaper :)			"

												I give Civilization VI a 9/10. I absolutely love this game so far. This is by far the best Civ game on release, as I'm sure you've heard from everyone else who's played this game. It is so addicting. I started a session Saturday afternoon, and a ""few"" hours go by, and the next thing I know, the sun is rising and it's Sunday morning. I took a brief nap, and when I woke up, I skipped eating breakfast and just played some more Civ. It does have a few minor flaws, and one semi-large flaw, that being how insane the AI is. I build a wonder, and China denounces me. Then a few turns later, they declare war on me. The reasoning was because ""I built more wonders than they did."" This is obviously ridiculous, but it could've been due to the fact I was playing on a higher difficulty. Who knows. I'm sure with the release of the expansions, or even just an ordinary patch, they'll fix that issue. It definitely has more depth on release than any previous Civ game, and because of that, I recommend that you buy this game. It's just too fun to pass up. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to play some Civ VI.			"

												Well... Civilization VI. I was really hyped and eagerly waited for it's release, so much so, that I purchased the Digital Deluxe and therefore own all DLC's up to Persia & Macedonia.I will go through the positive stuff first, from the obvious and superficial downwards: The good Stuff Civ Vi is a pretty game. Some might consider it's style ""Childish"" and ""Casual mobile"" but it looks well made in that regard and has a number of little animations like spinning Watermills, doves over your Holy Sites and nice Movement Animations for Units. The Effects are again cartoony, but in a good way that fits the general Artstyle. Same goes for the Leaders they show thier Emotions clearly and whatever they say correspondes to thier animations. Good Job.The unstacking of cities is brilliant and requires forward thinking planning to get all the bonusses, the usage of mountains that unlike in Civ V now feel like they actually do something Maybe a bit too much so, as wonders take space as well now, so you are basically doomed to know wich victory you want to achive (If you play with enabled victories, I myself turn them off pretty often) and know exactly how you want to set your city up before you even settle it. Apart from that, the system is highly encouraging and entertaining at all times. Science!  the System of Eurekas and Inspirations is great and makes science feel more directed than in Civ V. That's actually really good.The System of Armies and Fleets.  You can throw units together to make them stronger! Great! Unfortunally, there is no visual feedback except for...three tiny stars, so thats sad. Show us that there are more unites or ships involved! Fix pls.Well that's good.Now for the bad stuff or as I like to call it This game is friggn broke! Obviously, the AI. The I has no buissness here. IT's entirely disruptive, the Civs have no personality in how and where they settle, dispite the Agendas wich are a nice Ida, but in reality, are just different reasons for the A""I"" to declare war on you.Everything they do is to hurt and hinder you, esspecially in how they settle: As close to you as possibleThis in a Late Aplha, Early Beta State and has hardly improved over five months. Which is dumb.Oh and they cheat like every terrible player.The UI Is inconvenient. It's not bad, just not good. Why do you make it needlessly hard?Pointless Bugs and I have no goddarn Idea why certain bugs where left in from October and have just been fixed. WHY?`DLC.  There is no point to the Digital Deluxe, because the fist DLC is worthless. Firaxis has been pumping out DLC without fixing thier darn game.Last Point!Balance404 Not Found. DLC Factions Like Poland (Can now into Space) and Australia have culture shock abilities wich are just the worst. The steal Land. Alexander?Never stop conquesting. The Azects? Sure let them build everything in no time.England? You mean that one Civ that never survives? And who and what is a Kongo? Ohhh, the ones that declare war on everyone for not getting all religion are wiped out really early.The Civs are just extremly pooly balanced. Why, just why Firaxis.ConclusionIt is an ok game for now, but I can't truly recommend it as it stands now.The mistakes made by Firaxis are dumb and pointless, by the way.			"

												I pre-ordered thinking this would be a fun and complete game, a new and improved Civ, a step up from the fifth edition. In some ways it is. In most ways I feel it is not. The game feels unbalanced, and dice roley. The pacing is gruelingly slow as well. I think Civ 5 was better, but to be fair it took them years, and several expansions to make civ 5 good. I am going to stay tuned to see if things improve, but I am not looking forward to spending even more money on this game than I already have, just to keep it playable.			"

												I have a lot of good things to say about this game. The mechanics are cool, day/night cycle, fog of war visual change (the map look). This game feels very fresh. But I also have a few pretty bad things that are going to make me not recommend buying this until, like other Civ games, the expansions are out. First of all, I play on Emperor difficulty. Otherwise, Civ is super boring for me and not at all challenging. However, as I am sure most of you other Emperor/Deity players are aware, if you get a bad start on this difficulty you are essentially doomed. So, you want to get a fresh start that just needs to be do-able on these difficulties. So you click the ""restart game"" button, right? Wrong. It doesn't exist in this game. So just now, when I got 4-5 tundra/desert starts (which are WORSE in Civ VI than in Civ V) I literally have to restart or I get steamrolled by barbs or another Civ. And the restart process in Civ VI involves backing out to the main menu, re-selecting EVERY option you just had, and loading again. As someone with a middle of the road PC (upgrading soon), this process takes quite some time. In fact, I just decided to stop trying and play League after the 25 minutes of trying to get a do-able start.Second, the music is just ""Ok"". I much preferred the soundtrack for Civ V. Maybe just me, not sure, but it seems much worse now.Third, the graphics. Probably the thing that caught the most flack before launch were the graphics. I tend to agree now more than I did then. The graphics truly are quite cartoony and definitely feel like a mobile game. I shouldn't just say ""it's the graphics"" because it technically isn't. It's the graphical style. Textures and such are fine, but the stylistic direction for this game was quite poor IMO.Fourth, and the most obnoxious IMO, is the AI. I thought that the AI was supposed to be better in this version of Civ but it feels like the opposite, which says a lot. In both of my playthroughs every Civ ended up hostile for some really dumb reason or another. Telling Civs not to do things literally never works. When you declare war because they didn't stop sending their missionaries or they forward settled you after asking them not to settle near you, you're the bad guy, because the ""casus belli"" system fails to do what it is supposed to in every way. The AI also seems just out-right dumb and far too focused on the agenda system. I get that the Vikings are aggressive, but when they spend nearly 100 turns exhausting warriors and longships on me, I get really agitated. That Civ essentially existed to just severely ♥♥♥♥ with me the entire game, pushed itself into absolute nothingness (it was useless after the 100-turn onslaught), and promptly lost. Not even Joffrey would have been this dumb. Not even close. It was a huge hindrance to me, and no matter how many soldiers of his died on the field, he just kept coming. Makes absolutely no sense. The AI in Civ V didn't make much sense, but at least when they lost they recognized it and admitted defeat.Just wait. This game needs mods, expansions, and patches.			"

												I've tried SO hard to like Civ 6, but I am afraid I am going to have to absolutely BURY it.Graphics - not a patch on Civ 5, looks and plays like a cartoon.Movement –They have ruined the movement dynamics, as hilly/forested terrain now won’t let you traverse it without full movement points.  This is a real ball ache when exploring, and has really messed up the tactical system when engaging in combat.Warfare – the game is now pretty boring, as you need all manner of political capital to wage war effectively.  When the AI gets suitably annoyed with you and decides to invade – it’s always a damp squib in the early eras, just an extended cold war, with an eventual easily managed peace.Maps –They have created this really good artic passageway system at the hemispheres, with one HUGE flaw – they are always blocked by the landmass.  Most times you get this across a huge vertical continent, which means you cannot traverse the map or circumnavigate the world with ships.City-states – On the positive side the diplomacy management for city-states is hugely improved, as are the missions they offer.  On the negative side, city-states seem to create +10 military units and rarely upgrade them, which can mean you get to the medieval period and they still have galleys and starter warriors.  No idea why this bug isn’t patched.Science – AI seems to get to the industrial age by the Middle Ages; this ruins the game dynamic, as it’s not that they are vastly in front of the other players, they just pick a specific route and neglect the other era sciences.  This just plays terribly, as you have knights and bowmen attacking skyscraper cities when the city is more than lively defending with a classical bowman.  They desperately need to put an era restriction in place unless you have x amount of the previous era science developments.  There was a mod for this in Civ 5 – it’s easy to do! Religion – the only positive improvement in the entire game.  Religious victory is great, as is the new religious warfare system.  Summary - £45 for this game is disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful.  It feels unfinished (and I am writing this 4 months after publication), hurried and badly designed.  I’m now so sick of Firaxis and their rotten games – Civ 6 and Beyond Earth are garbage; they no longer know what the hell they are doing with 4x games – many smaller publishers have overtaken them, Firaxis are simply living off the brand name and by subtly copying great Civ 5 Mod ideas and other developers (and then butchering them).  Plus, just to rub it in, they are now asking us to purchase DLC, which I don’t mind on reasonably priced games, but not when they have you paying well over the odds on the initial purchase.  They are absolutely ripping their client base off, I’d advise everybody to boycott their products and DLC until they stop taking Civ fans for granted.  Don’t believe the hype, this is a HUGE step back for the franchise, and probably won’t survive it. "

												Most popular negative reviews reflect my exact thoughts on the worse features of the game, so I won't waste your time repeating them here.The reason I bother giving a bad review is the outrage I feel towards big reviewers, calling this ""the best civ game ever made"" when it was an outright lie, and I'm 100% sure they knew they were lying. I could tell this game didn't have half the charm Civ 5 did the first half hour of playing it. This disgusting display of♥♥♥♥♥kissing only warants a negative review from scorned, disgruntled customers. I gave it a chance, I really did, and I really wanted to enjoy it, considering I paid the extra for the deluxe edition.Some stuff I do like, like the art style and managing districts as efficiently as you can think of, but so many game mechanics seem to have been decided upon simply for the sake of being different from Civ 5, for example changing ""jungles"" to ""rainforests"", or ""amneties"" instead of ""happiness"", and other such unnecessary changes.First Civilization Beyond Earth, now this. Man, Firaxis really dropped the ball on this one. I'm really hoping the next expansion makes it worth playing.			"

												I can honestly say since Playing Civilization since the very first Civilization came out in the early 1990's that this is the first civilization game I do not like.  I only played it a few hours as I like to start on the lowest level so I can try and understand the game.  I was able to beat Civ V on Deity level eventually and other Civilizations on higher levels as well. Within the few hours playing this game I like other reviewers found Barbarians to be the toughest Opponents out there.  This new luxury way of keeping cities happy is ridiculous.  Even at the lowest level I found my cities contantly revolting and spanning tons of barbarians.  The barbarians were coming at higher tech levels than me even with Helicopters and such.  I was so swarmed by barbarians (even after shutting barbarians off in the menu- making it even more ridiculous) that the game was unplayable. When I shut off barbarians I think I should have no barbarians not even from cities revolting which seems to be a constant thing in this civilization game.One of the other big problems I have with the game is the concept of builders.  You build a couple things like mines, etc and the builders just go away.  I don't want to have to spend my entire game constantly building builders (workers I mean) when I could be working on wonders, buildings , military , etc.  Workers have been a constant in all the Civilization games until now.  I want my workers to last the entire game so I can have hundreds of them out building mines, plantations, roads, etc.  I don't want my workers (excuse me builders) going away after three builds and I have to spend time building them again.  If my workers are captured that's one thing but constantly having to build new ones is irritating.This game I feel is the most unplayable Civilization game ever and I wished I never bought it. If you want to see how much I hated it compare my Civizliation 5 Playtime of over 800 hours to my measly playtime on this one.  I really like some changes in Civiliztion 5 like shorter playtime so I can play a game in 2 hours to completion where civilization 1 and 2 a good game was 12 hours at least (which I had more time to play back then). I also really liked Civilization 5 in being only able to have 1 military per square which made combat more interesting.  Also if I shut off barbarians in Civilization 5 I didn't have any and it was much easier to control cities (though not as easy with the happiness as Civilization 1 and 2).Civilization 6 in my opinion is an unplayable and unfun game with cities constantly revolting at low levels and having to constantly build builders.  And I have been a huge fan of Civilization since it was first released.  I feel this is the first Civilization game not worth playing.			"

												Very flawed Science tech issue within the game... and lets not talk about the overly dumb AI..It would be a good game if they could be bothered to fix the base bugs and not fix when they have more DLC to sell..Loved Civ 5.... but something is hugely flawed in Civ 6 that makes you want to put the game down instead of picking it more.It's like an ugly puppy.. you want to love it.. but you just can't. :)			"

												I pre-ordered thinking this would be a fun and complete game, a new and improved Civ, a step up from the fifth edition. In some ways it is. In most ways I feel it is not. The game feels unbalanced, and dice roley. The pacing is gruelingly slow as well. I think Civ 5 was better, but to be fair it took them years, and several expansions to make civ 5 good. I am going to stay tuned to see if things improve, but I am not looking forward to spending even more money on this game than I already have, just to keep it playable.			"

												I'm a little shocked that I cannot recommend Civilization VI, given that I have played every game in the series (almost religiously) since Civilization II.While I feel there are numerous positives to this game, there are also far to many drawbacks for me to recommend this product. The most glaring issues, from my perspective, are two things:Aggressive Expansion Want to build tall? Do you dream of establishing a small, powerful empire that can stand the test of time? Well, you best keep dreaming. In Civilization VI, since there are no penalties for founding cities, more cities = more bonuses. The game requires you to focus on expansion until there is simply no land left to colonize. If you do not make claiming everything around you your number one priority, rival civilzations will become too large to effectively deal with. While I have no issue with playing wide, it is frustrating to be forced into playing a particular style during the early portions of the game.Arbitrary Leaders Why does Cleopatra hate me? Am I not tall, handsome, or Italian enough for her? She's on the other side of the world, yet she randomly sends letters telling me how much she despises me.The AI in this game is exhausting to play against. Not exhausting in a 'difficult' way, it is exhausting in a 'it's-not-paranoia-if-they're-actually-out-to-get-you' type of way. In Civilization VI, you would be wise to assume that everyone hates you. Yes, everyone. Did you just meet Queen Victoria? She hates you. What does that telegram from Teddy Roosevelt say? He's just reminding you of how much he hates you. Did you just see Gandhi waving at you from across the border? He's waving goodbye to you, because he completed the Manhattan Project 20 turns ago and the guy loves thermonuclear induced winter.Summary At the end of the day, Civilization VI has potential, however it lacks the magic of previous entries in the series. When I play this game, I do not feel like I'm going on adventure into the unknown with my empire. Too many gameplay elements make my decisions feel predetermined, which makes me no longer wonder of what lies ahead for my own civilization. Stick with Civilization II, III, IV, V, or even Alpha Centari.			"

												game needs serious overhual from its current state.  just too many mechanics are broken or very unbalancing.  -warmonger needs to be fixed or properly explained and fleshed out.  currently they say there is a way it acrues and a way it decreases but i have tested it and it is false.  what i think is happening sometimes is that i go to war with an AI and the city states go to war with them, then they loose suzerin status but the city state is still at war.  funny thing is that i havent discovered the city state yet, so im stuck searching the globe for an odd city state at war with me, just so i can decrease my war monger penalty and my negative social attitude with our civs.  also if one civ goes to war against a city state and i join them, they will denounce me as a war monger even though we're attacking the same civ or city state.  kind of silly-AI is horrible.  they will attack you with one wave and thats it.  then they wont give up until you have a bunch of units right next to their city.  even though barbarians are rampaging through their lands tearing their economy to bits. -in diety mod AI always attacks you within 10-20 turns.  i had to manually change the start location of civs to avoid an early rush.  i like playing the long game, so the idea of beating them to the punch seems bad in my opinion.  but i guess there will always be other civs to conquer in the long run.  barbairans spawn way to aggresively, or way to infrequently.  there is no middle ground.  either i need to spawn units to fend them off from one camp that spawns one horseman a turn, or they arent present at all and every civ has carte blanche to settle whatever land they want.  it needs to be balanced. as i find it eithe overwhelming or insignificant.  currently, i love playing the game, but these are just some of my major gripes.  i will wait for some more updates etc... before i change this to a positive review (hopefully) in the future.

												The Good:Happiness is goneBetter lookingDistricts are coolThe Bad (gamebreaking at the moment):The AI is terrible, no matter what dificulty level, war is incredibly easy. You get penalties if someone declares war on you...It's basically impossible to not have most of the Civs hating you even if you don't declare war on anyone.Too much micro management, telling same cities to do industrial/science/gold projects every 8 turns. Reassigning trade routes over and over is tedious. Spying is tedious and annoying.  Frigates and Battleships are overpowered, way too easy to take coastal cities with them.			"

												Most popular negative reviews reflect my exact thoughts on the worse features of the game, so I won't waste your time repeating them here.The reason I bother giving a bad review is the outrage I feel towards big reviewers, calling this ""the best civ game ever made"" when it was an outright lie, and I'm 100% sure they knew they were lying. I could tell this game didn't have half the charm Civ 5 did the first half hour of playing it. This disgusting display of♥♥♥♥♥kissing only warants a negative review from scorned, disgruntled customers.

If  you have played the previous titles then you should know that this fllows the pattern 4 was better than 5 and... well it's hard to say if 5 is better than 6 but you get the idea.

												I was pretty hyped to play this game when it came out, but found it relatively boring in comparison to other games. The mechanics aren't really brought forward in a way that makes them clear which makes wanting to play the game multiple times less appealing. In a 4x game that's kind of important. That being said, I don't know if I really gave this game a chance. But at a $60 price tag...all I'm saying is that the level of engagement I felt was lacking. The game is extremely polished, just don't know if it will drive you to discover if it has the depth it might have.			"

They definitely added some cool elements to the game (like the district system), but it fell very flat on me. Was intrigued with all the new elements at first, but by about hour thirty when I had wrapped my head around the wonders, districts, war, units, terrain, diplomacy, civs, trade, religion etc... the game became stale and boring.

They go ahead and surprise you again!Pros:- interesting builder system, kinda works- Nice artwork for the tiles- Love that a city isn't just 1 tile anymore, but hate how they went about doing that (see below)- Fluid culture system- UI is ok, similiar to Civ V but a little cleaner designCons- Terrible AI - Boring gameplay - Too many limitations that are designed to force you to ""specialise"" your city, but just result in tedious placements and WTF moments of why you can't expand your 24 person city because you can only have 6 buildings adjacent to the main city tile- Combat is pretty weak- Techs are pretty boring- Maps seem repetitive, despite removing ""starting bias"" and always using randomised- Civs are ok, they have a nice characteristics attribute, but its nullified due to the steaming turd which is the warmongery system- Diplomacy is a myth- Terrible AI (just to reiterate)- Worst ""DLC"" (since thats what they call it, even if it has less content than a premium packet of crisps... the ones that just come with air) for a fairly reliable company- AT THE TIME OF THIS REVIEW: they disabled workshop, meaning even if people wanted to fix the game for them... they can'tIn short: Buy Civ 5; its cheaper, it allows for steam workshop and its pretty much the same game except the culture rework (though there might be a mod for that soon)Maximum amount you should pay for this game: £20 - $25			"

												Until the modding tools, or some decent DLC, are released I cannot recommend this game as it stands. At least not at full price. Don't get me wrong, the game is very fun, for a while anyway. The AI is not exactly what I would call ""challenging"" and there are more than a few frustrating bugs. If Firaxis has no desire to really give feedback on fixing those, they would be smart to release the modding tools so that the community will do their job for them. They seem to be of the opinion that mods will cut down on their DLC sales. I would put forth to them that if a mod keeps interest in your game going, players are more likely to BUY your DLC. Especially if it requires it. I'm saddened to have to say this about this agem as I love the civ games. Still with the AI issues, bugs, EXTREMELY long load times in late game (upwards of 4 minutes in some cases), and lack of variety in play, the game gets old fast.			"

												OK so played a few games now.  The biggest problem is the massive disproportinate negative effects for being in the unfortunate position of having war declared on you.  Basically and in general you cannot trade or have diplomatic agreements with anyone from this point onwards (for the whole rest of the game - its idiotic). I'm sure there is an order of magnitude error in warmonger penalties.  It makes the game unplayable.  I tried avoiding this and it is possible but makes for a very boring game - basically you need to be in a globally  dominant position before going to war and fully self sufficient.  No sneaky deals with CIVs saying one thing and doing another with back channels.  It all very dumbed down. Very sad it seems that the makers or this game have basically cashed out.  Dont buy it or wait for Mods to fix these issues.  Also there are enough maps in the base game and no granualrity in the advanced game set up - no raging barbarians,  Trading is also poor (again) why not see all available luxy resources available for trade so you can make informed decisions.  Not happy with this expensive game.			"

												Civ VI is a fantastic addition to the Civilization franchise, from its gameplay tweaks, additions, and aesthetics. It is also surprisingly more polished than previous Firaxis releases, which is a big plus!One of the first things you hear is Sogno Di Volare, the game's AMAZING new theme. For longtime Civ fans, it's by the same person who composed Baba Yetu for Civ VI. The rest of the game's soundtrack is equally as impressive as the theme, especially as you get into the later eras of the game (your civilization's theme progresses as you do)!Anyone who didn't like the lack of depth of Civ V upon release won't be making the same complaints here. Religion, Tourism, and Trade are in base game, and at their full potential compared to their representatives in Civ V. The new District system makes planning ahead that much more important, and a lot of other changes to existing mechanics allow more decision-making and specialization to how you play (for instance, all Great People and City States have unique bonuses)! My personal favorite feature, Espionage, is back as well - it's much more in-depth than in Civ V, and anyone who's played Civ IV will be delighted to know that the mechanic is back in its full glory.Concerns about the game's cartoony art style are subjective - I personally find it helpful in quickly identifying what exactly is on the map. The minimap could be improved, as it's a bit difficult to discern certain things at the moment.Some negatives - the UI is laid out a bit oddly, although I admit that I can't pinpoint what's exactly off with it. It looks like some tooltips are missing as well, such as where Tourism is being generated. The auto unit switching has a delay and can switch even after you've selected another unit, which is annoying. These are all minor complaints, however.The game is very well optimized - I had a low-mid-range laptop rig (2.4 Ghz processor, Nvidia 640M) and can run the included benchmark at ~48 fps average on low-medium settings.Multiplayer is mostly flawless - there was a bug I encountered in a game lobby where it appeared there was an ""unsupported amount of players"" when there really wasn't. Also, for some reason, some turn processing times take very long. Zero crashes or desyncs for me so far!Overall, I am very pleased with this iteration of Civ VI - it a lot more gameplay mechanics in a vanilla release, along with a great soundtrack. This is a very high recommendation for me!			"

												DISCLAIMER This review talks about single player and singleplayer only.     This is not a bad game, HOWEVER it is missing some major features. For example, if you set up a game and start it up and dislike the start, then you can't restart the game with the same settings, you could do this in Civ 5. Here, if you dislike your start, than you'll have to return to the main menu and redo all your settings (such as difficulty, game pace and victory conditions.) Civ balance is terrible as in my opinion there are only a couple that are enjoyable to play as (Germany, Kongo) all the others are boring or awful (Sythia is good but boring to play as past the classical Era). The devs suggested that we'd have a true start map in the base game but we don't, they most likely want to squeeze money out of us in expansion packs.The diplomacy agenda system is screwed up because civs like India will start to dislike you for not having nuclear weapons in the ancient Era and you won't be able to fix this until the atomic Era but by then they will have denounced and probably declared war on you (their agenda is BS India has declared 3 formal wars on me without nuking me). Another problem is that if a Civ starts to dislike you, then it's very hard to turn the relationship around. I do like the new government system but 90% of the civics are useless. I also think that satin himself invented the religious victory as it is by far the most frustrating victory I have ever won and it just made me want to pull my hair out.  This game isn't all bad but I wouldn't recommend it until it gets cheaper and they patch the game up.			"

												I'm a long time fan of the Civ series.  After playing through several Civ 6 games, I feel like it wants to be a great game... it just can't quite get there.  I like all the design changes, the districts, the mini-stacks, the concept of national parks, etc.  The reason I can't recommend it is the poor AI around Settlers and City Planning.  In it's current state, it makes the game almost unplayable, which is a shame considering what it has to offer in other areas.My experience comes from playing a variety of different Civs on standard, small, and tiny map sizes. I played on prince difficulty at standard speed. AI civs don't seem to look for sensible plots near their own capitals, at least they don't prioritize them.  In all my games, AI civs go out of their way to build right on top of the non-AI controlled player.  On a tiny map, I watched both AI Civs on my continent send their very first settlers all the way across the map so they could attempt to settle right on top my capital.  They ignored perfectly legit locations near their own capitals to do so.  In other games, I fought to build up a matrix of cities over time, only to have AI settlers swoop and plant doomed cities in the tiny gaps where I intended my cities to eventually expand into. As a player, I do like to leave some space between my cities so they can grow.  That's sort of the whole point, unless your Japan with their bonus.  These aren't big gaps mind you, and I still end up with overlapping tiles in the end.  However, if you attempt to plan ahead early on, your city placement will result in some temporary gaps between your cities.  AI Civs seem to go out of their way to exploit these gaps.  It's like the AI is going out of it's way to jam you, almost to point of ""griefing"". You can't stop this diplomatically.  If you open your borders, then you're going to get settler spam.  The only way to prevent this is go to war.  You can do this proactively by having scouts look for encroaching settlers, and picking them off before they can build.  This is a great way to farm settlers, but it's not mechanic I want to be ""forced"" into.  If you aren't proactive, then the AI is going to settle right on top of you eventually.  You'll be forced to raze their poorly planned city in order to expand your own, earning a hefty 3x warmonger penalty for your efforts.  Dealing with this persistent settler spam is a big reason why I'm constantly flagged as a ""warmonger"" in my games. There is a great game in here somewhere, and I hope it comes out down the road.  They just don't have a winning AI formula yet.			"

												I really can't reccommend this over Civ 5. Sure there were a few good improvements, like the Builders vs Civ 5 workers, cultural cards (which can become very annoying if you're a civ that focuses culture) and different governments.However, these improvements are few and far between. Most of the factors that differ from Civ 5 actually take away from the experience rather than add to it. For instance, I ONLY play Civ with friends, and usually we team up and stack the AI against us, as AI has never been a strong suit of the series, and we always found it more enjoyable to play 2v3 or 2v4 to make up for the stupidity of the AI. However, Firaxis completely removed team play from Civ 6 (it can be edited back in, but it doesn't work well) meaning that if you want to be on a team, you have to do it in game, which, when the AI hates each other almost at much as it hates you, never works out well for the AI.Other features that were added just seem incomplete. The trade screen is just horrid, especially for a first timer. It's cluttered and often times i forget to confirm a trade route, as in previous games you just chose which city to trade with and you were done, whereas now it has a confirm button, which isn't bad, if it were visible at all times.The AI is more sporatic than ever with the new diplomatic system. It seems to have just given AI more reason to declare war on you than before. AI is one of the core mechanics of the game, and when you're 200 turns in with 3 ALLIES and they all declare war on you for no reason whatsoever (yea, we know that guy declared war on you, and you were just defending yourself, but ♥♥♥♥ you) It's just frustrating. I get it, AI is hard. But it shouldn't be that hard to implement a system where an AI views it's relationship with you before determining whether or not to declare war, or a system to determine who was the aggressor in a war. (Seriously, it's like all of 2 functions ""If player character is Ally > don't declare war. If player character declared war on AI > view player as warmonger > Else if > view AI as warmonger"")Oh and then ♥♥♥♥ing $5 for every civ as a DLC.Go and buy Civ 5. It's a much better and cheaper game.			"

												Like almost anyone else who chose to review, I have been a huge fan of civilization. I'd waited awhile but I eventually had worked up the nerve to spend $60 on it because I'd been bored of Civi V for awhile. Either way if you're on the fence about buying this it's not worth it, here's whyPros:- It's a fresh change from Civi V- The perks of leaders aren't as swayed (for example Catherine's perk of double strategic resources in Civi V) and that makes the game interestingly difficult - Some developments like adding districts (not just buildings) makes the game a little bit more in depth rather than the detatched construction that it once had. Another would be builders being dispensible, it makes user maintnence and utility easier. - More luxury resources/ less stategic resources (ads a level of specialty to units that require them)Con:- THE F*CKING BANE OF THIS GAME: DIPLOMACY/WAR!!! Diplomacy is a joke, I've had three playthroughs and literally in the classical era every single civi I'd met had declared war on me at the same f*cking time. HOWEVER as Fraxis decided to make everyone aggressive they ALSO made war  SIGNIFICANTLY harder, but even worse they added intense penalties and horrible response. - CARTOONY GRAPHICS!?!? WHAT THE HELL FRAXIS? It made the game soooo lame, my favorite part of Civi V that Civi IV seriously lacked on was these kick♥♥♥♥♥graphics. I didn't even realize that I'd liked them until it looked like TellTale was the arts director for this game. - Changes in moving. - OK choosing the player models for countries: you chose Teddy Roosevelt for America and Peter the Great for Russia? What the hell is that?			"

												(This is a very early review for Civ VI on a Mac.)I've owned literally every version of Civilization there's ever been -- starting with Civilization for DOS, then Civ for Windows, CivNet... I think I even owned the weird Activision rip-off version that came somehwere around the time of CivNet and Civ II.In all those years (around 25), on all the various computers and operating systems I have tried to play it on, none of them bleeding edge systems, believe me, this is the very first version of Civilization that is unplayable due to performance issues out of the box.I'm currently using a four-year old (almost to the day) iMac.  While this is obviously not a thoroughly modern computer, it's not a relic from another era either.  It can't run Civ VI even with all of the graphics features turned off or set to their lowest quality.  The most glaring example is that to give a unit a command to move you have to wait up to 3 seconds after right-clicking on a hex before the computer responds to the command.  By three seconds I literally mean counting out loud:  one-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand....  This is appallingly bad performance, it's actually shocking to me that it has been released in this state.  This is the performance of the game in the first 20 turns; I can only imagine how awful it gets once the map is populated with cities etc.Most likely this is a Mac port issue and PC's are seeing better results.  That's just a gut feeling.To compare, Civ V runs perfectly well on my iMac.  As do most other games I play (Diablo IV, Starcraft II, X-COM, etc.)  So, no, I don't feel my computer is in need of replacement, I just think this is some really bad coding.UPDATE:  Having given up on playing this game on my iMac, I installed it on my MacBook Pro, which has somewhat better specs.  In particular I discovered the game recommends 1GB of video memory; the iMac has only 512 MB and the MacBook Pro has 1.5 GB.  The MacBook Pro easily exceeds all the required technical specifications.  I hoped that I'd find the game fully playable on the MacBook Pro due to the greatly increased video memory.  If anything the performance is worse, with all graphical options on minimum.  To give a single example, I just executed a move order on the second turn of a brand new game and counted one-one-thousand all the way up to seven-one-thousand before the game responded to my mouseclick.  Seven seconds -- on the second turn of the game!  Disgraceful.UPDATE 2:  (Just trying to keep it real by communicating what I learn as it happens...)  I discovered how to lower the resolution to the 1991-era 1280x786 (or something like that).  There was no noticeable improvement in the performance of the game at this archaic, eye-bleeding low resolution, so one begins to suspect the problem is not the graphics card at all but just really, really brutally bad coding.

Product received for free
												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET! WAIT FOR MORE DLCS, MODS AND FOR IT TO GO ON SALE!My friend brought this game for me on special, i did tell him to wait but he didnt, i am very thankful for the gift, im more annoyed at the game and developers.This is an unfinished, unironed game. Fireaxis released a very unfinished, crumpled game and are going to make their fans and players pay through the nose so that it is a game worth playing over Civ V.The Civs are nice, they all seem pretty strong or over powered such as Scythia and China or they are weak as♥♥♥♥♥♥and their bonuses are next to useless such as Japan which has been royally ♥♥♥♥ed, the worst of military bonuses if it's not some sort of island map and the special building is not perticularly great or that amazing. Germany is the new Mongolia, France is pretty much the same other than being lead by an Italian. Rome is a different, its no longer a 'make everything in the capital' oriented civ, rather it has a relitively♥♥♥♥♥♥bonus with regards to trade routes, like, useless. The AI in the game is a bit touchy, do a lot of the time you wont have any allies or friends unless you REALLY try.Religion has improved but at the same time gone down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, if your cities get converted to a different religion, all of them even your holy city, that's it, your religion is dead and AI LOVE to spam missionaries and Apostles, I mean have an army of them... OH and you cant take missionaries with military units, you can only fight them with your religious units which is slow and when they are sending 3-4 missionaries up there every few turns so if you declare war you still cant do ♥♥♥♥ all and dont even get me started on the holy cities presure output, it is about the same as a preacher in space without a space suit plumeting towards the earth and him saying he'll survive as his face melts away and his body disintergrates.The new District system is fun, interesting and a bit fiddly at times, you must plan ahead which I like, it requires some actual brain power for the first few games. On a side note Japan doesnt actually seem to get its bonuses from having districts next to each other.Combat is ok, i like seeing all the extra stats and so on, mounted units however seem increadibly strong against anything but pikemen even then if you have 2 knights against 1 pike, you win. Don't bother with swordsmen or muskets, pikes and crossbows is all you need for the first half of the game. Sieging is different, a bit easier or harder depending on how you look at it, I've never actually seiged a city before yet but I've looked at the stats and some videos.Tech is ok, but too fast (At least on Online mode, online mode is WAY too quick) You get swordsmen, 10 turns later if youre of ok playing abilities you'll have longswordsmen, once you get knights, only a few turns to field cannons which can wipe them out and any other unit for that matter, in other words, it's very hard to go to war with someone who has roughly the same size military as you.Culture is nice, its different, it's more complicated but so much more customizable and tweaky fun, later on at least, again for the first half of the game, pretty much there are only a few things you really choose because the rest are♥♥♥♥♥♥or not your play style or included in your plans.City states are fun now, they are no longer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and they are harder to lose in terms of an ally.Wonders now have to be build next to certain districts and on certain land which is very nice, now one person will have a little tiny bit of trouble getting all the wonders. There are now however, wonders that can not be built for the majority of the game until someone decides it'd be cool to pick it up or they have nothing better to do.Victory types, religion is the easiest, i havent achieved one yet but i believe if i wanted to, i could win the game before modern era with religion, maybe sooner, domination is the same, science is pretty much the same, culture is different and weird still dont have a full grasp of it.With only 10 hours it's not much, I prefer to try and play more but , every single expierence ive had with this game so far has been bad, barbars are op as hell if they have horses, civs are either op or next to useless and dont feel unique or their bonuses are useless, I prefer Civ V.

												Love Civ. Civ has given me a lot. Civ has taught me a lot. Civ is basically my age. Civ AI has always been important and always been a let-down. This Civ is, IMHO, the best iteration of Civ; this Civ's AI is the worst iteration of AI.I've had fun with this Civ (quite a lot of fun, mostly during the beginning when I was exploring the game's functions, etc.). Honestly, though? I've had more boredom than I've had fun. The AI is boring, predictable, and worst of all, hardly employs half the features of the game to any meaningful extent.If I had more friends who played Civ, maybe it'd be worth it (when I try multiplayer—though rumour has it there's an update upcoming or something, so who knows—there's at most 5-8 games to pick from). As it stands. though? I regret getting it.Moreover, I loath the way they're doing the dlc and the prices they're demanding for so little that doesn't do anything about the boredom of the mid-game and the AI. I'll check out the first actual expansion, and if it looks promising and actually offers something promising (and lives up to it), then maybe. That's the standard Civ attitude, I suppose. 'With expansions, it's a full game.' Which means I spent a ton of money on less than a full game, which seems accurate.So yeah. Wait for the expansion(s). See what people say then. Until then, I'll stay away.			"

												Civ V was my first in this series and I loved it, so I expected this to be great as well, though I now realise that it was great because I got Civ V after all DLC was released. It seems I'll have to wait a few years before playing this properly, as it's in many ways illogical (e.g. my landlocked powerhouse empire being mocked by Harald Hadradda because he had one ship to my non-existent navy), and incomplete (no real earth map, really?). More important game mechanics don't work well either (infintely slow wonder construction, culture/science importance) but other reviews cover them in more detail (you can see I haven't bothered playing for too long).See you in 3 years!p.s.

												The game has been improved a lot by the Australian Summer patch and the Spring patch, it's what the game should have been at release. The AI can defend itself a lot better, plus they are more likely to be fond of you rather than just being upset and denouncing you. Diplomacy is a good bit better than Civ V IMO. The agenda system is an improvement, if your not warring Gorgo or Alexander will dislike you so if you're playing peaceful, starting next to them is a challenge.The game is at the right difficulty now IMO. In my recent Emperor game I was going for a Culture victory but fell a bit behind on Science. When I had Field Cannons and Musketmen, Australia invaded me and took me out with their tanks and Artillery. Not only did they have the more advanced tanks, they are ""Army"" tanks, not just single tanks.I also tried to go for a Culture victory on Emperor with Kongo, a powerful Cultural Civ, but I was really struggling. Before I used to have good success at Immortal difficulty, but I got took out fairly early on in my 3 Immortal games so far. I feel like i'll have to get a lot better before stepping up.Civ VI base game is a lot more complete than Civ V with all it's expansions. You can found an Empire rather than just going Tradition, founding 4 cities and rushing Rationalism tradition, which was by far the superior way to go in Civ V. I also like that Spies can steal Money from other Civ's and that you can create rebellions in other Civ's cities. The ability to steal Great Works from other Civ's is nice.So overall, having put over 2000 hours into Civ IV and 849 hours into Civ VI, I say I am definitely content with how Civ VI is and like the direction it is going. IMO when it gets all it's expansions it will be superior to Civ V, and who knows, it could even challenge Civ IV.			"

												Civ VI is definitely more of the same, but with a very different aproach in mechanics. It seems to be more challenging than 5, with difficult decisions on what and where to build districts in your city. The larger your city gets the more difficult some of those decisions are. The AI seems to be pretty intelligent, but what is really stands out is that they each have their own personalities. The game is a step up, and it's quite amazing. I'm really loving my time with Civ VI so far.			"

The only bad feeling about this game is that it's performance is very poor. The games seem to last longer than in civ 5 and bots are a lot more agressive which is one of my favorite things that they have done for the game so far. Bots don't sit around sucking their thumbs all game. They now declare surprise wars and other kind of wars on you. There is also another bad thing which is that bots are very hard to get on your side as allies. They almost never like you and when they do, they just change their goverment which makes your relation to them into pure♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I can't recommend this game over Civilization V.In 6, we see some improvements to gameplay, like city districts.  City districts are amazing.  We see some really great ideas like with highly customizeable government policies.But inevitably I compare this game with Civ V, and I feel that VI is needlessly complicated.  Civ VI seems to give you more choices to make, more mechanics to micromanage... but the reward for your effort feels very low.  In V, you pay attention to the little details, and it helps you out immensely, but in VI you pay attention to the little details, and it might help you out some.A lot of this bland-ening of difference in choices seems to be to make the game more evenly matched across all of the civilizations.  Unfortunately it removes that rewarding feeling you get as a player that you used to get in V, when you settled near the right resources as <any civ that exploits resources in V>, or got that great unit trade with an almost-dead Japanese unit.Being strategic in V takes some skill feels rewarding.  Being strategic in VI takes more skill and feels less rewarding.And don't even get me started on the cartoony direction it's going...			"

												As a veteran of CIV V, I cannot recommend the game at it's current state. Is it an improvement on it's predecessor? Yes, though a marginal improvement. There are alot of changes that I really like, but there aren't enough to keep me enthralled with the game. I've grown more and more so skeptical of Firaxis with every game they release, so I'm not even going to say: ""wait for the expansions"". No, I'm not even going to recommend waiting for a steamsale; blasphemy!Instead I recommend you and your wallet to stand the test of time and wait until: all expansions are released, the game is properly patched, and steam drops a hefty discount.So, maybe come back in 3 á 4 years...

												By the Nine Divines, what has happened to one of my favorite time sink series? The game looks shiny and neat, and I like the idea of districts and being forced to specialize cities and expand instead of turtling up in two or three key cities. But that's about where my praise stops. There is no such thing as peace, no matter what you do. At the lower difficulties you'll be spammed by denouncements and eventually Joint (and not the fun kind) War declarations solely because you're doing better than everyone else. And while your enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥marks at the lower difficulties, the tedium of endless war and the constant dedication of resources to the war machine result in the map ending up like Aleppo. Normally carving a huge swathe of destruction Sherman-style would be a good thing, right? But somehow Firaxis winds up sucking the fun out of mass genocide.Then there's the City-States, which are a neat idea implemented worse than the Bay of Pigs. If one isn't planted square on your doorstep then it'll be on the nearest resource you absolutely have to get. If you want to take it for yourself then you'll either have to befriend them and send envoys to get their resources and aid, which pisses off about half of the Leaders, or taking it by force. Good luck there, because I have yet to see a City-State with a military that could fit into it's borders. You can mod them out, but I'll get on that in a moment.So let's say that, like me, after about 20 hours of endless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that sees you endure the pain to the Industrial Era once before you quit for something more fun like Overwatch or smoking, you identify the above problems and search for mods to help. Firstly, good luck finding a mod to fix your problems, it took me clicking TWO links in my google search to find one to remove City-States. but then when you kick off your next game you notice something: Without the massed forces of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥-States fighting back the Barbarians, you're going to be responsible for curbing all of them. So now resources must be dedicated to the war machine to fight off an almost literally endless horde of enemies. that's fine and all, except the game also has this odd tendency to plop a Barbarian Camp spawning horsemen every five turns right outside your borders. ""♥♥♥♥,"" you say to yourself, ""I've got an option to remove Barbarians, why don't I do that?""Because by know you should know how this is going to go.So now you start your new game, a good old classic Civilization game on a big ol' Continental map. Should be good! But then you take a good look at the map, proud of setting your third city, only to notice that every single other smeglord has twice your cities, equal to yours in pop, with districts and buildings galore. And that's at all difficulty levels.I want to have fun with the game so bad. You can see how much time I've put into it. But there is, as of yet, no way to find any kind of balance to the game that makes any strategy other than spamming military viable. I'm sure that even on a huge world consisting solely of myself and one other civ would end in a massive fireball a decade after we made contact.It's a shame I can't return this for a reduced amount now that I've played it for so long trying to find the fun and joy that the series has brought me up until now. I can honestly say that after the first couple games I have had almost no enjoyment from the game. I'm still playing (in fact it's open in another window right now), and probably will keep doing so, but only because I'm an idiot who hopes that maybe, just once, I'll have a good run that doesn't feel like a chore.

												I bought the Collectors Edition for Civ6, after activating all three keys and downloading in the vicinity of 4,5 GB, I could finally start my first game of Civilization 6.The intro is the same as the launch trailer.Went through the options, set it all up good (high quality on everything) and started my very first game! Went with Gilgamesh and having a blast!Easily the best Civ game at release to date! And since Civilization games only get insanely better with each DLC and expansion, this is on its way (with a major head start) in becoming the best Civilization game to date! Easily even blowing Civ4 out of the water.Pro highlights The new district system is making me really think about my city placement, and how to build it up. Empire planning is so much more important with this iteration. And I'm loving that! The new unit movement takes some getting used to. Mainly because it's different. By now I'm used to it and find it makes more sense then all all the previous versions of Civ.Con highlights The pathing AI and what the AI wants to do with settlers and great people can be improved. Sometimes they keep these around in their empire in large numbers, seemingly unaware of what to do with them. "

												I love Civilization games. I also love most of the new features that come along with the newest release. I love the music, sound effects, and the new artstyle. However, the game is not working as supposed to, and I cannot recommend it to anyone at the moment untill the following things get fixed. To name a few:- Extremely bad AI (unescorted settlers, bad city placement, no city defence from AI, idiotic diplomacy, horrible tactical AI, it spends most of its time wandering, unoptimized district use) etc.- There are no drawbacks to any decision you make.- Production is too slow; techs and civics are way too fast.- Agendas don't really seem to affect what the different AI players do.- The UI is laggy and uninformative.- Lack of balance is terrible.Maybe in two or three years this game will become what it deserves to be?

												My biggest problem with this game is the AI difficulty.  I'm currently playing three different save files, one for each of the first three diffuculty levels and I have to say, something feels off.  The first difficulty is exactly what you'd expect, pretty easy, however AI declares war often.Second difficulty level feels like a huge jump from the first one, AI builds up insane military within the first 100 turns, not just a big military, it feels like an impossible military to have in 100 turns.  AI declares war religiously.Third difficulty level, I don't even know what happened here.  Maybe I didn't have the greatest start, but my god, it feels like I'm living in a mad max like world, everybody is at war with everybody, everything is up in flames.  Met an AI, and in 5 turns they declared war on me with a sizeable military, have not gone back to play this save file yet, but I know I'm doomed.If you're thinking of buying this strictly for the single player, I would recommend against it.  One of the most skewed strategy games/Civ games I think I've ever played.This game does not feel like it's worth the money I spent on it.			"

												It really saddens me to give this game a thumbs down. Civ has been my favourite game since Civ 1, and I was really looking forward to this instalment. Unfortunately it was  real let down. My only hope is that they patch it. As I recall, vanilla Civ 5 was not all that great.One quick disclaimer about my review - I am going to be explaining things as I experienced them. I have purposefully not read all the details of all the mechanics of Civ 5 (I of course read about the basic differences). With all versions, I like to learn the basics and play by feel for a while - just to extend that feeling of actually building an empire rather than playing a computer game.The good:1. I love what they did with the governments and civics. It feels like a combination of the early Civs (where you had actual governments) with the civics of Civ 5 plus so much more. I was really impressed here, and it really adds a dynamic element that you can continuously change between different kinds of civics in anticipation of what you will be doing in the next few turns.2. The districts - this appears under both pros and cons. Overall, the idea is great and I like it. It adds a tile management strategy to the game. 3. The wonders - as above, this appears under both headings. I like the tile management aspect.4. They seemed to have removed penalties for larger kingdoms (as in Civ 5). I can only approve.5. They went back to the traditional city-based happiness model. This is real Civ.The bad:1. The AI and the warmongering penalties. I dont know what to say here. The AI is beyond abysmal. It routinely wages war and me and then sends no units. Like NONE. It is upset with me constantly and everyone is denouncing me for the most idiotic reasons. And because they are always mad at you for no good reason, you can rarely make a decent deal with them either. A few examples of AI/programming stupidity:i) I found a religion. Next turn I denounced by Kongo for not having spread it to them. The next turn. I barely knew where the hell Kongo was on the map exactly.ii) I build one wonder and am denounced by China for having more wonders than they do. That remained permanent because, despite their builder bonus, they cant build♥♥♥♥♥♥iii) America declares war on me in the ancient era, sends no troops (not ONE) but refuses any kind of peace arrangement until the Renaissance. They were on the other end of the map. Logical.iv) I build a peaceful kingdom and am attacked constantly (or more correctly, war is declared constantly). The AI declares war on me in groups - ok I understand that, but they send almost no units. The biggest culprit is Brazil, my neighbour. After centuries and centuries of fending off my borders and otherwise being a sweetheart, I have enough of Brazil and I declare war. EVERYONE denounces me as a warmonger, including America (see above). That was my ""♥♥♥♥ it"" moment when I decided to screw international relations altogether and just beat them the old fashioned way.2) Increasing district costs. I am not sure of the formula, but they increase in cost throughout the game. Very annoying because it makes later cities difficult to improve.3) Lack of worker automation - I get why this had to be removed with the new tile management system and the fact that worker ""charges"" are extremely valuable. However, operating a large kingdom is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥particularly when dealing with the new small graphics (see below).4) Wonder restriction. It is frustrating that they added so many restrictions to wonders. I understand what they were thinking, and they were aiming at an added strategic element, but it makes it way too luck based. And they are ridiculously specific, not just desert for the pyramids (which is annoying enough), but like ""must be on a hill next to a mountain"", ""must be on xxx next to xx district"". The matters of taste:1. The movement: Movement is rounded down, so you cant use the last movement point to cross a river, enter a forest, etc. This is ok, it was similar in the early Civs, but I don’t like that you also cant attack a unit in these squares with your last movement point. Makes for chasing barbarians around in circles. I also think roads do not offer enough of a bonus. Clearly the programmers never tried hiking over rough terrain.2. Graphics. Some people love them, some people hate them. I mostly dislike them. I don’t like the cartoon elements, but more than that I find it hard to get an overview of this map. I literally get tired.Conclusion:I am sure I missed a few things, but overall, this game stirs up no passion. It feels tedious and annoying, largely due to the AI but also due to other obstacles the game throws your way. The other Civ games I would play late into the night and I could hardly put them down. Remember that whole, ""just one more turn"" thing? That's what I have to tell myself now just to convince myself to take another turn of this thing.			"

												Just like with vanilla Civ V back then, there's a lot to like in this iteration of Civ. While I find the unstacking of cities and the district sprawl a sharp contrast to the older games and the convoluted build requirements for some stuff requires active planning 5,000 years in advance, it actually succeeds in creating meaningful choices. The split tech trees and the religious combat add layers to the overall gameplay, and the limited pool of great people and the ability to buy them with either gold or faith works nicely via addition by substraction - no longer will you be able to have four great generals standing around by the late game.Unfortunately, every single good addition to the game, and the strong Civ V core that was carried over into VI, are completely unraveled by the horrible pace of the game, which is almost entirely down to the way in which movement has been changed in VI. Units can no longer move into terrain if they can not pay the required movement points in full, including river crossings. In addition to that, roads can not be built anymore (by most civs) except by running trade routes  , which is only possible to other cities and thus greatly limits the ability to get a road down in a perhaps strategically important location, or by a special support military unit that won't pop up until the second half of the game, and even if you get those roads down, they will scarcely be of any use until late in the game. Coupled with the random map generator's tendency to create swaths of hill terrains, movement more often than not slows to a complete crawl, one tile per turn. And since stacking is for the most part not allowed, this means one unit per turn. In V, if your production cities are in the west and you are attacked in the east, a single road will pump your entire war machine over there in just a handful of turns. In VI, you're forked. Exploration, for me one of the most fun parts of any particular Civ game, becomes a chore, even with scouts. Unfortunately I don't see the core concept of movement to be able to be amended in patches / expansions, leaving it as the fatal flaw in a very good game.			"

 I love it! Things I love The new graphics are really neat! Districts are awesome and make you think forward and make the map look more interesting All the civs are different and feel unique to eachover The game is very addictive and always keep you interested and has loads of replay value. The music really captures the atmosphere of the game its awesome. The ideas of cities having walls and having to destroy them before taking a city makes defense and attacking so much more interesting. The AI are a lot more crafty than before, they will do suprise attacks and I've seen them be able to do massive naval invasions and suprise me a little. The tutorial and advisor and being able to easily use the Wiki makes it easy and fast to learn. Being able to stack units into armies and a progression tree is a lot better and easier to see what skills the units have than in Civ V. The resources make more sense and are much easier to see. I like how Casus Belli's work now I like how City states work, before the person with the most money got the most allies as City States, now its about how many Envoys you have. City States build up armies and are much more powerful and scarier than before, they are much more important. However during defensive and offensive wars they won't attack the enemy unless they come near their city.Things I don't love The fog of war is brown and has a bad aesethic contrast between the bright colours of the visible map I can't rename cities I'm not amazing at Civ and the advisor counsel is now gone which makes me sad, not a big negative but still. I sort of don't like the new micromanagement with builders and how they have 3 turns, but I understand that this isn't exactly a negative but more of a change I need to get used to. The AI sometimes don't upgrade units and are not great at keeping up with the times, I was in Modern Era and some were in Medevial. Sometimes near late game the map can become confusing with loads of icons everywhere, I know you can disable some, but it just looks visually confusing, this is the same issue I had with Civ V. "

												Delayed this review since I believed that this game would become better with time like previous entries in the series. There is honestly a lot to like about Civ 6 and as a core the game is good. Chances are you've heard what the najor issues are but here is what I think is right and wrong with the game:-The game is impressive graphically and I really like the art style, however I would say it isn't better or worse than Civ 5 just different-Districts are a nice additon to the game as well -Barbarians are no longer a nuisance and now can be an oturight threat to your progression in any given game, killing them provides certain inspirations and eurekas which help development of the tech and civics tree but ultimately they're not that impacting in a positive way-Most Civs tend to either be focussed toward being a warmonger or nothing in particular, having versatility can be a good thing but I also feel that this further enphasizes being a warmonger. Most of the games I've played tend to be kill everyone or endure their petty complaints-The AI agendas whilst promising in nature for some variation in diplomatic goals basically almost means you're hated by everyone since you can't do the abitrary things they want you to do. Even when you do fulfil them other civs hate you or the fulfilment isn't recognised (I've had mulitple 'money grubbers' tell me it's great my economy is doing well one turn to then tell me 20 turns later my economy is terrible even though it hadn't changed in that time). When one civ declares war on you it tends to make others do the same even if they had no reason to and the friendly with them until that point-Like previous titles I was expecting that we would receive additional content through expansions containing signifcant updates, but given the announcement and release of Macedonia and Persia I think that content will just be drip fed through to the community as one or two civs as dlc. It would be nice if game was given some more substantial expansion as seen in Civ 5In short I can't recommend this game in it's current state			"

												NOT RECOMMENDED to buy, if Your focus is on SP - not before all DLC come out and not before the ""finished product"" get ON SALE.Having played civilization from civ1 on, I sadly have to confess that the last great and epic Single Player games I played, was CIVILIZATION 4 Beyond the sword!!In Civ 5, after being shocked by the unfinished product of vanilla, I did everything right, and waited a few years and bought the complete game ON SALE ... and really enjoyed 2000 hours of MP.Civilization 6 has really a long list of positive and nice features and I honor all the effort in creating a visually appealing game and adding more layers ...but sadly Single player is unplayable, due to terrible AI, which is not capable of ""understanding"" the many layers of game-play.Also, the way of presenting a unfinished product, and then by ripping the players off by selling a lot of extra DLC I also don't consider long time effective, and morally not acceptable.Having in mind the price and the price of all future expansions and DLC, I can NOT RECOMMEND to buy this game if Your focus is on Single-player due to an AI which will NOT deliver the ""one more turn feeling"", and mid and late-game where you will feel ""no more turn please"" due to time-consuming boring game play.I really wanted to believe that Civ 6 will make a step forward making half a step backward and picking up the ""one more turn"" feeling they lost in Civilization 4 Beyond the sword.I really gave the game a fair chance by investing more than 200 hours - and I AM DONE!! Maybe in a few years on sale I pick up the ""finished product"" for a fair value for money and not to high expectations anymore.I don't worry for Civilization 6 because of a great fan-base of dedicated modders who will for sure, once the modding tools get released, do a great job and make this game shine in future, as they always did.I really wish well for the Civilization franchise, and I honor the 25 years of Civilization, so I decided this to be my 1st review of more to come.

												I have about 200 hours in Civ V. I love that game. Beyond Earth, well let's just say I didn't care for it so I didn't have high expectations for VI. I started playing and it felt nice. I liked it. I do like it, the new features are great! However the AI's need major work. Seriously, I can be playing on Prince and the standard turn setting and I'm like 50 turns in. I meet Trajan and Tomyris and literally two turns later they both declare war on me. I'm not on the same continent as them, I've just created a galley (which is how I met them) and without any warning or given them any reason to declare war. It's not the first time either, the AI's are crazy and completely irrational...For me, this ruins the game as a person who usually plays towards other victories than domination. I avoid wars as much as I can. I would recommend it if this didn't ruin the game for me. It's a shame because other than the AI: I love it. It takes some time getting use to with the changes from V, but after you learn it it's great. So I really hope they update the AIs to less crazy...			"

												Fix the crashing already....It´s a descent game despite the braindead AI and the extremely poor optimization. Not lag wise, but the waiting between turns is a joke. I spend more than 90% of my time playing this game waiting for my turns and I have a really good computer. Watching tv-series on a 2nd monitor or listening to audio books is the only way to not go insane while waiting.The crashing issues however is not acceptable. I can´t go for a domination victory. Keep crashing trying to capture cities after 300ish turns every game. A lot of players are having crashing issues and some players can´t even get games going past turn 1. Do not buy in current state. It should not have been released completely broken. I have played computer games for 25 years and never had so many crashes in a single game before. Not nearly ready for release. It´s like an unstable Alpha build that cost 60€. Not even the patch fixed the issues. Made the crashing even worse in my case. Do not support this madness. Wait a year and buy it on sale.			"

												Iv'e been playing Civilization since Civ2.  The series seems to get more shallow as they go along.  First there was sacrifices made to increase playability for multiplayer, then recycling content to continue producing expansion packs, now to broaden the playerbase there has been too much simplification that takes the fun out of managing your civilization.  It's starting to feel like Civilization Revolution which is very unfortunate.  All of this has ruined one of the greatest aspects of the game; replayability.  Returning depth to the managment aspect would increase the quality of Civilization by a lot.			"

												As someone that has over 1,000 hours in Civ V, I feel that I should write a review about this game after playing it for over 60 hours already. This game is fun and has a lot to offer that is new entirely to the Civilization games, at least recently, and also has new ways of playing the game which I will get back to in a moment. It also has a lot of question and sometimes bad game design and functionalities. So I will list out a list of specific accomplishments and faults of the game right now.-Promotion system is awesome!Pros:-Districts are awesome. They provide replayability to all of the civilizations as you can play through each of them a multitude of different ways-Religion is now a way of achieveing victory. This is a great addition becuase it give a purpose to the religion system seen in Civ V. (There is a con to this however that I will address later).-The civics tree is amazing. This adds so much flexablilty to each civ, it also adds replayablilty as you can play as communist America or facist India. It offers so much more to the game.-This is subjective, but the art style in my opinon is superior to Civ V in the sense that it is unique and allows for more individualized detail for each civ. The attention to detail is much more substantial compared to Civ V.-Armys and Corps are an awesome additon and makes war even more enjoyable than before with the addition of some cool animations as well.-The fact that every playthrough will not be the same as you wil not be able to build the same wonders over and over again. This goes in line with strtegicaly placeing everything around your cities.Cons:-Lack of content (which I know will be reversed in the past, but it is barebones at realse).-Barbarians give and take from the experience. I am always tempted to turn them off, but in the beginning they make the game exciting and they help with civics and technological advances. They are raging to the max and later on they give up on any logical strategical advantages and charge with their spears at your tanks. This needs to be fixed.-Civs in this game are all warmongers. In Civ V you could play the game without going to war. In this game, it is almost impossible to do so with each civ being programed to attack one another, not caring about the penalties, and their agendas are contradictory completely. The Kongo hated me becuase I woud not spread my religion to them even though they had their own, that makes no sense. This is probably the number one thing that MUST be addressed before this game can be worth the $60 asking price.-War is too heavily emphasised in this game as I stated before. Every victory is reliant on it.-There are next to no luxury resources in this game. What happened to jewlery?-City states are broken and will leave being your ally for no reason whatsoever. Even if their are no spies in the game and you have 13 envys sent to them, they will still leave. They act like bi-polar prepubecent girls that just had their first period. But, because this game relys on war, might as well take them all over.-The science victory is egregious. If you do not have sufficent production to build anything, even with the space civics, you will not win a science victory unless you have another way of getting some great engineers. It is awful how long it take to win this way.-Hitler is not the leader of Germany-Poland was added to the game before Mongolia (Why?)-Aztecs are locked-There is no diplomacy victory. This is huge and might be the reason as to why the diplomacy is nonexsistant in this game. This needs to be added ASAP as it will add an actual passive way of achieveing victory.-Nuclear weapons have no real apperence in this game compared to Civ V as it is substantally harder to aquire uranium than before.-Trading is garbage in this game as Civs will ask for the dumbest trade deals I have ever witnessed.Is this game worth the money though? It seems with everything this game achieved, it failed in an aspect of it. It is fun and there is a lot of game play to get through and it is fustrateing enjoyable. With that in mind. It is not worth how much it is. Civ V with the DLC is cheaper and is superior to this game in many aspects, most of which were in vinila Civ V. I would not buy this right now and would wait for a good sale of atleast 50% off its current price. Nuclear Gandhi would have wanted it that way.			"

												Compared to Civ 5, pretty unsatisfying. I just can't bring myself to sit down and play a whole game all the way through. The game is much more difficult to understand, much less strategic, and the graphics and visuals for the different civilizations is terrible. Save your money, just buy Civ 5.770+ hours on Civ 5.Not a single completed game in Civ 6.			"

												I play for Science and Deomination. Players interesteed in Religious or Cultural victory, may not find this very useful. For those looking for combat strategy Civ  6 is an utter washout. Civ 6 in its current state barely qualifies as a game. Despite two patches the AI still  is unable to compete. There are plenty of Declarations of War - but after the first two eras the AI may (or may not) send units, it may send one unit, or it may send several  that simply mill about in confusion, never attacking the city where they are deployed., waiting to be picked off by ranged units. Capturing an enemy city also is absurdly easy. The AI has no conception of how to make use of its units. Together, these make Domination absurdly easy to the point it's not worth bothering.Many people hate the Diplomacy. If you capture a city belonging to an AI that has declared war on you - you're branded by all other civs as a warmonger - and will be denoucned for the remaineder of the game. If you declare a joint war with another civ that civ is likely to brand you a warmonger.  wouldn't even mind that - if the AI would mount a credible attack or defense but as it is, it's completely brain dead. Religion is where the game AI seems to come awake by spamming religious units to the point your territories are overrun with missionaries, appostles etc.  One may try to compete - but with the all critical ""districts""  limited by population, the AI has to be building Holy Sites in every city... at the cost of either military encampments, trading hubs, education hubs,, industrial cites, theatre districts etc - and STILL you can't compete with the AI for spamming religious units. The only solution is to declare war - since you cannot tell the other civs to stop sending religious units. That earns you the stripe of being a warmonger - which quickly will be picked up by all other civs.I could live with the much villified UI if the game otherwise were good. Many reviewers detest the ""cartoony"" leaders. I find the animations quite appealing.   Overall, the visutals are awesome. This should be a great game - instead it's just a broken, incomplete effort and not worth playing at any price.			"

												I recommend to give this one a pass until the AI is fixed. Right now, it is laughably bad and greatly diminishes from the enjoyment. Mostly everything else, however, is good. But I can't recommend it for singleplayer right now, the AI being such a fundamental component of the game. Multiplayer is good, though.			"

Product received for free
												The Sid Meiers Civilization game that was promised to be ""complete"" at launch. It was supposed to be a finished and polished product. It isn't.It's not far off, but I find myself, even with the ""new to civ"" option on, lost as how to use the new features or units in the game. The Civilopedia is woefully inadequate. It gives you a moderate description of the real world units, buildings, concepts, etc., but the in-game function is described minimally.Diplomacy is still lacking and the A.I. is clearly still quite basic. The Complete Civilization IV is still the best version of the game. Hopefully as with almost every Civ game in the franchise they will improve this most basic of Civ games. I hope they don't wait to do it in an expansion but rather in a comprehensive patch.			"

In this game, it is almost impossible to do so with each civ being programed to attack one another, not caring about the penalties, and their agendas are contradictory completely. The Kongo hated me becuase I woud not spread my religion to them even though they had their own, that makes no sense. This is probably the number one thing that MUST be addressed before this game can be worth the $60 asking price.-War is too heavily emphasised in this game as I stated before. Every victory is reliant on it.-There are next to no luxury resources in this game. What happened to jewlery?-City states are broken and will leave being your ally for no reason whatsoever. Even if their are no spies in the game and you have 13 envys sent to them, they will still leave. They act like bi-polar prepubecent girls that just had their first period. But, because this game relys on war, might as well take them all over.-The science victory is egregious. If you do not have sufficent production to build anything, even with the space civics, you will not win a science victory unless you have another way of getting some great engineers. It is awful how long it take to win this way.-Hitler is not the leader of Germany-Poland was added to the game before Mongolia (Why?)-Aztecs are locked-There is no diplomacy victory. This is huge and might be the reason as to why the diplomacy is nonexsistant in this game. This needs to be added ASAP as it will add an actual passive way of achieveing victory.-Nuclear weapons have no real apperence in this game compared to Civ V as it is substantally harder to aquire uranium than before.-Trading is garbage in this game as Civs will ask for the dumbest trade deals I have ever witnessed.Is this game worth the money though? It seems with everything this game achieved, it failed in an aspect of it. It is fun and there is a lot of game play to get through and it is fustrateing enjoyable. With that in mind. It is not worth how much it is. Civ V with the DLC is cheaper and is superior to this game in many aspects, most of which were in vinila Civ V. I would not buy this right now and would wait for a good sale of atleast 50% off its current price. Nuclear Gandhi would have wanted it that way.			"

												Civ VI is good, not great BUT I can not reccomend it at this time.The first patch messed it up.  Despite having a high end system, the game now crashes after 100-200 turns with alarming regularity.   Certain colors also flicker if zommed in more than 1/2 way.  Until the patch these were not problems.There is alot to like about Civ VI.   The graphics (except for the current flickering) are good.  The amount of content and paths to victory are amazing.  The addition of religious war, although disliked by some, is pretty good and adds a new dimension to the game.But there are too many quibbles.1)  Islands frequently aren't islands.  Many times, islands are grounded to the poles at both top and bottom of the map, making them impossible to move around at sea - even on the Island Plates map supposedlyt featuring many islands.2)  The AI's ability to wage war is down right horrible.  It retreats when it shouldn't retreat, it initiates wars it has no chance of winning, it leaves builders and settlers out in the open without moving them to sdafety so they are easy to steal, it atacks one unit at a time despite having overwhelming forces nearby.  It is just horrid.3)  Almost every game you play will become a huge slogfest about 50-60% of the way into the game.  To be fair, many games of this genre suffer a similar fate but it seems worse with Civ VI.  Perhaps, it is knowing I have so many turns left to play even though I know i am in position to win, I have to suffer literally through hours more of gameplay before I can start a new game and make it fun again.Although, actually it doesn't really matter if I finish or not because Civ VI doesn't give me any 3way of recording my victory.  No Hall of Fame, no permanent record of a win at all.  you just get a little graph showing you a fairly meaningless score and when you go back to the main menu, no lasting record of your god-like gaming prowess exists.4)  It really doesn't seem to matter what leader you pick.  The bonuses exert only small influence on how you have to play.  The result is you can play every civ almost the exact same way and achieve the same style victory.  So, why even have varying bonuses?  They appear meaningless for the most part.5)  There are many other quibbles, but I have only so much time to write this.If the game was being offered for $35, I would say must buy.  But it costs almost twice that.Wait and buy it when it goes on sale.  At the moment, it is a $35 game asking you to pay $60 to beta test it.			"

												Too many little things about this game feel rushed.  The scrolling in this game feels unatural and trying to scroll topward the top of your screen is a pain.  I absolutely abhor the graphics gives me a headache trying to play the game for more than an hour.  Very little details into the social and laws.  All in all I give this game a C+ rating.  I have played 68.3 hrs on this game and I really wanted to love this game, but why would I buy a newer game when the older version civ 5 is just so much better?  Like the idea of expanded cities.  If you take one thing from this game and put it in your next attempt at a better sequel take that developers.  So all things taken into the account after 4+ times of playing this game each time with a different Civ I can say that this game is not an improvement.			"

												If you're a fan of the Civ series, you will find yourself with questions after a few hours of gameplay. Like: ""Why did I bother buying this game?"" ""Is the UI really this bad, or did I completely forget how to computer?"" ""I wonder what's on TV?""Unresponsive user interface aside, stilted game mechanics aside, overpowered combined units aside, Cleopatra as a Latina chica aside, this game is BORING. I'm not sure how the developers managed to go from the previous deeply engaging game to this disappointing garbage. So much of what you do seems to have little or no consequence. Religion in particular seems to be little more than a distraction; it's easy to go through the game while paying zero attention to it. The endgame is particularly annoying, with no option to just set a city to produce gold or whatever and ignore it. Spies likewise require frequent babysitting.If you're a fan of the Civ series, wait till the next one comes out.			"

												If there was a ""neutral"" rating option, I would have picked it. Since there isn't, I went with the thumbs down because of three issues that to me are important and would affect my own decision on whether or not to buy the game again. Decide for yourself if these are aspects that matter to you:- As of writing this, the game still does not have a UI/font scaling option that works with all resolutions. It appears to be available at 4k, but at 1440p (2560x1440) the upscaling option is disabled and can't be enabled by editing the config file. Text and icons are uncomfortably tiny.- No teams. Surprisingly, the co-op option was removed in Civ6. You can only play against your friends, but not team up with them to play against  the AI. You also can't form teams with the AI.- The AI is peculiar and has major trouble with combat and diplomacy. Yes, just like in Civ5, though just more so. It also doesn't understand districts well and seems to be mostly focused on spamming missionaries.It's fundamentally a good game and rather promising, but since we pay for games the way they are now, not for how the may or may not turn out in a year's time, I gave my recommendation based on the game as it is (it's not an inexpensive game). I'll update the review as the game evolves.			"

I really feel that one of the biggest features of the game is diplomacy and if thats broken then the games broken. I'll be happy to change my recomendation once they fix the issues that are evidently a problem.			"

												It's pretty, it's still a time stealer, it's still Civilization. But something is... missing. I wish I could say something specific like ""the AI is broken"", but that's not really why I'm not enjoying this installment of the series. Part of the fun has somehow gone away, and I don't know exactly where it went. I hope the game will improve over time, and I will certainly check in with it again, but for now, I have no desire to continue playing. Every Civilization game I've played before (I-V) have been exciting and engaging, and it was very difficult to stop playing once started. Civilization VI does not entice me to come back for more, and that is a shame.By the way, it certainly doesn't help that the AI is weird and the UI is confusing.			"

												I have been denounced for... Not having the large army. Not having a large navy. Not spying enough. For Spying. For having an encampment pop up close to my lands, and one turn later they ♥♥♥♥ing denounce me for it. For having a different government. For having a different religion. Having more wonders than them....and so many more I am sure I don't remember and missed.This is really my only issue with the game other than a few freezes when loading a game.It feels like more of a complete game than Civ in space and Civ V did on their release.  Though there is a learning curve to this one.  It took me a few games to work out how to stop sucking.  I look forward to future expantions to the game to see what they add.			"

												Yay, Civ6 is here. Look at all the awards it won, before it was even released I might add. Look at all the high praise it has! Woo.Too bad the game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks!There are numerous things ""wrong"" with the game but rather than list them all I will list the biggest one of all and why all the others only serve to make the issue worse but are not, in themselves, the biggest thing wrong with the game.Ever play Civ5? 4? Any game in the series? If you answered yes then let me tell you why Civ 6 is bad.In any civ game, when you are midgame, you are usually winning your chosen victory condition and there is not a whole lot for you to do. Even with domination victory, you are just waiting for your stack of units to wipe out all resistance when they cover the distance on the map.This leads to the 'next turn' issue where there is nothing for you to do except wait for victory to occour and iron out any speed bumps on the way. Civ 6 makes this almost unbearable!There is no build queue!So every other turn you will be nagged by one of your 50 odd cities to give them something to build and this gets really aggrevating when it has nothing left to build! So you start giving it junk tasks to do.Now imagine having 50 cities all nagging for your attention.Its horrible! I just want to launch my spaceship or move my army and I have to micromanage a load of rubbish every other turn! But theres more, because of course there is! In every civ game prior to civ5 trade routes were assumed so you never had to do anything except build a road. Now you have trade route units, and after TWENTY TURNS they need reassigning. Going back to the 50 city example you can imagine how absurd this becomes, its just...Its civilization beyond earth, all over again! Nothing was learned from that mess of a game that even Firaxis dropped after one expansion because it was so bad! Yet I actually found things to like about that game but this?! I had to mod the game to make trade routes last 100 turns and even then it is tedious but at least its long enough that I don't try to kill myself!Now you may read 50 cities. Yes, Infinite city spam is back and infact the optimum way to play because barbarians will spawn in fog of war as they always have AND THEY WILL ♥♥♥♥ YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥UP! Barbarians are a huge step up, frequently killing an AI for you very early in the game so be sure to fog bust or squeeze cities in every crack and you will have too because sooner or later because the crazy AI will declare war on you, because they feel like it. Yes, that is back but then what would a civ launch be without crazy AI. A civilization I have never met will declare war on me. I haven't met them so why do they hate me and how do they know they want to declare war on me? Doesn't matter because you are never told.I don't think everything is terrible about civ6, infact I could go into the positives but why bother? Everyone else is riding this game like the second coming of christ but for me, personally, I'm just trying to get all the achievements to try and assauage my buyers remorse.The mid game needs more meaningful choices which is the same of every civ game ever made. We are also sick to death of crazy AI, which we were once again lied too when we asked if their behaviour was improved.Maybe for civ7 we will just get a physical box with poisonous asps inside.Oh, expansions will fix it? Well it will be another year to two years before an expansion is announced. Just wait for civ6 complete, it will only cost you 4 years of waiting.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												EDIT: There was a huge patch that fixed a lot of the problems talked about in here.Right now I would still recommend it to anyone fan of 4x games, but if you are not into this genre, I would suggest trying older titles before making the investment on this one.High difficulty player here, and a long time fan of the series.Probably the strongest release Civ, has most of the basic systems from CiV V complete, and some other things added as well. It's missing the diplomacy win, but honestly it was the weakest and less interesting part of the game on V. And on top of that, has a huge gameplay change; The Districts.First off, lets start with the issues people have.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Barbarians.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The early game has changed a lot because barbarians are a threat once again. On Civ V they were extremelly weak, they didn't pose a threat at all due to the changes on City mechanics from IV to V (city strenght + bombardment). On older civ games, you had to keep military around because cities didn't have any kind of defenses, a single barbarian could wipe out your civilization if you left your city undefended.On Civ VI we get the middle. Cities have lost a lot of their early game power due to losing city bombardment. Now to get it you need to build walls. Even without it you still have city strenght, which means a single barbarian can't just walk in your capital and end your game.Then we get the new Barbarian AI. Basically right now it's posing a threat to many people that used to only focus on infrastructure back on Civ V. Right now you can't do that, and it's completely fine, the biggest threat on the ancient world was barbarians, and this is what you experience on the few first turns.Even with the Barbarian AI being better, all you have to do is make sure the barbarian scouts don't actually see your cities. If they don't they won't launch a horde of units at your cities. If they do there's ways to stop it as long as you didn't fall for the monument trap. (seriously you don't build the monument until you have at minimum 3 units)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~AI~~~~~~~~~~~~~This is probably the biggest problem with the game right now, but it's not a new problem. The AI on all Civ games hasn't been espectacular, and it's somewhat expected. Building an AI that can play a game like Civ is extremelly difficult. Even then, there's some problems that have no reason to exist. (Like joint wars still giving you penalties with your ally)What I believe is the biggest problem people have is that they once again playing the game way too much like Civ V. You really need to understand that Civilization has never been a franchise that just copies and pastes things, changes graphics and ""new game"". They actually make the effort to change the gameplay, and this is one of the reasons as to why there's always a different lead game designer on each iteration.Some tips for the people having trouble making allies: send delegations early, give trade deals early, and help your neighbors. The new AI doesn't like isolationist players, so go out there and make friends.This still doesn't excuse some things, but nothing that can't be fixed.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UI~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Basically the UI has problems, like certain information isn't there on plain sight, like the experience bar for your units is extremelly small, or not actually showing up that certain techs/civics give you certain boosts (you have to hover over them to see them, on past games there was an icon for it) nothing unfixable, but it's kinda annoyingAlso GIVE US BACK THE OPTION TO RENAME CITIES. (there will probably be a patch around december that should fix most of these things.)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Religion Game~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Right now religion is a new victory condition. One big problem I have is that you can immediately lose that victory condition if you are not able to found a religion. You should at the very least be able to take over other civilization religion (by possibly conquering the holy site where it was founded).The other big problem is that Religion units should be able to move on tiles which have military/civilian units from all civilizations unless you are at war with them. Right now, the AI can get a huge amount of faith generation, and just spam a huge amount of missionaries and clog up the mapThe religious combat is kind of dissapointing. There should be more unit types, and not just be a fight over who has most apostles and got the right promotion.Even with all of these problems, it's a big improvement from Civ IV and V religion game.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Districts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Probably the biggest change the civ franchise has made. Basically, districts are a place you put in the map, near your city, where you put the buildings of a specific type. For example all Scientific buildings go in the Campus, and the district itself gets bonuses from things, like mountains.This means your city no longer is stacked on a single tile, and it spreads on the map. This makes very interesting gameplay changes, and due to the bonuses each district gets vary depending of terrain, you have to plan your cities on advance, and there's more ""improvisation"" on the game. You no longer go a specific route to win the game, and you have to adapt more.What I dislike about this is just a pet peeve of me. Since cities spread on the map, you lose the feeling of ""epicness"". What I mean by this is that the game kinda feels more like a city manager more than an empire manager. (which has honestly always been more a city manager more than the other). And all of this makes the world seem smaller.Wonders also work like districts, meaning they take a tile on the map, and are not just another building in the city tile. They also require specific terrain to build them, which means there's more opportunities to get wonders on higher difficulties (which was impossible on previous games).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Production~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Production has become more important with this iteration, because production costs for districts go up over time, and to win science victory you need to make a huge project that takes a lot of production to finish. Once again, I've seen way too many people just focus on growth and science like on Civ V, and then suffering with productions costs.Basically you need to use your industrial zones and plan them well, because they can affect more than 1 city (with the factory and power plant). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Final Thoughts~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~So the big question. Is the game worth it?Yes absolutely, but only if you are a 4x ""fan"" or at least enjoy this genre. If you are new to this, I would recommend waiting for a sale, or get an older one when they are extremelly cheap (they go by like 5 bucks complete).Also I would like to point out, that the game isn't ""incomplete"" even though I said there's things missing, and also I am not excusing them for not having them done on launch. It's just that game development, and feedback ""on house"" won't give away all the problems. And there's going to be bugs or certain problems that millions of players will find faster than a couple of playtesters.So if you excuse me, I'll go back to play one more turn...			"

												I have played civ since the first one. I lost countless hours with civ 2, and 4. Civ 5 over 2,240 hours logged on that game with more to come. Civ 6, I hate it, some of the worst money I ever spent on a game. I only paid 40 bucks for it and still feel like I over paid for it.  This is my opinion but the changes were not for the better, heck I do not even like to look at the game and the silly cartoonish characters. I would love a mod that could change that. Let’s face it you have to look at the game to play it and it takes away from any emersion when you look at a caricature of a great leader or outlandish units. I am not a fan of the districts, but I can overlook them and not a huge turn off. I would rather they did not change the cities like that. The districts in no way I feel opened up the game like unstacking combat did. Just seems to make things more annoying to me. Speaking of combat, how long do you have to keep swordsman around? The gap in science and upgrading to better units seems to be forever. Warrior to Swordsman, to musket men, there’s no real in between for some units and makes combat feel stale. How is the great wall not a wonder? Only China can build it, but it is a world wonder in real life! They made social policy growth like science growth and controls more of how your government is run. That system starts to feel as stagnant  as combat at times because there are only so many policies you really care about. The one thing I did like was in regards to city states and it makes a whole lot of sense from a history standpoint. You now generate cultural or diplomatic points you can spend to garner favor with cities states and can become allies with them and friendly with them much easier. I actually liked that part of the game. Would I recommend this game, no. I even told my friend do not buy it and  to keep playing civ 5. He can try my game and make up his own mind.  "

												8 Hours In-Game Impressions From a Civilization vet:- Almost everything is improved, from the ai being slightly better (still needs some work), the game has MUCh more content on launch than Civ 4, Beyond Earth and Civ 5 had during there launches, Sean beans voice is beautiful and a joy to hear, awesome new features (I LOVE the district addition!), The UI is maybe the best it has been and of course the game gives you that classic civilization feeling ""Just One More Turn!""- The things I feel like could be improved is the AI (I feel like its improved from the last game but still not on par with say stardock,etc..) and the art design (It is very bright, doesn't bother me as much as I expected but I def feel like I would have liked better art design) and it needs the ability to name you're cities! (Not sure why this was not included lol).Overall I am very impressed, not perfect but it is FULL of content and feels much more complete than civ 4 and civ 5 on release. With a few expansion packs this will, without a doubt be my favorite Civilization game ever (Civ 2 is my fav). Well done devs!I will comeback later for more thoughts when I put more hours in on the game, but so far I am impressed! This is the best Civilization game on launch since Civilization 2.**16 hours on the game now and I am still loving it to bits, best Civ since Civ 2 on launch day, but I have another minor issue, the game won't shutdown properly half the time**			"

												Very disappointed, Civ VI appears to have gone backwards instead of forwards, it feels like I'm playing a child's game. The dev's should have stuck with what they have with Civ V and Beyond Earth and improved with more DLC's. I'm still waiting for a DLC for Civ V so that once you build your spaceship you can travel to other planets but I'm not holding my breath. Civ VI Not Happy.			"

Posted: October 26, 2016
												BACKGROUND: Played CIV 2 as a child, loved it, and sunk probably 300 hours into it. Came back to the series way later with CIV 5 BNW, and mostly loved it, but still craved the chess like strategic feel of CIV 2. Super excited for CIV 6 and have played 40 hours on king and emperor difficulty games going for two different victory conditions. I have played only one other 4X game which is ENDLESS LEGEND which taught me a lot on how 4X can be different and awesome in so many ways (do play that).VERDICT: One step forward, and two steps backward, It frustrated me when developers don't just keep the good bits of previous iterations of games. There is a lot to like about the things they have added, and I mostly like the art style despite the negative reviews on here for that, but so much of it has been taken away and the balance is atrocioius.NEGATIVES:--UI-- Some of the changes have been nice, but it mostly is a huge step backward. In CIV 5 BNW, you could use the UI to understand the sytems and adjust strategy. For example, when you do a deal with a civ, you have no idea what it is if you want to check back. This history was there in CIV 5 BNW so why remove it. Further I hate the in city management mess. There are more buttons to click and it isn't very apparent initially how to manage amenities and what bonuses certain perks give (for example I can't check up on how a factory affects production in cities other than the one where I have produced it). Citizen management is just okay, but CIV 5 BNW was way better. They sacrificed usability to make it smaller on the screen and seemingy easier to do. Its so hard to track amenties from luxuries and know how many you have to trade, and the reports are horrible in comparison to CIV 5 BNW. There are so many things here that I can't quite remember, but the lack of info on many systems leaves me frustrated. And I hated how things overlapped other things. Shouldn't be hard to make better UI. Its the main interaction with the game, should be the first thing you work on in developing this type of 4X game.--Districts-- Following on from the above point, there should be an easy way to plan out a city and know the different advantages and whats  coming in advance. A simple advisor who shows you what a city plan could be in the future would be great. And its so hard to know the exactly adjacency bonuses...--Civopedia-- Which brings me to the terrible civpedia which was pretty good in CIV 5 BNW, but not perfect. Now they made the stupid mistake of doing it over and in the process making it pretty and forgeting all the info people crave for when playing.--Diplomacy-- I like how you can see things about relationships, but mostly I hate the new diplomancy and was never a big fan to beging with. Endless legend has much clearer diplomacy, albeit much more basic. I wish this was the part they spent way more time with in CIV 6. I mean CIV 5 BNW had them talking for each interaction, now they are just silent mostly which is stupid. There were more options in CIV 5 BNW, but mostly I wished this was worked on more and expanded so your game involved a lot of pivoting and relationship management. I know the world congress they will bring in at some point, but the diplomacy does not seem fleshed out at all even though they have sold how smart it is with the agendas. Small point but I also hated the loading screens that you couldn't skip.--AI-- Still sucks. So easy fighting wars. Why can't they work on this!!!!!! Make it hard. The game difficulty shouldn't be about giving the AI perks or advantages, but having them smarted so they know the most efficient way to do things and have more awareness of the board to hurt you more. It just sucks. --Balance of cities--  The coastal and ocean tiles mostly suck now. I loved in CIV 5 you could add improvements that would add yield to the ocean tiles. Nothing here. So it makes no sense to have too many ocean tiles taken up by your city.--Balance of production--  Production has been reduced throghout which is fine but it did feel like it was way easier to grow a city than actually biuld things, and then I had to manage housing so I wasn't able to get on with the military side of the game as easily.--Great People-- I like how you compete for them great idea but the UI for it again sucks. I still felt the pursuit of great people in CIV 5 BNW gave much more bonuses and were more rewarding to work towards. I mostly forgot them in this game.--Wonders-- Seriously, if it takes up one whole tile they should be really powerful. Instead, all the wonders felt worse than CIV 5 BNW. I found only one or two really helpful, and then I mostly ignored them. The video is cool.--Controls-- No WASD?? Seriosly. And how bout a way to rotate screen like you guys do in XCOM 2? Would make the world so much more interesting if you can see it from different perspectives, and sometimes would help for those moments items are blocked from view because of the angle.--Strategic view-- Was so good in CIV 5 BNW i could play a whole game in that view only. Now it looks pretty but no adjustability in what I want to see. The lenses is there for what CIV 5 BNW had in terms of view options, but apart from religion they are useless. ARGHHHH.--Spies-- So weak whats the points. I get they have missions but there are so many options and they take so long I just didn't bother. Could be a great part of the game.--Amenities-- I get it and it makes much more sense, but it was so much fun to balance happiness as you grow your empire. It was clear and understandable, if not having so much real world sense. Again here I mentioned before I don't understand how my luxuries affect amenities, and I would like more control over distribution to perhaps buff up some cities at certain times.--Roads-- I get the caravan trade routes should make roads, but this was so frustrating. You should be able to plan roads another way, or they should be some more domestic trade options without the use of caravans as you can also plan roads.--Promotions-- The system looks better, but there should be clear paths to created distinct styles of units, and after the second tier almost always was  useless. One was scale cliffs which I could never figure out how to use.There are more things I hated, but mostly it just didn't feel as cohesive a game as CIV 5 BNW. The middle turns are better for sure, but still it gets tedious moreover frustrating with lack of info.POSITIVES:--Districts-- I mostly love this, especially the harbor district which means you can create naval units even if you city is a few tiles inland. This is a great evolution. --Builders-- Great idea reduced the tedious clutter but i still found some suggestions not popping up and without the strategic view resources option in CIV 5 BNW was a little harder to know where things were to plan.--Civics tree/Government-- I thing this was mostly a good idea but I the cards should be perhaps a timed use so you keep changing your play style and plan when to do things and to reduce the clutter of so many cards. I would also love if they bought back the taxation/luxury/science system they had in CIV 2 in a more advanced way.--Performance-- Way better. Reduced loading times, quicker between turns and didn't crash once which CIV 5 BNW did a lot on my laptop with GTX 960M 2gb (all medium 1080p settings). Felt a lot better to play.--Domestic trade-- So glad the domestic trade doesn't reduce one city output and is just a bonus. Long overdue fix.--Religious units-- Loved how they fight with each other and have more fleshed out options and upgrades.There were probably more things I liked, but it goes to show this could be a great game if they address the above issues, and put more emphasis on improved AI, sensible and informative UI, intricate and thorough diplomacy systems, rotatable screen, and fleshed out options to streamline game options in the mid to late game.

												I understand the mixed reviews. In the beginning, I too was frustrated by the idiot child AI and the persitent crashing that plagued me after a few hundred game moves. Both of which, mind you, required lengthy restarting and reloading sequences.(!) Despite all this, I still managed to log nearly 300 hours, because the game is a truck load of fun! I usually don't care if I win or lose, as long as I get to build my cities and wonders without the moron AI interrupting me with inane banter then crashing if I try to cancel their dialog prompts too quickly. They can also be stubborn♥♥♥♥♥mules if they want your city-state. Truth be told these annoyances, while frustrating, are few and far between; except for the city-state thing. Most of your time is spent buidling beautiful, sprawling, unique cities with intricaltely crafted animations and gorgeously detailed landscapes.Since it's release, the game has been improved through updates and DLC. Sadly much of the AI interaction here feels pretty hackneyed and that's a missed opportunity. When you see the graphics you'll realize where most of your dollars were spent. The game looks and runs fantastically smooth on in 21.9. (brag) Everything about the game graphically, is top notch. The day/night cycle, the smoke, the fires, the characters, and the geography, it all looks amazing! The audio is excellent too. Every player action carries a sublimely satisfying sound cue. Sean Bean is also excellent as the narrator. His subtle and dramatic interpretations of popular quotes and phrases are often compelling. Rarely do I tire of his reading of Monty Python, but after many many plathroughs, I yearn for variety. I really liked the non-fictional/educational aspects of the game. Long Story Short: It's beautiful looking and it sounds great, but it can be dumb at times. I'm looking at you city-states. It's an improvement over its predecessors in many ways, but the AI is flat. If you enjoy sim city-esque city building, and/or RTS, you'll really enjoy this game. You can build a city, an army, a navy, and an airforce then blow the crap out of barbarians and annoying AI, or you can buff your spies and steal all their cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've played both IV and V, and this one hooked me more than those could. 287 hours worth of salty fun, peppered with occasional aggravation.

												I'm here from Civilization 4, having skipped Civilization 5 and received this game from a friend (it wasn't free to him, but he did get a game from me!).  On the surface there's a fair bit to like.  I mean, it's a 4X game.  We love 4X games!  And there are new civs to hang out with, with special objectives (which, I'm told, was brought out in Civ 5) that make the AIs simultaneously easier to predict and more fun to engage with as a general idea.  Inspirations and Eurekas!  I can do things to get bonuses toward research!  Civics get researched in tandem with techs instead of being unlocked by them!  The civs all have something unique about them beyond a special unit and a special building.  Who'd have thought you could research new civics by beating up barbarians?!But then there were a few bugs.  Not glitches, but stinging insects that got too noisome to ignore, and these are going to make me wait for some major content patching before I'll be ready to hop back in:1.  Districts.  I hate them.  I hate that a single military unit can set me back dozens of turns by burning down a couple of buildings because they were set outside the main city tile.  I found this out when a barbarian chose not to run away from a unit that was absolutely going to destroy the barbarian, and burned my university down instead.  I hate also that I have to spend a couple dozen turns before I can even *start* building my library and university because I first have to...what.  Clear the land for them?2.  SCALING COSTS, capitalized for emphasis.  The first builder you produce will cost X.  The second will cost X+Y.  The third will cost X+Y+Z.  The same holds true for buildings, districts, all other units, whether you built them with gears or bought them with gold or faith.  It's bad enough that I first have to put down an industrial zone before I can start my workshops and factories, but my modern-aged new city will take FOREVER to finish that zone because a few other cities had already built one.  This is backwards beyond belief, and possibly worst of all...the game documentation DOES NOT TELL YOU that this is happening!  It isn't in the manual anywhere that building a musketman now will make the next musketman cost more gears to produce or more gold to buy.I've heard this is to encourage you to 'build tall' instead of 'build wide', which I assume means to focus your cities so that this one is the commercial city, that one's the factory city, this other one makes soldiers...but, as before, your districts sit outside your city and can be pillaged.  Three turns can ruin a hundred of yours.3.  Hex grid movement.  This one isn't going to change, and I'm willing to put up with it, but ultimately I find I dislike hex grids for how restrictive they are to movement.  Further, the game is often very poor at telling you that moving, for example, through a threatened series of grids costs more movement to pull off.4.  Builder charges.  WTF with builder charges.  I heard the reason for them (now you don't have a bunch of buildings sitting around and doing nothing!), but they're bogus (You could just disband them, y'know).  The increasing cost of builders, as with everything else, makes builder charges one of the worst mechanics I've seen in a Civ game.5.  Roads.  They can only be built by trade caravans, but you can't cancel and reroute trade caravans that I've seen.  They stop when a trading post is built (seems random to me so far), but there's otherwise no reliable way to get roads between your cities.There are others, but these are some of the most frustrating on the list.

												I would not recommend a purchase of this game at this time and at this price.The pros:Familiar enough to where you don't feel lostNew features are explained pretty wellGraphics are very nice, music is gorgeousThe cons:AI turns take FOREVER, even worse than Civ 5 and I didn't think that was possible.   I think the game actually emails Sid Meier every time I end my turn and he manually controls all the AI and barbarians.  That's the only reason I could think of it taking that long for a turn.   Poor, poor optimization.Diplomacy still makes no sense.   Leaders seem to denounce and make desicions based on absolutely nothing.  Barbarians need work.   I like that they are a threat, but they can get out of hand early.Bottom line is that this will probably all get ironed out eventually (even though Civ 5 still has painfully long turns), so if I were you I'd wait for a Steam sale and hope they've got it all figured out by then.

												I've been playing since Civ II. I've owned every game, and expansion there is, and I've loved it, until now. I also paid $80 for it, and I wasted my money. I'm not happy, so all of my thoughts are not articulated well in the below review. The Cons:1. I find it boring - Yes, boring. From Civ II to Civ V, I would stay up way later than I should and play, because I had to ""just get the next turn done."" But this one, isn't fun, it's boring. Mostly because all of the challenge has been removed. It's as if I'm just grinding like I would in an MMORPG, or Assassin's Creed (the new ones). It's a tragedy! Perhaps Firaxis is attempting to cater to console and facebook mobile gamers, but it's the wrong direction. 2. Don't care for the graphics - The map and land and units are nice, the interface is ok. It's the people, striving for realism has been a ""thing"" for 20 years. Now, they look like Pixar cartoon characters. I'm interested in a game that has 100% focus on the adventure of building an empire, not how the leaders look. It seems as if, a nice package was more important than gameplay.3. This is just going to be an array of bad things: Can't re-name cities. Can't change unit names, once named. Movement is worse, and roads do almost nothing. I feel like it's a facebook game. Took me 30 minutes to figure out my unit cost.  The game is sluggish. It's task based almost (elimination of the RPG part).4. And why I wrote the review: The Civilopedia, is terrible - there's no information that's useful, they got super lazy with that one. For the newbies, this is important, because sometimes for planning purposes it's important to know unit upgrades and progression, before you start to upgrade units. 5. The AI is insane, and has absolutely no logic operators whatsoever, they act completely randomly. I declared war on myself, and got a warmonger penalty (WTF?) - this happened, but I didn't declare it, a screen popped up and just told me I was at war with myself. Perhaps a bug, but these people should know a thing or two about releasing a working game. The AI seemingly have no reason for disliking you or liking you. I run a peaceful game, but as TR said: ""Walk softly, and carry a big stick."" I'm peaceful, isolationist, but I carry with me a mighty wrath - I will destroy a civ that attacks me first. It's just how I play. I had four civ's declare war on me and I was able to lay waste to all four of them before 430BC. The sad part, not only did I not provoke them, nor did I have a government or policies they disliked, it's like they bugged out and went to war. I'm playing on Deity! Worse yet: No matter what decisions I make, the AI will always react the same. The AI should be far more intuitive and trading and diplomacy should be better at this point, it's worse than the diplomacy in Civ III. I should feel like I'm dealing with real world leaders, not angry school children (I understand the irony in that statement). 6. Unit stacking is a no go. I understand limiting unit stacks to create a challenge. But at least let me stack a couple of combat units in one hex for organizational purposes. This was a bad feature in Civ IV, and V and a worse feature here. 7. The Barbarians are a bigger threat than any civilization, and they're everywhere. This is a con and a pro - the biggest con is that they're more dangerous than a civilization. The pro is that they're a challenge, and I love it. 8. Where is the demographic screen?9. What were you thinking with city states? Poorly executed.The Pros: What's good?1. The Policy interface is awesome, as is the entire new government interface. The policies are now like technology - good job. 2. Leader traits have improved.3. Diplomacy interface is better4. Barbarians are more intense. Unfortunately, the good doesn't outweigh the bad. The game is buggy, slow, and not executed well at all. I hope this gets better in the next few patches. At this time, I will not, and cannot recommend this game.  "

												There are some good things to be said about Civ6.  The new system for religion, for example, is both more rewarding and more realistic thanks to the fact that it can be tailored to a civilizations needs or incliniations.  The districting system, while not necessarily an improvement over older games, provides a fresh new way to think about city management.Unfortunately the good is lost in a sea of bad design choices.  The very best example of this is the new ""Eureka"" system for technological development.  You are essentially given one quest per tech, which cuts the cost of that tech in half if you do the quest.  Such a powerful incentive means you will have to go out of your way to perform many random actions if you want to stay competetive technologically, turning the game into an RPG style deluge of meaningless tasks.Speaking of competetive, the AI is most certainly not when it comes to combat.  Playing on a high level, I found myself in a situation where Brazil had a much larger army than mine.  They declared war and should have easily been able to take my border city.  Instead they wandered around my territory and slowly let me shoot them to peices, seldom even attacking any of my units or cities.  I ground them all into meat without losing a single unit.The removal of the civ-wide ""Happiness"" type feature seen in Civ5 returns us to the days where explosive expansion has barely any limitations.  This removes the need for the subtler strategies we developed to deal with happiness limitations and once again reduces us to a formula of pumping out settlers or soldiers as fast as possible, with infrastructure being considered only as it allows us to achieve those two previously mentioned ends.I tried it, and I wanted to love it, but I just don't want to play it.

												[Update: Australia Patch]Unfortunately Civ VI still suffers from some very annoying issues - with AI players hitting the Atomic Age about a 1,000 years early, nonsensical AI war declarations, etc. However, it is much improved since the original release and is worth a look when on-sale. One caveat is that somehow Firaxis botched the localization with their latest update and now parts of the game are in Portuguese instead of English...[Original Review:]Civilization VI has a lot of cool new design elements and is quite different from previous Civ games (for better or worse). However, what effectively ruins the game at this point are bugs, poor balance, and a terrible AI that overshadow everything else. For example, even on higher difficulty levels, the AI won't upgrade their troops. In my current game, it's the Information Age and I'm literally fighting off hoards of Slingers! The AI also has no sense of relative power, as they will declare war on you with no chance of victory; plus will ask for the sun and moon for any trade that's even remotely balanced. On the flip side, sometimes AI players will hit the Modern Age by 1000AD! These aren't game breaking on their own, just some examples; but it's the overall majority of issues that conspire to ruin the game.Wait for a patch or two before purchasing would be my advice. I'll revisit this review as the game hopefully shapes up.			"

Posted: November 11, 2016
												First off, let me say that I have been a civ player since the very first game. I love the series and have stuck with it throughout its many iterations. I will continue to stick with it, even though I am mildly disappointed with this first version of civ 6. I may not be recommending this game right now, but, much like civ 5, I see the potential in this game to be something great after some much needed changes. -Districts: Why do these take so much production to build? Why can't their placement be cancelled in case the player makes a mistake (when no production has even been put in yet)? Why does the cost of a district increase as the game goes on? Modern construction technology should ease the creation of a district rather than make it more difficult to produce. This is an unrealistic and silly aspect of the game. It should be a steady, cheap cost the entire game. Furthermore, add in tooltips better explaining adjacency bonuses for players who don't know how to find the useful (player-made) guides on reddit or wikipedia. -Spies: I like the fact that spies defend a specific district and any adjacent districts. This encourages better city planning. However, why do spies need new orders every few turns? There should be a spy overview that allows you unassign and re-assign spies when needed, rather than being constantly prompted every few turns. This is unnecessary micromanagement that detracts from the flow of the game.-Trade Routes: Tying in with spies, why are trade routes constantly an issue? Why not allow the player to set a trade route and then cancel it when they want to rather than being forced to renew them every 10 turns or so. Late game, with over 10 trade routes going at a time, you will spend a good chunk of your time micromanaging these trade routes rather than dealing with more interesting aspects of the game. Give the player the ability to choose when/if they want to deal with this rather than forcing it down their throats every 10 turns.-Units: Why do fortified units look practically identical to units that have simply used up their movement for the turn? Previous civ games have changed the shape of the unit's icon to better visually indicate that the unit is fortified. Why can't units go on Alert rather than just Sleep or Fortify? Why do chained units require an order for each unit in the chain? Shouldn't they be controlled as a stack with the option to control separately rather than forcing separate activation?-Cities: Why is there no building queue? Every single 4x game out there has a building queue. Why can't buildings be rushed or bought out any more? -Wonders: Why is there no refund for failed attempts at building a wonder? What, the dead building just disappears and no resources are harvested from it? Why can't wonder construction be cancelled and placed differently if a mistake was made in the initial placement?-City-states: Why aren't your envoys returned to you if a city-state is conquered by another civ? -Notifications: Why does the player need to know EVERY SINGLE THING that an enemy civ does through the rather bland reports that pop up at the top of the screen? Shouldn't specific and important events be highlighted rather than ""oh, civ X just settled their 20th city"". Was it impossible to use the bold font for important things? -City Defense: Why is the player not notified (a la Civ 5's system) when an enemy unit is in range of city defenses? Instead we see a tiny red button below the city, but if a player is otherwise distracted they can miss their opportunity to stop a barbarian or enemy unit from ravaging half the countryside.-Barbarians: I appreciate barbarians, I do. However, it is incredibly silly that they can spawn in any fog of war tile and are immediately hostile to everyone. Not to mention their endless (and fast!) supply of units. Tell me, is it realistic that every tribe and minor civ in history was immediately hostile to everyone? No, it isn't. Perhaps make it a 50/50 chance that they are hostile, or maybe that non-hostile barbs turn into peaceful villages. Look to Endless Legend for a better system. The minor faction villages in that slowly accumulate units to aid their own defense, but rarely ever have many units roaming around. Furthermore, they might attack your units, but they never siege your cities unless you♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. The barbarian system in civ 6 is an outdated mess that worked for the older games but demands a revision for modern gaming. -Religious Victory: This victory mode, although long overdue in the series, is an absolute mess. Currently it can be summed up as ""whoever spams the most apostles and missionaries wins"". Religious combat is a joke and constitutes throwing melee-only units at each other until one side dies. I don't believe defensive bonuses even apply as they normally would for military units (I could be very wrong about this). Why do nearby cities lose belief if they see an apostle fail in combat? Have you ever known a religious person to be that fickle? Civ 5's religious pressure system, although imperfect, was superior to the newer system. Spamming apostles and sending them at enemy cities/apostles is not interesting gameplay. -Culture victory: Needs reworking.-Diplomacy: The agenda system seems like a good idea, but shouldn’t the AI judge you more on your actions rather than really weird “goals” or styles of play? Why does an AI that has been at peace with you the entire game, trading prosperously, suddenly decide to denounce you or declare war on you simply because you didn’t play the game exactly how they wanted you to? Historically, neighbors fought each other more than countries from all the way across the world. Would write more, but I ran out of space.			"

												As much as I want to like this game, some of the changes from Civ V are interesting, but I cannot in good conscious recommend this game. Since day 1, I have not been able to get through a game without multiple crashes. I sent a ticket into 2k and after 3 or 4 emails later, each with a long list of ""troubleshooting ideas"" I still can't get a couple turns into a game without crashing to desktop. Everytime I crash, I immediately say ""yes"" to sending in the crash report, in hopes it will get noticed and fixed. Maybe in a few months, something will finally get changed and I can enjoy this game, but untill then, this is a definite NO from me.			"

												I am very tentative to recommend this. Here's why:Pros:-Amazing and beautiful gameplay. Captivating, complex, well-designed, and amazing.-Much more interactive-Religious victory and better religious units-AI has new agendasCons:-Broken AI: they don't upgrade their units and are almost always permaently hostile-Agendas between different civs conflict-DLC. Complete BS.I bought the deluxe edition, expecting that, in exchange for +$20, I'd be getting the first 4 DLC for free, which maybe costed $30-40 in total. So far, there's been 3 DLC released, at $5 each, all complete BS.Overall, buy the base game, DO NOT buy deluxe, and be very careful if you choose to buy a DLC.			"

												100% for polish, but 30% for actual game playIt looks & feels lovely, it is actually very polished, & I feel a big step up from Civ5.  I have been playing Civ for 25 years, 1->6... this is an astounding step up.  The wonders are.. well wonderful!  It is great to not have stone henge in the bloody ocean.  The cities look great & the graphics are easy on the eyes.  I loved finding new & amazing natural wonders too.Having said that, there are some things that really get on my goat, you can't name your cities??? What were they thinking?  You do not seem to be able to put your units in sentry mode, it is fortify or skip (& sometimes there is no skip even???).  You can not use auto end turn, or it runs out of control with no way to stop it, the game even ran in the background playing whilst I tried to change the setting back!!!  Even clicking on wake unit only seem to work if you could do it in the nano second of your turn, the same for trying to move a unit.  Barbarian camps appear with no notice, & the screen does not jump to their location if they appear... nor if any inter your space, or move out of the FOW;  so every turn I have to search my large border looking for a brown camp on a brown map (I often couldnt see them if they were on a resourse on forrest or jungle).  You can not put your units into an extended move, or they run right past the bad guys, you need to move just the alotment of each turns movement, or they miss their target.  I can not bump the edge of the screen to scroll up, it will work left, right & down.  The auto explore had my scouts taking a step left, then one right for 25 turns... so I was actually left feeling tired of micro-managing & interupted by having to end every turn manually & move every unit 1 tile at a time...  so 100% for polish, but 30% for actual game play.   I am horrified that they have chopped out some basic mechanics of the game since civ1.			"

												I might come back and edit this review in a few months.So I just bought Civilization VI on sale for 79.96NZD and was majorly disappointed. Luckily, you can get refunds. My main problem with the game is that it isn't fun. Not nearly as fun as Civilization V. I enjoyed the art style, a few of the mechanics, but honestly, it wasn't great - as a game. Every other negative review talks about AI problems. This one is no exception. The other leaders are... stupid, to say the least. I was playing as Arabia, with Rome and Brazil in my world. I was taking a while to expand my nation as I was focusing on building up my capital first. I had a few warriors and builders. Overall, I was smaller than the other two nations I had met, but not tiny. Suddenly, on the 50th turn (roughly) both Rome and Brazil decide to declare war on me after... no issues, land disputes or anything of the kind. Both of them tried to kill me. The two nation's units start flooding into my capital and there's really not much I can do. It was a disaster. That was after absolutely no previous troubles with either of them. In fact, I had been gifting gold to both leaders occasionally. I don't expect that to stop a war, but come on. The new additions of city districts and what not are okay, but you don't get much help with it. You're advisor will say ""My leige, we've just discovered some new information about [something to do with your city]."" and expect you to get on with it. It's not like I need a 50 page manual, but I need a bit of assistance with new features. I've watched Youtube videos and gameplay of the game and yet I found it unorganized and difficult to get a hang of. The gameplay is stale, too. It felt very slow and tedious, it took a life time to produce stuff with my cities because the turns were taking so long. This was on a small map, as well. There were only a few leaders and city states to have turns for. My computer is also very capable. I couldn't understand why, but I was genuinely bored playing this game. I didn't want to be. I had spent a good chunk of money on this game, I wanted it to be enjoyable. But it wasn't. I would recommend sticking with Civ V for the time being. At least until they fix the moronic AI. Maybe watch a few series online. I'm not here to tell you how to spend your money, but in my opinion, right now, the game isn't worth how much they're charging. Thanks for reading.			"

												This game has done a wonderful job setting itself apart from previous entries thanks to some significant revamps. The most obvious changes came from diplomacy. It's much more intricate and realistic, though a number of AI actions still don't make much sense. But, it's far more dependent on how the player reacts as opposed to the AI programming, and that's a huge step forward for the franchise. The next big change is the districts mechanic. The series standard has been to cram all your buildings and wonders in the city proper. Now you can build different districts (such as science, culture, commerce, etc) and wonders onto their own hexes. This makes managing your space far more important and also makes even the most passive players have to consider putting in some work on their military as AIs in particular like to use hit and run tactics on those spaces when you're at war. I don't think the franchise has ever looked better, and it's a good thing because the soundtrack, while good, doesn't quite live up to the glorious standards of Civ V. Thanks to this game's numerous tweaks and balances and bold revamping of major mechanics, this should be a must buy for any strategy fans and an inivitation to return to those who felt jilted by Beyond Earth.

												A great game with some deep flaws.Civ 6 does many big things right. And also a lot of small things so wrong. The UI is not streamlined at all and the game will waste your time, especially when your empire gets bigger and older. Best example is the ""Future Tech"" research. The game will ask you to choose it every couple of turns. At that point there is nothing else to choose, so why ask me over and over and over again? The same is true for cities who are maxed out, you still have to choose something every couple of turns. The fire-and-forget options of ""give me gold/research until I change it"" of former Civs is gone.And of course, again, the AI is half brain dead. This is true for troops movement on the map and also the ""diplomacy"" stuff.While a good AI is hard to do, most of the other stuff is easily fixable. So why is it here, at release, at full price?Before the worst problems are patched, I cannot recommend the game to anyone. Maybe except hardcore Civ fans?			"

												This game is pretty much civilization 5, but less fun.The largest problem with this game, and with a lot of the civ games, is they build these complex mechanics into their game, but there's little reason to invest in them.There's little reason, because the way to win the game on higher difficulties is to spam units and take advantage of the horrendous combat AI. Yes, the AI is bad. Yes, it's worse than in civ 5. Other civs will ignore your unprotected workers/settlers. They won't pillage. They won't attack a city unless they have it surrounded. Sometimes they'll ignore your units even if they have them surrounded. I've held off wars with just two slingers against entire armies. The barbarians are a far greater annoyance in this game than any civ.In summary, here's a list of things that are worse in civ 6 compared to civ 5:Minimap (impossible to read it)UI (complicated and uninformative)AI (they can't even use the new mechanics)Policies (You'll end up using the same 3-4 cards every game)Game speed (Production takes too long)Happiness/Amenities (You can't even tell which resources are providing you amenities)Resources (They are everywhere, but also pretty unexciting) "

Districts are a very nice addition but there could be some more upgrades.AI is pretty stupid.

Do not believe the publication reviews. This doesn't ""feel like a Civ game that's already had two expansions"". It feels like a regular Civ game on launch with even less play testing than V.Give it a year, time for them to slap us with a few expansions and start fixing some of the horridly broken things. "

												Sid Meier's Civilization series has been, for my money, the best of all strategy games for as long as they've been coming out. Each time they come up with a title which keeps me sit infront of my PC and greed me to commit 1 more TURN . About Civilization VI Civ VI feels more dynamic. It's moved away from a static progression style for your civics, government and research where once you picked an option, it was there to build on for the rest of the game. VI lets you do things like gear your social policies toward producing a more effective military, and after the completely justified war, shift focus to rebuilding your cities and keeping your post-war populace happy.Speaking of war, you can now also use casus belli - justified reasons for conflict with enemy Civs -to massively reduce the diplomatic penalty for warmongering usually tacked on to declarations of war.Progression on the huge scientific research tree is now no longer entirely determined by an abstract ""science"" production value, and you can get contextual bonuses based on how you play. Kill an enemy with slings, get a bonus to discovering Archery.The breadth of the new civic system, the expanded cities, deeper diplomacy and research tree make your choices feel more personal, important and specialised. You feel like your Civ is your own, not like you're racing to the end of the tech tree for the umpteenth timeCivilization VI in my opinion is a must buy . There have been a lot of improvements and many new models have been set up giving players more openess in the game.  Civilization VI is a game which will make you sit till 3 in the night just to make 1 more turn . #ADDICTIVE #10/10  "

												v.1.1Before we begin, I would like to make a note that this review is not a standing stone - it might change in both depth and final grade because of patches, updates, dlc, etc.I play this game since Civilization 1, and had certain expectations from this game, which unfortunately have not been met... yet. But this is a different story, because for now you want to know why this review goes against a mainstream - why cannot I recommend it?1.	Unfinished / unpolished product. I was afraid of this most, ""for this has never happened before, and here we go again..."" The game is not only half-finished - in fact, it also misses some key and significant things which ALL previous civilizations had always been proud of, such as:  - NO STEAMWORK - 0 scenarios (all previous games contained some scenarios in vanilla games),  - 0 maps other than computer generated ones, it does not even have a simple Earth map to start with (even Civilization 1 had it). - can rename a religion - which is a bad thing in mp - though cannot rename your country or cities (which is very strange) - no auto work function for builders - no alert button for units - the game makes it clear from the start what future DLC will contain (which in my opinion is an insult to players considering the $ 80 price tag for vanilla game) Of course, many of those things will be fixed by modders sooner or later - but that would be a different game, why should Firaxis get a credit for the things they were lazy to implement on their own in vanilla game?2.	AI. Lots of advertisements pointed out to the improved AI. I have not seen it, for I only see some scripted personalities which predictably react in certain way. In other words, there have been no significant improvement here: - AI still makes similar stupid mistakes as in Civilization 5 - for example, exploring with its own settlers, building cities in illogical places, having no tactics against a player other than sending waves of enemies until being defeated.  - Adding to all that, AI does not know how upgrade its own troops, so you may end up in situations where you see chariots, archers, etc. accompanied by submarines... This might look funny but when it happens over and over the game not only loses immersion but also some logic. - Like in previous games, AI still spams player with useless offers, praises and denounces3.	Multiplayer. I must admit that there is a big improvement here compared to civilization 5; however, it is far from being ideal. Desyncs, crashes happen very often, mp games are still very slow, especially at late game (wait times before player turns are unusually long). Also I do not understand why the game ""does not officially support"" more than 8 players in multiplayer (you need to manually unlock it) - even though we managed to play with 10 players, the fact that game says it is a bad sign as it only adds to what I said in point 1 about unfinished product.4.           Although the district / Wonders placement is interesting in theory - it has many issues in practice which only make life harder for players (which is especially the case in mp). Thus, when the game starts, you can only guess which tiles might later be useful (where is oil, iron, etc.) - so you start building districts, Wonders, and then in late game you realize that (1) you have no room for new more districts or Wonders (if you play on small islands map, this is a big problem), (2) the above mentioned tiles contained some useful resources which now lost forever. - This would be not a big problem  - (a) If the AI was in same circumstances - but unfortunately AI always know where to build due to scripts, (b) If the resources could be obtained by having Wonders on it, or (c) If the districts or Wonders could be transferred to other tiles. Now, keep in mind that you cannot remove your districts or Wonders, even if try to build it once but in few turns decide to build something else - you will be stuck with cosntruction on this tile forever.  - Unfortunately, all this makes Wonders a bit useless, especially if you play an island game - where every tile might make a difference. So, I think the game will improve if players would be allowed to build Wonders in districts (for example, 1 Wonder per corresponding district) - this would greatly conserve the space on the map and simply make the map look better. - Another problem with Wonders is that sometimes they look weird - I understand some Wonders like Pyramids or Colossus must be built outside of the city but why cannot Eifel Tower, Big Ben, etc. be built in the City Centers, which is the case in real life? Also, why do they need to look bigger than an actual city on the map?There are also some bugs and mp glitches which I do not want to talk about for now - I will give developers an opportunity to fix them, for we know that they know about it - they did test a game after all, am I right?So, at its current stage the game deserves 6.0 out of 10.

												I have played every mainline civ game since the start, and i am not impressed. This game has no soul, it feels like a visually sumptuous city builder. Pros:-It looks pretty-soundtrack seems beautifulCons:-Sean Fkn Bean (seriously, if like me you are allergic to him, do NOT go near this game)-It all feels a bit clunky, if you hover over your various different currencies at the top, you will get a basic break down, but then theres no further information, clicking on it does nowt. The same thing for the new stats in your city panel, some have hover over tooltips, others simply do not.-Happiness has been replaced by utilities, but there seems again to be no way of tracking this, it doesnt even get a place on the currencies bar at the top.-No overviews (Military, Diplomatic, Trade etc. all gone)  - there seems to be no way of seeing what all your potential trade routes are, it only recognises a potential trade route if you have a free trade unit in a city, and then only from that city.  - no diplomacy overview, you have to go into the video diplomacy screen everytime you want to check something, and theres a lot of info i'm used to having thats just not there-NO CITY SCREEN, you now get a panel that kind of treats a city like a unit (and no way of apparently leaving the city panel without deliberatly clicking on a unit and then on the ground?)-No City build queue-'C' no longer centres on unit, and cannot bind a key to do this-Religion, they seem to have kept the bare bones (most of the beliefs from civ5 seem to be there, tithe, pagodas etc); but there seems to be no way of identifying religious pressure, are you doing well or not? is a city of yours likely to convert? dunno.-No alert setting for units, you can fortify a unit but it will not wake up if there is an enemy unit in sight-No score panel (not vital, but always gave me a sense of how i was doing)I might add more to this later, Steam have refused to refund me because i played over 2 hours, so i'm stuck with it.My advice would be do not waste 50 quid on this, wait for the first xpac when hopefully (a la Civ5) they will resolve many of these QoL issues. It has many flaws that will become clearer as more people put the hours in, i can only hope Firaxis will respond.Thank you for your time.Edit: Oh and by the way, as others have pointed out, the AI is a reckless drunk.

												A poor, almost amateur, rendition of a AAA game. This game continues the trend of the popular Civilization series to coast on popularity and good looks, pouring a large budget into game assets while ignoring the AI. Despite its importance in a single player strategy game, the AI continues to get stupider with Civilization VI. Not only is the AI essentially broken, the game design is fundamentally flawed as it turns the playing experience into an exercise in micromanagement that is difficult to balance and is a nightmare to write AI for. This micromanagement serves to distract the player from the game's shortcomings: it is a single player strategy game with a hopelessly incompetent AI and poor game balance. After playing every game in the series, it is sad to see it develop like this.			"

												I loved Civilization V so I had to pick this one up. So far so good. I'm really enjoying it so far. I recommend buying it if you have liked any of the other civilization games. I have been a fan since the first one.

												So many bugs. I mean, where did the user friendlyness go?1. You get spammed permanently by a retard AI 1: Do you want to be friends? - Click no - Same turn retard AI. 2: Do you want to be friends? - Click no. Every god damn turn.              And like this isn't annoying enough it it self. You get these looooooong animatics that are absolute rubbish on top.2. Trade routes.. ""Use last trade route?"" - Nope, that seems too user friendly. Let's trash this option and make it utterly annoying.3. ""Alert"" - Wait what, who used that besides everyone? Let's trash it.4. Spy.. No comment. It's like gathering all the former points into one hugely annoying unit.5. Units and movement.          1. Let's pretend to select one unit, then select another one right after. Why? Cause we're on the why not train, choo mother-fkin choo.          2. Do you want to attack? Are you sure? No really, are you? - Hah, I'm moving you instead, idiot.          3. Seriously, wtf.All in all, this seems like a brand new game, which isn't in it self a bad thing. But why remove all the ""I don't really feel like scouting my entire civilization each turn"" features?If you want to buy it. Wait. Right now, it's close to being just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ new game. But it has the potential.First review ever. The game deserves being close to perfect, as usual.			"

												AI still buggy as hell.I'm playing as Catherine de Medici (France). Suddenly Catherine de Medici pops up on screen saying she declares war on me. I declared war on myself apparently. Then the Romans declare war on me 5 turns later - A civ I haven't even met yet...Within 12 turns, 4 civs have declared war on me, on Prince difficulty. No rhyme or reason. "

												This is going to be short.Preface - I have played well over 400 hours on Civ IV and 550 on Civ V. I truely love the franchise, they mean a great deal to me. That being said...I cannot get into this game. I am so confused and so bored. I feel like I never accomplish anything and the pacing feels so off. The AI is so random, so bad and, acts with no reason. I'm starting to feel like I am just going to go back to Civ V until we start getting some serious MOD help, or an expantion really, really quick.If you've yet to buy the game, wait. Wait for a massive update or an expansion. This game, as it stands, lacks so much and I wish that wasn't the case.			"

												This game is terrible compared to civ 5. It's almost the exact same game with different graphics but some of the mechanics need serious overhalls. I've tried three different games and each time no matter what i do i end up at war with 2 or 3 ai by turn 50. Also the multiplayer can take forever to tick over turns and often bugs out, so that someone has to leave and reconnect. There are a lot more things that I can't be bothered to waste my time typing, but I'm completely fed up with this game. It worldn't be too terrible if the game wasn't expensive, for $100 canadian it's not worth even considering till they patch everything. If it was $30 like civ 5 I probably still wouldn't have bought it. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to it and it turns out to be trash. I would recommend sticking to civ 5 for another 5 or 6 months till they fix everything.			"

												I have been a supporter of this franchise since the original but I've found this one to be a let down. Once you get over the gimmicks it gets boring really fast. The interactions and art style of the leaders irritates me something fierce, I miss seeing things like old mate monty looking like a bad♥♥♥♥♥♥glaring at you over his fire pit. The leaders are now just unmoving pictures, their ai is out of whack, the map is 'cute' but lacks functionality, The art style is nauseating, I don't know what happened. The city district gimmicks are, eh... gets old quick though.Don't waste your money, and this is coming from someone who'd hermit for days on end playing the older ones straight without getting bored.I'm really dissapointed.

												I have to say I am disappointed with the initial game. I am about 18 hours in and I am finding I want to play it less and less. I hope a fix is in the works and balance issues are addressed. I have played every version of Civilization.The key factor for my negative review is the AI. This has to be the worst AI to date. You used to be able to play the civilizations off each other or be able to walk a fine line with them, but in Civ 6; everything pisses them off. The lack consistency, One moment they praise you, the next moment is a surprise war, and typically the other AI follow suit, so when one AI declares war, the rest typically jump in. The AI also constantly makes mistakes. I have seen an AI claim I am settling too close after they founded a city on my border. It is tiring and frustrating that it isnt intuitive at all. I am forced to play the game automatically assuming the AI cant be trusted or dealt with, at that point, playing against more than 2 civs seems like a futile effort.  I am sorry Firaxis, you dropped the ball on this and I am so very disappointed. Please patch this.			"

												This is a good game. I'm not one for long reviews and whilst this one is mostly negative, I do recommend it as a game if you've enjoyed other Civ games. Aspects such as the music, combat, religious and research options are fairly diverse and well thought through. Different civs have their own flavour and features which makes for interesting playing.It does have issues though, one of the main being the AI. The AI are at times ridiculous, and it can be taken light heartedly up until a point where it starts to grate. They're difficult and sometimes virtually impossible to please and ally up with, because any sort of war will tarnish your reputation permanently. Even friendly civs can suddenly decide to declare war and try to wipe you out, then denounce you for conquering their cities as a result. Interaction with other civilisations is poor and limited, which only makes the issue of the AI worse. There are ways of appealing to certain civs, and learning how to do so is essential when the alternative is bad relations with everybody. There definitely needs to be a more complex way of interacting with other civs with better thought out AI behaviours.There are obviously other pros and cons but for me that's the main con.			"

												First off: I miss Leonard Nemoy doing the quotes...I've been playing the Civ games since civ2 back when i was 12 years old and alot's changed since then. Honestly, civ5 has been my favorite so far, and in alot of ways, civ6 has been a bit of a downgrade from that.Then again, alot of games aren't necessarily Great these days, more like mediocre.I dont know why games can't just find a formula and stick with what works. Civ6 is a perfect example of a company taking a franchise that's found a perfect balance and then trying to change it in hopes it might bring in a new generation of players (or whatever their motives). Honestly, they should just be adding onto what they've already established as 'good'. There's only a handful of playable civs in this current one, meaning the rest will slowly get filtered in through a bunch of DLC later on.As far as the gameplay goes, there's things i like about this game and things i dont. Its kinda cool that caravans now make roads, for instance. Hmmm... i'm actually having a hard time finding other things i like.I pictured a game with tons of civs and tons of new wonders and technologies, now i have two different fricking tech trees to deal with and no proper city screen. the ai and the diplomacy isnt all that great either, mostly because they're all highly irrational and wildly unpredictable.Dont even get me started on the workers or 'builders'. Three improvements then they disappear... really?I dont know, this is just another example of video gaming slowly going to crap. i dont hate this game, but i wasnt exactly wowed by it either. it felt like a step down from the earlier one and felt ridiculously over simplified for people that want to be a grand strategy game player, but dont really have the knack for it.I dont hate it, but i wont recomend it either.

												I have 300 hours in Civilization V, so I can tell you my general first impressions of this game.1: The districts added to the game seemed to add a sense of depth that was important and very crucial to city building, however it seemed pale in comparison to what it was aiming for. The overall city-building aspect seemed diminished overall because of the sheer power early game has potential for.2. Early game overpowers everything by far. If you don't have about 20 tiles between you and the nearest competitor, one of you can easily get facerolled by the mass production of low-level troops because cities no longer have their ability to attack units within 3 units of their hexagon, meaning that four warriors can just blatantly mass siege a city with little to no penalty for waiting long durations of time, unlike in Civ V where if you fortified and waited outside of an enemy's city, regardless of size, they could retaliate with little attacks to, at the very least, wittle you down, but it was very significant early game.3. AI is terrible, as usual, but this is exceptionally terrible compared to previous Civilization games due to the added depth of the Civil tree and Technology tree, as well as trying to determine when to build districts vs when to build regular improvements via builders, and they seem to only focus roughly 80-90% of their resources on ""improving"" themselves, but I have personally seen people have Settlers for over 50 turns sitting in a single tile at their city center, but I am not sure if it's because they can't find suitable land to settle a city on or if they are just uncertain of how to settle a city.3.1 AI seems to denounce randomly. If you declare one war and win or take anything of value, it will almost always have a huge penalty for the late game which usually involves every single AI in the game denouncing you and then eventually declaring a massive joint war against you due to ""Warmongering."" However, typically, they are very unmilitarized so you can defend very well unless you completely abandon all of your cities and leave them completely defenseless.4. The art style has caused a lot of various flak and such, but overall, I didn't mind it too much since I run on a more low-end PC. However, the art style feels very cartoonish, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it constantly feels like the map is extensively crowded. I cannot exactly pinpoint this issue, because Civilization 5 has moments where it feels more crowded, but something about the icons makes it feel very condensed and unreadable, and I believe it is because you cannot zoom out as much. Not really a huge issue, but still a complaint that didn't help the game overall.5. The separation of the Civics tree and the Technology tree as long as the added addition of the policy cards seem more like a tag-along for ""added depth,"" when in reality they just feel poorly designed overall, more specifically the card system. There are some cards that are overall better in almost every situation, especially early game, and do not harbor any benefits that can be established from the overall diversity of other cards. For example, the first two military card options you are able to choose from are recon units gaining more experience from exploring, or bonus damage against barbarians. Due to the very oppressive presence of barbarians, it is almost never a good idea to choose recon experience over the damage to barbarians. Not only that, but to level up any unit requires a turn where the unit is required to be dormant, meaning you have less time to actually explore, and in the early game where recon units are most impressive, you should always be competing to find tribal villages to jumpstart technologies and gain advantages. You can argue that in the long run, bonus recon exp pays off, but if barbarians have the opportunity to pillage your lands and stunt your growth, late game doesn't matter anymore because you simply don't have one, you're just another city waiting to be plundered at that point. And barbarians can very well utterly obliterate someone at the beginning to hinder their growth dramatically and leave them well open for invasion, and it can be a case of bad RNG from barbarian spawns. This also ties into how hard it is to defend cities early game.Overall, I'd say the separation of the Civics tree and Technology tree wasn't a bad idea, it was indeed a very GOOD idea, but the execution with the addition of cards seems very poor and needs a rework or overhaul, or at least tweaking. Balancing issues are overly abundant with early game civilizations have very obvious advantages due to the ability to mass spam units and faceroll an advantage.I paid $80 for this game, which is part of the reason I am very disappointed. Even if I had just paid the flat $60 for this game alone and not the future DLCs, I would have expected at least some bit of reassurance that my money wasn't entirely wasted due to unreleased content. It was fun in some moments as a relaxing, casual game, but overall, it provided little to no challenge due to the AI difficulties being additional cheats for the AI instead of actual reasoning or tweaks to the situational awareness.Within a few patches, I believe this game will be far more enjoyable, but don't buy it at full price unless you plan on waiting a few additional weeks to months for quality gameplay.

												The game itself is basically a reskinned Civ V. While there are some cool new features like the civics tree, the game is still clunky at this point. For example, diplomacy makes no sense. You will be declared friends with someone one turn and the next they declare a formal war on you. War weariness does not go away (I think this is a bug). The pathing for units can be kinda strange. At some point in the future this might be a fun game, after some patches. However, I do not recommend buying this game at this time. I wish I had not.			"

												Its well done IMO. Im looking at some of these reviews and they play hardly half an hour and go this is bad. Refund. Might as well just not buy it if you dont give it a chance. But thats their descision. Anyways. Feels really similiar to Civ 5. They tried something new and it was...meh. Now they went back to what works and people are still kinda meh about it. Honestly, I think a lot of work went into the art and to me thats fine. I love the new visuals and mechanics. Maybe very similiar but the visuals really make the game pop. So Im happy with my purchase and to me thats all that really matters. They could have added some more into the game and built up from civ 5. To wrap it up I like the new game, even if its very similiar. Theres a lot of new mechanics that make it different even with the similiarities. Some people disagree and thats fine. Im not an expert reviewer just someone who plays and throws his opinions out there on the game like some people do. Maybe this will help someone or maybe not.			"

												Lovely graphics, sound and maps, but I feel this game is deeply flawed.I'd label this a '4X-Casual' at best because it is missing most of the elements that make a meaningful 4X game. This is my FIRST Civilization game and I have to say - meh, what's all of the fuss about? I'm about 20 hours into the game and it all feels superficial and lacking. I have a lot of experience in 4x games, mostly Stardock. (GalCiv, Sorcerer King, Fallen Enchantress).Each turn feels like - Oh great, another popup, another useless uninspiring research or tech to click on.. Yawn. Some new cards to shuffle around that don't really do all that much.. Yawn. What this really feels like to me is 4X-Turbo Casual Edition.. This is like something Stardock would make for a mobile game.There are things I really like about this.. The music, sound, graphical style, different leaders, etc. But I can't help but feel everything else is tacked on and shallow. Were all previous Civ games like this? I purchased every prior one but actually never played them because I was playing other 4X games. I purchased this one highly discounted on a CDKey website ($29) and elected to make this the first one I actually play and really try to get into.But overall I am not 'feeling it' with this one. Certainly not even in the same league as Fallen Enchantress or GalCiv where I felt every decision I made impacted the game and researched technologies/sciences/religions had a major impact on the game. Also, and more importantly - the AI is terrible, cheats, and doesn't apply the same standards to the player. For example if I get anywhere near an AI he declares war on me but doesn't support warmonger penalties. If  do this I am immediately labeled a warmonger by every other AI and my trade suffers. Seriously?It just feels incomplete, possibly even rushed. Maybe I am spoiled by some of the really great 4X games out there? Either way, if this is how Civ games are I probably won't buy another one going forward. Obviously I cannot refund this at this point so I will probably utilize this as a super-casual 'i'm bored today' kind of game. But even then, with the other 4x out there why bother? Maybe it will grow on me with time? But at around 20 hours I should have a pretty good handle on it right now and so far it's pretty, it's mildly interesting, but otherwise basic and uninspiring.

												I strongly recommend not buying this game in its current state. At the moment it is totally unbalanced and plays totally wrong. To give an example: You get a great person that gives boost to computers research early middle ages. The Renaissance may as well not exist because in about 10 turns you are through it. The game needs a total balance pass for the middle ages. I am guessing a large part of this is due to distribution of old research content between regular research items and civics in this new version. So the whole thing plays completely wrong at the moment. By the time you build your first primitive siege unit you also discover cannons as well.AI is the weakest of any Civ iteration in history. It is well and truly sad. I am beginning to think it is more of a random number generator then an actual AI.Diplomacy would make feel as if you are dealing with a bunch of extremely drunk people. There is no logic or sanity to it. This also ties in with the practically non-existant AI I guess but still it deserves a mention.The maps seem to be smaller then previous versions and the lack of an in-game map editor is a big minus. Over the years I have played every single Civilization that came out and none frustrated me as much as this iteration. I hope the developers get their act together and fix the game instead of money grubbing with DLC's. Till then game is unplayable for me.			"

Even if I had just paid the flat $60 for this game alone and not the future DLCs, I would have expected at least some bit of reassurance that my money wasn't entirely wasted due to unreleased content. It was fun in some moments as a relaxing, casual game, but overall, it provided little to no challenge due to the AI difficulties being additional cheats for the AI instead of actual reasoning or tweaks to the situational awareness.Within a few patches, I believe this game will be far more enjoyable, but don't buy it at full price unless you plan on waiting a few additional weeks to months for quality gameplay.

												I don't like to play any game at normal or easy, I allways plays at maximum dificulty, so at Civ I loved to played in previous editions in Dedidity mode. This Civ VI have a lot of improvements, amazing graphics, bla, bla, bla, but it's cheated, completely cheated if you plays at deidty, and for me it's not funny anymore. I would be requesting a refund today if I wouldn't spend more than 30 hours playing it. A good game is this one that surprise you with amazing tactics, that gets you trying better and ingenious tacticts to win, nor a game that understand that the maximum dificult is just getting a civilization close to you a the turn number 5 with 6 warriors troops meanwhile you are still having to spend 8 turns to get your second warrior unit. Bad game, only enjoyable playing in lower dificulties.I've got bored with Civ VI for this reason.			"

												Impressive game, there are already many features in the vanilla game ( religions, commercial routes, 18 different empires, etc ), the game runs very smooth and so far i've found 0 bugs. The district system and politic system are very interesting, also the AI and diplocacy seems a lot better than Civ V. To be honest i also like the cartoonish sytle of the game, add a layer of visual fun. One of the best Civ game if not the best oneUpdate after the first big patch : The game has improved a lot after the first update. The Ai seems better but there's still room for more adjustments. Let's see what happe nafter the first DLC			"

												I need to just chime in against some of the hate that I'm seeing in the reviews. Here's the thing haters: You guys have hated on every single Civilization game that has come out. You have claimed that it is bad and that the previous one (this this case Civ V) was far superior (and in some cases the ""Golden Age"" of Civilization games). Then the next one comes out and you sing the same tune about the one that you so boldly claimed sucked. We all recall how much you guys hated on Civ V for being hex tiles and only allowing one unit per tile. Now you love it and this game (that you played for 2-3 hours) is the one that sucks. It's a really disgusting aspect of an otherwise amazing Civilization community. And a LOT of the negative reviews are following this mantra.The game is great. It's Civ V with some improvements, changes, and a new coat of paint. They have streamlined (not dumbed down) some aspects of the game, which is a great thing. They've made it so cities require a bit more thought to manage (e.g. Wonders take up tiles). And it's overall just a fantastic new iteration into the franchise we all know and love. Sure, it needs some work. But so does every Civ game when it first comes out. I have no doubt that they will polish it up with free patches and then expand upon it further with some expansion packs.Don't believe the hate. The game is not perfect (no Civ is when it's released) but it's a great addition to the franchise and well worth your $60. You will once again spend your night saying ""One more turn"" until it's time to get up for work.SCORE: 9/10(Disclaimer: I have played far more than 2 hours. I played before release (not on steam) at multiple stages of development as well as the release candidate version. I've probably put in a total of 40-50 hours so far and I see no end in sight. And if you don't believe me then that's fine. I got nothing to prove and I don't really care if you believe me or not)Edits/Additions:- One of the biggest and most consistent complaints is that you can't rename cities or leaders. Really guys? It's not that big of a deal and I'm sure they will add that back in.- Just because the graphics remind you of Civilization Revolution doesn't mean the game is watered down, simplified, or dumbed down.

												I really wanted to like Civ 6, but I just can't. Most of the new features sound like a good idea, and in part they are, but most all have a big negative to them. I could type out all the problems for hours, but I will just give a few to save time.New city district system sounds good, but you are still stuck building only one thing a turn despite having all these seperate building complexes. Then builders are only good 3 times, so you have to spend extra build time on them. And if something gets damaged you have to repair it via the build system. That sometimes takes 9+ turns! It can also take several turns for your troops to simply go from one side of your city to the other.Roads are built automatically by traders. Sounds good, but that means you have to send traders to every city even if you don't want to. So you have to send one from City A to City B, City B to City C, City C to City A, and so on. You can get an engineer to build roads,... ONE TILE AT A TIME!AI leaders seem to be bipolar. They shame you over the size of your military, and then the very next turn say how impressive it is. They will delare war on you, and then just sit there and never send any troops. Also enemy units sometimes get stuck and never move from a tile.You now gain influence over city states by sending them envoys, but it's a constant see-saw battle with the AI. You send 5 envoys. They send 6. Then you send 7, so they send 8. In one game I kept losing my caravans because my max number would constantly be changing from 5 to 10 because my influence would rise and fall constantly.Religon? Nope. Not even going to go there. The changes sound good on paper, but it sucks. I turned off religion victory and just avoid all of it.Notification! Notifications have been reduced to a tiny hidden button on the lower right. I had barbarians running thru my capital and never knew. Is someone close to victory? Well you better constantly be checking the victory tab or you'll never know. I lost a game and I still don't know why! The end screen doesn't even show who or how they won!Meh, I don't want to go on any longer. I can see a good game here, but so much needs to be fixed. I'm sure modders are already working on a lot of these problems. I'd wait a few month before purchasing.			"

												There is much to admire about this game, and I enjoyed the first few games. However, all sense of immersion and threat is quickly sunken when you realise how bad the AI is with its military units. If you attack a city, they will circle around the borders without any apparent purpose, or attack barbarians of much lesser threat than your army. The AI is also hopeless at capturing your cities. There is only very minimal improvement after 2 patches. Simply unacceptable for the price they are asking. I will update to a positive review at a later time if the AI is improved; I really want to like this game.			"

												I bought the 80 dollar pre-release in september my friend bought the 60 dollar version. From the beggining my games keeped crashing after playing 4 hours both single player and online. I meet and exceeded the recommended requirements. After 3 weeks of this issue I decided to contact 2k tech support.  I talked to 5 different people all with different responses and things to do. Last week, I recieved information on the steps to try and resolve the gameplay issues, as well as information that there could be something corrupted in my system. After doing these steps this morning at 4AM, my computer was effectively turned into a $2000.00 paperweight. I lost all of my drivers, all ability to connect to the internet, and all of the work I had stored on this computer. I immediately responed to them via the email on my phone about what had just happened and requested a refund ASAP because I could no longer get a refund through steam because it was past their refunt time. My last message from them was basically ""You have to contact the vendor, we're just tech support."" I will be posting the full conversation after this. Not only am I totally disheartened about this game, but I have deleted ALL of my Sid Meier games, including Starship, Colonization, both original and remastered, Trains, Alpha Centauri, Civil War, and all of the Civilizations. I will personally never buy a game from 2K or Faraxis. As for my computer, it is officially FUBAR, and will need to be replaced. I am using an old laptop of my wifes at the moment, and it is unable to play any of the games I have in my library at all. I am beyond angry. Do not buy this game, do not play this game, do not give this company your money.Here is the last week Hi Alessi,Thank you for your reply.We've checked your recent MSInfo and found that a file called WzBGTools.exe was in your windows error log that could be involved in the problem. Can you please run an anti-virus/malware scan on your computer?Also, we've noticed errors with other games and applications on your PC, we will recommend the following fix, so please do them in the order as provided:Firstly, try running the System File Checker. The System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.To run the SFC, just follow these steps:1) Click on the Start button and in the search field type ""CMD"". 2) In the list of results you will see ""Command Prompt"" please right-click and select ""Run as Administrator""3) In the new window please type ""sfc /scannow"" (note the space between sfc and ""/"")You may have to run this up to 3 times to verify/fix all the problems.You may find more information about the file checker on the Microsoft's support site found hereAfter you've run the file checker, please let us know if it was able to find any issues and resolve them all.We also ask that you please include the CBS.log file that SFC will create after the process is complete when responding. To locate this file;1) Click on the Start button and in the search field type ""CMD""2) At the command prompt, type the below command and press ENTER:findstr /c:""[SR]"" %windir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log >""%userprofile%\Desktop\sfcdetails.txt""3) The file ""sfcdetails.txt"" should then be created on your desktop.4) Attach this file with your response.Now then, please also try running the game in a ""Clean Boot"" of Windows after running the System File Checker to see if there is any other program interfering with the game.The instructions on how to do this are hereThe article also explains how to boot back into your normal Windows environment.Also, please re-verify your game integrity once again while in Clean Boot before launching your game. To do so;From within the Steam Library page, right-click on your game and select ""Properties"".From within the ""Local Files"" tab select the option to ""Verify Integrity of Game Cache"".That's it!Hopefully that'll help with your issue but should you have any questions regarding any of the troubleshooting steps, or any further comments or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.Best regards,Usama N.2K SupportAvatarAlessiodemonte3 Today at 11:47After doing everything said by this email I now demand my money back asap. My computer has lost Internet connection as well sound and the ability to get past restore points. Congratulations your company just turned my pc into a 2,000 paperweight.

Today at 14:49Dear Alessiodemonte3,Thank you for taking the time to contact 2K Support and for being willing to share your feedback with us.I understand how discouraging this all must be, as well as how frustrating it must be that you’re still unable to enjoy your game.I would love to fulfill your refund request and make sure you feel adequately compensated (and appreciated) as our customer. Unfortunately, we as the support team don’t process any monetary transactions whatsoever. We do not have the ability to do so, nor do we have access to the vendor’s tools which would be required to process a monetary refund.That doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t get a refund, though. I would suggest contacting your retailer and putting in a refund request with them. Beyond that, however, if you’re experiencing any difficulty with the game (other than wanting a refund), we’ll do whatever we can to help alleviate any concerns and get you back into the game. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.Thank you again for your patience and cooperation. I genuinely hope we can get you playing again.In the meantime, if you have any other questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to ask; it’d be my pleasure to assist you further!Sincerely,Nathan D.2K Support			"

												Being a Civ fan is hard to get to the point of feeling i need to write a DON'T RECOMEND review... but i feel i was almost robed by the Civ's team. The game lacks everything, 1. IAs are stupid idiot and characters are too plain. Every character has only a couple sentences which makes the simulation of a conversation simply WRONG... AIs does things without any logic or reason.2. FULL OF BUGS. I nuked an allied and took cities without declearing war, an ally won't always join war if someone else attacks. If one of those happend you also get other bugs as laking different options while in diplomacy  and other details3. The DLCs where ridiculusly expensive, they were worth not half of what i payied. NOT ONE OF THE DLCs4. VERY FEW diferences between civs, only 3 or 4 differences, in a long game you end up using the same mix-civ... result of getting to a stage when those very very little differences just don't apply... and all the civs are the same.5. Faith plays a vital rol in the game. TOO MUCHAND MANY MORE DISSAPOINTMENTS Sorry for any laguage error. i'll be waiting for WAAAAYYYY better CIV VII			"

												This is a good game. I'm not one for long reviews and whilst this one is mostly negative, I do recommend it as a game if you've enjoyed other Civ games. Aspects such as the music, combat, religious and research options are fairly diverse and well thought through. Different civs have their own flavour and features which makes for interesting playing.It does have issues though, one of the main being the AI. The AI are at times ridiculous, and it can be taken light heartedly up until a point where it starts to grate. They're difficult and sometimes virtually impossible to please and ally up with, because any sort of war will tarnish your reputation permanently. Even friendly civs can suddenly decide to declare war and try to wipe you out, then denounce you for conquering their cities as a result. Interaction with other civilisations is poor and limited, which only makes the issue of the AI worse. There are ways of appealing to certain civs, and learning how to do so is essential when the alternative is bad relations with everybody. There definitely needs to be a more complex way of interacting with other civs with better thought out AI behaviours.There are obviously other pros and cons but for me that's the main con.			"

												I played a game through the Renaissance era so far and I really like it. The Disticts are a really great system and they increase the difficulty of the game while also making it more customisable. The new city state system is so much better than the old one. The envoys that you earn make it so that you no longer have to constantly babysit your allied city-states so they do not leave you. The AI on prince seems much weaker than it was in Civ V and they have no subtlety and tend to spend ages on preparing for war. Great People are definitely my favorite part of this game. Each unique person has their own special ability that they add to a unit or use to generate a resource. I don't mind the amenities system, but it isn't really that great either. The new research tree is definitely different aand takes some getting used to but in the long run makes the game have more replay value. Overall I love the game and it is a great edition to the franchise			"

												Civilization VI(Also Know As: Why Should You Should Wait for DLC)Score: 6/10 (As of Vanilla)The improvements of this game are vast and the unstacking of cities will likely be viewed as at least as monumental of a change as the unstacking of units in V's system. The units (although need aesthtic development) are overall alright although the new movement feature that leaves you with 0.25 of a movement credit left that you can't use is somewhat irritating when playing on faster game modes. However for every step forward, Firaxis has seemingly learned nothing from even the fully developed civilization V game. The AI is without any better word to describe it is ""f*cking atrocious and idiotic"". The fact that you can use the diplomacy system to gain trust only to be declared war upon and denounced is unbelievable. At the start I anticipated the ""era penalty reductions"" to solve this but the slightest transgression will result in an all out war. Science victory's and the collective rest of the possible conditions are only fully possible if you can face off the brunt of the attack and eventually beat them into submission in order to ensure they dont raid your land again. This has happened every game I have played up to emperor (and I imagine the trend will continue and only make the game more difficult to play, and not in a good way). This game is well rounded in style and intial ideas but it needs major work in order to become a fully fledged game worth of the Civilization heritage it claims. In conclusion, wait for the DLC, wait for AI improvements, if they never come (to my potential chagrin) then save your money and time and stick with V unitil VI goes on sale.			"

												Game has alot of blance and game play issues specily with the computer. as of 11-17-2016major issues are me and my friend played game with standard time on large map with 16 other computerp players.1 Research - what will happen is countrys will get boost that give you 50% to 100% research and you will get alot of these boost which will push people in directions that make game unblanced, you will end up with people in classical age with other people who are in modern area.2 tatical combat, the ombat is pretty bad due to how unblanced it is, units you will want to push for are Archers, Militamen, Mech Infantry Nukes and for ships you want  Iorn Clads, Missle Curisers.all other units are not worth there time or effort to even have. - reason for this is that game is that unblanced towards these units air plans are worth lessc ompletly no point in making them at all.Mech Infantry are the prime goal, they can take out anything even most advance modern tanks. here example I had three battleships 2 destoryers and the mech infantry with there machine guns in a troop transport wipped out all 5 all 5 had full health and all 5 where in grouped with 3 and mech infantry was grouped in 3 with full health.all my units did about 9 damage average vs his 30 damage aginst my ships.then there tanks mech infantry will do on average 30 to 40 damage to tank groups and tank group armys will do about 10 damage to mech everything in game dos about 10 damage to mech infantry and mech infanry average 20 to 30 to everything elese in game even army of choppers who are made to take out calavery units cant not take out mech infantry who are calavary units not with out sustaining heavy damage where they will need to retreat.the best tatic in this game is just to nuke everything and move in mech infanatry nukes wipe also nukes will wipe out every unit but mech infantry and Nuckler submarines3. AI the AI is pisspoor, especialy the late game after they get so far into game they just give up completly I had a 150 turn war with africa who had 15 mech infantry and I had no units at all on any cities he just would come into my land then he would leave and I just built up my nuke stock pile and on turn 150 unlshead my 25 nukes across his whole country wiped out everything took my tank and bunny hoped every one of his cities.that is best tatic to use in this game.O also no one cares if you nuke or how many nukes you use there no consequences in this game for nuking period. sure the AI may not like you but who cares you have nukes and one tank you will wipe every one out period.in civ 4 nukes where controled by nuke winter and fallout which had to be cleaned up now its just a timmer you wait out 10 or 20 turns and all effects of nuking are gone no issues at all so just ramp them up and shell them out.4. best starting stragety which was fixed in civ4 but issue in civ 5 and still is in civ 6 is city sprawl best way to make money and start game is push out as many cities as possiable and fill them with libarys, on a standard map with standard time if you build 3 warriors thenr ush to archery build archer three archers then push out settlers I had 6 cities 7 archers 2 warriors with just 7 archers and 2 warrior i beat back india elphants atez warriors and english all at sametime. plus due to number of cities I had I brought in enough money to buy libarys and with in 95 turns of start of game I was working on gun powder due to all boost I was getting while every one elese in game was still on there 2nd city and had spearmen.the game mechanics are easy to minuplate - the AI is easy to Minuplate once you figure out the unfair unit bais and that research and research boost are like gods pushing you tech far into future and that more cities = good, as for citie moral do not worry about it its been so nerfed in this game that you dont need give a rats butt about any of the people in cities being happy or not I never did never made a single aminity in any city ever.till they fix blanace and AI I do not feel this game is worth price.

												I have tried to get enjoyment out of it. But I just can't, its not fun. The AI is a mess it always wants to fight you or offer trade that is horribly in favor of the AI. Like every extra resource you have for just one gold a turn, bad. I have no idea what the AI is thinking and when they do fight you they throw all their ancient era units against your modern army. Every war I have fought has been terribly one sided. And they always end up hating you no matter what you do so why bother. The district aspect might be fun if you had any idea why. You can do things one time and not the another. So you just end up throwing down districts for amenitites. There is no explanation why things happen or don't happen. So you need to figure out the why most of the time. Even then sometimes you just can't figure out why. Like religions, what do they do. Why even bother? I really can't find a real reason to pursue one. I usually forget about religions until the my civ in flooded with tons of missionary units. It's like they are cockroaches, they just keep coming. I ask the the other civ to stop. They say sure and but they keep coming. I have tried many different rulers and set ups but it always ends up the same way. Me just steam rolling over the rest of the civs. I have stopped playing it because of the lack of enjoyment. I bought the digital pass package (which I now regret) so hopefully after a expansion it will get better. But for right now I have put this game aside.			"

												As much as I'd love to give this a reccomendation- the fact that Civ V is so cheap and offers more than this is a pretty good indicator that you should wait for some proper DLC to rear its head, especially with the more outlying problems such as AI and the sort being a bit naff..			"

												Original Civ player from the first one back in the early 90s and played them all since then.  Was excited with some of the features being described and initially found it fun for the first few games until I realized that I was winning every game really quickly no matter the level.  It's a shame because the AI is just terrible.  It is pathetic when you are more worried about the barbarians then the other nations.  Maybe in a patch or two I can revisit this game, but right now it is just too easy.  No challenge means no excitement and no satisfaction of winning.			"

												Despite it's similar appearance to Civ V, this part of the series is unashamedly an Ed Beach take on the genre and has all the lovely crunchy mechanics he brought to the previous version right out of the box. Because of this, it maintains the integrity of V's expanded game without the clunkiness of trying to hide the ""board game"" that Civ V's base game was trying to emulate. The question for me isn't ""Is it worth buying over V?"", it's ""Is it better than IV?"", and long time civ fams should hopefully understand that I am posing the possibility that this may be the best Civ game ever made.After 10 hours play, I've come to the conclusion that the answer is no, not quite - not the Civ IV that had 10 years of expansions and patches gradually polishing the gameplay, it is still king, but, significantly, this is the best game when you compare the launch versions. As long as Firaxis continue in their tradition of honing their games, and I have heard nothing to suggest they won't, I predict this will be the best civ game by the first expansion.So to explain why I believe the game deserves this acolade, I'm not going to list new features and changes to the gameplay, for the simple reason that it won't do it justice and they are easy enough to find. Most gamers are aware that in modern strategy games, the merest of tweaks can radically alter the game - think Blizzard making making roach armour light not heavy and this rewrote zerg strategies at every level of the game. The theme of this game is simple, your environment dictates your strategy. Every mechanic feeds into and loops back to the subtleties of how the tiles around your land grant bonuses and allow buildings the space to be built. No mountains, or rainforest near you, forget science victory unless your opponents are similarly stranded. Fortunately, the civilizations are no longer locked to one strategy, with the changes to the government and religion, your choice of civ will always support at least three paths to victory, at a minimum. The initial metagame is only just emerging, and weaknesses and optimal plays will surely emerge, but nothing is isolated. Your choices interlock with the other mechanics so seamlessly. The game isn't perfect though, it has the odd bug in this build, I've not experienced anything game ending, there are scattered reports from others who seem to have some. The worst bug I've experienced is when a civ that you havent met declares war on you (because their ally has dragged them in), it is your own portrait character that springs up, not theirs. A bit surprising the first time it happens, but nothing game ending, for sure.The major problem is the AI. If you're a player who roleplays the game, likes to relax while playing, you will be pleased. The AI is less directed to winning, it plays in a consistent way. There seems to be far less unexpected war declarations, and when it does happen, it usually makes sense. The flipside of this though is that it's not as good at winning the game, so if you're playing for a challenge, you will be disapointed with single player. Of course you can crank the level up and allow the AI to have all it's cheats turned on, but as always, the game makes no effort to hide the cheats from you - some people will be OK with that, others resent it.So, should you get this game? In my opinion, if you play to relax and play a role rather than a strategy puzzle, yes, absolutely. this game is better for you than Civ V, and already almost as good as Civ IV.If you play multi player, well, then that depends on what your group want, obviously you will play the version they all have, but I see no reason to resist the change.If you think the game is expensive, no, don't get it yet. The game will drop in price, it's currently at it's least value for money. Civ games have lifecycles measured in decades, value is of course subjective but it will always tend to be better value and you will not miss out by not being in on day one.If you play single player for a strategic challenge, then no, stick with V unless you really want the new mechanics. This game is not as good for you.If you hate one unit per tile, also no, this game, for all it's much vaunted limited stacking, spends the vast majority of the game as civ V, with blankets of troops spread across the landscape.Hope this helps :)			"

												After 12 hours of gameplay, I came to a conclusion that Civilisation-6 was an experiment, developers did NOT redesign the whole game (i.e. combat is mostly the same) and left a few other previously known features mostly unchanged, but they made more focus on the small things, which may only be appreciated by limited audience (including me).Highs (SUBJECTIVE):- Visuals and UI feels more intuitive than in previous games.- War justifications result in different warmonger score: Relegious wars, Formal wars, etc.- Leaders forgive your aggression as the time progresses.- District concept is simple to grasp.- Exploration feels more interesting than in previous games,- I like the new fog of war mechanics.- When you re-prioritise your city's foucs (food, production, science...), the improved titles change their appearance (i.e. fields become greener / browner).- Continent names!- Multuple map modes (religious overview, governmental forms, etc. similar to EU4).- Each civilisation has a music theme that evolves in complexity every two eras.Lows (SUBJECTIVE):- AI: ""I do not care that you have the largest tank fleet in the world, my cavemen with clubs will beat the hell of your tank's paint... and while I do that, let me build a new city on the border with you"".- Starting positions seem to be poorly thought through - you start way to close to other civilisations.- Religious victory is too over-powered - should be not 51% but rather 91% of another's civilisation's cities following the religions.- Scientific boosts are over-powered (50% for most of things that you would do naturally). I end up entering Industrial era in 10th century. Should either have slighly reduced boost (i.e. 10-25%) or have higher triggering conditions.- Half of the cultural cards are rubbish.- Most of the great people do not bring great benefits.- The new happiness mechanic is not clear (may well be part of my learning curve).- Micro-management is way too admin-driven (I would like to be able to auto-renew trades based on simple conditions, such as keep this route internal with the larges production output, followed by largest income, followed by largest food, etc.).- District repariments are tedious (""Okay, bunch of rebels decided to burn a few tiles and now it will take me 20 turns to get the city of where it was and I cannot use builders to boost / auto-complete repairs).

												So I've played this game for 33 hours as of this review. At the moment I cannot recommend it.Many similar issues to others, but I'll list my specifics here: UI - notifications are bad. All of a sudden you win or lose a game with little notification of whats happening Diplomacy - frustrating. From the constant interuptions to again the UI just feels like a chore City management - as the game progresses the length of time to build seems to get greater, very hard to work on a wide empire which is needed for this game - tall empires no longer work.  Also again the UI for the city management is lacking.  It's a constant battle between managing amenities, housing and being able to expand in science, culture, etc.  End up buying most unitsThere are some good things Using traders to build roads works really well. Combat is much better than Civ V.  War is more enjoyable and later features such as corps allow you to build strong armies.There are also quite a few bugs, of which I expect most will be squashed with patches and hopefully changes will come with further DLC which continue to improve the game.  Civ V wasn't great until Brave New World so Firaxis have a chance to make this a great game, but it's not one on release.			"

												I am disappionted. Full disclosure, my favorite Civ game was ""Civilization: call to power""Every map feels claustrophobic, with lots of other Civs, city states , barbarians and impassable/unusable mountains. I do not understand why they insist on cluttering up the screen with crap, giving the feeling of getting on an urban bus rather than founding a new civilization. Yes, you can modify the maps in settings and have less of all this stuff but then many Civ's special abilities revolve around city states and barbarians. Do I really have to tell the game that I don't want an arcady /zerg experience when I buy a franchise KNOWN as a deep strategy game? Districts and wonders. They all take up their very own space on the map. I don't like it.Governments..the ""Cards"" seems like an interesting mechanic, too bad all choices aren't equal.Factions and their ""super"" powers""..Some of the special units and powers are just plain dumb and often inconsequential.Religion ...just dumbThe music sounds great, the visuals are adequete BUT the Game is terrible. Poorly thought out clunky, mechanics eclipse all the good hard work that went into making this game.			"

												A terrible shame Civ 6 turned out like this.Right now, I cannot recommend this game.  Bugs aside, all games have bugs, glitches even bad mechanics, Civ 6 has an abundance of all of these.But there worst of it is:Non Existant Ai.  Games like this need to have a fairly easy ai, otherwise they'd be just too hard to win, but in Civ 5 the ai was realitively good.. in 6.. it's a joke.  All it does is denounce you then declare war.  Over and Over.. then it looses all it's soldiers and begs mercy and surrenders.  That is all Civ 6 really is now an endless cycle of Denouncements, War and Begging.You cannot play a political game, there are no options to bribe ai to fight each other, there's so much missing from Civ that makes it fun and otherwise different that this has been dumbed down so much you need a lobotomy to actually enjoy it.I would say about 80% of what makes Civ 5 endless fun, is missing from Civ 6.There is some fun to be had, the graphics, textures and animations are excellent, there's alot of artistry and research gone into making the game at it's core, the music is excellent as well.  But there is no game to be played outside of endlessly doing the same thing.Multiplayer is extremely unstable at the moment, so there's no real way of playing it online.There's some serious game breaking bugs, which can effectively damage your computer, after forcing reboots due to crashes and hard lockups. The Victories aren't well thought out, the design of the game just doesn't exist at all, many units have been removed, many units are massively overpowered, really the game has been made for very young kids.. it's like a Revolutions 3. It's a terrible shame.  Really is.  The new ideas, builders, let you build stuff in 1 turn, you get 3-5 charges depending on civ and techs.. they make the game too easy.  Instant free endless repairs.The tech and new civics tree, is horribly messed up, you can get tech before you discover the resources to make it.. it's just badly designed.The road networks are now only made by traders, so you end up with a mess of roads all over the map, the movement on roads is so slow that you don't really get any decent movement until the end of the game.  Making them pretty pointless.   You could actually play the game without any roads at all.Maps are smaller, there's a total lack of map designs, no earth map, no scenarios, the smaller islands are useless because of the addition of districts which are designed to slow you down and specialise your cities.The only changes which I like are wonders now take a tile, so you're limited to how many you can build, there have little wonder movies which are nice, there's now a day/night cycle which is kinda cool. But everything else.. the tech boosts.. supposed to help you, actually hinder you, trying to push you down slow research linear gaming paths.. you're better off just ignoring the entire idea of boosts and following your own aspiration.Overall I'd give Civ 6 in it's current form about 4/10.  Until the ai is patched so it doesn't just hate you for the entire game, you're better off playing Civ 5...............................................Right, that was then, this is now.With the latest patch and including the use of some mods, the game is now largely enjoyable.  Ai has been improved, online stability as well.  The game avgs 11-12k online at any one time.  And that's only counting steam players.   Still it is roughly a quarter of the number still playing Civ 5, which says alot for the game.I'm changing my recommendation to Yes.  As the game is now viably enjoyable, but Buyer beware, it may not be the experience you're expecting and it might well require a solid expansion from firaxis to become as saintly as Civ 5.At this point I'd give Civ 6 a 6/10.

												Yeah, it needs some patchwork; however, after the dissapointment that was BE, this is a giant leap in the right direction. Civ 6 reestablished the standard for these games. It has the same gamefeel that the Civ games should have, while beatifully implimenting new feature and mechanics.Now, if only they could fix the AI...(I kid you not I had city state allies attacking an enemy civ with no less than 17 catapults while I used 2 field caannons and a cavalry, it was quite amusingly absurd)			"

Maybe this guy is fo- oh... Surprise attack! Religion better not be op... Oh wait here comes the Chinese army of missionaries. Graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the leaders do look better. I like some of the new resources, and they do make victory points a lot more challenging. I also enjoy making wonders and finding natural wonders. I have NO clue why everyone is crying about the online is broken, but i've played with a few friends and I haven't had any issue at all, I haven't even been forced off of it a few times when playing to long like on CIV V.  I'm going to give this one a thumbs up just because I personally still enjoy playing it ... But please fix your AI...			"

												Horrible AI, just horrible, I can't believe they can't get proper AI programmers and testers with the resources Firaxis has, smaller companies do a much better job on other strategy games. Terrible pacing and gameplay is back to CIV3 infinite city sprawl strategies. The rest of the game is only OK, it looks good and the move to districts and wonder placement on the map is a welcome bold move.As expected, they took features present in the previous games to sell later as DLC, like the UN or world congress. Other features are refined and improved on like city-states and great people.Still playable and OK to pass the time, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it yet, wait for expansions and big sales.I'd give it a 6/10.Oh also they sold the digital deluxe edition promising buyers to get the first DLCs and then only released civs and scenarios, you know stuff that any modder can do on their spare time, disgusting and borderline fraudulent move.

												Chances are, you already know if you are inclined to buy this or not. I have played, let's just say a lot of hours of the other Civ games (and the SM railroads game - a personal fav of mine). Most people are comparing, so read theirs for comparisons. Here's what was NEW to me, a few tidbits you may or may not like in Civ 6: - After you discover land and walk away, the map grays over. It REALLY takes getting used to, or at least it did for me. - The builders can make 3 land tile adjustments, than they disappear. They don't just stick around forever. - Your cities need to have enough housing to grow, they don't just massively expland.- Your cities need to have enough ammenities, you know, comforts. Some of these take actual tiles to build on- When you build a wonder, for example, you have to build it on a tile. It doesn't just appear somewhere close to your city.- In case you can't tell, what you place on the tiles around your cities is VERY important, and can massively change your people's happiness. - When you get a promotion, you don't have to choose between health and a bonus. Your fighters get a bonus AND health at the same time. Oh, and the loading time between turns is long right now, but that's to be expected as new releases for them are always a bit loady.			"

												I've started playing with CIV 4, so I'm not obssessed with the ""classic"" civ nor do I have unsurmountable nostalgia about how the previous games worked. That said, I've played Civ 4-5 to the point of cazy and I do love macromanaging and the turn based system. I will be recommanding Civ 6, but only because there is no ""neutral"" review. This is the context for this review.Graphics: (intro prettier then for Civ 5, but less inspirering for me)I don't mind the cartoony graphics, it could of been worst and they are well made. They also make it easier to spot the ressources and do make the game more appealing as far as buildings/districts go, if not ""realistic"".Gameplay: (Good game, but missing something...)So far I have yet to get the heart of the mecanics of this one. I love macromanaging, but this is a bit much as far as details go. The base fonctions are similar to Civ 5, but they changed a bit how they work and I still haven't wraped my head around those changes. Luckily, the menus are familiar, somewhat easy to navigate and provide lots of information. They've also made the game more challenging by limiting the use of builders/workers and pushing the importance of fresh water and surrounding hexes on districts and improvements. Old players might feel, like I do, that there is something missing...Some depth or whatever and so I recommand this game more for new player, with reserve, and eagerly await some miracle update that will make me go: ""Aaah, ok! Thats more like it!"".Fixings: -Make the Civclopedia available in the starting menu, not just in game.-Make the map we end up with editable in game, like in Civ 4...REALLY missed that in Civ 5.-More map types (like Earth, editable in game).-The ability to make one's own leader (customization, looks and all). I love the historic leaders, but what if I want to be one...In game at least? "

												I came into this game, expecting it to be much more confusing and complex than its predecessor, Sid Meier's Civilization V, and while at some points it was more difficult, it's still the same CIV that everyone knows and loves. The new changes such as Governments and Civic Policies really did bring a lot to the table. The new ""Fog of War"" is a lot smoother and nice to watch while you move around, but I still liked how it was a lot more in CIV5. Not to say it's bad, but it's what I personally enjoyed more. Sometimes in CIV6 I mix up what's been unexplored and what has been. The AI is definitely a lot smarter now, but I can't help but find they may have made them too aggressive. As a normally peaceful player myself, I've had to resort to plotting against them to defend myself, whereas in CIV5 I didn't usually need to do that unless I really released that the AI didn't like me. Some players may like this, but I am sure you can understand why a guy like me might not. But some good things are the Wonders you can find and build. Instead of being normally made wherever in CIV5 (I always found it weird that you would build the Pyramids in water), you are now required to place wonders in separate tiles in certain areas (example: Pyramids in Desert tiles only, Great Lighthouse in Water only, etc.). This makes it a lot more realistic, which I love. Overall, there are many changes that will effect the way you play CIV, but also still keeping the base game there. Love this game, this series, and every company involved in creating it, continue what you're doing.But please, in a future DLC add Canada as a CIV. Not is it just my home country, but it is also the home country of Sid Meier himself. Make him and I proud ;)			"

												Civilization 6 is just... great. Tons of new mechanics and concepts, and all of them seems to be successful. No lags, good performance, no crushes. Thanks Firaxis! Hope that some issues with UI will be fixed soon ( more information in tooltops, better font size).			"

												-The starting spots for civs, even on a HUGE map are rediculously close.-The AI rode the short bus to Civilization school-You can't costumize leader names-You can't costumize civilization names-You can't build roads in order send armies faster/settle faster (since they only come from trade routes)-The Barbarians are endless. I would clear a camp and literally 2 turns later there would be a new camp built in the same spot.-The quotes are attrocious.-Rival civ leaders seem to be autistic with tourettes. They just spout off stupid stuff at you at random time and constantly decide you're a war monger.-You still can't capture Great People...which since you're competing for them from a pool would make sense that you could do.-You still have a cap on how much experience you can gain from fighting barbarians...which means you will definitely lose many units to fighting barbarians (combined with below)-When you receive a promotion, you partially heal, but you can't move or flight, so you're stuck there and just keep fighting and likely dying. Not only that, since you are capped with fighting barbarians, they can just wear you down and you have no chance to get a promotion so you can't heal.-Perhaps i'm getting old...i've been playing Civilation since it was called ""Railroads!"", but the map is very confusing to me. I think it's probably too cluttered...but the brown fog of war scheme seems to make reading the map very difficult.It's a boring game. "

												Well after 16 hours gameplay and not winning a SINGLE game (what the ♥♥♥♥ man), it's review time.Civ 6 graphically is a huge step up from Civ 5. It's cartoony style doesn't take away from the game and actually make it a bit more light hearted and fun, which I know is a complaint from most people because it changes the ""tone"" of the game. It's a game people, we don't really want to take over the world, do we? I'm loving the new fog of war effect that makes any area of the map that isnt yours look like an old school map. I did find some glitches with that in which I had destroyed barbarian camps and they would still show illustrated on fog of war map.The map changes are a welcome change, with any city improvements (now classed under districts) and wonders taking up hex tile in your cities borders. It actually feels like your city is growing with every turn. Adjacency bonuses also add a challenge to your city building game. Another change to the city improvements is Builders. In Civ 5 your Workers would improve surrounding tiles and would do so automated if that was one thing you didnt want to bother with. Civ 6 has thrown the Worker out and the Builder in. These units have a restricted numbers of improvements and wont automate either so you need to think pretty hard about the improvements that will benefit your game.Another major change is the Tech tree, which is one of the first complaints I saw about the game. One mouth breathing Steam reviewer wrote ""TEHRE'S LESS TECHNOLOGIES, DIS IS♥♥♥♥♥♥@""True, there is less. However there are two tree's to play with. Your Tech tree and your Civics tree. Civics take pretty much any improvement that isnt a technology (ie. social policies, government style etc) and lets you research those separately. Both trees are bolstered by the new Eureka! system. Every technology and civic upgrade now comes with a single objective quest that, upon completion, will spark a Eureka! moment that halves the research time. Sailing is researched in less time once you’ve discovered the ocean, for example. It's a nice new element to the game that doesnt feel tedious.Diplomacy has also been changed as well, AI leaders now have identifiable Agenda's which become really apparent because the leaders like to tell you all the time that they don't like that you are different from them (see attached photo's.). I think the biggest downfall of the game is AI gameplay, which I know is an easy patch fix that hopefully comes along soon. Some leaders are either overly aggressive or non existent. I have yet to play a game with Gandhi yet so that could add another element.Still though, I am yet to win a match (to be fair, i've only played one all the way through, i've started a few just to try a few different strategies).I did find barbarians quite overly unbearable in the first game or so, I actually turned them off in my current game so I could actually enjoy the progression. I also find it a bit weird that barbarians would still be invading in the 1900's..Another great feature is the ability to build armies instead of single units, which i'm pretty sure comes from a tech advancement.All in all it's a great improvement on Civ 5, with some awesome new features and retaining some of the better features. I'll probably get a lot more hours out of this and I say bring on any DLC, I'll be throwing my money at it.			"

												Game has alot of blance and game play issues specily with the computer. as of 11-17-2016major issues are me and my friend played game with standard time on large map with 16 other computerp players.1 Research - what will happen is countrys will get boost that give you 50% to 100% research and you will get alot of these boost which will push people in directions that make game unblanced, you will end up with people in classical age with other people who are in modern area.2 tatical combat, the ombat is pretty bad due to how unblanced it is, units you will want to push for are Archers, Militamen, Mech Infantry Nukes and for ships you want  Iorn Clads, Missle Curisers.all other units are not worth there time or effort to even have. - reason for this is that game is that unblanced towards these units air plans are worth lessc ompletly no point in making them at all.Mech Infantry are the prime goal, they can take out anything even most advance modern tanks. here example I had three battleships 2 destoryers and the mech infantry with there machine guns in a troop transport wipped out all 5 all 5 had full health and all 5 where in grouped with 3 and mech infantry was grouped in 3 with full health.all my units did about 9 damage average vs his 30 damage aginst my ships.then there tanks mech infantry will do on average 30 to 40 damage to tank groups and tank group armys will do about 10 damage to mech everything in game dos about 10 damage to mech infantry and mech infanry average 20 to 30 to everything elese in game even army of choppers who are made to take out calavery units cant not take out mech infantry who are calavary units not with out sustaining heavy damage where they will need to retreat.the best tatic in this game is just to nuke everything and move in mech infanatry nukes wipe also nukes will wipe out every unit but mech infantry and Nuckler submarines3. AI the AI is pisspoor, especialy the late game after they get so far into game they just give up completly I had a 150 turn war with africa who had 15 mech infantry and I had no units at all on any cities he just would come into my land then he would leave and I just built up my nuke stock pile and on turn 150 unlshead my 25 nukes across his whole country wiped out everything took my tank and bunny hoped every one of his cities.that is best tatic to use in this game.O also no one cares if you nuke or how many nukes you use there no consequences in this game for nuking period. sure the AI may not like you but who cares you have nukes and one tank you will wipe every one out period.in civ 4 nukes where controled by nuke winter and fallout which had to be cleaned up now its just a timmer you wait out 10 or 20 turns and all effects of nuking are gone no issues at all so just ramp them up and shell them out.4. best starting stragety which was fixed in civ4 but issue in civ 5 and still is in civ 6 is city sprawl best way to make money and start game is push out as many cities as possiable and fill them with libarys, on a standard map with standard time if you build 3 warriors thenr ush to archery build archer three archers then push out settlers I had 6 cities 7 archers 2 warriors with just 7 archers and 2 warrior i beat back india elphants atez warriors and english all at sametime. plus due to number of cities I had I brought in enough money to buy libarys and with in 95 turns of start of game I was working on gun powder due to all boost I was getting while every one elese in game was still on there 2nd city and had spearmen.the game mechanics are easy to minuplate - the AI is easy to Minuplate once you figure out the unfair unit bais and that research and research boost are like gods pushing you tech far into future and that more cities = good, as for citie moral do not worry about it its been so nerfed in this game that you dont need give a rats butt about any of the people in cities being happy or not I never did never made a single aminity in any city ever.till they fix blanace and AI I do not feel this game is worth price.

												Do one thing before purchasing this game. Google ""Civ 6 crash to desktop"" and see the numerous people plagued with this above common problem.The Good: It follows the traditional Civilization Genre of planning and strategy. There are aspects that do become tedious during gameplay. Ex. No automated production forces you to constantly choose the same item in later turns of the game. Overall: It is enjoyable If your able to play without problem.WHY I would NOT recommend this game. Games are supposed to be fun and relaxing.  Only it isnt when you're 30 or 200 turns into a game and crash.  You cant even reload and continue because at that point it keeps doing it on that particular moment.  The issue of crashing to desktop for no rhyme or reason is very frustrating. Tenaciously, I have tried a multitude of things to fix the issue. Declared war, made trades, loaded saved games to earlier turn, changed civics etc.  Checked game integrity, windows updates, turned off firewall, Reloaded drivers, Uninstalled/Re-installled game and many other things that would normally cause hiccup errors.  Bottom line:  There is a design flaw somewhere. I imagine it would take the development team to peel through the whole game to fix it. Something thats gonna cost the company time and money.  Most likely why it hasnt been fixed yet for so many people.If you do buy the game. I wish you good luck. You have been warned... lol			"

												The game is alot like Civ V but diffrent as well. One thing is diplomacy, which is alot better than Civ V but is still not yet balanced. The game style of moving characters and trading has not changed too much.The nice and cool thing about civ 6 is how you build your cities its alot more strategy involved unlike in Civ V, which is a strong plus, but all in all its not better enough than Civ V to spend more than 10 euros to buy it.I would also like to add that the graphics has a higher resolution which is nicer but alot more cartoonish as well, which is not to my liking. The design of the leaders are a prime example of this. The quotes used in discovery of science seems alot more comedical and so does also the movement of the units you use, like the builder, when repairing things he jumps around like ninja, this aswell is not to my liking.

												Civilization VI(Also Know As: Why Should You Should Wait for DLC)Score: 6/10 (As of Vanilla)The improvements of this game are vast and the unstacking of cities will likely be viewed as at least as monumental of a change as the unstacking of units in V's system. The units (although need aesthtic development) are overall alright although the new movement feature that leaves you with 0.25 of a movement credit left that you can't use is somewhat irritating when playing on faster game modes. However for every step forward, Firaxis has seemingly learned nothing from even the fully developed civilization V game. The AI is without any better word to describe it is ""f*cking atrocious and idiotic"". The fact that you can use the diplomacy system to gain trust only to be declared war upon and denounced is unbelievable. At the start I anticipated the ""era penalty reductions"" to solve this but the slightest transgression will result in an all out war. Science victory's and the collective rest of the possible conditions are only fully possible if you can face off the brunt of the attack and eventually beat them into submission in order to ensure they dont raid your land again. This has happened every game I have played up to emperor (and I imagine the trend will continue and only make the game more difficult to play, and not in a good way). This game is well rounded in style and intial ideas but it needs major work in order to become a fully fledged game worth of the Civilization heritage it claims. In conclusion, wait for the DLC, wait for AI improvements, if they never come (to my potential chagrin) then save your money and time and stick with V unitil VI goes on sale.			"

												I have tried to get enjoyment out of it. But I just can't, its not fun. The AI is a mess it always wants to fight you or offer trade that is horribly in favor of the AI. Like every extra resource you have for just one gold a turn, bad. I have no idea what the AI is thinking and when they do fight you they throw all their ancient era units against your modern army. Every war I have fought has been terribly one sided. And they always end up hating you no matter what you do so why bother. The district aspect might be fun if you had any idea why. You can do things one time and not the another. So you just end up throwing down districts for amenitites. There is no explanation why things happen or don't happen. So you need to figure out the why most of the time. Even then sometimes you just can't figure out why. Like religions, what do they do. Why even bother? I really can't find a real reason to pursue one. I usually forget about religions until the my civ in flooded with tons of missionary units. It's like they are cockroaches, they just keep coming. I ask the the other civ to stop. They say sure and but they keep coming. I have tried many different rulers and set ups but it always ends up the same way. Me just steam rolling over the rest of the civs. I have stopped playing it because of the lack of enjoyment. I bought the digital pass package (which I now regret) so hopefully after a expansion it will get better. But for right now I have put this game aside.			"

												Yeah, it needs some patchwork; however, after the dissapointment that was BE, this is a giant leap in the right direction. Civ 6 reestablished the standard for these games. It has the same gamefeel that the Civ games should have, while beatifully implimenting new feature and mechanics.Now, if only they could fix the AI...(I kid you not I had city state allies attacking an enemy civ with no less than 17 catapults while I used 2 field caannons and a cavalry, it was quite amusingly absurd)			"

												So I've played this game for 33 hours as of this review. At the moment I cannot recommend it.Many similar issues to others, but I'll list my specifics here: UI - notifications are bad. All of a sudden you win or lose a game with little notification of whats happening Diplomacy - frustrating. From the constant interuptions to again the UI just feels like a chore City management - as the game progresses the length of time to build seems to get greater, very hard to work on a wide empire which is needed for this game - tall empires no longer work.  Also again the UI for the city management is lacking.  It's a constant battle between managing amenities, housing and being able to expand in science, culture, etc.  End up buying most unitsThere are some good things Using traders to build roads works really well. Combat is much better than Civ V.  War is more enjoyable and later features such as corps allow you to build strong armies.There are also quite a few bugs, of which I expect most will be squashed with patches and hopefully changes will come with further DLC which continue to improve the game.  Civ V wasn't great until Brave New World so Firaxis have a chance to make this a great game, but it's not one on release.			"

Maybe this guy is fo- oh... Surprise attack! Religion better not be op... Oh wait here comes the Chinese army of missionaries. Graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the leaders do look better. I like some of the new resources, and they do make victory points a lot more challenging. I also enjoy making wonders and finding natural wonders. I have NO clue why everyone is crying about the online is broken, but i've played with a few friends and I haven't had any issue at all, I haven't even been forced off of it a few times when playing to long like on CIV V.  I'm going to give this one a thumbs up just because I personally still enjoy playing it ... But please fix your AI...			"

												Despite it's similar appearance to Civ V, this part of the series is unashamedly an Ed Beach take on the genre and has all the lovely crunchy mechanics he brought to the previous version right out of the box. Because of this, it maintains the integrity of V's expanded game without the clunkiness of trying to hide the ""board game"" that Civ V's base game was trying to emulate. The question for me isn't ""Is it worth buying over V?"", it's ""Is it better than IV?"", and long time civ fams should hopefully understand that I am posing the possibility that this may be the best Civ game ever made.After 10 hours play, I've come to the conclusion that the answer is no, not quite - not the Civ IV that had 10 years of expansions and patches gradually polishing the gameplay, it is still king, but, significantly, this is the best game when you compare the launch versions. As long as Firaxis continue in their tradition of honing their games, and I have heard nothing to suggest they won't, I predict this will be the best civ game by the first expansion.So to explain why I believe the game deserves this acolade, I'm not going to list new features and changes to the gameplay, for the simple reason that it won't do it justice and they are easy enough to find. Most gamers are aware that in modern strategy games, the merest of tweaks can radically alter the game - think Blizzard making making roach armour light not heavy and this rewrote zerg strategies at every level of the game. The theme of this game is simple, your environment dictates your strategy. Every mechanic feeds into and loops back to the subtleties of how the tiles around your land grant bonuses and allow buildings the space to be built. No mountains, or rainforest near you, forget science victory unless your opponents are similarly stranded. Fortunately, the civilizations are no longer locked to one strategy, with the changes to the government and religion, your choice of civ will always support at least three paths to victory, at a minimum. The initial metagame is only just emerging, and weaknesses and optimal plays will surely emerge, but nothing is isolated. Your choices interlock with the other mechanics so seamlessly. The game isn't perfect though, it has the odd bug in this build, I've not experienced anything game ending, there are scattered reports from others who seem to have some. The worst bug I've experienced is when a civ that you havent met declares war on you (because their ally has dragged them in), it is your own portrait character that springs up, not theirs. A bit surprising the first time it happens, but nothing game ending, for sure.The major problem is the AI. If you're a player who roleplays the game, likes to relax while playing, you will be pleased. The AI is less directed to winning, it plays in a consistent way. There seems to be far less unexpected war declarations, and when it does happen, it usually makes sense. The flipside of this though is that it's not as good at winning the game, so if you're playing for a challenge, you will be disapointed with single player. Of course you can crank the level up and allow the AI to have all it's cheats turned on, but as always, the game makes no effort to hide the cheats from you - some people will be OK with that, others resent it.So, should you get this game? In my opinion, if you play to relax and play a role rather than a strategy puzzle, yes, absolutely. this game is better for you than Civ V, and already almost as good as Civ IV.If you play multi player, well, then that depends on what your group want, obviously you will play the version they all have, but I see no reason to resist the change.If you think the game is expensive, no, don't get it yet. The game will drop in price, it's currently at it's least value for money. Civ games have lifecycles measured in decades, value is of course subjective but it will always tend to be better value and you will not miss out by not being in on day one.If you play single player for a strategic challenge, then no, stick with V unless you really want the new mechanics. This game is not as good for you.If you hate one unit per tile, also no, this game, for all it's much vaunted limited stacking, spends the vast majority of the game as civ V, with blankets of troops spread across the landscape.Hope this helps :)			"

												After 12 hours of gameplay, I came to a conclusion that Civilisation-6 was an experiment, developers did NOT redesign the whole game (i.e. combat is mostly the same) and left a few other previously known features mostly unchanged, but they made more focus on the small things, which may only be appreciated by limited audience (including me).Highs (SUBJECTIVE):- Visuals and UI feels more intuitive than in previous games.- War justifications result in different warmonger score: Relegious wars, Formal wars, etc.- Leaders forgive your aggression as the time progresses.- District concept is simple to grasp.- Exploration feels more interesting than in previous games,- I like the new fog of war mechanics.- When you re-prioritise your city's foucs (food, production, science...), the improved titles change their appearance (i.e. fields become greener / browner).- Continent names!- Multuple map modes (religious overview, governmental forms, etc. similar to EU4).- Each civilisation has a music theme that evolves in complexity every two eras.Lows (SUBJECTIVE):- AI: ""I do not care that you have the largest tank fleet in the world, my cavemen with clubs will beat the hell of your tank's paint... and while I do that, let me build a new city on the border with you"".- Starting positions seem to be poorly thought through - you start way to close to other civilisations.- Religious victory is too over-powered - should be not 51% but rather 91% of another's civilisation's cities following the religions.- Scientific boosts are over-powered (50% for most of things that you would do naturally). I end up entering Industrial era in 10th century. Should either have slighly reduced boost (i.e. 10-25%) or have higher triggering conditions.- Half of the cultural cards are rubbish.- Most of the great people do not bring great benefits.- The new happiness mechanic is not clear (may well be part of my learning curve).- Micro-management is way too admin-driven (I would like to be able to auto-renew trades based on simple conditions, such as keep this route internal with the larges production output, followed by largest income, followed by largest food, etc.).- District repariments are tedious (""Okay, bunch of rebels decided to burn a few tiles and now it will take me 20 turns to get the city of where it was and I cannot use builders to boost / auto-complete repairs).

												I've started playing with CIV 4, so I'm not obssessed with the ""classic"" civ nor do I have unsurmountable nostalgia about how the previous games worked. That said, I've played Civ 4-5 to the point of cazy and I do love macromanaging and the turn based system. I will be recommanding Civ 6, but only because there is no ""neutral"" review. This is the context for this review.Graphics: (intro prettier then for Civ 5, but less inspirering for me)I don't mind the cartoony graphics, it could of been worst and they are well made. They also make it easier to spot the ressources and do make the game more appealing as far as buildings/districts go, if not ""realistic"".Gameplay: (Good game, but missing something...)So far I have yet to get the heart of the mecanics of this one. I love macromanaging, but this is a bit much as far as details go. The base fonctions are similar to Civ 5, but they changed a bit how they work and I still haven't wraped my head around those changes. Luckily, the menus are familiar, somewhat easy to navigate and provide lots of information. They've also made the game more challenging by limiting the use of builders/workers and pushing the importance of fresh water and surrounding hexes on districts and improvements. Old players might feel, like I do, that there is something missing...Some depth or whatever and so I recommand this game more for new player, with reserve, and eagerly await some miracle update that will make me go: ""Aaah, ok! Thats more like it!"".Fixings: -Make the Civclopedia available in the starting menu, not just in game.-Make the map we end up with editable in game, like in Civ 4...REALLY missed that in Civ 5.-More map types (like Earth, editable in game).-The ability to make one's own leader (customization, looks and all). I love the historic leaders, but what if I want to be one...In game at least? "

												I’m a long-time Civilization player and I have to say that this latest version is very disappointing. Extremely buggy, especially in the later game. The AI is, well, dumb and extremely annoying at times. Other civilization leaders will pop up and say things to you that make no sense whatsoever. They will denounce you for any little thing so keeping relationships good is almost impossible. The warmongering level seems to be way too aggressive.

												Meh - doesn't offer much over Civ V.tl;dr Play Civ 5. At 20 hours I was pretty much bored with Civ 6.I'm a fan of Civ titles all the way back to the first Civ on my Amiga. I can't count the number of all-nighters I put in on Civ 4 and Civ 5. Civ 6 feels like it was handed to a team that wanted to go a good job but had no history with the series, and stopped working as soon as the title was ""stable"". I'm not sure they ever played a game to completion either, given how tedious and annoying late game is in Civ 6. If someone told me this game had 25 years of franchise gameplay refinement I would assume they were being sarcastic if I didn't know better. The Good:Builder mechanic has improved.City districts are a fun and meaningful improvement.Early-game road building by traders is an improvementEureka mechanic is an improvementTroop stacking system is an improvement (over no stacking)Great people's unique features were improvedOnly place it crashes is when exiting to desktopThe Bad:The UI: unit icons are semi-transparent on city names = can't read either. Mouse over notifications also pops up the info for tile behind the notifcation icon, blocking the notification. Nothing like the the wheel of leaders to easily and quicly see agreements between civs. Dialog with the AI's have a delay before buttons fade in and it slows down the game - though they're just invisible - they make noise when you mouse over them. New Game menu settings don't remember settings, so I have to set them every time I start a new game. Can't skip the leader intro.Later-game playability: No city production queue, no automated production, no automated builders, no automated trader route assignment or renewal, no patrol paths = an annoying late game, Despite there only being ""Future Technology N"" it isn't auto-researched.The AI: Others have discussed the enemy AI so I won't bother with it, other than to say the criticisms are correct. However, the friendly AI is also bad. For example: Troops on auto explore will ask what to do when encountering barbarians. You move them away from the barbarians. You turn auto-explore back on. They run straight back to the barbarians and get killed. Improving vs the enemy AI is partly learning why the suggestions offered by the friendly AI are bad.Misc:Despite being an incredibly useful early-game policy for winning games, and an integral facet of our history as a species, slavery has been removed, along with state religion.

Use great admirals to blockade enemy cities. The city can't launch any ships nor can they attack your blockade. Your battleship will be completely held at-bay by a great admiral commanding a caravel navy.Antiquity sites can no longer be turned into tourist attactions.

												So my first review,As someone who grew up with Civ 1 i'd love to be telling you how this is an improvement more fun and better, but it quite simply isnt. It looks nicer, i'll grant them that.An intricate part of Civ is how you interact with other civilizations, now to be able to that you would have to have a diplomacy system that makes sense, which it doesnt.To give you an example; the mere trading of a luxury resource for another with another civ is nigh impossible.You set it up in the deal screen, they disagree, you ask them what would make it work? Well how about half or all your money you make for 30 turns some cash on the side and the thing you want to trade for my one thing.This happens to declared friendship civ's, civ's that denounced me civ's ive never done anything too. They cannot be arsed.So there's no reasonable trade, (you can get them to trade 1 luxury resource for your 2 for example but screw that im still beeing cheated.)Warmongering: the bright lights at Civ have adressed this (so they claim) So i don't like war, i like to outshine other civ's in awesomeness, sadly some civ's dont like that so they declare war with you, which is fine.However when i then stomp their armies and or towns forcing them to obliteration other civ's hate me for it.If i let them live they will just come again. So you have a choice to either kill them totally and be done with them, which results in their friends and even enemies hating you and declaring war more often than not.Or rinse and repeat the tedious process of showing a civ it's place beneath you every so many years.The ai decision making skills are just outright bad.One last thing; The absolute nonsensical idiot that made the reset to default button in the create game section, it came after one of the first big patches and the thought made me happy.The execution of it however just makes me want to shoot you in your hands.You know how it is you set up a game as russia for example with island plates and the dumbass game just keeps setting you at the map border just because there is loads of tundra an you are left with a region you can build 2 towns on at best, with crappy ground yields etc. so restart time. So i thought wow! now i can just restart the game without having to set all the parameters again which is a tedious part of the game? No,Hell no.This button was made for people who are adjusting their game setup there an then who see what they are doing yet forget what they click , thats the only purpose of that button, an idiot aid for people that do not know what they are clicking an then want to restore what they clicked a minute before. Because leave the setup screen an come back an all your parameters are back to default, which pretty much renders the button useless in the first place.You like Civ? This Civ delivers you some 60 euro eyecandy while playing just dont get your hopes up if you expect a better game, it's worse.			"

												Ok so I did one playthrough and for the first time in all the civ I dont even have any desire to play it again... so much for one more turn... horrible horrible game this will be the death of the franchise for old fans :( - Graphic are weird not bad but kinda reminds you of a FB game- auto roads are horrible cant control the palcement does not consider the rest of your empire or where you want to head just take point A to point B makes an auto road... outside your territory half the time gets killed by stupid barbarien cause you cant control the unit... roads are place so badly your military units wont even use them most of the time when you are moving the military from east to west of the empire for example... clearly made with no though of large empires maybe they had 3-4 cities in mind when they built this crap :/- Leaders are terrible both the choices they pick and actually interacting with them I would call them bipolar but it be an insut to the people that are bipolar cause these leaders are worst -_- very very VERY bizare play through you can tell they spent 99% of their time developing the district system (which is actually neat) and just toss up the rest of the game together with zero consideration to anything that work... Honestly just doing a DLC for civ 5 with district would have been MUCH better then this final product Very unfortunate I got the deluxe edition trusting the civ franchise... wish I never bough it not as disapointing as Starship but not far... this is 2 in a row now not sure who running things over there now but its becoming increasingly obvious beyond earth and civ 5 are the last decent thing they plan on releasing :(			"

												Greedy ♥♥♥ company that should go down like many other companies making cheap ♥♥♥ DLC for people that spend money on the deluxe to ""save"" money bying the dlc individually. Hope all these companies go bankrupt soon so the companies that actually give Gameplay worth the money.Worst thing is the fact that mods add Civ's for free while they dare ask 5 euros for it.			"

												Well, after 6 installments, they finally got one wrong. Some great ideas here, but the AI and some of the development ideas are just plain bad. (Like, the metal things you can make before ever researching steel). Numerous drops from Lan games for other players when City-States are turned on. Extremely long wait times between turns when City-States are allowed. If you have the Religious Victory option turned off, some cultures will continue to spam Missionaries endlessly for no reason at all. (Seriously, in a game yesterday with 3 Lan players, we counted 75 missionaries wandering inside our borders...the lag was atrocious and we kept getting random disconnects because there were so many units on the screen at one time). There are some good ideas here...the City Districts ideas are excellent as well as some of the Government and Policy ""Card"" setups, but sadly, the majority of the game is just really, really bad.I really wanted to like this, as I've loved the other Civs all the way back to the first, but this one I just can't, in good conscience, recommend. I would not recommend this to any friends and I would not recommend buying this when there's a sale. At least not in the state it's in as of the date of this review.			"

												After a while the hype of a new civilization game wears off and you realize that all these dynamic new features are just not quite as fun as the last civ... yet.. I'm not even gonna talk about the AI.Also yeah... I bought the digital deluxe and it feels like a rip off.  It was basically a way to force you to buy 4 dlc for what is turning out to be a super mild discount.  I'm gonna think twice about buying anything ""deluxe"" from fireaxis again.I can't recommend this game.  The leaders feel hyped up, but most of them are no fun to play.Also they took out my restart button so now I have to make a new game from scratch... one of the funnest parts of the game for me is to get a good starting location.  I don't care if it ruins the challenge of the game.  I just want to build the most glorious empire using all the mechanics available to me, including restarting until I get an excellent start.  Why can't people understand that it's still fun to try build the greatest empire ever.  Also it's single player, so why do they care if I restart or not.Go play Civ V or Rimworld or something until they fix this mess.			"

												After only a few hours I am quite disappointed that the look and feel harkens back to Civilization IV.For me  the Visual style somehow doesn't capture the intense visceral addiction I feel with Civilization V to continue playing late into the night. The unit animation is too smooth, almost plodding on a 4Ghz Core i7 Nvidia Gaming Laptop.The game itself is buggy, some scouts have to be prodded to auto explore. One  of the scouts I had to move them manually at time but sometime after multiple 'auto explore'/E key strokes to get them going. The other scout auto explored w/oo problem.Further its possible to leave Gov Policy slots empty before ending the turn, with no obvious way (yet) to go back during the same turn and finsh selecting policy cards(There must be a way). I am prompted at the beginning of the next turn to select those gov policies. Districts make sense, if I spend additional time playing this I look forward learning about Districts more.As to bugs this is for a Linux Laptop I hope since the this version was only reciently release they will  be soon fixed. I have logged 1300+ hours on Civ 5 and while I am still just a warlord/prince at heart at this time I don't know if there is enough joy/fun to be had in CIV 6.For me now the game is not fun or addictive, or compelling.

												A short review:THE GOOD - The new districts add a lot to the game, allowing you to specialise cities to certain activities (science, military, culture, industry, trade, and religion). There is also a certain amount of city planning you need to do for optimum placements and balance of districts, imporvements and wonders (you can only build one type of thing per tile). - Splitting the tech tree into two (science and culture) was a fantastic idea. Now its possible to focus on one or the other depending on the type of game you want to play and what victory condition you are going for.THE BADThe user interface is poor. Here are a couple of my bugbears: - Very little information is given, for example once you've built something the only way you can find out what bonuses it gives you is by going into the Civipedia (bloody nightmare when working out which city is best to build something in). Some other examples include no information on which cities benefit (or not) from luxury resources, trade route management does not show previous route or how many turns until it ends. - Map scrolling is bugged. If edge srolling is enabled it scrolls the map when you attempt to click on UI buttons (this can be fixed by manually editing the ini files but have to redo it whenever the game updates). No option to bind keys (e.g. can't use WASD). THE UGLYThe AI is just terrible, giving zero challenge to the game. Computer players declare war and attack with a few low tech units even though they have higher tech and I have high tech units. AI is actually a misnomer because there is no hint of intelligence there at all. Quite often it decalres war and doesn't send anything to attack . Worse, civs will decalre war, you wipe out their army, then 20 turns later they do the same even knowing that you have a much better army and beat them last time they went to war.  All the higher difficulties seem to do is add more starting units, so if you are unlucky you will be attacked in the first few turns by a huge army you can't possibly defeat. If this doesn't happen, then once you build your army up you can simply smash your opponents with ease. Once you are about a quarter way into the game you pretty much know if you are going to win or not.CONCLUSIONWhilst there are some great new features, the appauling AI ruins this game. Firaxis really needs to fix the AI and improve the UI if they want to make Civ 6 a game worthy of its name.			"

												Do one thing before purchasing this game. Google ""Civ 6 crash to desktop"" and see the numerous people plagued with this above common problem.The Good: It follows the traditional Civilization Genre of planning and strategy. There are aspects that do become tedious during gameplay. Ex. No automated production forces you to constantly choose the same item in later turns of the game. Overall: It is enjoyable If your able to play without problem.WHY I would NOT recommend this game. Games are supposed to be fun and relaxing.  Only it isnt when you're 30 or 200 turns into a game and crash.  You cant even reload and continue because at that point it keeps doing it on that particular moment.  The issue of crashing to desktop for no rhyme or reason is very frustrating. Tenaciously, I have tried a multitude of things to fix the issue. Declared war, made trades, loaded saved games to earlier turn, changed civics etc.  Checked game integrity, windows updates, turned off firewall, Reloaded drivers, Uninstalled/Re-installled game and many other things that would normally cause hiccup errors.  Bottom line:  There is a design flaw somewhere. I imagine it would take the development team to peel through the whole game to fix it. Something thats gonna cost the company time and money.  Most likely why it hasnt been fixed yet for so many people.If you do buy the game. I wish you good luck. You have been warned... lol			"

												I’m a long-time Civilization player and I have to say that this latest version is very disappointing. Extremely buggy, especially in the later game. The AI is, well, dumb and extremely annoying at times. Other civilization leaders will pop up and say things to you that make no sense whatsoever. They will denounce you for any little thing so keeping relationships good is almost impossible. The warmongering level seems to be way too aggressive. For example, war was constantly declared on me, and I became the warmonger when I started to win battles – even though I never declared war. That algorithm need serious adjusting.  Combat graphics will disappear with some units and sometimes the combat will pause for a few seconds. (I have a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card, 32GB RAM and Intel i7 CPU so it’s not system lag.)Again, I love the franchise, but I would strongly suggest waiting until a major patch comes out and then wait for updated reviews to see if it actually fixes things that are seriously broken with the initial release.

												Ok so I did one playthrough and for the first time in all the civ I dont even have any desire to play it again... so much for one more turn... horrible horrible game this will be the death of the franchise for old fans :( - Graphic are weird not bad but kinda reminds you of a FB game- auto roads are horrible cant control the palcement does not consider the rest of your empire or where you want to head just take point A to point B makes an auto road... outside your territory half the time gets killed by stupid barbarien cause you cant control the unit... roads are place so badly your military units wont even use them most of the time when you are moving the military from east to west of the empire for example... clearly made with no though of large empires maybe they had 3-4 cities in mind when they built this crap :/- Leaders are terrible both the choices they pick and actually interacting with them I would call them bipolar but it be an insut to the people that are bipolar cause these leaders are worst -_- very very VERY bizare play through you can tell they spent 99% of their time developing the district system (which is actually neat) and just toss up the rest of the game together with zero consideration to anything that work... Honestly just doing a DLC for civ 5 with district would have been MUCH better then this final product Very unfortunate I got the deluxe edition trusting the civ franchise... wish I never bough it not as disapointing as Starship but not far... this is 2 in a row now not sure who running things over there now but its becoming increasingly obvious beyond earth and civ 5 are the last decent thing they plan on releasing :(			"

												A short review:THE GOOD - The new districts add a lot to the game, allowing you to specialise cities to certain activities (science, military, culture, industry, trade, and religion). There is also a certain amount of city planning you need to do for optimum placements and balance of districts, imporvements and wonders (you can only build one type of thing per tile). - Splitting the tech tree into two (science and culture) was a fantastic idea. Now its possible to focus on one or the other depending on the type of game you want to play and what victory condition you are going for.THE BADThe user interface is poor. Here are a couple of my bugbears: - Very little information is given, for example once you've built something the only way you can find out what bonuses it gives you is by going into the Civipedia (bloody nightmare when working out which city is best to build something in). Some other examples include no information on which cities benefit (or not) from luxury resources, trade route management does not show previous route or how many turns until it ends. - Map scrolling is bugged. If edge srolling is enabled it scrolls the map when you attempt to click on UI buttons (this can be fixed by manually editing the ini files but have to redo it whenever the game updates). No option to bind keys (e.g. can't use WASD). THE UGLYThe AI is just terrible, giving zero challenge to the game. Computer players declare war and attack with a few low tech units even though they have higher tech and I have high tech units. AI is actually a misnomer because there is no hint of intelligence there at all. Quite often it decalres war and doesn't send anything to attack . Worse, civs will decalre war, you wipe out their army, then 20 turns later they do the same even knowing that you have a much better army and beat them last time they went to war.  All the higher difficulties seem to do is add more starting units, so if you are unlucky you will be attacked in the first few turns by a huge army you can't possibly defeat. If this doesn't happen, then once you build your army up you can simply smash your opponents with ease. Once you are about a quarter way into the game you pretty much know if you are going to win or not.CONCLUSIONWhilst there are some great new features, the appauling AI ruins this game. Firaxis really needs to fix the AI and improve the UI if they want to make Civ 6 a game worthy of its name.			"

												So my first review,As someone who grew up with Civ 1 i'd love to be telling you how this is an improvement more fun and better, but it quite simply isnt. It looks nicer, i'll grant them that.An intricate part of Civ is how you interact with other civilizations, now to be able to that you would have to have a diplomacy system that makes sense, which it doesnt.To give you an example; the mere trading of a luxury resource for another with another civ is nigh impossible.You set it up in the deal screen, they disagree, you ask them what would make it work? Well how about half or all your money you make for 30 turns some cash on the side and the thing you want to trade for my one thing.This happens to declared friendship civ's, civ's that denounced me civ's ive never done anything too. They cannot be arsed.So there's no reasonable trade, (you can get them to trade 1 luxury resource for your 2 for example but screw that im still beeing cheated.)Warmongering: the bright lights at Civ have adressed this (so they claim) So i don't like war, i like to outshine other civ's in awesomeness, sadly some civ's dont like that so they declare war with you, which is fine.However when i then stomp their armies and or towns forcing them to obliteration other civ's hate me for it.If i let them live they will just come again. So you have a choice to either kill them totally and be done with them, which results in their friends and even enemies hating you and declaring war more often than not.Or rinse and repeat the tedious process of showing a civ it's place beneath you every so many years.The ai decision making skills are just outright bad.One last thing; The absolute nonsensical idiot that made the reset to default button in the create game section, it came after one of the first big patches and the thought made me happy.The execution of it however just makes me want to shoot you in your hands.You know how it is you set up a game as russia for example with island plates and the dumbass game just keeps setting you at the map border just because there is loads of tundra an you are left with a region you can build 2 towns on at best, with crappy ground yields etc. so restart time. So i thought wow! now i can just restart the game without having to set all the parameters again which is a tedious part of the game? No,Hell no.This button was made for people who are adjusting their game setup there an then who see what they are doing yet forget what they click , thats the only purpose of that button, an idiot aid for people that do not know what they are clicking an then want to restore what they clicked a minute before. Because leave the setup screen an come back an all your parameters are back to default, which pretty much renders the button useless in the first place.You like Civ? This Civ delivers you some 60 euro eyecandy while playing just dont get your hopes up if you expect a better game, it's worse.			"

												After a while the hype of a new civilization game wears off and you realize that all these dynamic new features are just not quite as fun as the last civ... yet.. I'm not even gonna talk about the AI.Also yeah... I bought the digital deluxe and it feels like a rip off.  It was basically a way to force you to buy 4 dlc for what is turning out to be a super mild discount.  I'm gonna think twice about buying anything ""deluxe"" from fireaxis again.I can't recommend this game.  The leaders feel hyped up, but most of them are no fun to play.Also they took out my restart button so now I have to make a new game from scratch... one of the funnest parts of the game for me is to get a good starting location.  I don't care if it ruins the challenge of the game.  I just want to build the most glorious empire using all the mechanics available to me, including restarting until I get an excellent start.  Why can't people understand that it's still fun to try build the greatest empire ever.  Also it's single player, so why do they care if I restart or not.Go play Civ V or Rimworld or something until they fix this mess.			"

												After only a few hours I am quite disappointed that the look and feel harkens back to Civilization IV.For me  the Visual style somehow doesn't capture the intense visceral addiction I feel with Civilization V to continue playing late into the night. The unit animation is too smooth, almost plodding on a 4Ghz Core i7 Nvidia Gaming Laptop.The game itself is buggy, some scouts have to be prodded to auto explore. One  of the scouts I had to move them manually at time but sometime after multiple 'auto explore'/E key strokes to get them going. The other scout auto explored w/oo problem.Further its possible to leave Gov Policy slots empty before ending the turn, with no obvious way (yet) to go back during the same turn and finsh selecting policy cards(There must be a way). I am prompted at the beginning of the next turn to select those gov policies. Districts make sense, if I spend additional time playing this I look forward learning about Districts more.As to bugs this is for a Linux Laptop I hope since the this version was only reciently release they will  be soon fixed. I have logged 1300+ hours on Civ 5 and while I am still just a warlord/prince at heart at this time I don't know if there is enough joy/fun to be had in CIV 6.For me now the game is not fun or addictive, or compelling.

												Well, after 6 installments, they finally got one wrong. Some great ideas here, but the AI and some of the development ideas are just plain bad. (Like, the metal things you can make before ever researching steel). Numerous drops from Lan games for other players when City-States are turned on. Extremely long wait times between turns when City-States are allowed. If you have the Religious Victory option turned off, some cultures will continue to spam Missionaries endlessly for no reason at all. (Seriously, in a game yesterday with 3 Lan players, we counted 75 missionaries wandering inside our borders...the lag was atrocious and we kept getting random disconnects because there were so many units on the screen at one time). There are some good ideas here...the City Districts ideas are excellent as well as some of the Government and Policy ""Card"" setups, but sadly, the majority of the game is just really, really bad.I really wanted to like this, as I've loved the other Civs all the way back to the first, but this one I just can't, in good conscience, recommend. I would not recommend this to any friends and I would not recommend buying this when there's a sale. At least not in the state it's in as of the date of this review.			"

												Well after 16 hours gameplay and not winning a SINGLE game (what the ♥♥♥♥ man), it's review time.Civ 6 graphically is a huge step up from Civ 5. It's cartoony style doesn't take away from the game and actually make it a bit more light hearted and fun, which I know is a complaint from most people because it changes the ""tone"" of the game. It's a game people, we don't really want to take over the world, do we? I'm loving the new fog of war effect that makes any area of the map that isnt yours look like an old school map. I did find some glitches with that in which I had destroyed barbarian camps and they would still show illustrated on fog of war map.The map changes are a welcome change, with any city improvements (now classed under districts) and wonders taking up hex tile in your cities borders. It actually feels like your city is growing with every turn. Adjacency bonuses also add a challenge to your city building game. Another change to the city improvements is Builders. In Civ 5 your Workers would improve surrounding tiles and would do so automated if that was one thing you didnt want to bother with. Civ 6 has thrown the Worker out and the Builder in. These units have a restricted numbers of improvements and wont automate either so you need to think pretty hard about the improvements that will benefit your game.Another major change is the Tech tree, which is one of the first complaints I saw about the game. One mouth breathing Steam reviewer wrote ""TEHRE'S LESS TECHNOLOGIES, DIS IS♥♥♥♥♥♥@""True, there is less. However there are two tree's to play with. Your Tech tree and your Civics tree. Civics take pretty much any improvement that isnt a technology (ie. social policies, government style etc) and lets you research those separately. Both trees are bolstered by the new Eureka! system. Every technology and civic upgrade now comes with a single objective quest that, upon completion, will spark a Eureka! moment that halves the research time. Sailing is researched in less time once you’ve discovered the ocean, for example. It's a nice new element to the game that doesnt feel tedious.Diplomacy has also been changed as well, AI leaders now have identifiable Agenda's which become really apparent because the leaders like to tell you all the time that they don't like that you are different from them (see attached photo's.). I think the biggest downfall of the game is AI gameplay, which I know is an easy patch fix that hopefully comes along soon. Some leaders are either overly aggressive or non existent. I have yet to play a game with Gandhi yet so that could add another element.Still though, I am yet to win a match (to be fair, i've only played one all the way through, i've started a few just to try a few different strategies).I did find barbarians quite overly unbearable in the first game or so, I actually turned them off in my current game so I could actually enjoy the progression. I also find it a bit weird that barbarians would still be invading in the 1900's..Another great feature is the ability to build armies instead of single units, which i'm pretty sure comes from a tech advancement.All in all it's a great improvement on Civ 5, with some awesome new features and retaining some of the better features. I'll probably get a lot more hours out of this and I say bring on any DLC, I'll be throwing my money at it.			"

												After being out for 3 months, I picked the game up hoping the negative reviews would have been fixed with patching. This is not the case. The AI in this version of CIV is so buggy it makes the game unplayable in any way besides all out war. The game also freezes every time I try to close it to the point of needing to end the process in task manager. The UI is unintuitive and has various other bugs scattered throughout. Overall, this game is not polished or even completed to my expectations of Civ a game. I am requesting a refund and will return to Civ 4, which at least works.			"

												 Honestly, at this point playing Civ VI makes me relize how much I love Civ V even more. So far Civ VI, while taking a few steps forward by introducing some interesting new features, they then take massive leaps backwards as in a sickly new art style, new district system + housing cap system; of which I shall explain more later, and a brainless AI. I've played a few hours of Civ VI with my friends, I so far have uninstalled the game in order to make space for Civ V again. The biggest problem I have is a problem that has been hardwired into the game, and it is the new way cities are handled, some people like it... In fact I see many people advocating for it as a decent change. However in my mind this defeats a core element of Civ, and this is playing a ""tall"" game. Playing tall is focusing on a small and highly developed nation that contains only around 3-4 cities that have massive populations. Now, with the district system each individual tile can either be developed into into a upgraded tile by a worker unit or be totally eaten by a highly specialized city district (Yeah, my cities require kilometers of land just to build a university). This means, it is imposible to play tall now, the game has become an obsurd land-grab between you, as a player, and the AI.  Frankly I feel as this new mechanic hasn't been throughly hashed out. Perhaps a better way of doing cities was to simulate metropolitan growth as the city's population rises, as in the city naturally expands to a handful of nearby tiles instead of one specific district taking up most of my land near me. In the game's current state I advise against a purchase; perhaps in the future we may see expansions like Civ V's which add new core features, and perhaps these core features would alleviate the outstanding issues this game has. Only time will tell.			"

												I am a big fan of Civilization V where the different civilizations and winning options are more balanced. In this game: The barbarians and some of the civilizations makes it impossible to win other victories than domination in this game. You spend so many turns in every city building only militairy units defending yourself that nothing else gets built. If you do get the chance to build anything else you first have to build districts that takes sooooo many turns to build. Sounds fun on paper to have districts but you also have to sacrifice one square to build them and don´t expect to be able to build them all because of game restrictions and lack of city area. I feel the same about building wonders (which are not very useful at all). If you do get ahead in some of the other areas then get prepared to get attacked by rediculously many units by the AI. Then you also have to keep spending turns on building builders to repair everything. And be prepared to have to build lots of them becase they only last for 3 uses (or playing as China, 4 turns) Then fun of the game being diverse is gone.I think the game have some really good ideas in form of the eurekas, a tech tree and a civics tree, special people but the game is not fun to play unless you only go for domination victory every game you play due to the imbalances.

												I love this game.  I have been playin the Civs series since the 2nd one and for this one I don't know why so many complain.  Guess they are new our don't know the format though I get most of it.  Yes, the AI is always dumb and not realistic.  Yet adding all the wonders and making it really difficult to conquor a city I like.  I am a perfectionist and this one of the series makes me want to replay it and like all of them learn how to win.  Borders mean so much in this installment.  The DLC's, I would like it if they just let you buy all in one the extra civs leaders instead of all the scenerio stuff that I personally do not like to play.  But I bought a new laptop just for this game, though I have enjoyed others, Civ has always been my favorite and I am not looking through rose colored glasses.  When you have played a series for almost half of your life you get it.			"

												I would love this game however there are just a few things that make this almost unplayable.first is how long it takes to move units late game. In between selecting units the game will go HEY SEE THIS MISSIONARY OVER HERE THAT YOU FORGOT ABOUT? STARE AT IT AND GIVE IT AN ORDER FORGET ABOUT THE UNIT YOU WANTED TO SELECT!!!! which makes 1 turn on a large map take maybe 15 mins, inbetween the game correcting which unit you want to select, and also the having to reassign every spy every 4 turns when you just want it to counterspy for all eternity turns this game into a clickfest and makes the game more of a chore than an actual game. also the fact that missionaries block military units path is incredibly frustrating because 1 civ most of the time ghandi will spam missionaries in your territory or on the middle of the battlefield and wreck any of your plans on having a fun game plus the lack of mod support on a game that should be a mod heaven really speaks as to how little the devs care.     The other issue with this game is the difficulty. When I first started I played on prince and found my self attacked by 3 of my allies on the same turn. Me being stupid, thinking the devs built a half brained ai, had no military and died. The next game I played on settler and the same thing happened this would maybe be ok on diety but SETTLER???? I just wanted to have a fun game and not wonder how I was so naive that maybe for once a game with a working ai was realeased.			"

												There has been plenty of feedback regarding the overall gameplay and the completely unacceptable not-existing quality of the AI. I am shocked that the game was released with flaws of this magnitude and I cannot find words for my disappointment after having spent 80 EUR on the ""Deluxe"" edition! However, I will not write yet another detailed review of these aspects. In stead, in the vague hope that all the IMPORTANT feedback provided here by so many dedicated Civ-fans will be picked up by Firaxis and other developers with the task of getting the game beyond these humiliating defects with a XX-gb patch (sarcasm detected), I will state a couple of more practical improvement-ideas:1. Should be more options when creating a game including number of city states, several more map types, choice regarding terrain e.g. the world full of forest or rainforest.2. Should leave the last entered choices in the ""create game"" menu, so you dont have to put all the same choices in again if you start over.3. Reinstate the ""restart game"" button in the in-game menu during turn 1 in a new game.4. Currently not able to liberate city states after having taken them over at part of a negotiation (thus not having conquered them as such).5. There should be some recognition from a city state if you liberate them!6. Add the details of religious pressure to each city.7. There should  be some kind of ""second prize"" when failing to complete a wonder first - the materials etc. you spent time on would not just disappear as is the case for now where you receive neither a production boost towards what you choose next nor gold etc.8. Add the option of your units being on alert.9. Stop centering on the city each time you click the red dot on the city when wanting to use defenses against intruders.10. And finally, regardless of my earlier promise not to, I will have to say FIX THE AI AT ONCE!!!!I will come back to CivVI after the major overhaul that hopefully awaits before Christmas - otherwise a lot of fans getting it as a gift will initiate rebellion!

												The basic game is well designed, but it is still far to buggy to play without beeing fustrated. And I am not just talking about the crashes which some users have. But basic things such as: Num keys don't work to move units.  (You have to use the mouse to move units).There is no sentry(Wait until you see an enemy) function.If a unit is set on an auto path to a target, and an enemy unit block the path, the system will just calculate an other path and take it, sometimes sending the unit the other way around some mountions.It's really difficult to stop/cancel a units auto move.When you lose, the game just tell you that you lost. But not why you lost. Just ""Sorry, you lost"".The diplomatic system don't work. You can have positive relations with an other civ for 50 turns. And then they suddently attack you for no reason. Sometimes civilizations far away which you don't share border with, just declare war. Since you are so far away, they newer send any units, and after about 30 they just ask for peace without you ever seeing any of their units.The highlight content under the mouse pointer don't work. If you move the screen content without moving the mouse pointer(Such as using the scrollwheel in a menu, or moving the map with the cursor keys). the selected content under the mouse don't update. So even if the mouse pointer hover over new content, the old content is still selected. This causes quite some missed move(Especially since you have to use the mouse to move units).There is no sdk. So currently no mod support.And the spy system. DOh the spy system. Very interesting but you have to give all your spies the exactly same order every 3 turns. There is no ""Just keep doing anti spy service, until I tell you otherwise function).Guess it will be better in the future, but for now it seems like they released the game without testing it. "

												Very good, very different then civ 5, way more things to consider. BUT it mutes all other programs,  (at least for me it did) very weird that it would do that, but it did. Other than that the game is very optimized and not very much lag in high combat zones. The ability to change your government provides way more opportunities for strategy and big decisions.Good game. Buy itVERY VERY VERY GOOD MULTIPLAYER			"

												Unlike most of the games I get hyped for, this game completley met my expectations and much more. The developers really  expanding the basics of the game like city building and structure and government structure, while only tweaking the parts of the game that were 'good' or 'okay'. Not only does it add many new things to the series, but Civilization VI is full of little things that will make you smile (Things like the music). Honestly makes Civilization V look like an unfinished, basic game. There are really no major cons of the game. If you like empire building and managing games and/or do not have the attention span to read any more reviews, empty your wallet on this beauty.			"

												I have played Civilization since the 90's and loved every version, this version has some great ideas.You can research two items at once. You can fight religious conversion without going to war. However the interface is horrible as in, Often difficult to get a unit to move where you want, or be able to fire on another unit, it let's you try and try then suddenly will move your artillary to a location near the target so it will be killed on the next turn. I have to play in windows mode or my mouse pointer isn't visible, this puts the standard close game X on the upper right corner just above where they often put their close dialog window X I have closed the game 3 time due to this 'feature'.  The custom game settings cannot be saved so if you want anything other than the standard setup you have to go through and pick each of your setting every time you start a game. Tedious and frustrating.The Options menu is vague at best, I tire of the videos shown each time an opponent talks to you but they didn't put an obvious don't show the video selection you have to reduce performance to eliminate this. (who knows if this also cuts out something I may want.)Others have covered the AI, so I won't go there, I don't know if it's any worse than Civ 5 but it certainly isn't any better. The graphics are much worse than 5 more like something from Civ 3. When moving a settler or religious person the graphics go from poor to horrible and you often can't see any details of what is on the map.Others seem confident the game will be fixed but I don't hold out the same hope, it doesn't seem to me they did any proof testing prior to the release so this version is probably just a money grab. They know it will be a best seller so they ddin't put any effort into the game. It is too bad as there was someone there who had some good ideas for improving the game but the execution is mediocre to horrible.			"

												First impressions of Civ 6 after about an hour so far... It's not bad.It's not as amazing as Civ 5 was yet, but it's for good reasons. It doesn't have all the DLC that Civ 5 has yet, and there doesn't seem to be some super OP civilization that would result in having 2 composite bow archers and 2 cities on turn 6-7 like on Civ 5.It is also a lot less newbie friendly, and sadly it's mostly do the the appearance of the map and the art-style being a bit more confusing to look at than its predecessor. Can still pick the game up and play fairly easily, but it's not as easy to do as Civ 5 was.The AI seems better though and more challenging, even on lower settings, which is good, and the music is still just as good to listen to and the game overall seems enjoyable so far, once you can actually figure it out with the new art style. It's definitely worth picking up too, as it's just going to get better as more DLC is added too.There is also more settings in general for difficulty and more starting maps than Civ 5 had at release too, and they seem to have adding some things like small villages (These are NOT city-states), though from the little experience I've had with them so far they seem to have only taken the place of ruins. Natural wonders are also still in the game too.The main menu is solid, and most of the game's interface is pretty good, though they seem to have removed the ability to click on a unit and just click on a spot to move it. Instead you have to select to move that unit in their menu on the bottom right, then move it. The previous method seems to still work for attacking, however. While this isn't necessarily bad (At least for me, as I had a habit of accidentally moving units to spots I didn't want them to go and wasting a turn or two) I feel that some people might miss the previous system.The loading screens are a bit longer, however. Instead of only reading the first few sentences of the civilization loading screens, it reads all of it, and still lasts a few seconds afterwards. While this could be cool to be able to hear all of that and not have to ignore the option to play, it will get a bit tedious after hearing them over, and over, and over. Really though, this is the only major complaint I have so far with the game, and it's a pretty small thing really since there aren't a ton of loading screens during the actual game itself.Also, the game does NOT seem to crash a lot like Civ 5 had despite having higher requirements, though I haven't played for hours at a time yet either. If they fixed this as much as it seems they did, it is a huge improvement over Civ 5 already.So far I'd give it a solid 8/10. It's an awesome game, and I will definitely be putting more time into this and can highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the grand-strategy game genre. It's only going to get better, and I can't wait to see just how much better it really gets.			"

												It gives me great sadness to thumbs down this game. Great concept released with a threadbare amount of content and yet again a shockingly fast mid game. I would wait a couple of years and grab it in the sale as patches and updates are few and far between - A real lack of resource and plans for monetising long suffering fans who just shelled out £50 for it. They seriously need to up their game.			"

												NB, just to clarify my perspective: I played a lot of Civ III, IV and V, mostly at emperor or above.Civ VI has some interesting new features (districts, cards system for governance, two ""tech trees"" that can synergize, new city state dynamics), but like with the new features of Civ V, it looks like the AI just doesn't know what to do with them. So it's the same situation as before: depending on difficulty, you might be a bit challenged at the start because of the AI bonuses, but once you settle in and decide on a path to victory, it's basically coloring by numbers while the AI is mainly an annoyance in the form of unit spam and random declarations of war.So, if you're a player who just wants to roleplay their puppet empire and tends to go for the lower difficulties because you're not bothered by steamrolling the AI after the ancient era, Civ VI might still offer you tons of entertainment. If you're like me, and were (foolishly) hoping for an overhauled and somewhat interesting and competent AI, you should probably avoid this title.Maybe patches will address some of the glaring issues, but I'm beginning to think that decent AI is either technically impossible, or just not high enough on the priority list of Firaxis/2K Games to ever get the serious attention it needs.[EDIT] played a bit with the fall patch, but it hardly did anything to ameliorate the issues with this game:* Balance is nowhere to be found (most of the policy cards are useless compared to a few indispensable ones, some resources are completely overpowered compared to other ones, same with natural wonders and city state bonuses: some spawns might as well come with a win button)* AI is still dumb as a brick, and will still declare wars that feel completely disconnected from what you are doing* Easy quality of life fixes (restart button, saving game settings, being able to tell your most recent production, etc.) are still not in* Official modding support still isn't in, no idea when it'll come* Late game still a slog with units filling the map and blocking each other, pop up dialogs all the time (by turn 100 I completely lose interest in what they say), AI shuffling units around for no reason at all* Only two games I ever lost to AI were due to spawning next door to Sumeria with it's completely broken unique unit. Maybe I could have avoided defeat by spamming military from turn one, but then I wouldn't have been able to explore, expand, work on infrastructure, or any of the other core 4X stuff.I'm a 100 hours in, most of them were spent looking for things to like, and unfortunately I just didn't find enough to inspire me to play more. Too bad, since Civ V did manage to keep me hooked despite its flaws.			"

Posted: November 22, 2016
												4.5/10I'm udpating my review because the game is several patches in now, but unfortunately I can't change the score or my recommendation against buying the game.  This is a shame because I still feel it has a lot of potential, but the patches released so far haven't done anything to address the fundamental problems with it.  At best, Civ VI is still only tolerable to play for a brief period of time.  Instead of ""just one more turn before I quit,"" it's ""can I force myself to take one more turn before I quit.""  A game shouldn't be an experience you tolerate.  A root canal is an experience you have to tolerate.  Games are supposed to be fun, and VI just isn't.  I still can't recommend anyone spend their money on this.The fundamental problem remains that the lead designer, Ed Beach, didn't want to make a Civ game.  What do I mean by that?  The prior games in the franchise were randomized 4X sandbox games that emphasized empire building and management.  Warfare was always a major aspect, but Ed Beach apparently wanted to make a straight up war game instead. So what he did was rig the game.  Pretty much every aspect of it - from diplomacy to map seeding - is artificially weighted to make sure that AI always has a reason to hate the human player and constantly declares war.  The end result of Ed Beach's ham fisted scripting makes every time you play feel exactly the same.  Oh, the map and what civilzations you're playing against may change, but that's pretty much it.  It's ALWAYS going to play out the same.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  TIME.  By rigging the game so that the hostile AI will always declare war on you, he's turned Civ into the war game he wanted to make.  You'll find youself forced to repeat the same military focused strategies every time you play.  Each playthrough of prior Civ games was a different experience, and replayability has always been one of it's major selling points.  Without that, the base game isn't worthy anywhere near it's heafty price tag. Pros:  District System =  I like unstacking the cities and the accompanying adjacency bonuses.  It adds a whole new layer of strategic planning to the game.  On an aesthetic level, it also gives cities a grander scale and makes them feel more like actual cities.City-States = City-states have been revamped, and have their own new diplomatic system involving assigning them envoys.  As more envoys are assigned, new levels of perks are unlocked (bonuses to the capital, bonuses to districts, etc.).  These bonuses are pretty generic among the different types of city-states until you reach the top level and become their suzerin (overlord).  Each city state now has it's own unique top level bonus at that level that range from Lisbon giving extra gold on trade routes to a special tile improvement from La Venta, giving each a unique value.  New Government System = The new government system was one of the things I was most put off by when they previewed it, but it's rapidly become one of my favorite new features allowing for greater customization and specific focus on the player's goals.Cons:Map Generation:  Smaller map sizes are now larger, but larger map sizes are now smaller.  It makes sense on the smaller maps since cities play wide instead of tall now, but larger maps are now too small.  My biggest complaint, though, is is now a default to ensure another civ will spawn no more than X number of tiles from the player.  This is set up to force early game conflict with an AI that is much more aggressive than in prior versions of the game.  I don't like this at all.  I - like I imagine most long time players - play for a random experience, not to be forced to follow some script the dev thinks I should.  Because of this, you'll end up restarting over and over again until you get a map where you're not completely surrounded since the map generator jams city-state and civ starting locations so close together it feels like it's trying to play Tetris with them.Removal of Basic Features and Player Control:  I squarely blame Ed Beach for this.  He's on record in the preview videos hyping up the removal of certain features so it's a more ""dynamic"" experience and players have to ""pay more attention.""  When the game released, the hostile unit alert was removed and has now been patched back in after complaints form the community, one of Ed Beach's innovations to make the player ""pay more attention."" At least now if a barbarian horde or enemy army shows up next to one of your fortified units, the game actually tells you.  It's one of the few ""positive"" updates, diminished by the fact it should have been included in the game at launch.  Barbarians now can't tap dance past your warrior waving spartklers without them noticing.  I still can't figured what possessed him or anyone else on the design team to think this was ""dynamic"" instead of just being obnoxious.  It's particularly annoying since the game decides it knows what you need to be looking at and constantly jerks the camera around.City growth is another major issue.  After the first patch, we can finally see which tile is going to be claimed next, but the player has no control over it.  All you can do is sit there and curse under your breath when you see it's going to claim a useless tile instead of a resource it could claim.  There seems to be no rhym or reason to the tiles it chooses.  I've seen it bypass four resource tiles - silk, horses, copper and iron - to claim an ocean tile with no resources anywhere near it.  In a game about building and developing an empire, the player should have the option to manually control this.  Making it random doesn't add depth, it's just handicapping the player under the false pretense of adding ""challenge"".  This still hasn't been fixed.   Barbarians: The new barbarian system is still buggy, they spawn far too early and too often.  I've had three barbarian camps spawn around my capital, and been under seige by two of them by turn 7 on Prince.  I've also watched camps spawn on the same tiles outside my borders over and over again after I've cleared them unless I postition a unit so it's in line of sight.  If the camps keep spawing in the same locations over and over again, it's not random.  It's another feature for some reason they felt needed to be scripted.  Religion:  In prior versions of the game, this was left to expansions and I wish it had been here.  I can understand from a design perspective that it made sense to build it into the base game.  With the new district system, there is now a religious districts and it makes sense to get all your districts - part of the basic mechanics - into the base game.  That said, religion is broken and over-weighted.  The new religious combat system is tedious and depending on what AI opponents you're facing you'll spend more time in religious combat than military combat.  We also now have a Religious Victory.  Quite frankly, this should be cut from the game.  I'm fairly certain they only reason it's included was to justify all the work spent on religion when Diplomatic victory was left out of the game and so many other areas were crying out for more work.   The religious victory mechanics now make it possible for you to loose to an AI player you haven't even met yet.  The ability to achieve religious victory depends far to heavily on starting location and who is closest to the majority of civs.  It feels clumsy and poorly implemented.			"

												As of now, the game can't really be recomended. I'll still play because it's the only game series me and my boyfriend both enjoy, but the poor execution is slowly taking away all the love for the series and the new ideas.First, the good: I like what they did with culture, which became a second ""tech"" tree similar to science. I also enjoy the animations, from Wonder building to units attacking (at first this was strange, really cartoony, but I actually find it funny now). The music is FANTASTIC, best in the series. On higher difficulties, the AI is pretty solid into exploring its strength, advancing in science, culture and religion faster than me. The barbarians pose a real threat this time.Now, the bad: apart from advancing down the tech trees, AI is atrocious. They'll spawn endless religious units for no reason, their military units are often ages behind current tech, and they simply won't attack anyone unless they can win in a single turn, so after more than 200 hours playing they've attacked ONE of my cities, before I could build walls. They'll be like those horseriders around Daenerys last season in GoT: all scream and shout, not a single strike. Neither the game nor Civilopedia provide all info you need, failing to explain things like what bonuses a wonder provides after you (or someone else) built it, or what bonuses a district is gaining (which is critical to decide which policies you'll be using), or what is generating the amenities in your cities. The new walls system makes all wars basically attrition unless you specifically build cannons. Support units are useless. Ships are almost useless since they no longer easily sink embarked units and do almost no damage to city walls unless you got the last promotion in ranged boats. They could implement some of the ideas from CIV:BE, like waterbased cities or districts, but they chose not to, and seas are blue deserts again. Some Civs seem to always lose no matter what. The UN is gone. Everyone hates everyone all the time. If someone declares war on you and you kill some units, you're a warmongering threat. You'll probably be a warmongering threat no matter what. Even if you're not, you'll be denounced by everyone, probably because you're not killing anyone. Diplomacy is broken anyway, so a Civ can propose completely moronic deals to you, emptying their vaults over luxury resources, which makes you the richest guy on Earth for the next 30 rounds.			"

												I tried  couple of rounds, and the features are great. I have played IV, V and now VI, but the last one is broken.The main issue is the AI, in it current state it does not work in single player. I just won't take cities or defend it in the most basic form. I don't belief that they have done anything with playtest reports or did any thing with the AI issues in V. It is probalby the same with same extra because of the new features.Keep in mind that this cost almost 60 euro's! that is not for an early acces game, but should for a complete game. Patches are for minor bugs or gameplay issues. DLS to add new features. It is like buying a new car and find out that the steering wheel will come next year!!If you play multiplayer, buy the game, for single players, don't buy this!It is problay to late, but i asked a refund hoping the developer will understand this.Btw this review says it all:https://mic.com/articles/157541/civ-6-review-here-s-what-s-great-and-wildly-disappointing-about-civilization-vi#.pzCTwAnFQ "

												So far this game is a terrible disappointment.  5 months on from release, the AI issues still aren't resolved.  I bought the Digital Deluxe edition, paying $20 more, for access to the first four DLC packs at a supposedly better price than buying them individually.  So far the 3 I've been given are selling on Steam for $4.99 each, so unless the next pack is expansion-level content with a pricetag of at least $14.99 I'm going to feel even more ripped off than I already do.  Save yourself a whole lot of disappointment and just buy the Civ V complete package instead.  It's an infinitely better game.Edited 4/1:  the fourth piece of included DLC came out on 3/28.  It's 2 more Civs and one more scenario, retail price 8.99.  I saved 4 dollars by buying the deluxe, and after 6 months this game is no closer to being playable than it was at launch.  Two bad games in a row for the franchise (Beyond Earth, even with Rising Tide, is no good).  Hopefully they fix this but I don't know that I'm willing to spend money on the expansion content that it'll take to do that.			"

												So Ive been playing this game for a while, 55 hours as of writing this, and im really having issues with what to do, thumbs up or down...In the end though, i will not recommend this game, although it has various good points.Plus:-The district system is very nice, forces you to consider placement of future districts and wonder while balancing the recourses nearby.-Wonders requiring a tile is smart, gives you more of a penalty if you dont finish while also taking a tile from your city if you do.-The civics tree is interesting, culture in general feels much more immersive and competative than before.-The earning of great people allows for you to play in alot of different ways and screw over your opponents by taking something that they could use.-Combat units are balanced.-The addition of projects let you produce something of worth when no buildings are available instead of just units, gold or science.Minus:-Religious victory is completely overpowered, especially in pve games. its too easy to take over another Civ with religion, especially if that Civ isnt specifically aiming for that victory.-There arent enough great works slots. especially for the Writers, there is 1 spot in an aphitheater for each city, other than that, you need wonders, which makes writers useless, especially considering they produce 2-3 pieces each.-Leader and civilization powers are weirdly specific and sometimes useless. The powers need you to have or do some very specific things that are sometimes very bad. for example, Russias leader Peter has the ability to receive ekstra science and culture from traderoutes with Civ that are more advanced than them. This means that to make greatest use of this leader, 2 victory conditions have been eliminated. -Amenities, Housing and Population. on paper it seems smart but in reality, housing and amenities stop the player from settling alot of places early in the game simply because they wont result in anything, and when playing against high level AI, early settling is key. its also not well explained what ""entertainment"" is in the game, as the ""entertainment complex"" district says it gives amenities from different sources of ""entertainment"".-Not alot of map options so far, it was okay in civ 5 after all the expansions but to have this little option and with very few ways of controlling how the map will form? not good.-No way to play co-op. Civ 5 had a broken way of playing co-op but at least you could still do it, here, you have no actual way of playing any real co-op, which really makes it uninteresting to do.And lastly, the big issue that everyone is annoyed with:-AI. So many new things in Civ 6 were based on giving AI an overhaul and give them personality and agenda. which they did. they just all have the same, almost immidiately denounce, go to war for petty reasons, rinse repeat. There are so many more issues with AI but this review is long enough.			"

												I am not saying this to be arrogant, so save the flames on your flame throwers.  I am saying this to demonstrate how much I care about the Civilization franchise and how much of my own personal time I have invested in playing their games.  I am also saying this because it lets you know how much thought I have put into each game, and that when I give a review about the game I am not just talking out my a*s and it come from a place of knowing a great deal about the series.I consider myself an expert at Civilization.  I have beaten every Civ game on normal and huge maps on the deity level and my top scores rank in the top 10% in the United States.  Here then is my “expert” review of Civilization VI.I consider Civilization VI to be the worst Civilization ever.  I had such high hopes too.  After Civ 5 made the worst mistake in Civ history by allowing only one military unit per hex, resulting in comical scenarios where you would build a new improved unit but could not even get it out of your city because there were so many of your other units on tiles, I thought that Civ 6 would have to learn something.  I mean the people who design this game aren’t total idiots.  Are they?It seems that in some sense that sadly they might be.  Let us start by the fact that they unleash the game upon the public with game breaking bugs.  These bugs are as follows:  0. Many people could not even get the game to play.  I had a lot of trouble.  I bought the game from a store.  After I installed in, it would say ready to play, but was trying to download 25% of the entire game’s size in GB from Steam.  However, the download was not downloading anything, even after hours. Finally, it started downloading after restarting Steam 20 times and I could play it.  I had hoped that that would be the worst bug found.  I was wrong.1. Every other turn, long after it had already been built, 3 different Civs would build the world wonder the Oracle. 2. City-States don’t update their military and are surrounded by warriors in the Atomic Age, as do many of the other Civs. 3. The sound will randomly cut out, and only play the sound effects for certain things until you reload.4. Aircraft carriers cannot carry air units.  If you send an air unit to an aircraft carrier it disappears forever and the air craft carrier says it has no units in it.5. My diplomacy screen lists two artifacts which I do not possess and have never acquired.6. After the Modern Age, when I researched a tech or civ that should give me one envoy, I would get three.7.  Luxuries and strategic resources which other civs give you through trade do not show up on any screen nor do they seem to effect the number of amenities that I have.8. And the game-breaker, war weariness.  Out of 380 turns, I declared a holy war with only a moderate warmongering penalty, and spent only 5 turns fighting them before I wiped them out.  Even though I had every single luxury the game has, including special ones like perfume, and all my cities at that point had entertainment complexes with all buildings, my entire nation is in revolt after just 5 tums.  What is worse is that after being at peace with everyone and all city-states, the war weariness never decreased, ever, making my game unplayable with every city in revolt.  That is a severe bug and breaks the game at deity level.Gameplay Review:  While Civ 6 tried to bring a few good things back from earlier Civilization games which for some reason were discontinued, they broke so many other tried and true aspects of Civilization that the ended up making the game worse, and the worst yet.  Some of these changes for the worse are as follows.1.  There is no longer a central diplomacy screen.  Previous Civ games have had a central diplomacy screen where you could see all Civs relationships to each other and to you.  You can also see all deals that you have with other Civs, when they started and when they ended or end.  I think it was Civ 5 that had a great screen where you had the portraits of every Civ and lines going between them to indicate their relationship with each other.  For some insane reason, Civ 6 decided to chuck this out, in favor of nothing.  Now to see the relationship of Civs with other Civs you have to click on each diplomacy screen individually and read the tiny print about their relationships with other civs.  And even though there is a screen which tells about your gold deals with other civs, I do not see any other screen which tells you about you other deals, friendship, alliance, resource trading or anything with other Civs.  It is just guesswork and is crazy.2.  Building districts and wonders take up precious tiles that could be worked by citizens.  This is a terrible step in the wrong direction for Civ and adds nothing that is really cool.  Already there were too few workable tiles around your cities in Civ for them to really grow to juggernauts of cities, and now if you want to have buildings and wonders you have to sacrifice about half of them. Are you kidding me?  Cities are less productive than ever using up all their tiles for districts which give less yield when citizens work them than a typical improved tile. Districts are not a terrible idea in and of themselves, but make a separate overlay for districts if you are going to have them so they do not take up a worker tile. Also, the buildings should have to be built first, before the district.  Districts should be something you should be able to build if you build first two or three buildings in the district’s theme, and should enhance the output of those buildings.  For instance, if you build two economic buildings, then you can build an economic district that enhances the output of these buildings.  When ancient peoples dwelling in mud huts set up a market, they didn’t say first, oh, we have to build a specialty place for this market.  No, the market was build, usually around a crossroads, maybe some other economic dwellings, and then it naturally evolved into a market district.3. District building take an absurdly long time to build in the early game.  So much so that in a deity game, I was almost in the Middle Ages before I built my first market.  That is absurd.  Ancient peoples were building markets almost day one.  If they are going to do it this dumb way, then at least allow the first economic, etc. building to be built before the district, and the district required to build the more complex ones.4. They completely messed up builders.  Having builders only have a few uses before expiring and taking so long to build is absurd.  Having them build what they are building instantly is absurd too.  The way Civ did builders in the past was fine and good.  There was nothing broke there, and if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it because there are plenty of things that are broke.  But Civ 6 took the attitude that if it ain’t broke yet, we will break it.  A builder who does not expire and takes a while to build things, and gets upgrades to the time it takes to build things with tech, is a good system that makes sense in a real life context.  To make builders expire, build things instantly, and cost an arm and a leg is just annoying and foolish.  Plus they cannot build roads, which is the next point of contention.5.  Roads.  Civ 6 completely messes up roads.  Roads have always been very important to Civ, because on higher levels of difficulty, Civ is a race.  Civ 6 ruins them, another thing that wasn’t broken.  Traders are the only ones to build roads until military engineers who can only build two before expiring?  Are you kidding me?  This is annoying beyond belief.  I like having control over my roads system and being able to build them where I want them.  I also like the late game roads where your units move long distances, which again matches real life, and you having to have researched technology to get better roads.  Continued...			"

												I have played CiV for 366 hours. While I loved the game, especially the expansions, it was getting a bit stale. To remedy that and to make games more diverse Civ VI introduced the new district system among other things. This is the backround and the expectations I had when I jumped into the game.I only have 7 hours clocked now and my impressions are mixed. I immediately created a game, skipped the ""useless"" tutorial assuming I'll get the hang of things and started playing with China. On one hand it's the familiar Civ we all know and love but on the other hand things work really weird. I played maybe 40-50 turns and decided to play the tutorial afterall, everything felt so confusing. The tutorial started from way too basics so I got bored and decided to try to learn again by playing.I managed to get my new game with China again to Medieval Era, maybe around 150 turns. And from that game my feeling was quite meh. The beginning of the game is always great: the sense of exploring, building your city, planning the first steps. While on Civ VI there is something to do all the time, if not building and researching, it's hunting for heureka! moments. But still I just kept on clicking next turn, next turn, next turn... I kept getting heureka moments, which by the way seem way too easy to get: almost any civ, anywhere, can get them. I kept getting new policies, new techs but nothing felt great or groundbreaking (perhaps I've played too much CiV?) Political Philosophy civic was the first thing that made me stop for a while and it felt great to ""choose your path"".The new district system really takes time to get used to and probably many trials and errors before getting the hang on things. You really need to plan way, WAY, ahead when building a city. So it seems there is a lot of promise but I'm not sure is it yet enough to justify a full priced game when you can get CiV with all DLC's with a fraction of the cost. If you really like civ games and want something ""new"" I suppose I could cautiously recommend this game. Just be mentally prepared to unlearn what you know and to learn new startegies.EDIT: Playing with Gorgo around 150 I realized why I feel so ""meh"": The passivity of the AI! The other civs feel like city-states. None of them interact or engage me in any way. I've played on both prince and king and didn't see much difference. Also the barbarians seem to just mindlessly wonder around my city, not attacking anything.I've learned more about the districts and your cities will get crowded really quick if you try to build everything. I still recommend Civ VI, I'm starting to see the potential but the AI is really lacking. I guess I need to try on harder (cheating) difficulty to see if there is more interaction.			"

												I can't completely say it's a crap game, but it definately is in what it seems to be an ""early stage"" of it's official release.....I bought the deluxe edition because of the comments honestly. Knowing that down the road there will be DLCS most likely, if it's any sid meier's, there will be DLCS....I'll say it again. Unfortunately I can agree that I had more fun with Sid V than I did with this...and for a few reasons. I'm not as in-depth about the problems I notice in the game, like someone mentioned how ""roads are useless and workers can't build them and the only way to build them is to waste a trade route"" yea...I did notice that, and it is a little upsetting because if you're trying to match reality and give the player freedom to make his own decisions...let him build a ♥♥♥♥ing road himself. (just saying) if he builds it through the rainforest of nothingness and nothing gets accomplished with that road as far as military advancements or whatever, then that's their ""loss"" in my opinion. I am also saddened that there are very few options for ""starting a game"" I find myself resetting constantly because I feel the game just doesn't ""cling on to me"" or the person I picked doesn't really have much to offer. I liked the simplicity of Sid V as far as the ""benefits of a leader"" and I think districts are pretty stupid (not going to give a reason, just don't like them)  I also feel like the ""luxury resources and bonus resources"" are pretty useless....again, not giving a reason, just my opinion. I also noticed that workers....when you make a farm or give them something to do, I don't know what happens but they ♥♥♥♥in disappear and that just pisses me off that they poof after It took like 10 turns to produce a worker and he disappears after making 1 farm...I've had it happen to me before, I 've had it happen randomly it seems, idk if it's a bug or they go into like a ""production mode"" and just...""work the tile"" but in my opinion that is very ....very.....very....stupid and annoying.  Makes me produce another worker and another, and another, really I find myself not having workers most the game because they ♥♥♥♥in fall off the earth or seep into a tile or whatever...idk, I definately fine the older version better, and am not entirely upset about wasting $80 at the same time...it is an improvement but god ♥♥♥♥ing DAMN they seemed like they were experimenting with TOO MUCH and have Tom,♥♥♥♥♥♥and Ernie's desk projects implemented in their game when maybe not a lot of people like♥♥♥♥♥♥s idea or Ernie is a little bit on the dumb side and just likes making things broken. Idk, anyway, this is my honest opinion about the game, I know I don't have a lot of hours but i've honestly never had an $80 game seem ""boring"" in a sense....So I feel like I've been ripped in the way that I thought I was buying Civ VI, when really I'm buying something ""like Civ V"" but for dummies...seems to be less to actually ""do"" in the game.

												Was excited for this game. The sins of Beyond Earth were fogiven when they announced Civ6.When I played it, it was very clear that it was different to Civ 5. So I pushed through and in fairness the more I played it did get better. But the nagging feeling always remains that I'd still rather be playing Civ5.That's the problem. Its not (at this stage) a more interesting or enjoyable experience than last time. The Devs should be writing to people with 1000 hours (Ive got around 800) in Civ5 and asking them why. What did they love about it? What would they improve?In civ6 I feel as though I have less control and less freedom to play the way I want. And the game focuses on the things that I always found boring - like victory conditions. In all my hours I never cared about victory types and almost never finished a game. The victory types in Civ always seem so unfair and thus no clear measure of performance. So I generally ignore them, especially in Civ5 where all it does is end the game and tell you someone has won. Yawn.What was fun about Civ5 was exploring, defending, expanding, rushing to find and secure the best land and finite resources, building your empire. Once there was little cloud to explore and no land to grab before someone else, I always became quite bored with empire maintenance and building toward some uninspiring 'victory' type. I was hoping they would recognise that and withhold part of the map or make part of it usless for settlement until mid-late game. Perhaps a new technology may allow you to access or settle new areas because essentially thats the fun part.Civ5 I always found it balanced offering you tough choices without feeling like micro-managment. In Civ6 sometimes there is nothing I want my city to produce, choices of where to settle a new city are so restrictive that its not really a choice. There isnt much in the way of buildings early game so no hard decisions there. Exploring feels like a chore rather than an adventure. The art style is ugly. AI is well - insane. Plus Im not going to spend all my time reading about what makes a particular AI character happy or unhappy. AI should be intuitive if youre a good neighbour and you keep your promises and they are not an agressive AI you should have no problem. The ammount of gold you generate per turn for example, should have no baring and does really restrict the way you play if you want to keep an AI civ happy. Chosing policies is a chore and its a lot of reading with no real big picture plan. Wonders are less wonderful and the number of players who can compete for them is now even more restrictive as they bizareley wemt for 'realism', so no need to stress if you will get there first.One thing I've wanted to see for a long time is genuine unit diversity between nations or regions. Giving each civ 2 token 'unique' units that you may never even use is not exactly game changing. I wanted it to feel like there really is a difference when selecting your civ and not just a cookie cutter reskin with some minor changes or perks.Overall playing Civ6 has less of the things I enjoy. I feel less free, less in control, not as able to plan ahead, and the whole experience feels a great deal more aimless. Although there are plenty of things to work towards like completing mindless tasks for city-states for example, there are very few things on offer that I care about enough to bother working towards. I'll keep playing it because I really want to like it more. But I have a feeling Civ5 will always be the more balanced, better looking, more interesting game.Thats why im giving it a no.			"

Couchy's thoughts on Civ VI:Great base game that innovates on the classic Civilization formula in many areas.  It is genuinely fun to 'learn to civ' again for the x'th time, but bugs, features that you'd expect strangely missing, an especially helpless AI for the opponent Leaders as well as blatant exploits gradually do their part in making the whole exercise increasingly pointless.Great game.  Needs a great deal of bugs and exploits fixed.  As well as features missing from V put back into VI WITHOUT making it part of the next DLC, thank you very much.  It also needs said improvements incoming sooner rather than later, as I feel I've completely wasted the last 15-20 hours I put into the game after bugs ruined the goal of victory I had been working towards since the start.  Don't see myself picking this title up again until it is in a better condition.  Huge let down, at this price point you expect a game to be released in a much better shape than this.While the single player AI soon becomes annoying to deal with to the point you soon stop caring to even read what they say when they contact you, Civ VI in multiplayer has so far been a great experience.  We had some occational disconnects during the first days after launch, but have not experienced any multiplayer specific game stopping bugs or desyncs.Still gonna recommend the game though, its very fun despite all the flaws and shortcomings I whine about.  Going to be a  Civ game for the times if it gets the many fixes and improvements it needs.			"

												Do they even test these games anymore?! Buggy, unbalanced, shallow. I've loved Civilization sice the first generation, but one week into this new adventure and I'm already bored.The problem as I see it is that Firaxis is not learning from their own history.  Civ V vanilla came out and it was unbalanced, buggy, lacked depth... all in all, not nearly as good as Civ IV plus the expansions.  And guess what, the same thing has happened in CIV VI.  It took two expansions for Civ V to become a good game and several mods for it to become a great game.  So why didn't they learn their lesson from their own previous expansions?  Similarly, why didn't they incorporate elements from the most successful mods into their new game?  They ignore their fan base, they don't test their games, they give us half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥released... this was a money grab pure and simple.I see a lot of people saying ""wait for the expansion"" or ""don't worry, a mod will fix that"" -- shouldn't the onus be on Firaxis to release a full gaming experience?  Furthermore, why are we depending on UNPAID modders to fix the problems of an expensive triple-A game title?  For $60 I expect a fairly high-end (polished) game.  Civ V changed a lot of things from the previous version, so I can somewhat understand why it wasn't 100% on release... but Civ VI just feels like a really dull version of Civ V.  The removed a bunch of the depth that made Civ V great and only gave us a couple of game mechanics that seem like good ideas on paper but don't currently work together  to increase the levels of enjoyment in the game itself.The game play is unbalanced, the graphics are a HUGE step backwards (looks like some freemium mobile game), the AI managed to get worse, the civs are boring, diplomacy is useless, religion is annoying... and basically it feels like they've nerfed most of the things that made Civ V so great.""Wait for the expansions"" how about wait for the bargain bin because right now this game is nowhere near where Civ V left off.

												I don't write many reviews on steam but being a well seasoned Civ player I decided to do this for once.Positives: - New Styled Graphics; the cartoony goofy graphics provides a fresh new start to Civ, unlike Civ Beyond Earth, which gave new graphics but went the wrong direction. Although it will be a shock for Civ 5 players, and will take a while to adjust, it will nevertheless bring nostalgic memories to older Civ players. - Gameplay change; unlike Civ 5, this game will bring a larger focus on city building, letting you decide what you would mould your empire to become; cultural, militaristic or religious? Unlike previous installments, where the city with the biggest production produces everything, you have to more carefully decide what ""district"" you will build. Negatives:-Diplomacy; AI is still ♥♥♥♥ed, and declares war every century. Even Gandhi seem to be the most warmongering on the game from what I have seen (although this is the case for every Civ game for some reason) but I still hope this will be patched. -Borders; Just a small tweak but the borders are hard to differenciate from each other. A simple coloured line marks your territory. I played a game as China vs Japan and I could hardly tell the difference between our cities and empires. This is maybe because I am used to all territory to have a colour but I believe I will adjust to this. -Warfare: Although focus has been taking on infrastructure I can't help but notice that the quality of warfare has been dropped. Not only are enemies practically unconquerable until you get the Artillery unit but they also seem to be spamming units that provide buffer making it impossible to reach their cities. This again might be the AI's fault but I still appreciate they added new support units like Medic and Engineer. I also like the idea of combining units to form corps and armies, even though combining them does not provide double the damage which one might think.Conclusion:Overall this game provides a relief from Beyond Earth, and with some few patches on the AI this game will be a genuin success to the franchise.

												I've been playing previous Civs and this is the best Civ I've seen. Yes, at this very moment, AI does seem to have a room for an improvement, but I'm sure it will get better as patches roll out. This is definately worth the money and befits AAA title. You can leave your real life's misery behind and plunge in to your civilization until people drag your corpse out from your desk.			"

												Edit: Saw that they released an update and gave the game another chance.  TLDR - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it is still fundamentally broken. Simplest way to explain how obviously the AI still blatantly cheats - I played as China, rushed Stonehenge with a worker, no wasted turns. The AI magically produces Stonehenge with 1 turn remaining (no duplicate rulers, so no other Chinas out there). And in late game the AI STILL bumbles around like a chicken with its head cut off.Look, I know people worked very hard on this game and there are a number of positive things about Civ6, but the negative aspects far outweigh them. I don't know what went wrong, wouldn't be surprised if it was due to 2K's involvement (garbage publisher that in recent years has been prioritizing $s far more than user experience, same thing has happened with the NBA 2K games over time). I'm done with this game, can't recommend it even if you get it for free. If you want to play a great strategy game, just buy Civ4/5 (still published by 2K but before their garbage phase).-------------------------------------------So much promise, but suffers from horrible balancing, broken/cheating AI, and poor optimization.In terms of balancing, the majority of civs are critically weak vs the stronger civs. To the point where it's not even really a decision.AI blatantly cheats. Every time you invest in a major wonder, the computer will ALWAYS complete it just ahead of you to force you to waste production.  Additionaly, every time you take a risk (moving a settler 1 square without protection, moving a severely damaged unit into an unknown area, etc), a barbarian will magically appear in the perfect location to ambush you.  Strong AI is important, but barely-masked cheating is totally different.With regard to optimization, the game runs way too slowly. I'm running an i5-7600k with a 1080, 1 min long computer turns, even on a huge map, is inexcusable.  I know a lot of calculations are required, but that should still take seconds in a well-programmed game.If you want to get into Civ, go with Civ 5 (with expansions and mods). Civ 6 is nowhere near worth it, even though the mods have done an admirable job of improving the game.  I'm shocked by the nerve 2K has to sell DLC before fixing the core issues plaguing this game.

												What is with all the hate on this game!!!Look i've been playing the Civ series since civ II. I've owned every game since then, and I have to say I love Civ VI! In fact I think it has a very special place in my heart,  however I dont know if it will wrestle the throne of IV from my favourite...we'll see.But Seriously this game is the most complete Civ game at launch hands down.  Since III there has been a nasty habit of releasing a base game, and then providing two subsequent and expensive DLCS which reintroduced mechanics from its predecors titles..... Im particularily looking at you CIV V, ...gods and kings etc.On Civ V...I have to say I think it was a step back from IV and one of my least fav in the franchise (Dont even get me started on its spin off BE!)....but it introduced a lot of new concepts, such as the unstacking of units.....and the hexagon system...and I think when they made Civ VI they took all the good from that game and refined it here. There are a lot of new mechanics to that are so interesting to me as a decades old sim player, such as the unstacking of cities, new approach to builders, and I really enjoy the way government and civics work now.Like I said I dont get all the hate, and for all y'all complaing this game is too hard, perhaps reconsider your interest inthe  strategy genres? Coz they actually simplified a lot of the mechanics in V, and VI to please you dumbass lot and your still complaing. Like any really good strategy game.. "" old total war games"" ...its expected that you actually have to spend a few hours 'studying' the game to figure it out. I luv this game but honestly its a piece of pi ss so far, i'm achieveing victories way ealrier than I would have in past titles. In fact the difficulty is really my only complaint....its just too bloody easy at this point, and im playing on the higher diff levels.Anyways this was meant to be a short response to all the haters....now i've gone and went on a rant...So final point.....this is not just a good game, its an awesome game!!! and as a very long time civ veteran it gets my vote!!!(Should have mentioned the balance at the begining, but hey i'll sneak it in here. I have had none of the balancing issues with diplomacy, denouncing etc that everyone else is complainging about. Yes Civs can do dumb things at times....this is a franchise issue not a civ 6 issue. Since its release date a lot has been solved in terms of balance...but I dont know what is up with people expecting perfect balance on release....name me a tilte that i perfect on release ( Cd project red games excluded here luv your work!) and this wasnt a FPS like BF1 that benefited from large community beta testing.....yes Genres of games are still important...who knew......end rant.

												From the one game I have played till the end this is where I stand:If you enjoyed Civ V you will enjoy Civ VI no questions asked.Early game is a lot more enganing, just a quick word of warning, early game is a lot more focused on warring and conquering, in my game by about turn 40-50 my neighbour decided to come at me with about 10 chariots.I defended against these chariots with about 3 archers and 2 spearmen, quick hint, don't kill the AI's units just damage them to the point they retreat and then chase them down, the AI won't attack your city if the unit attacking will die.Mid Game is a lot more about specalising and making sure all your shiny new districts are setup. With the new culture system there is a lot more ways to play the game. As long as you are not reaching for a optimum stradgey that will win every game then there is tons of replayability in this.Late game has a lot less wars and in my game the AI wouldn't stop denouncing me, from what I saw there is 5-6 different victory conditions that can be met and the victory I went for (Science) has a animated victory screen. One thing I didn't like though when compared to Civ V is the lack of a map through history view or whatever it was called or atleast I didn't spot it.In the end it is a great game and deffiently worth playing should you be able to afford the hefty price tag.

This game just feels very clunky and slower. The Asthetics and Pace of the game just killed it for me.Again, please look at the Screenshots and Videos.Hope this helps - I'm going back to Civ:V			"

												I feel betrayed by the developer. I've seen games go down this path before and fail.Civ VI starts FAR BELOW the level of where Civ V or Civ IV left off. The gameplay has changed with the new game which is fine, but the ""removal"" of funktionality we had in Civ IV and Civ V are gone. Multiplayer is a joke, cant even get a game because it runs through ""download regions"" on steam.The AI is terrible, no matter what they always popup with the same boring messages, and get offended over things that should not even affect them. Makes no sense at all. Unfortunatly it feels like we are starting from scratch again, and it should stand on it's own, NOT BEAR THE NAME of one of the best gaming series through pc gaming history.  I fear it end here.  The developers was warned LONG before release, even when they started showing bits and pieces, but as true conartists they completely ignored the feedback on their own forums, and whent ahead completing the game to a SUP PAR standard.Only purchase on discount.  This is similar to how EA screwed the simcity franchise with that awfull cartoon builder, fireaxis is now screwing the civilization in a similar way, cartoonish and simplification that ruins the beloved game play.Now we need a new ""company + developer"" to come in a swoop up all us ""used-to-be"" loyal civ players with an alternative title, in the same way it happened with Cities: Skylines.

												I had a hard time deciding how to rate Civilization 6, on one hand I really like it. It introduces a nice level of complexity that I felt Civilization 5 was missing, and there are many conceptual improvements. The empire-wide happiness mechanic is gone, which means that settling more than 4 cities is once again a staple.At the same time, this game was released unfinished. It's clear that it will need many more months of development, maybe even years, to reach the level of polish that Civilization 5 currently has. That's a shame too, they should not have sold the game as a finished product knowing its problems, but here we are. The short of it is, if you aren't a dedicated Civilization player or a fan of the series, go pick up Civilization 5 instead. It's cheaper, has more content, and is decently balanced. This game is not. The DLC for this game is also pretty underwhelming. Adding additional Civs to play as is nice, charging $5 each is not.			"

												Feels like the people at Firaxis have never picked up the game and tried to play it. The AI doesn't even try to win but fairly often will get the religious victory by accident. The Tech tree is terribly laid out. It's remarkably easy to get AT troops through beelining Chemistry by turn 150 on standard. The AI on Deity is only about 30 turns behind that getting Chemistry and AT troops so I'm convinced no one at Firaxis ever plays it at that level. Otherwise they would have noticed the problem with the tech tree.I was willing to be forgiving but the rate of patches and communication is horrible at this point. I'm sure we'll see two more mini DLCs before we get a decent working patch and that's pretty unacceptable.			"

												4.5/10I'm udpating my review because the game is several patches in now, but unfortunately I can't change the score or my recommendation against buying the game.  This is a shame because I still feel it has a lot of potential, but the patches released so far haven't done anything to address the fundamental problems with it.  At best, Civ VI is still only tolerable to play for a brief period of time.  Instead of ""just one more turn before I quit,"" it's ""can I force myself to take one more turn before I quit.""  A game shouldn't be an experience you tolerate.  A root canal is an experience you have to tolerate.  Games are supposed to be fun, and VI just isn't.  I still can't recommend anyone spend their money on this.The fundamental problem remains that the lead designer, Ed Beach, didn't want to make a Civ game.  What do I mean by that?  The prior games in the franchise were randomized 4X sandbox games that emphasized empire building and management.  Warfare was always a major aspect, but Ed Beach apparently wanted to make a straight up war game instead. So what he did was rig the game.  Pretty much every aspect of it - from diplomacy to map seeding - is artificially weighted to make sure that AI always has a reason to hate the human player and constantly declares war.  The end result of Ed Beach's ham fisted scripting makes every time you play feel exactly the same.  Oh, the map and what civilzations you're playing against may change, but that's pretty much it.  It's ALWAYS going to play out the same.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  TIME.  By rigging the game so that the hostile AI will always declare war on you, he's turned Civ into the war game he wanted to make.  You'll find youself forced to repeat the same military focused strategies every time you play.  Each playthrough of prior Civ games was a different experience, and replayability has always been one of it's major selling points.  Without that, the base game isn't worthy anywhere near it's heafty price tag. Pros:  District System =  I like unstacking the cities and the accompanying adjacency bonuses.  It adds a whole new layer of strategic planning to the game.  On an aesthetic level, it also gives cities a grander scale and makes them feel more like actual cities.City-States = City-states have been revamped, and have their own new diplomatic system involving assigning them envoys.  As more envoys are assigned, new levels of perks are unlocked (bonuses to the capital, bonuses to districts, etc.).  These bonuses are pretty generic among the different types of city-states until you reach the top level and become their suzerin (overlord).  Each city state now has it's own unique top level bonus at that level that range from Lisbon giving extra gold on trade routes to a special tile improvement from La Venta, giving each a unique value.  New Government System = The new government system was one of the things I was most put off by when they previewed it, but it's rapidly become one of my favorite new features allowing for greater customization and specific focus on the player's goals.Cons:Map Generation:  Smaller map sizes are now larger, but larger map sizes are now smaller.  It makes sense on the smaller maps since cities play wide instead of tall now, but larger maps are now too small.  My biggest complaint, though, is is now a default to ensure another civ will spawn no more than X number of tiles from the player.  This is set up to force early game conflict with an AI that is much more aggressive than in prior versions of the game.  I don't like this at all.  I - like I imagine most long time players - play for a random experience, not to be forced to follow some script the dev thinks I should.  Because of this, you'll end up restarting over and over again until you get a map where you're not completely surrounded since the map generator jams city-state and civ starting locations so close together it feels like it's trying to play Tetris with them.Removal of Basic Features and Player Control:  I squarely blame Ed Beach for this.  He's on record in the preview videos hyping up the removal of certain features so it's a more ""dynamic"" experience and players have to ""pay more attention.""  When the game released, the hostile unit alert was removed and has now been patched back in after complaints form the community, one of Ed Beach's innovations to make the player ""pay more attention."" At least now if a barbarian horde or enemy army shows up next to one of your fortified units, the game actually tells you.  It's one of the few ""positive"" updates, diminished by the fact it should have been included in the game at launch.  Barbarians now can't tap dance past your warrior waving spartklers without them noticing.  I still can't figured what possessed him or anyone else on the design team to think this was ""dynamic"" instead of just being obnoxious.  It's particularly annoying since the game decides it knows what you need to be looking at and constantly jerks the camera around.City growth is another major issue.  After the first patch, we can finally see which tile is going to be claimed next, but the player has no control over it.  All you can do is sit there and curse under your breath when you see it's going to claim a useless tile instead of a resource it could claim.  There seems to be no rhym or reason to the tiles it chooses.  I've seen it bypass four resource tiles - silk, horses, copper and iron - to claim an ocean tile with no resources anywhere near it.  In a game about building and developing an empire, the player should have the option to manually control this.  Making it random doesn't add depth, it's just handicapping the player under the false pretense of adding ""challenge"".  This still hasn't been fixed.   Barbarians: The new barbarian system is still buggy, they spawn far too early and too often.  I've had three barbarian camps spawn around my capital, and been under seige by two of them by turn 7 on Prince.  I've also watched camps spawn on the same tiles outside my borders over and over again after I've cleared them unless I postition a unit so it's in line of sight.  If the camps keep spawing in the same locations over and over again, it's not random.  It's another feature for some reason they felt needed to be scripted.  Religion:  In prior versions of the game, this was left to expansions and I wish it had been here.  I can understand from a design perspective that it made sense to build it into the base game.  With the new district system, there is now a religious districts and it makes sense to get all your districts - part of the basic mechanics - into the base game.  That said, religion is broken and over-weighted.  The new religious combat system is tedious and depending on what AI opponents you're facing you'll spend more time in religious combat than military combat.  We also now have a Religious Victory.  Quite frankly, this should be cut from the game.  I'm fairly certain they only reason it's included was to justify all the work spent on religion when Diplomatic victory was left out of the game and so many other areas were crying out for more work.   The religious victory mechanics now make it possible for you to loose to an AI player you haven't even met yet.  The ability to achieve religious victory depends far to heavily on starting location and who is closest to the majority of civs.  It feels clumsy and poorly implemented.			"

												First let me get this point acroos Civ 6 is NOT a bad game however is it a dissapointing game? YES! Why? I tell you why. 1st of all there are several things missing like for example options to turn off spies (wich are a pain in the butt) is absent, some map types are gone, and even the option to adjust the number of citystates is gone which can make this game feel even more like a dissapointing game since your missing stuff from the previous civ games. As for graphics i can tolerate them but for some leaders they look absurd. speacking of leaders yoll end up wanting to watch every single one of them be killed in the most millicaous ways possible (esspicaly cleopatria) after the crap they give you. they will declare war, spy on you (and only you), make stupid threats, constantly spam you with the worst trades possible, and as always complain about your warmongering (tbh i wish the warmoongering system was never invented) at least in civ 5 your allies dint turn on you after 1 city taken. It seems like there is too little from an improvment to be declared as a civ 6 and it is ESSPICALLY not worth 60$. Until i see major improvments in the ai, features added back i cant reccomened it.In conclusion if you want a good civ game get CIV 5 and Brave new world. Now that is worth your money.UPDATEI recently heard that steams workshop IS coming however i dont think modders should be responsible for adding the missing contentgame has recently added options to citystates but only on SOME maps			"

												As of now, the game can't really be recomended. I'll still play because it's the only game series me and my boyfriend both enjoy, but the poor execution is slowly taking away all the love for the series and the new ideas.First, the good: I like what they did with culture, which became a second ""tech"" tree similar to science. I also enjoy the animations, from Wonder building to units attacking (at first this was strange, really cartoony, but I actually find it funny now). The music is FANTASTIC, best in the series. On higher difficulties, the AI is pretty solid into exploring its strength, advancing in science, culture and religion faster than me. The barbarians pose a real threat this time.Now, the bad: apart from advancing down the tech trees, AI is atrocious. They'll spawn endless religious units for no reason, their military units are often ages behind current tech, and they simply won't attack anyone unless they can win in a single turn, so after more than 200 hours playing they've attacked ONE of my cities, before I could build walls. They'll be like those horseriders around Daenerys last season in GoT: all scream and shout, not a single strike. Neither the game nor Civilopedia provide all info you need, failing to explain things like what bonuses a wonder provides after you (or someone else) built it, or what bonuses a district is gaining (which is critical to decide which policies you'll be using), or what is generating the amenities in your cities. The new walls system makes all wars basically attrition unless you specifically build cannons. Support units are useless. Ships are almost useless since they no longer easily sink embarked units and do almost no damage to city walls unless you got the last promotion in ranged boats. They could implement some of the ideas from CIV:BE, like waterbased cities or districts, but they chose not to, and seas are blue deserts again. Some Civs seem to always lose no matter what. The UN is gone. Everyone hates everyone all the time. If someone declares war on you and you kill some units, you're a warmongering threat. You'll probably be a warmongering threat no matter what. Even if you're not, you'll be denounced by everyone, probably because you're not killing anyone. Diplomacy is broken anyway, so a Civ can propose completely moronic deals to you, emptying their vaults over luxury resources, which makes you the richest guy on Earth for the next 30 rounds.			"

												This game just needs work. I currently have a quit to desktop freeze glitch as well.The biggest issue with CIV VI is the AI and diplomacy. The idea that some civs like or don't like certain things becomes too stark and raises conflicts of interest that can't be overcome. Even in peace you ruffle feathers.For example, Montezuma will despise you if you have a lot of resources. Strategically, you can't just not have a lot of resources simply to appease an AI. The cost benefit of ignoring agendas is so incredibly imbalanced, leading players to peacefully tick off literally everyone in the game.  You're essentially giving the player a binary choice in this example: 1. Refrain from settling for luxuries and harm their potential in the hopes that Montezuma will sort of like them (although he might just backstab them for no reason anyway) 2. Ignore Montezuma's agenda and go about their business, settling resources and growing. Montezuma then holds a multi-millenia grudge against them.The choice is easy.Every game I play, the entire world has denounced me by probably turn 130 without any aggression on my part. This was maybe an interesting premise but it's a huge flop and a massive step back for the series.I find myself  pretty ticked at the AI most of the game. I frequently get declared war on for no logical casus belli. I am then angry, so I often take their capital if they decided to trifle with me. Then I am Hitler incarnate to the globe diplomatically. This could be the case in modern times, such as if the USA's terms of surrender for Imperial Japan were compelete annexation, but in ancient and classical times, diplomatically, an eye for an eye in the defense of a pointless war ought not make me a bloodthirsty warmonger. It's more that you launched an unprovoked attack and you lost. That's your failure.The builds take too long. Production is so unbelievably hard to come by, especially on archipelego style maps. It is not out of the ordinary for a single district to take 40-50 turns to construct. There is no benefit in constructing these districts, only that you can then build buildings on them.For example, if you pillage a CPU's education district, it is not uncommon for them to take upwards of 30 turns getting it back online. Not to mention you get tech for it. One farm is a full heal pillage. This game is simply made for warmongers, it trumps all other strategy, especially since the CPU is unable to coordinate counter attack or basic defense. Naval warfare is also grossly OP because of the AI as well. Especially if you form fleets. The CPU could have vastly the best culture in the game, the best religion in the game... but if my military or navy is better and bigger, they're toast. That's the theme of the game. There is strategic merit to the long build times, but it is a little too extreme. It is often an immensely superior strategy to completely ignore building commercial, entertainment, or cultural districts all together. I have yet to seriously build any district beyond production and science with strategy in mind, nor do I build anything beyond one or two strategic wonders for my navy or economy. Since the entire world is on fire at all times diplomaticallly, research agreements are rare, which makes being nice even less strategically beneficial than it already is.Trade is fabulously lopsided during the game. I frequently accept 1 gold per turn for a luxury resource, because I have no choice. When dominating the game, at least one leader per turn begs for a free gift. Scaling up the difficulty just delays the inevitable, or makes the game artificially hard, magnifying its problems.The game needs a lot of work. It also feels very vanilla right off the bat, it definitely needs an expansion and diplomacy revision for the leaders to not be so terrible. I would wait for this game, do not buy. Civ V is currently a better game.			"

Seems terrible for such a big game price.Out of wack and unfun warmonger penaltys, leader dislikes being illogical in some cases. Poorly balanced reasearch where you cannot experience an era or take time to make the small things. Why stick to a system that has always had problems when you could design a better one? Having a city with an encampment should be able to make buildings as well as units. Why can another city not help to make a granery on a new city?Generally a game that was designed around a system with no thought of ""Is this fun"" much like Civ V.3 out of 4 ""dlc's"" already used for more expensive version with what is very little content.

												In my first play through around 200 turns religion bar stucked. I was aiming for a religion victory and I wasn't able to pass a turn because I need to update smt from religion bar. I have no way of opening my religion screen and at this point I don't even remember what I can use religion screen for. I am shift + enter'ing my turns and I am able to pass turns now. I am going to win the game by 500 turns (I am around 450 into this game) and I have some problems other than multiplayer bug, or other bugs and crashes. They can all be solved from 5 mounths from now but core mechanics won't be change most likely and they all suck.Culture mechanic is not well thought through. Wars doesn't affect tourism. You can not block your borders for other countries and your citizens. (this would lessen their tourists income and punish culture victory) as far as I know there is not a steady income for tourism, not without cards at least.Goverment choices are not as deep as they should be. Capitalism, fascism or communism need bigger difference, bonuses and disadvantages without the card system. +You shouldn't be able to change your goverment every 5 years to suit your needs. +There should be bonuses if you keep your goverment save for a long time, like if you finish the game with theocracy.Spies are too damn op. I have never got caught spying and escaped every time. I used to defend my building but i find no need for it, they can't hurt me as much as i hurt them. I stole more than 5 great pieces but noone is asking any questions. I boosted all my science options from spies and those countries I spy on aren't even on the same age as I am. AI can't handle wars. You can trick AI everytime even if they have more units then you. AI tends to suicide charge its units and settlers. I stole 2 cities from the AI by just letting AI settle. I waited for it to settle to most bizarre place and sealed its way out.  Right now I am in 2010 and I can still see settlers wandering around + catapult and knights... I can go on and on about how idioutic the diplomacy is or AI uses every city state againts me but when I use other city states againts them they do not attack but just sit still to get taken by AI. Religion spreading is also bs, even on fascism or communism your cities can change religion and you have no way of enforcing your religion by military. You can't use religion as a way of starting a war or ask your allies to join the war with you.A shameful display. Back to the Total War...			"

												Just a few words.Pros: New city building system really rocks. Cons: Very few civs, terrible AI, discussable graphics, broken diplomacy (all hail warmongers!), horrible perfomance, no teams in multiplayer.Verdict: totally not worth its money.UPD: Well, at least (and at last) they added teamplay.

												So Ive been playing this game for a while, 55 hours as of writing this, and im really having issues with what to do, thumbs up or down...In the end though, i will not recommend this game, although it has various good points.Plus:-The district system is very nice, forces you to consider placement of future districts and wonder while balancing the recourses nearby.-Wonders requiring a tile is smart, gives you more of a penalty if you dont finish while also taking a tile from your city if you do.-The civics tree is interesting, culture in general feels much more immersive and competative than before.-The earning of great people allows for you to play in alot of different ways and screw over your opponents by taking something that they could use.-Combat units are balanced.-The addition of projects let you produce something of worth when no buildings are available instead of just units, gold or science.Minus:-Religious victory is completely overpowered, especially in pve games. its too easy to take over another Civ with religion, especially if that Civ isnt specifically aiming for that victory.-There arent enough great works slots. especially for the Writers, there is 1 spot in an aphitheater for each city, other than that, you need wonders, which makes writers useless, especially considering they produce 2-3 pieces each.-Leader and civilization powers are weirdly specific and sometimes useless. The powers need you to have or do some very specific things that are sometimes very bad. for example, Russias leader Peter has the ability to receive ekstra science and culture from traderoutes with Civ that are more advanced than them. This means that to make greatest use of this leader, 2 victory conditions have been eliminated. -Amenities, Housing and Population. on paper it seems smart but in reality, housing and amenities stop the player from settling alot of places early in the game simply because they wont result in anything, and when playing against high level AI, early settling is key. its also not well explained what ""entertainment"" is in the game, as the ""entertainment complex"" district says it gives amenities from different sources of ""entertainment"".-Not alot of map options so far, it was okay in civ 5 after all the expansions but to have this little option and with very few ways of controlling how the map will form? not good.-No way to play co-op. Civ 5 had a broken way of playing co-op but at least you could still do it, here, you have no actual way of playing any real co-op, which really makes it uninteresting to do.And lastly, the big issue that everyone is annoyed with:-AI. So many new things in Civ 6 were based on giving AI an overhaul and give them personality and agenda. which they did. they just all have the same, almost immidiately denounce, go to war for petty reasons, rinse repeat. There are so many more issues with AI but this review is long enough.			"

												I am not saying this to be arrogant, so save the flames on your flame throwers.  I am saying this to demonstrate how much I care about the Civilization franchise and how much of my own personal time I have invested in playing their games.  I am also saying this because it lets you know how much thought I have put into each game, and that when I give a review about the game I am not just talking out my a*s and it come from a place of knowing a great deal about the series.I consider myself an expert at Civilization.  I have beaten every Civ game on normal and huge maps on the deity level and my top scores rank in the top 10% in the United States.  Here then is my “expert” review of Civilization VI.I consider Civilization VI to be the worst Civilization ever.  I had such high hopes too.  After Civ 5 made the worst mistake in Civ history by allowing only one military unit per hex, resulting in comical scenarios where you would build a new improved unit but could not even get it out of your city because there were so many of your other units on tiles, I thought that Civ 6 would have to learn something.  I mean the people who design this game aren’t total idiots.  Are they?It seems that in some sense that sadly they might be.  Let us start by the fact that they unleash the game upon the public with game breaking bugs.  These bugs are as follows:  0. Many people could not even get the game to play.  I had a lot of trouble.  I bought the game from a store.  After I installed in, it would say ready to play, but was trying to download 25% of the entire game’s size in GB from Steam.  However, the download was not downloading anything, even after hours. Finally, it started downloading after restarting Steam 20 times and I could play it.  I had hoped that that would be the worst bug found.  I was wrong.1. Every other turn, long after it had already been built, 3 different Civs would build the world wonder the Oracle. 2. City-States don’t update their military and are surrounded by warriors in the Atomic Age, as do many of the other Civs. 3. The sound will randomly cut out, and only play the sound effects for certain things until you reload.4. Aircraft carriers cannot carry air units.  If you send an air unit to an aircraft carrier it disappears forever and the air craft carrier says it has no units in it.5. My diplomacy screen lists two artifacts which I do not possess and have never acquired.6. After the Modern Age, when I researched a tech or civ that should give me one envoy, I would get three.7.  Luxuries and strategic resources which other civs give you through trade do not show up on any screen nor do they seem to effect the number of amenities that I have.8. And the game-breaker, war weariness.  Out of 380 turns, I declared a holy war with only a moderate warmongering penalty, and spent only 5 turns fighting them before I wiped them out.  Even though I had every single luxury the game has, including special ones like perfume, and all my cities at that point had entertainment complexes with all buildings, my entire nation is in revolt after just 5 tums.  What is worse is that after being at peace with everyone and all city-states, the war weariness never decreased, ever, making my game unplayable with every city in revolt.  That is a severe bug and breaks the game at deity level.Gameplay Review:  While Civ 6 tried to bring a few good things back from earlier Civilization games which for some reason were discontinued, they broke so many other tried and true aspects of Civilization that the ended up making the game worse, and the worst yet.  Some of these changes for the worse are as follows.1.  There is no longer a central diplomacy screen.  Previous Civ games have had a central diplomacy screen where you could see all Civs relationships to each other and to you.  You can also see all deals that you have with other Civs, when they started and when they ended or end.  I think it was Civ 5 that had a great screen where you had the portraits of every Civ and lines going between them to indicate their relationship with each other.  For some insane reason, Civ 6 decided to chuck this out, in favor of nothing.  Now to see the relationship of Civs with other Civs you have to click on each diplomacy screen individually and read the tiny print about their relationships with other civs.  And even though there is a screen which tells about your gold deals with other civs, I do not see any other screen which tells you about you other deals, friendship, alliance, resource trading or anything with other Civs.  It is just guesswork and is crazy.2.  Building districts and wonders take up precious tiles that could be worked by citizens.  This is a terrible step in the wrong direction for Civ and adds nothing that is really cool.  Already there were too few workable tiles around your cities in Civ for them to really grow to juggernauts of cities, and now if you want to have buildings and wonders you have to sacrifice about half of them. Are you kidding me?  Cities are less productive than ever using up all their tiles for districts which give less yield when citizens work them than a typical improved tile. Districts are not a terrible idea in and of themselves, but make a separate overlay for districts if you are going to have them so they do not take up a worker tile. Also, the buildings should have to be built first, before the district.  Districts should be something you should be able to build if you build first two or three buildings in the district’s theme, and should enhance the output of those buildings.  For instance, if you build two economic buildings, then you can build an economic district that enhances the output of these buildings.  When ancient peoples dwelling in mud huts set up a market, they didn’t say first, oh, we have to build a specialty place for this market.  No, the market was build, usually around a crossroads, maybe some other economic dwellings, and then it naturally evolved into a market district.3. District building take an absurdly long time to build in the early game.  So much so that in a deity game, I was almost in the Middle Ages before I built my first market.  That is absurd.  Ancient peoples were building markets almost day one.  If they are going to do it this dumb way, then at least allow the first economic, etc. building to be built before the district, and the district required to build the more complex ones.4. They completely messed up builders.  Having builders only have a few uses before expiring and taking so long to build is absurd.  Having them build what they are building instantly is absurd too.  The way Civ did builders in the past was fine and good.  There was nothing broke there, and if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it because there are plenty of things that are broke.  But Civ 6 took the attitude that if it ain’t broke yet, we will break it.  A builder who does not expire and takes a while to build things, and gets upgrades to the time it takes to build things with tech, is a good system that makes sense in a real life context.  To make builders expire, build things instantly, and cost an arm and a leg is just annoying and foolish.  Plus they cannot build roads, which is the next point of contention.5.  Roads.  Civ 6 completely messes up roads.  Roads have always been very important to Civ, because on higher levels of difficulty, Civ is a race.  Civ 6 ruins them, another thing that wasn’t broken.  Traders are the only ones to build roads until military engineers who can only build two before expiring?  Are you kidding me?  This is annoying beyond belief.  I like having control over my roads system and being able to build them where I want them.  I also like the late game roads where your units move long distances, which again matches real life, and you having to have researched technology to get better roads.  Continued...			"

												So far this game is a terrible disappointment.  5 months on from release, the AI issues still aren't resolved.  I bought the Digital Deluxe edition, paying $20 more, for access to the first four DLC packs at a supposedly better price than buying them individually.  So far the 3 I've been given are selling on Steam for $4.99 each, so unless the next pack is expansion-level content with a pricetag of at least $14.99 I'm going to feel even more ripped off than I already do.  Save yourself a whole lot of disappointment and just buy the Civ V complete package instead.  It's an infinitely better game.Edited 4/1:  the fourth piece of included DLC came out on 3/28.  It's 2 more Civs and one more scenario, retail price 8.99.  I saved 4 dollars by buying the deluxe, and after 6 months this game is no closer to being playable than it was at launch.  Two bad games in a row for the franchise (Beyond Earth, even with Rising Tide, is no good).  Hopefully they fix this but I don't know that I'm willing to spend money on the expansion content that it'll take to do that.			"

												I have played CiV for 366 hours. While I loved the game, especially the expansions, it was getting a bit stale. To remedy that and to make games more diverse Civ VI introduced the new district system among other things. This is the backround and the expectations I had when I jumped into the game.I only have 7 hours clocked now and my impressions are mixed. I immediately created a game, skipped the ""useless"" tutorial assuming I'll get the hang of things and started playing with China. On one hand it's the familiar Civ we all know and love but on the other hand things work really weird. I played maybe 40-50 turns and decided to play the tutorial afterall, everything felt so confusing. The tutorial started from way too basics so I got bored and decided to try to learn again by playing.I managed to get my new game with China again to Medieval Era, maybe around 150 turns. And from that game my feeling was quite meh. The beginning of the game is always great: the sense of exploring, building your city, planning the first steps. While on Civ VI there is something to do all the time, if not building and researching, it's hunting for heureka! moments. But still I just kept on clicking next turn, next turn, next turn... I kept getting heureka moments, which by the way seem way too easy to get: almost any civ, anywhere, can get them. I kept getting new policies, new techs but nothing felt great or groundbreaking (perhaps I've played too much CiV?) Political Philosophy civic was the first thing that made me stop for a while and it felt great to ""choose your path"".The new district system really takes time to get used to and probably many trials and errors before getting the hang on things. You really need to plan way, WAY, ahead when building a city. So it seems there is a lot of promise but I'm not sure is it yet enough to justify a full priced game when you can get CiV with all DLC's with a fraction of the cost. If you really like civ games and want something ""new"" I suppose I could cautiously recommend this game. Just be mentally prepared to unlearn what you know and to learn new startegies.EDIT: Playing with Gorgo around 150 I realized why I feel so ""meh"": The passivity of the AI! The other civs feel like city-states. None of them interact or engage me in any way. I've played on both prince and king and didn't see much difference. Also the barbarians seem to just mindlessly wonder around my city, not attacking anything.I've learned more about the districts and your cities will get crowded really quick if you try to build everything. I still recommend Civ VI, I'm starting to see the potential but the AI is really lacking. I guess I need to try on harder (cheating) difficulty to see if there is more interaction.			"

												I can't completely say it's a crap game, but it definately is in what it seems to be an ""early stage"" of it's official release.....I bought the deluxe edition because of the comments honestly. Knowing that down the road there will be DLCS most likely, if it's any sid meier's, there will be DLCS....I'll say it again. Unfortunately I can agree that I had more fun with Sid V than I did with this...and for a few reasons. I'm not as in-depth about the problems I notice in the game, like someone mentioned how ""roads are useless and workers can't build them and the only way to build them is to waste a trade route"" yea...I did notice that, and it is a little upsetting because if you're trying to match reality and give the player freedom to make his own decisions...let him build a ♥♥♥♥ing road himself. (just saying) if he builds it through the rainforest of nothingness and nothing gets accomplished with that road as far as military advancements or whatever, then that's their ""loss"" in my opinion. I am also saddened that there are very few options for ""starting a game"" I find myself resetting constantly because I feel the game just doesn't ""cling on to me"" or the person I picked doesn't really have much to offer. I liked the simplicity of Sid V as far as the ""benefits of a leader"" and I think districts are pretty stupid (not going to give a reason, just don't like them)  I also feel like the ""luxury resources and bonus resources"" are pretty useless....again, not giving a reason, just my opinion. I also noticed that workers....when you make a farm or give them something to do, I don't know what happens but they ♥♥♥♥in disappear and that just pisses me off that they poof after It took like 10 turns to produce a worker and he disappears after making 1 farm...I've had it happen to me before, I 've had it happen randomly it seems, idk if it's a bug or they go into like a ""production mode"" and just...""work the tile"" but in my opinion that is very ....very.....very....stupid and annoying.  Makes me produce another worker and another, and another, really I find myself not having workers most the game because they ♥♥♥♥in fall off the earth or seep into a tile or whatever...idk, I definately fine the older version better, and am not entirely upset about wasting $80 at the same time...it is an improvement but god ♥♥♥♥ing DAMN they seemed like they were experimenting with TOO MUCH and have Tom,♥♥♥♥♥♥and Ernie's desk projects implemented in their game when maybe not a lot of people like♥♥♥♥♥♥s idea or Ernie is a little bit on the dumb side and just likes making things broken. Idk, anyway, this is my honest opinion about the game, I know I don't have a lot of hours but i've honestly never had an $80 game seem ""boring"" in a sense....So I feel like I've been ripped in the way that I thought I was buying Civ VI, when really I'm buying something ""like Civ V"" but for dummies...seems to be less to actually ""do"" in the game.

												Was excited for this game. The sins of Beyond Earth were fogiven when they announced Civ6.When I played it, it was very clear that it was different to Civ 5. So I pushed through and in fairness the more I played it did get better. But the nagging feeling always remains that I'd still rather be playing Civ5.That's the problem. Its not (at this stage) a more interesting or enjoyable experience than last time. The Devs should be writing to people with 1000 hours (Ive got around 800) in Civ5 and asking them why. What did they love about it? What would they improve?In civ6 I feel as though I have less control and less freedom to play the way I want. And the game focuses on the things that I always found boring - like victory conditions. In all my hours I never cared about victory types and almost never finished a game. The victory types in Civ always seem so unfair and thus no clear measure of performance. So I generally ignore them, especially in Civ5 where all it does is end the game and tell you someone has won. Yawn.What was fun about Civ5 was exploring, defending, expanding, rushing to find and secure the best land and finite resources, building your empire. Once there was little cloud to explore and no land to grab before someone else, I always became quite bored with empire maintenance and building toward some uninspiring 'victory' type. I was hoping they would recognise that and withhold part of the map or make part of it usless for settlement until mid-late game. Perhaps a new technology may allow you to access or settle new areas because essentially thats the fun part.Civ5 I always found it balanced offering you tough choices without feeling like micro-managment. In Civ6 sometimes there is nothing I want my city to produce, choices of where to settle a new city are so restrictive that its not really a choice. There isnt much in the way of buildings early game so no hard decisions there. Exploring feels like a chore rather than an adventure. The art style is ugly. AI is well - insane. Plus Im not going to spend all my time reading about what makes a particular AI character happy or unhappy. AI should be intuitive if youre a good neighbour and you keep your promises and they are not an agressive AI you should have no problem. The ammount of gold you generate per turn for example, should have no baring and does really restrict the way you play if you want to keep an AI civ happy. Chosing policies is a chore and its a lot of reading with no real big picture plan. Wonders are less wonderful and the number of players who can compete for them is now even more restrictive as they bizareley wemt for 'realism', so no need to stress if you will get there first.One thing I've wanted to see for a long time is genuine unit diversity between nations or regions. Giving each civ 2 token 'unique' units that you may never even use is not exactly game changing. I wanted it to feel like there really is a difference when selecting your civ and not just a cookie cutter reskin with some minor changes or perks.Overall playing Civ6 has less of the things I enjoy. I feel less free, less in control, not as able to plan ahead, and the whole experience feels a great deal more aimless. Although there are plenty of things to work towards like completing mindless tasks for city-states for example, there are very few things on offer that I care about enough to bother working towards. I'll keep playing it because I really want to like it more. But I have a feeling Civ5 will always be the more balanced, better looking, more interesting game.Thats why im giving it a no.			"

												""Most Civ games need a years worth of patches before they really get good, maybe an expantion pack or something right?""R...right?I'm an old piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥and I've been playing civ since I could on my old 386 on dos (barely managed to since I only had like 50MB of HDD but hey) and I can tell you it's always good to deliver a product when it's finished. Because most previous civs have been at least passable on their deliverly.Unless you're looking for multiplayer then I still dont think this game is a satisfying single player experience. Why? The AI mainly, there have been several decent UI fixes that never should've been there in the first place (they felt like mid stage alpha kinda oversites) . Regardless, the UI has improved, the AI hasn't and Sean Bean is still telling you about world wonders and advances in humanity.. not bad right? Ehhhhhh.....I think this is probably the biggest the ball has been dropped on a civ game so far and in making AWESOME PRE PURCHASE EARLY RELEASE SALES the game has actually sold a bit of its noterity and renown. I played this game pretty solid for a good month (ok 80 hours but yeah I have a social life) and I just couldn't get into it like I did with Civ 5 (pre gods and kings even..)Like multiplayer? Great this game is ready for youWant a satisfying solo player experience? Stick to civ 5 for a little bit longer and hopefully an expansion will come out with a 3 page apology from the investors for clearly grabbing the devs by the balls and making them juice out an UNFINISHED GAME. I'm still a fan but I'm a butthurt weary fan now.			"

												Need to fix the diplomacy. Even on the easiest game modes, the mid to late game turns into a massive fuster cluck with every civ denouncing and declaring war on each other. Every. single. game. turns out like this. The diplomacy ruins this game. Any slight changes they made to gameplay and builders from civ v are overshadowed by the terrible diplomacy. Id also like to point out that the AI program is really lazy. The difference between different levels of AI is how much free stuff they are given. For a game that is mostly a single player game, the AI should at least be decent.			"

												I really want to vote yes, and I feel like if they update the AI, I will, but right now, I simply can't. Let me start by saying that if you enjoy war in Civilization games (you absolute maniac), this game is a great improvement. The gameplay is fun and colorful, the much-touted improvements to city planning add so much more strategy and depth to the gameplay experience, and just about everything has been tweaked and polished to a mirror sheen. The game, if taken on its own without context, is quite great and I highly recommend it to any fans of the series.And like I said, if you enjoy war above all other things in this franchise, then it won't disappoint. But if you enjoy tactful negotiation, playing diplomacy, manipulating nations against each other, or just simply trying for another victory condition OTHER than domination, then I'd suggest passing on this game. For now. The AI is so bad that I am confident that it's bugged. They will openly declare war on you - and only you - for absolutely no reason.I know, to some degree, that this is a mainstay of the series, but it never felt this bad. Later in the game, you will have civilizations go from alliance to straight up war in a matter of two or three turns, and there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to prevent it. As someone who both hates the micro-managey nature of war in Civilization and enjoys actually feeling like there's some sort of diplomatic game that I can shrewdly manipulate to my advantage - even if it means paying off the most powerful nations to not go to war with me - I simply can't play this game. As I mentioned before, the irrational AI seems almost like a bug and I firmly believe it will be tweaked and fixed in time, but until that time, I cannot recommend this game for anyone that enjoys what makes Civilization great: the actual simulation of building a civilization. If you like turn-based war simulators, then go nuts. But if you want a Civ game with Civ-levels of nuance - certainly keep an eye on Civ 6 for when they (hopefully) fix the AI - but don't waste your money.			"

												As of now, the game can't really be recomended. I'll still play because it's the only game series me and my boyfriend both enjoy, but the poor execution is slowly taking away all the love for the series and the new ideas.First, the good: I like what they did with culture, which became a second ""tech"" tree similar to science. I also enjoy the animations, from Wonder building to units attacking (at first this was strange, really cartoony, but I actually find it funny now). The music is FANTASTIC, best in the series. On higher difficulties, the AI is pretty solid into exploring its strength, advancing in science, culture and religion faster than me. The barbarians pose a real threat this time.Now, the bad: apart from advancing down the tech trees, AI is atrocious. They'll spawn endless religious units for no reason, their military units are often ages behind current tech, and they simply won't attack anyone unless they can win in a single turn, so after more than 200 hours playing they've attacked ONE of my cities, before I could build walls. They'll be like those horseriders around Daenerys last season in GoT: all scream and shout, not a single strike. Neither the game nor Civilopedia provide all info you need, failing to explain things like what bonuses a wonder provides after you (or someone else) built it, or what bonuses a district is gaining (which is critical to decide which policies you'll be using), or what is generating the amenities in your cities. The new walls system makes all wars basically attrition unless you specifically build cannons. Support units are useless. Ships are almost useless since they no longer easily sink embarked units and do almost no damage to city walls unless you got the last promotion in ranged boats. They could implement some of the ideas from CIV:BE, like waterbased cities or districts, but they chose not to, and seas are blue deserts again. Some Civs seem to always lose no matter what. The UN is gone. Everyone hates everyone all the time. If someone declares war on you and you kill some units, you're a warmongering threat. You'll probably be a warmongering threat no matter what. Even if you're not, you'll be denounced by everyone, probably because you're not killing anyone. Diplomacy is broken anyway, so a Civ can propose completely moronic deals to you, emptying their vaults over luxury resources, which makes you the richest guy on Earth for the next 30 rounds.			"

												The mechanics of this game are a wide step away from previous Civilization games; many of which make it feel more like the first part of a new series than an entry into an established IP.  I have been a huge fan of the series since its inception, and this game really feels more like it was created as a mobile version than a full PC release.  Graphically, the game has taken huge steps backwards, opting for a highly-saturated cartoon aesthetic than the realism that such a game really demands.  In many ways, the game feels incomplete and most of the newly implemented mechanics (the government card systems, expiring workers, and AI players as a whole) really make the game feel less intuitive and effective than previous entries.I was expecting a game that built and improved upon the innovations from Civilization IV, V and Beyond Earth, yet this game has completely disposed of that feeling.Overall Synopsis:  Very disappointed.  Hopefully more content will be added soon that makes the game more playable.  Without that, the game really has very little play value, let alone replay value.			"

												Am I the only one loving polishment and care about details ? I'm not going to speak about the AI which need some improvement or some balance to be fixed, but I will talk about a very simple thing which are icons. Yes, icons :- Low-Resolution icons when unit's are selected ? Are you serious ? The game is not finished at all. The lenses are awful, there is no graphic/design chart in the UI, and I'm sorry it breaks my immersion, I didn't buy the 25th Anniversary edition of a pre-alpha game. There are lots of this things which I'm scared won't be fixed. - The icon for great works which is not from the same designer as the others  (governement, science etc...)- The icons when placing a district or a wonder informing you of the specific cases (rivers, mountains, ""natural wonder"") are made with paint and are not even cut well (white pixel line at the left).- In the city description (happiness, amenities etc...), the food symbol is surrounded by a square while on map it's a circle (yes, devil hides in details).Another thing which is significant : When you click on any city option (production, buy tiles etc...), the selected button become bright blue (instead of darker one) and the inner symbol become almost black, that is the graphic/design chart of the buttons in the game. But not really, because with units, the button become bright blue but the inner symbol become nothing, it stays the same, white on bright blue. I'm not talking about the empty main menu or the empty ending screen, that's a shame.The Lenses, only the Touristic one is Polished, the religious one is heavy, I'm not talking about the raw informations on map (faith production on holy sites, number of citizen following religions) which are not sidebared, which haven't got the good typography etc... The Legends of Lenses with this awful colored tiles on the top left of the screen... Seriouly, an independant pre-alpha game.If the game is polished, it could be the best Civilization evermade, but right now, it is not, and do not deserve a good rate.			"

												This game just needs work. I currently have a quit to desktop freeze glitch as well.The biggest issue with CIV VI is the AI and diplomacy. The idea that some civs like or don't like certain things becomes too stark and raises conflicts of interest that can't be overcome. Even in peace you ruffle feathers.For example, Montezuma will despise you if you have a lot of resources. Strategically, you can't just not have a lot of resources simply to appease an AI. The cost benefit of ignoring agendas is so incredibly imbalanced, leading players to peacefully tick off literally everyone in the game.  You're essentially giving the player a binary choice in this example: 1. Refrain from settling for luxuries and harm their potential in the hopes that Montezuma will sort of like them (although he might just backstab them for no reason anyway) 2. Ignore Montezuma's agenda and go about their business, settling resources and growing. Montezuma then holds a multi-millenia grudge against them.The choice is easy.Every game I play, the entire world has denounced me by probably turn 130 without any aggression on my part. This was maybe an interesting premise but it's a huge flop and a massive step back for the series.I find myself  pretty ticked at the AI most of the game. I frequently get declared war on for no logical casus belli. I am then angry, so I often take their capital if they decided to trifle with me. Then I am Hitler incarnate to the globe diplomatically. This could be the case in modern times, such as if the USA's terms of surrender for Imperial Japan were compelete annexation, but in ancient and classical times, diplomatically, an eye for an eye in the defense of a pointless war ought not make me a bloodthirsty warmonger. It's more that you launched an unprovoked attack and you lost. That's your failure.The builds take too long. Production is so unbelievably hard to come by, especially on archipelego style maps. It is not out of the ordinary for a single district to take 40-50 turns to construct. There is no benefit in constructing these districts, only that you can then build buildings on them.For example, if you pillage a CPU's education district, it is not uncommon for them to take upwards of 30 turns getting it back online. Not to mention you get tech for it. One farm is a full heal pillage. This game is simply made for warmongers, it trumps all other strategy, especially since the CPU is unable to coordinate counter attack or basic defense. Naval warfare is also grossly OP because of the AI as well. Especially if you form fleets. The CPU could have vastly the best culture in the game, the best religion in the game... but if my military or navy is better and bigger, they're toast. That's the theme of the game. There is strategic merit to the long build times, but it is a little too extreme. It is often an immensely superior strategy to completely ignore building commercial, entertainment, or cultural districts all together. I have yet to seriously build any district beyond production and science with strategy in mind, nor do I build anything beyond one or two strategic wonders for my navy or economy. Since the entire world is on fire at all times diplomaticallly, research agreements are rare, which makes being nice even less strategically beneficial than it already is.Trade is fabulously lopsided during the game. I frequently accept 1 gold per turn for a luxury resource, because I have no choice. When dominating the game, at least one leader per turn begs for a free gift. Scaling up the difficulty just delays the inevitable, or makes the game artificially hard, magnifying its problems.The game needs a lot of work. It also feels very vanilla right off the bat, it definitely needs an expansion and diplomacy revision for the leaders to not be so terrible. I would wait for this game, do not buy. Civ V is currently a better game.			"

The health icons are extremely difficult to identify how you will perform fighting an opponent.  Do not waste your money on this.  How do you display 10 thumbs down?			"

												I'll start by saying it's a good game, with the potential of being an amazing game. But it's just not there. Half of the gameplay is just trying to figure out how to work past the annoying interface. Stick with civ 5 until there are better DLC's that make it as smooth and not buggy as it currently is.			"

Posted: November 22, 2016
												4.5/10I'm udpating my review because the game is several patches in now, but unfortunately I can't change the score or my recommendation against buying the game.  This is a shame because I still feel it has a lot of potential, but the patches released so far haven't done anything to address the fundamental problems with it.  At best, Civ VI is still only tolerable to play for a brief period of time.  Instead of ""just one more turn before I quit,"" it's ""can I force myself to take one more turn before I quit.""  A game shouldn't be an experience you tolerate.  A root canal is an experience you have to tolerate.  Games are supposed to be fun, and VI just isn't.  I still can't recommend anyone spend their money on this.The fundamental problem remains that the lead designer, Ed Beach, didn't want to make a Civ game.  What do I mean by that?  The prior games in the franchise were randomized 4X sandbox games that emphasized empire building and management.  Warfare was always a major aspect, but Ed Beach apparently wanted to make a straight up war game instead. So what he did was rig the game.  Pretty much every aspect of it - from diplomacy to map seeding - is artificially weighted to make sure that AI always has a reason to hate the human player and constantly declares war.  The end result of Ed Beach's ham fisted scripting makes every time you play feel exactly the same.  Oh, the map and what civilzations you're playing against may change, but that's pretty much it.  It's ALWAYS going to play out the same.  EVERY.  SINGLE.  TIME.  By rigging the game so that the hostile AI will always declare war on you, he's turned Civ into the war game he wanted to make.  You'll find youself forced to repeat the same military focused strategies every time you play.  Each playthrough of prior Civ games was a different experience, and replayability has always been one of it's major selling points.  Without that, the base game isn't worthy anywhere near it's heafty price tag. Pros:  District System =  I like unstacking the cities and the accompanying adjacency bonuses.  It adds a whole new layer of strategic planning to the game.  On an aesthetic level, it also gives cities a grander scale and makes them feel more like actual cities.City-States = City-states have been revamped, and have their own new diplomatic system involving assigning them envoys.  As more envoys are assigned, new levels of perks are unlocked (bonuses to the capital, bonuses to districts, etc.).  These bonuses are pretty generic among the different types of city-states until you reach the top level and become their suzerin (overlord).  Each city state now has it's own unique top level bonus at that level that range from Lisbon giving extra gold on trade routes to a special tile improvement from La Venta, giving each a unique value.  New Government System = The new government system was one of the things I was most put off by when they previewed it, but it's rapidly become one of my favorite new features allowing for greater customization and specific focus on the player's goals.Cons:Map Generation:  Smaller map sizes are now larger, but larger map sizes are now smaller.  It makes sense on the smaller maps since cities play wide instead of tall now, but larger maps are now too small.  My biggest complaint, though, is is now a default to ensure another civ will spawn no more than X number of tiles from the player.  This is set up to force early game conflict with an AI that is much more aggressive than in prior versions of the game.  I don't like this at all.  I - like I imagine most long time players - play for a random experience, not to be forced to follow some script the dev thinks I should.  Because of this, you'll end up restarting over and over again until you get a map where you're not completely surrounded since the map generator jams city-state and civ starting locations so close together it feels like it's trying to play Tetris with them.Removal of Basic Features and Player Control:  I squarely blame Ed Beach for this.  He's on record in the preview videos hyping up the removal of certain features so it's a more ""dynamic"" experience and players have to ""pay more attention.""  When the game released, the hostile unit alert was removed and has now been patched back in after complaints form the community, one of Ed Beach's innovations to make the player ""pay more attention."" At least now if a barbarian horde or enemy army shows up next to one of your fortified units, the game actually tells you.  It's one of the few ""positive"" updates, diminished by the fact it should have been included in the game at launch.  Barbarians now can't tap dance past your warrior waving spartklers without them noticing.  I still can't figured what possessed him or anyone else on the design team to think this was ""dynamic"" instead of just being obnoxious.  It's particularly annoying since the game decides it knows what you need to be looking at and constantly jerks the camera around.City growth is another major issue.  After the first patch, we can finally see which tile is going to be claimed next, but the player has no control over it.  All you can do is sit there and curse under your breath when you see it's going to claim a useless tile instead of a resource it could claim.  There seems to be no rhym or reason to the tiles it chooses.  I've seen it bypass four resource tiles - silk, horses, copper and iron - to claim an ocean tile with no resources anywhere near it.  In a game about building and developing an empire, the player should have the option to manually control this.  Making it random doesn't add depth, it's just handicapping the player under the false pretense of adding ""challenge"".  This still hasn't been fixed.   Barbarians: The new barbarian system is still buggy, they spawn far too early and too often.  I've had three barbarian camps spawn around my capital, and been under seige by two of them by turn 7 on Prince.  I've also watched camps spawn on the same tiles outside my borders over and over again after I've cleared them unless I postition a unit so it's in line of sight.  If the camps keep spawing in the same locations over and over again, it's not random.  It's another feature for some reason they felt needed to be scripted.  Religion:  In prior versions of the game, this was left to expansions and I wish it had been here.  I can understand from a design perspective that it made sense to build it into the base game.  With the new district system, there is now a religious districts and it makes sense to get all your districts - part of the basic mechanics - into the base game.  That said, religion is broken and over-weighted.  The new religious combat system is tedious and depending on what AI opponents you're facing you'll spend more time in religious combat than military combat.  We also now have a Religious Victory.  Quite frankly, this should be cut from the game.  I'm fairly certain they only reason it's included was to justify all the work spent on religion when Diplomatic victory was left out of the game and so many other areas were crying out for more work.   The religious victory mechanics now make it possible for you to loose to an AI player you haven't even met yet.  The ability to achieve religious victory depends far to heavily on starting location and who is closest to the majority of civs.  It feels clumsy and poorly implemented.			"

												Edit: Saw that they released an update and gave the game another chance.  TLDR - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it is still fundamentally broken. Simplest way to explain how obviously the AI still blatantly cheats - I played as China, rushed Stonehenge with a worker, no wasted turns. The AI magically produces Stonehenge with 1 turn remaining (no duplicate rulers, so no other Chinas out there). And in late game the AI STILL bumbles around like a chicken with its head cut off.Look, I know people worked very hard on this game and there are a number of positive things about Civ6, but the negative aspects far outweigh them. I don't know what went wrong, wouldn't be surprised if it was due to 2K's involvement (garbage publisher that in recent years has been prioritizing $s far more than user experience, same thing has happened with the NBA 2K games over time). I'm done with this game, can't recommend it even if you get it for free. If you want to play a great strategy game, just buy Civ4/5 (still published by 2K but before their garbage phase).-------------------------------------------So much promise, but suffers from horrible balancing, broken/cheating AI, and poor optimization.In terms of balancing, the majority of civs are critically weak vs the stronger civs. To the point where it's not even really a decision.AI blatantly cheats. Every time you invest in a major wonder, the computer will ALWAYS complete it just ahead of you to force you to waste production.  Additionaly, every time you take a risk (moving a settler 1 square without protection, moving a severely damaged unit into an unknown area, etc), a barbarian will magically appear in the perfect location to ambush you.  Strong AI is important, but barely-masked cheating is totally different.With regard to optimization, the game runs way too slowly. I'm running an i5-7600k with a 1080, 1 min long computer turns, even on a huge map, is inexcusable.  I know a lot of calculations are required, but that should still take seconds in a well-programmed game.If you want to get into Civ, go with Civ 5 (with expansions and mods). Civ 6 is nowhere near worth it, even though the mods have done an admirable job of improving the game.  I'm shocked by the nerve 2K has to sell DLC before fixing the core issues plaguing this game.

												Do they even test these games anymore?! Buggy, unbalanced, shallow. I've loved Civilization sice the first generation, but one week into this new adventure and I'm already bored.The problem as I see it is that Firaxis is not learning from their own history.  Civ V vanilla came out and it was unbalanced, buggy, lacked depth... all in all, not nearly as good as Civ IV plus the expansions.  And guess what, the same thing has happened in CIV VI.  It took two expansions for Civ V to become a good game and several mods for it to become a great game.  So why didn't they learn their lesson from their own previous expansions?  Similarly, why didn't they incorporate elements from the most successful mods into their new game?  They ignore their fan base, they don't test their games, they give us half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥released... this was a money grab pure and simple.I see a lot of people saying ""wait for the expansion"" or ""don't worry, a mod will fix that"" -- shouldn't the onus be on Firaxis to release a full gaming experience?  Furthermore, why are we depending on UNPAID modders to fix the problems of an expensive triple-A game title?  For $60 I expect a fairly high-end (polished) game.  Civ V changed a lot of things from the previous version, so I can somewhat understand why it wasn't 100% on release... but Civ VI just feels like a really dull version of Civ V.  The removed a bunch of the depth that made Civ V great and only gave us a couple of game mechanics that seem like good ideas on paper but don't currently work together  to increase the levels of enjoyment in the game itself.The game play is unbalanced, the graphics are a HUGE step backwards (looks like some freemium mobile game), the AI managed to get worse, the civs are boring, diplomacy is useless, religion is annoying... and basically it feels like they've nerfed most of the things that made Civ V so great.""Wait for the expansions"" how about wait for the bargain bin because right now this game is nowhere near where Civ V left off.

												DON'T BUY... yet. Civ VI has the potential to be the best Civ yet. But the game is borderline unplayable in its current state due to two major issues:1 - UIThere is no queuing and certain mundane tasks cannot be automated. For example, you have to give new orders to each of your spies every three turns: There's no way to set them to permanently defend. These problems aren't not noticeable early on, but it becomes a serious issue late in the game because you'll be spending 90% of your time on these little things instead of actually playing. 2 - AIThe AI is completely broken. Trading is bugged, dipomacy doesn't make sense (your allies will attack you for being a warmonger if you accept their invitation to fight a common enemy), and city states will always spawn barbarians in late game because their populations outgrow happiness. The first few eras are a lot of fun, but it's hard to finish games because the game becomes boring. Less and less time goes towards making high-level decisions as a ruler, and more and more time goes towards clicking through menus to reissue orders that you had just set a few turns earlier. So, don't bother playing for now. Wait until it's fixed. And who knows: Maybe it'll go on sale in the meantime.			"

Gameplay just didnt feel right. Tech Trees made no sense and Civics tree felt very insignificant. Tech Balance was way off, I easily managed to research Satalites by the year 1700 (without even focussing on tech). I don't like how Raging barbarians is on by default, forcing you to always make a huge army to even stay alive, which makes the game feel very slow.			"

Archers suddenly closing it to attack when they could have at range.  Units that cannot skip turn unless the move first.

I enjoy a lot about this game, but I am still getting used to a few things and I would like to offer a few ideas and things I would like to see improved:1. I want my worker back. I understand that you are trying to make a new game, but the roads can be an issue when the caravan just won't go the direction you want. The military engineer takes a while to get to.2. The units are too slow. In V we were able to move across grassland and onto a mountain or cross a river. Why are we getting slower? Let's open up the battlefield for more dynamic military ability.3. Can the AI please be programed to upgrade their units? Why am I killing catapults in 1900? This is on level 7 btw. The most difficult AI in the series was in Civ 4.4. Does anyone miss the world congress? I do, it was a cool way to make diplomacy important even if it isn't a victory condition anymore.5. Many of the new ideas are terrific. The card system is great. But why do the wonders suck? Where is the game changing wonder like the old Great Library, Hanging Gardens. The Teracotta army was a sick trick to play on someone. And the national wonders?			"

												I really want to vote yes, and I feel like if they update the AI, I will, but right now, I simply can't. Let me start by saying that if you enjoy war in Civilization games (you absolute maniac), this game is a great improvement. The gameplay is fun and colorful, the much-touted improvements to city planning add so much more strategy and depth to the gameplay experience, and just about everything has been tweaked and polished to a mirror sheen. The game, if taken on its own without context, is quite great and I highly recommend it to any fans of the series.And like I said, if you enjoy war above all other things in this franchise, then it won't disappoint. But if you enjoy tactful negotiation, playing diplomacy, manipulating nations against each other, or just simply trying for another victory condition OTHER than domination, then I'd suggest passing on this game. For now. The AI is so bad that I am confident that it's bugged. They will openly declare war on you - and only you - for absolutely no reason.I know, to some degree, that this is a mainstay of the series, but it never felt this bad. Later in the game, you will have civilizations go from alliance to straight up war in a matter of two or three turns, and there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to prevent it. As someone who both hates the micro-managey nature of war in Civilization and enjoys actually feeling like there's some sort of diplomatic game that I can shrewdly manipulate to my advantage - even if it means paying off the most powerful nations to not go to war with me - I simply can't play this game. As I mentioned before, the irrational AI seems almost like a bug and I firmly believe it will be tweaked and fixed in time, but until that time, I cannot recommend this game for anyone that enjoys what makes Civilization great: the actual simulation of building a civilization. If you like turn-based war simulators, then go nuts. But if you want a Civ game with Civ-levels of nuance - certainly keep an eye on Civ 6 for when they (hopefully) fix the AI - but don't waste your money.			"

												I am extremely disappointed in this game.  The graphics are horrible.  It is practically impossible to identify where you have been.  The health icons are extremely difficult to identify how you will perform fighting an opponent.  Do not waste your money on this.  How do you display 10 thumbs down?			"

												Instead of writing very obvious thing that probably said by others thousand of times already,I'll just show some cases I encountered while playing this miserable excuse of *Strategy* game.1. I defended my encircled remote city with 'One machine gun' unit, against 10+ enemy force armed with same tech level,and after that defend, they come to begging for their surrender.2. I've send my battleship to bombard enemy shore city, and they responded with bunch of embarked land unitwhich can't even attack my battleship. So they just sunk one by one and their city got scrapped and captured while my shipdidn't evet got sctratch.3. AI don't build any aircraft. I saw some report of lucky player who seen AI build aircraft, but I didn't see them and my frienddidn't see them. Apparently my whole Civ fan cafe didn't see them too. So you have to be lucky if you want to see AI aircraft.4. Thanks to the horrendous UI, even the simplist thing like click on your City can be some kind of tricky mission,and click on notification need some kind of wild luck to working correctly.Show up overlay is nothing better, and nearly half the time it refuse to work and don't show up info.This parts is literally fall short even in the 90's standard. This is one of most fcked up UI I've ever seen,nearly comparable with that infamous Skyrim UI(Speaking of which, that game UI was sck♥♥♥♥♥too).They are same level.5. Diplomacy is practically non exist, and considering this is strategy game, that's a good sign.All AI just acting like 6 years old♥♥♥♥♥♥kid who playing some juvenile hot-seat multi player game with friend in all same room,joking eachother, laughing, sometime smash head of friend with fist while eating homemade pancake.- - -I was royal fan of Civ franchise, and after this one I decided put this company on my life time blacklist.And you also need to know this,1. Most(if not all) of these problem is still exist and didn't get fix.2. While not addresing such curcial failure, they already deployed two additional $ DLC.I recommend not just don't buy this game, but shut out that company from your interest forever.If you really want to try out and give a chance to this miserable wasted pile of files,wait until at least AI problem got addressed and they put on huge discount.

												I found it to be a very tedious game and quickly lost interest.   I'm still a big fan of Civ V.  I found particularly irritating the inability to scroll ""north"",  the clumsy and confusing diplomatic set up, and the disappearance of territory unless you had a unit stationed there after you explored it.   Also irritating was the ""using up"" of workers after construction.  I could go on but it's just a bad game.			"

												I had a hard time deciding how to rate Civilization 6, on one hand I really like it. It introduces a nice level of complexity that I felt Civilization 5 was missing, and there are many conceptual improvements. The empire-wide happiness mechanic is gone, which means that settling more than 4 cities is once again a staple.At the same time, this game was released unfinished. It's clear that it will need many more months of development, maybe even years, to reach the level of polish that Civilization 5 currently has. That's a shame too, they should not have sold the game as a finished product knowing its problems, but here we are. The short of it is, if you aren't a dedicated Civilization player or a fan of the series, go pick up Civilization 5 instead. It's cheaper, has more content, and is decently balanced. This game is not. The DLC for this game is also pretty underwhelming. Adding additional Civs to play as is nice, charging $5 each is not.			"

												Feels like the people at Firaxis have never picked up the game and tried to play it. The AI doesn't even try to win but fairly often will get the religious victory by accident. The Tech tree is terribly laid out. It's remarkably easy to get AT troops through beelining Chemistry by turn 150 on standard. The AI on Deity is only about 30 turns behind that getting Chemistry and AT troops so I'm convinced no one at Firaxis ever plays it at that level. Otherwise they would have noticed the problem with the tech tree.I was willing to be forgiving but the rate of patches and communication is horrible at this point. I'm sure we'll see two more mini DLCs before we get a decent working patch and that's pretty unacceptable.			"

												While arguably a better game than civilization V was at launch, and brimming with interesting ideas, the game as a whole just isn't fun.   Once you clear the early game, everything you do feels like tedious busywork meant to hide the fact that you aren't really doing anything of any importance.   The entire late game is a slog of micromanaging things that should be set and forget (trade routes and spies especially), while you're waiting 60+ turns for your next project to be built because production is completely out of step with every other system in the game.I'm sure it'll be an OK game once they've charged us for 2 more expansions, and I'll consider buying those on sale.  However with this game coming hot on the heels of Beyond Earth, I really don't feel like giving this developer any more money for producs that don't feel like they've been playtested by human beings.

												Finally I feel pushed to write a recommendation not to buy this gem (yet). I will start off by saying that it is a good game, beautiful graphics and all that. But it doesn't matter because the most basic check box has not been fulfilled - the game cannot be played. The game crashes the same time every time. This is the second playthrough, that i've had to abandon because - well - I couldn't play onI have been in contact with customer service, and they were helpful although they asked a lot of help from me. Now it turns out that the error, they say they fixed suddenly occurs in another playthrough, so they probably just took the easy solution. At this time, I would not advice people to buy it simply because it's broken.			"

You gotta do your research to build a good city.+I like the visual style, some people don't though.+The vanilla game is more fleshed out than any other civ releaseCons-glitches, bugs ,glitches and bugs, example : enemies will enter your borders without open borders.-Ui is messy and needs to be cleaned up-The AI are terrible and I mean that in the worst way possible. Keeping a friendship can be near impossible because they get angry for sometimes no apparent reason. Everyone will hate you and its pretty dissapointing. The AI try to make sure you don't win instead of focusing on their own issues and goals. They will often declare a surprise war on you and you wouldn't have any idea why.I don't recommend this game right now. Hold out and watch for some updates or expansions that might fix these issues.

												Lazy garbage in the gaming industry always gets to me, really.Don't get me wrong here, my review will almost definitely change after most of my issues are patched out (hopefully), but my main issue is one of laziness. We'll get to that.Right, so this was pretty much the most promising Civ game of all time. Civ 4 was pretty much objectively the best in the series and Civ 5 had its problems, but Civ 6 looked like it was going to solve the problems of both games and present a complete package. Kind of like the ultimate civ game. You boot up the game, and everything's great. Nice presentation, and even though the combat is really barely changed at the end of the day it's still relatively inoffensive. The barbarian scout stuff was a nice touch as well. Then you meet another civ and everything goes straight to hell in a handbasket. How do I say this nicely...Diplomacy needs quite a few patches, you could say.By that I mean diplomacy literally does not matter in Civ 6. At all. Not even remotely. You might as well be in an always war game, for how much the ♥♥♥♥ing diplomacy actually matters in this game. You can trade with people, you can ally with them, you can gift them the shirt off your back, you can try to buddy up with them via the sickeningly lazy agenda system. They'll still declare war on you before turn 100. Even allied civs, because alliances literally don't matter in this game at all.In fact, it's so ridiculous that you can actually have civs you've never even met denounce you and declare formal war on you. When this happens, your own leader screen pops up in the DoW. Good QA testing there boys, I can see how you missed that blatantly obvious bug that happens in the ancient/classical era in almost every game.They try to make up for the fact that the AI is still as garbage as ever by adding Agendas. Now, this would be great if the agendas were an accountrement and not the entire AI system, but they're not. Nope, it's just a lazy replacement for actual intelligent politics. This civ will dislike you if X, but like you if not X. And that's it. No other factors come into play at all, or, if they do, they're miniscule at best. The AI's entire opinion of you is completely hingent on the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing lazy agendas they came up with in 5 seconds.The worst of which have to be the Aztec and Kongo, who will just hate you for little to no reason the turn they meet you. Because, yup, agendas are cool. In civ 4, there were hidden modifiers that would make civs further away from you care less about you. In civ 6, no such thing exists. Every civ will hate you every game no matter what, without exception.I mean, simply put, releasing a civ game with barely functional diplomacy is stupid. It just is. It's like releasing an FPS with broken guns, it's the bread and butter of the genre. There's literally no reason to play Civ 6 unless you want to win a domination victory every game. And that's ignoring the ♥♥♥♥tons of balance bugs and other major bugs. (Barbarians can raze capitals and if they do domination becomes unwinnable and the game crashes if you still try, for example)If EA pulled this♥♥♥♥♥♥ people would be frothing at the mouths, but for some reason when it's Civ it's fine to release a barely functional, shambling mess of a game with clear issues that would have been caught and fixed in about 5 seconds by any QA team worth their salt. Double standards in the gaming industry, I guess.Either way, this one's on the shelf until the next patch, which is inevitably going to be the first expansion considering the pattern of laziness here. Maybe my review will change then, maybe it won't, who knows?UPDATE: Welp, we're two patches in, and literally none of the problems I've brought up have been fixed or even worked on. Luckily, buildings in tundra areas now have snow on them! Thank god for that, right? Glad you guys put that in the game instead of fixing the blatantly obvious Cleopatra agenda contradiction that's been in the game since day ♥♥♥♥ing one. Or the blatantly garbage AI that even people who have defended the game have slammed six ways from Sunday that apparently you were stupid enough to showcase on a stream before release day. Or the warfare AI that's far below Civ 4, hell, it's far below even Civ 3.Or the agendas system that's STILL nothing more than a lazy excuse not to actually fix the AI. Isn't it convenient that the only agendas revealed before release day were the ones that actually looked like they could be promising or unique, and every other agenda is garbage, poorly-thought out at best and lazy at worst? Again, just look at the Cleopatra thing for a prime example of how honestly incompetent these guys are.I thought I was being too harsh in my initial review. Now I clearly know I should have been harsher. Civ 6 is straight up nothing more than a poor man's reskin of Civ 5, a Ubisoft-level buggy dumpster fire, plus a shameless ploy to try to get some cheap buys from the Civ 4 crowd. That's it. There is nothing new, innovative or novel in this game, and the few-and-far-between things that could have been cool are broken beyond all belief. It's disgusting, and I honest to God regret spending 80 dollars on this half-functional piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Seriously, I bought No Man's Sky, successfully refunded it, and still I regret that less than I do buying Civ 6. Dead ♥♥♥♥ing serious. And that's where you know we have a problem.UPDATE 2: We're now well into 2017, and I can count on one hand the number of Civ 6 games I've actually had the patience to complete. I tried again yesterday, and as far as I can tell the only major change has been doubling the load time and making the barbarians even more intolerable. Oh yeah, and shamelessly crapping out EA-tier DLC every couple months. Can't forget about that!			"

												Civilization 6 is an excellent game that suffers from some noticeable hiccups. I thoroughly enjoyed the game, but I would recommend waiting for some patches or the inevitable expansion pack. This is probably the best base Civ game, an once the patches roll out it will likely be one of if not the best Civ games. To summarize, think before you buy this game, and if you do not wish you buy it now, take a look once the patches/dlc comes out.			"

												The AI is absolutely atrotious in this game. I have played 2 full campaigns and quit in the middle of another because of the infuriating AI. They refuse to make peace unless you're on the verge of destroying you, end up denouncing you no matter what and just generally act stupid. I quit my most recent game since Japan refused to make peace unless I gave them a city (despite the fact that I destroyed their entire military) and then my citizens became unhappy because of the new war exhaustion system, which led to half of my empire revolting with nearly unkillable cavalry units pillaging all of my tiles. This game has so much going for it with the district system, interesting new unique civ abilities and units, and it's really great art style. The absolutely horrendous AI makes this game nearly unplayable in my opinion unless you play with friends, (I assume) which I haven't been able to do since none of them have bought this game. It's fun to a point but I can't recommend it.			"

												I'm about 140 hrs or so into this game and have been playing this series since Civ I, and unfortunately, because of the total lack of AI I have to not recommend this version of the  game (buy Civ V if you are new to this series).I don't want to rehash other comments but will say the AI in this version of  the game is absolutely terrible. For the first time in the Civ series I have started playing this game in hot seat mode (i.e. personally playing all active civilizations) in order to get any enjoyment out of the game. This version of the game has so much potential and I look forward to the time when the AI plays at a level equivalent to previous Civ versions (that's all I'm asking for) but until then people should not purchase it.

												This game is time consuming, but not the way you might think. It really spends a lot of time to calculate the AIs response. I feel like 70% of the time playing is spent waiting for the computer to finish its turn, 20% is spent doing the same repetetive task over and over and the last 10% is spent on making meaningful decisions.I found the other leaders can be quite flimsy. One turn a leader might scoff of your request to be friends, the next turn he comes running asking you to declare a formal friendship. Long standing good relations can be broken in a second, seems quite pointless to nurture them. Some polishing issues such as your cities bombardment ability is not considered a move, and it is easy to overlook an ability to bombard an attacking enemy before ending the turn.The game tries to be deep, but actually it basically plays itself for the most part. However, if you liked Civ 5 then you pretty much know what you will get.I would recommend a game like RimWorld instead to scratch that strategy game itch.Edit: I should have mentioned I enabled Quick Movement and Quick Battle. Despite of this, I found myself looking at ""please wait"" most of the time... I have a high end system, PCIe SSD, GTX 1080, 64GB RAM, fast CPU, all water cooled and overclocked.			"

												I recommend waiting until the game is patched several times. The AI is broken in multiple ways. In 1946 on Prince, the AI for every civilization was still building ancient era troops. At the beginning of the game, all of the civs immediately hate you.  It appears that the only way to play is to destroy them all. The AI strategy is this: denounce you as soon as you meet them, send hordes of religous units to convert your cities, build cities in stupid places right next to yours. The AI strategy completely revolves around just being annoying. The spy system is horrible. If you want to defend against it, you want to use spies for counter intelligence, the system is terrible. Every few turns you have to micro manage a whole pile of spies to decide which city/area they should go to. The only way to counter the annoying is to destroy everyone, which is made simple by the AI just being dumb and annoying.I wish I could get my money back. "

												            I can almost mark my life as to when each new installment of civ has come out. I have devoted thousands of hours since the first days of good old civ 1. Each was a vast improvment over the previous until civ 5 came out. It clearly missed the mark and the devs should have learned their lesson and rebooted. Alas, it isn't so based upon the boring mess that is civ 6. There are so many things missing and just plain done bady I hardly know where to begin... I won't bore you with a list of peeves, but here are a few: no ""sentry"" function for units (they either fortify or sleep). An enemy unit can (and does) walk right up to the unit and pillage the nearby tile. All you may get is a little icon on the side showing that enemies are in your territory. Spies are a huge pain in the butt as you have to reasign them every few turns by clicking through a whole process of seemingly pointless and few ""actions"". Even then your districts will frequently keep getting pillaged requiring several turns of rebuilding even if a spy is assigned to counterspying. There are too many options that require tiles to build so that having a truly great city is difficult at best because you quickly run out of room to build and still keep up with food production and housing. The housing is broken from the start as you will early on continuously get warnings that more housing is needed, more housing is needed, more hous.... etc. (PLEBES NEEDED!).             I expect the faithful gaming community will do the devs jobs for them and fix what is woefully broken, develop mods, and (hopefully) create entire total conversions that might make this game worth playing. As it has been released it is not only not worth $60 it isn't worth $30... I assume the pressure was on to release this game far too early and there just was not enough time to do it justice. A big reason I assume that time was a huge factor is the fact that not a single scenario or extra bit of additional content was released with the game. Huh??!!             My advice to the devs is this: if you cannot do civ right then please do not do it and send this game to others who will treat it with the respect that it rightly deserves. My second piece of advice to the devs is: on a fundemental level you need to admit that civ 5 was a mistake and scrap that entire line of thinking and go back and rebuild/ reboot an entirely new concept for the civ series (usng civ 4 and the many terrific mods as a jumping off point). Because you have not admitted that civ 5 was a mistake, you have created a pile of garbage with civ 6 that did not need to be so. Poor clay produces even worse bricks and this series will keep getting worse and worse if it does not catch itself, admit and own up to its recent mistakes and get back to the greatness that stayed with civ 4 and it's predecessors. This game is boring, basic, and even more cartoony than 5 which was bad enough...			"

Playing with random people is often waste of time because of instability, inability to rejoin game unless host is your friend, no penalties for leaving game, unimplemented ladder system etc. We need no more content, countries, units, etc.. We need AI and true mulitplayer support. I will not buy any single dlc unless they will do something to make this playable.			"

												Maybe after Workshop support and an expansion or two, this could be a good Civ game. In the meantime, it isn't. In fact, it's quite likely that even several expansions will be unable to fix what I'm convinced is a fundemantally broken game. None of the various systems in the game interact together well or function as intended. Take religion - it's a miserably grindy secondary combat layer with only three units. It can be won in two ways: getting the right random promotions on your apostles, or by simply declaring war and exterminating religious units with regular combat units and ignoring it altogether. Religion always defaults to miltiary combat, which is always a function of production. Or how about culture - culture and tourism have no effect on any other system except for initial border growth. Once your borders hit another civilization's borders, all border pressure stops and there's no way to affect those borders except, again, by reverting to military combat (with the exception of Poland, a DLC civ). Winning a culture victory amounts to pressing end turn a whole bunch of times until your arbitrary tourism number is higher than your opponent's arbitrary tourist number. There is no way to affect your opponents tourism number except by wiping them off the map - even nukes will not make enemy tourism decrease. They will, however, prevent your opponent from converting any more production into culture, thereby shaving off a few extra 'end turn' presses. Again, the easiest way to win a culture victory is by resorting to brute force. Again a system inevitably boils down to miltiary strength and production.Wonders have lackluster bonuses, take an incredible amount of very valuable production to build, and take up precious district and improvment tiles while providing zero tile yields of their own and deleting existing yields. They are never worth building over things that help your production or miltary. Districts are there to ostensibly make your cities more customizable, but they do the opposite. Because produciton is everything, you will build the same districts in the same order in every city, every time. Industrial districts -> commerical districts -> science districts -> anything else. Worse, the buildings you build in each district amount to different versions of the same building. There is almost no customization to what you can build within districts, with the exception of the art/archeological museum choice in cultural districts. But you don't need to build those anyways.Because most of the systems in the game are superfluous, the science and civic trees are similarly warped in favor of production and miltiary tech. In the tech tree you will beeline for commercial and industrial districts and buldings every time. Then you will pick up the units you need to steamroll. In the civics, most of the policy cards are fairly useless - it's the government types that really make a meaningful difference. While there is some choice in government types in the early game, the civic tree ultimately resolves itself into a race to get communism, which has a 10% global production bonus in a game where almost every bonus is small, local, and additive. After you get communism, the civics tree has no more meaningful choices left. A scientific victory involves building a whole bunch of spaceship parts which means, spoiler alert, it's nothing but a production check. Beakers themselves come primarily from scientific districts, which take gears to build and upgrade. Production, production, production. Diplomacy is..., well there are already tons of great critiques of the atrocious diplomacy system. Needless to say, it barely functions at all except as a constant annoyance and can be safely ignored in favor of, you guessed it, production. Influence is the only system in the game that actually has no ties to production whatsoever, but that's because it's barely in the game at all. Influence gain is totally static, arbitrary, and divorced from any other system, and it can only be affected by a handful of government choices and policy cards. Needless to say, you will never be able to hang onto any of the few good city states (read: those with production bonuses) without taking the influence policy card every time. Good thing every government has at least one guaranteed diplomacy slot for the only diplomacy card that matters!So gears are it. Nearly every other system or mechanic reduces to 'do you have enough gears/units to solve the problem'. This means every game is winnable exactly the same way - mindless city, industrial district, domestic trade route and unit spam until there's nowhere left to expand to. Your civilization choice only affects how long it takes you to hit that critical mass of gear deployment. So then what about war? Is the combat finally a fun experience?You already know the answer. The tactical AI is actually worse than the AI in Civ V, and there's a very simple reason for it: movement in Civ VI is much slower than in Civ V, and movement points are a lot more valuable. What this means in practical terms is that the AI has a lot less room for tactical screw-ups than it did in Civ V, and it isn't capable of doing anything but screwing up tactically. With the new movement-points system, the AI can move right up to your ranged units, but still not have enough movement points left to attack. That's right, in this game your archer blob doesn't even really need a few melee units for cover. I've only lost a city to an AI one time, and that was on my very first game. I've been able to beat deity games every game thereafter, and I am a thourougly mediocre Civ V player who could only occasionally take on anything higher than emperor. Even if the AI bothered to upgrade its units correctly it would still be completely unable to pose a significant threat because it simply cannot plan ahead enough to deal with the limited movement points. So far I have only described fundemental flaws in the various systems and mechanics that Civ VI has to offer, I haven't gone into any depth on the horrendous bugs or micromanagement issues that turn every game into a repetitive mindless chore. I've ignored these things for two reasons: there are already tons of reviews that identify these problems in great detail, and also it's likely that these problems can be fixed by patches or mods. But every major system in the game is broken at a core level. It is highly unlikely that these problems can or will ever be fixed by any DLC or expansion pack. They require not just a few balancing tweaks or extra attention and time, a real fix would involve a ground up systems redesign on a game-wide level. In other words, in order for Civ VI to be a good game it would actually have to become an entirely different game. That isn't going to happen. Save your money, save your time for something other than systems-testing broken software, and for the love of god take Firaxis off your 'guaranteed preorder' shortlist. The glory days of Civilization are long over, and the new Firaxis has definitively proven itself incapable of crafting a satisfying or interesting long-term strategy experience.			"

Maybe further down the line when all the expansions are out and the game is cheaper it might be worth it. Especially if in a few years' time the modders have been able to improve it. But for now, not worth it.			"

												Wait until the DLCs. The look is fine, the civs are decient, couple bugs still going unnoticed, and... that's all I can say.This was the same thought I had when civ 5 came out, but that all changed when it was complete.Oh, and next time, try adding a civ leader that's not base on a ♥♥♥♥ing meme (Ghandi).

												While I love this game andwill likely continue to play it in my spare time, I am also a diehard fanboy who has spent thousands of hours since I was 8 years old and I got Civ 3. If I were to recommend this, citystates should have more purpose. Commerce should have a winning condition, as it feels like an afterthought. Religious victory should be revamped from a quasi-combat mode. Additionally, science and culture victories are typically consolation prizes for almost getting a domination victory. Explaining tourism (the essential mechanic for a cultural victory) is hard, in part because I still do not fully understand what goes into its calculations.The lategame has been revamped fully, and is GREAT. All other iterations of Civ (thatI have played) basically had two or three contedners determined at the industrial age. With all of the different mechanics, every civilization should have a conceivable pathto a victory and most endings are intense.People complaining about the AI and diplomacy are fundamentally asking for too much. If the programmers for Civ 6 knew how to make sentient and adaptable AIs for such a complex ruleset, they should be working for IBM's Watson. That's not a sleight on the programmers at all: what I mean is that developing an answer to their complaints would be cutting-edge research. That being said, Diplomacy certainly seems to get exaggeratedly harder for the human player. In all, wait for moddable workshop content to be enabled, wait to see what the developers come up with for the expansions, and buy the micro-expansion civs and scenarios at a bundled and decreased price. It's great for the civ fan who has already bought it. But for the ones still holding out and reading reviews, you could likely hold out a bit longer and get a much better game.			"

												The AI is horrible.I find no pleasure in sending my musket (which I didnt rush, just upgraded tech randomly) to crush my enemies' bunch of WARROPRS. It just makes no sense to me. Heck, even the barbarians can keep up with the tech better.Sieging cities is also the easiest thing ever. The AI rarely fight back, and only focus on range units such as caltapults or archers, never the melee units surrounding it, even if they're at 30 HP or smt.Just...not fun at all.			"

												Right now the game is not worth the buy. Not exactly rushed out but definitely missing a whole lot of polishing. The UI is a mess often lacking plenty of information you really need. For instance an entire enemy force which sets foot on your territory; there is no alert for that so you have to check everything yourself. They tried to simplify the design of the interface but instead it merely leads to more looking and clicking till you may or may not find what you have been looking for.Also the AI is completely nonfunctioning, making decision without any sense (e.g. sending units into combat that will definitely not survive or sending them into combat to simply pull them back immediately). The AI is often not capable of negotiating fair trades. Most annoying, however, is the warmongering of the AI. At times declaring war when you just met them and have not even build a second city, but at least declaring war after a while for no apparent reason. The latter happened in ever single of my games. A few times I even have been at war with someone who I have not even met. On top of this several quite annoying bugs (e.g. units with no orders and unused move points are simply forgotten without notification until you remember yourself Oh, there was that archer I haven't moved for 20 turns.) Also the loading times are way too long. I stopped the time at 1 minute and 40 seconds, playing on an SSD.To be entriely honest, the new additions (e.g. districts, policies and such) are nice and cool but feel more like DLC. There is too little new content and too many steps backwards to justify the full price.			"

												Unpolished, lacking in features, and even the features present are not well presented or explained. Tech tree feels a lot more empty now than ever before. It feels like they got rid of old features like 'health' and 'happiness' only to replace them with 'housing space' and 'amenities', both of which lack the intuitive ui and depth of the old, and really there seems to be no way to dig deeper into or look comprehensively at either feature than just looking at an individual city screen. Also is it just me or is amenities broken? It went down to like -4 in one of my cities once when I wasn't paying attention, but the penalties were the same as at -1 amenities, and apparently had been for a few dozen turns. So you can completely disregard happiness as long as you're willing to sacrifice 5% of your yields. Enemy AI is bad, even by Civ standards. Last game's homicidal Ghandhi was endearing, but now all leaders are ridiculously aggressive. The only time in 5 playthroughs I have had an AI attempt diplomacy with me was one civ who was at war with the other 4 that I knew. After he sent me a gift and praised me, and we had traded some resources (on unfair terms but no one else was trading with me and I needed gold), he then declared a surprise war on me, and never invaded. Which I am guessing is what happened between him and all other civs too, because although they were all at war for centuries, no cities ever changed hands. AI nations are impossible to trade with on terms that are not extortionate, and even bending over backwards and accepting unfair trade deals, I still have never been able to go beyond trade deals with an AI nation, even when I try to play a relatively peaceful style and deal with other more pacifisty nations. Also the only diplomatic attitude ui is emojis next to the leader's portraits, with no real explanations as to why. Every game so far, just about every nation I have met has gone to the frowny emoji within a few turns of contact, no matter how I handle things. Even better, after AI declare and subsequently bungle or abandon their wars against you, surrender never really makes much sense either. Once Japan totally surprised me, and before I could bring the bulk of my army and navy back to my unfortified and undefended capital it was surrounded by ~5 strong japanese units with more coming ashore. But no, they just kind of sat there. One of them pillaged one improvement. The rest just kind of sat on improved tiles. ONE unit attacked my capital city ONE time, and did some damage. Though if they had all attacked relentlessly, it easily would have fallen with minimal losses for the invaders. I bought an archer unit and literally built walls for like 10 turns, and bombarded the still stationary army. Once all the units in range were dead (~5 killed, ~5 remaining), Japan surrendered and gave me tons of gold for 30 turns. None of their units really went anywhere after the war either, the ones that had landed and were sitting on the border of my capital city still sat there until I decided to destroy Japan a few dozen turns later. Since that first time, every single time I have been invaded has played out in roughly this way, if they even make it to my cities. Barbarian marauders wrecking tiles are more of a pain than a serious invasion by the world's strongest AI armies, which is strange because the barbarians are AI too, and quite decent. I watched another country invading me lose most of their army to barbarian quniteremes trying to cross the ocean without naval escort, with the survivors mopped up by barbarian units on shore and 1 spearman I had been exploring the area with (who witnessed the slaughter from shore). I am guessing with the number of AI counties that declare war on me, and then offer me very favorable surrender conditions a few dozen turns later, with literally no fighting between us, have also managed to lose their invasion forces this way (?). AI is a little better at defending in wars than it is in attacking, so to keep things interesting I usually end up invading people after their first or second failed wars against me. Also the game just feels a lot smaller, in terms of city building options (districts were a really cool concept, but the ballooning costs really killed it for me, I didn't even understand what was happening until someone here explained it). The maps and armies also feel a lot smaller than in previous games. Growth feels a lot slower and more grinding too. On a huge map with 3 civs, tons of room for explosive growth, after 300+ turns of growth in these optimum conditions on regular difficulty, I have not seen any civ rise beyond a technoligically stagnant backwater that only really excels at one thing. On my huge map like this, around the year 1600, one civ had very advanced culture plicies, but was wayyyy behind in all aspects of development, the other had no special characteristics, and was far behind me(and the times) in technology, size, etc. I don't mention the third one because I believe they were wiped out by barbarians? There was a message about their death very early on, and unless they spawned rightttt next to one of the other civs, on a huge continents map, no civ killed them off. And in a more densely populated world this is even worse. I was kind of worried about the series becoming too dumbed down in Civ V, even though I eventually came to love that game after a few playthroughs. And if I can do the same with this one after a few patches and playthroughs I will amend this review. But right now, it seems the game has been dumbed down too far for my liking, and has lost that magic 'one more turn' feeling, which I can honestly say I never felt after the first few dozen turns in any of my playthroughs so far. Instead of becoming more fast paced as technology and society advance like in past games, if anything this game bogs itself down in ballooning unit and district costs in the late game, and there is no real feeling of sense or a narrative behind the actions of late game civs, or other civs at any point in history, really. I have yet to see a coalition of religions or ideologies work together or fight one another, which both civ 5 and 4 pulled off VERY well. Here, the mid to late game seems much like the early game, constant minor wars that go nowhere, and slow grinding expansion. Also sometimes someone will win a cultural or religious victory, and it can be you if you actually reach for either with any amount of effort. 3/5 of my complete playthrough have just ended with score victories, twice for me, and once for greece, who got a ton of points for advanced policies, but really wasn't relevant or powerful in any other way. None of these victories felt like winning though. I got a lot more familiar with how to manage districts, and am now playing for a science victory, but I am not sure if I am even going to finish this game. So far I just took over 2 nice big continents, and am now spamming campus districts and their buildings, while trying to hold off the religious emissaries from all civilizations who have not declared war on me. Thankfully for science, none of my enemies have been able to overcome my masterful defense strategy of: Building walls in a few cities. I don't garrison ANY cities, and right now have 2 spearmen and a warrior. The year is ~1700. When there is a threat of invasion I buy a ranged unit in the city. I should really just declare war on them so they stop sending the missionaries into my lands. Also wtf, religion mechanics never well explained, and basically no useful ui on them. To see the breakdown of city religion I need to select a missionary, but sometimes this does not even work. Also instead of the pressures from civ 5, the most indicator you will ever get of how things are going is an arrow. up or down. That tells you which religion is winning. I haven't even tried espionage because honestly I haven't needed it at all, but I doubt it adds much to the game.			"

The AI trading is bugged and can be exploited to make them give up luxuries for close to no gold in returnThis game needs at least another 6 months of dev time. "

												I want to like the game but cannot recommend it. I am a big fan of all the earlier Civ's. Civ 5 was great and just needed a few fixes.  Civ 6 addreses most of these pretty well...but then overwhelms the game with rather dull stuff. You can spend the whole game working on one city with endless districts, buildings within districts, harbors, etc. Religion gets worse and more complicated yet less consequential. AI is not very good and diplomacy is unpredictable. Without goint into detail, Civilization should be a macro level game with the growth and disappearance of empires which the old ones did pretty well. There was a lot of good tension in trying to nail down some significant wonders, get a few small allies and build a competent army for mostly offense or defense. You picked nations depending on what you want to do and sized up competing ones carefully. Many were dangerous. Civ 6 is frankly dull. The tension is gone and you feel like you are playing a version of Sim City. Nothing you do matters very much. It is all 2% and 5% improvements. You have even more to manage and warnings about everything. Housing, amenities, special resources and so on to manage. Yet, there are few benchmarks to really know if you are doing well. The map is really dull and hard to read and hard to tell you've done an improvement. I don't know who beta tested but I wonder if they even liked Civilization for it's core ideas. I cannot believe they accepted the map system as is. It's a mildly interesting game but not much fun and well...that is the point of buying these, right?I actually have gone back to Civ5 which I love (along with Civ4). The reason is the tension and relatively easy managment of Civ5. Every turn and every activity matters, especially on the higher levels. You NEED the Great Library to catch up on tech or you have to choose between making a combat unit or a market because your gold is running low. You may need to settle a war because you are falling behind on other stuff. Everything you choose to do on a small level and on a big level like deciding on a cultural or scientific victory as well as which two opponents must be eliminated...matters. Civ6 is just really really dull...but nice looking. The best part is the opening video and then it goes downhill.			"

												Easily the best Civilization game at launch that still seems to fall flat in regards to diplomacy and general AI. Culture, Religion, and Science victories are all quite fun yet I seem to be forced into Domination most games just because the AI declares war on me a turn after I meet them. I would wait until the game is ironed out before really diving in and sinking hundreds of hours though.Other than the AI, I feel like production is nerfed. I can move so far into the tech and civic trees while still struggling to create districts/wonders even into the late game. I feel as if this is a bug in the industrial district not actually adding what it says it adds to a city's production.Again, wait for the game to be ironed out with patches, (hopefully free) DLC, and the inevitable expansions.Update - Late Nov.First Patch cleaned up the interface and made it slightly easier to see some things that previously needed mods to see (like culture border growth), however the AI is still extremely lackluster. Wait for more patches.			"

												This game includes some nice changes like continents and eureka moments but overall is a step down from CIV 5.Some poins which make it worse are :-Unit animation makes it so a player is able to queue his unit's attack by clicking fast, your units cant move while animations are going on. (even those who aren't under attack)-Tall city building is almost imposible, once your cities reach 10/12 pop cap is almost a dead end until late game-Terrain change is silly, with having to require full turns to enter hill or forest and no zone of control makes it harder to defend.-Graphics are a huge stepdown from civ 5 and performance wise seems about the same-You only need 1 strategic resource in order to have multiple units, 1 horse can make it so you can have 20+ war chariots or horsemen			"

Were they able to conquer a city and start their own Civ, they would surely win the game everytime.-Diplomacy; China declares sneak-attack on me, captures my city. I then recapture it and fight back in their territory, taking one of their cities. All Civs declare me a warmongering menace and denounce me. (I don't recall World War 2 ending this way...)All comments are based on initial release. I do expect improvements over time - but I'd really like it if the developer would spend a few weeks ironing out Diplomacy. I'm suprised to see it actually get worse from Civ 5's 'DENOUNCE-AGGEDON.'			"

												Sid  civilization six is disappointing. It takes an inordinate amount of time to complete a sequence or a mission and the finished result is extremely anticlimactic. also, It's not clear at what point the game decides you won or you've lost. It seems like at an arbitrary moment the game just stops and declares you the winner or the loser with no clear-cut answer that can be found on the stats.I like that they’ve gone into detail on city building, probably to compete with the other games, as are the cartoonish features of the upgrade, which were not there in version V, but they’ve sacrificed the original concept of the game to achieve this..

												Great Game but...A lot of people have complained about the AI (it's not that bright, but thats okay because i'm not very good at the game) the changes to things like diplomacy and districts (I quite like them) but you'll notice it's still a thumbs down.It's the crashes. The game has a number of bugs involvings game length and numbers of cities owned that don't just probably produce a crash but in fact will absolutely guaranteed cause a crash.  10 Hours into your epic game, when you get to a certain turn the game will crash when you hit next turn *every time*On the road to your domination victory, you take an enemy city ready to raze it, game crashes.  Now if you take any city, anywhere for the rest of the game it *will* crash, no way around it.I found myself really enjoying the game but several saves were completely ruined by the fact I cannot continue, essentially automatic invisible declarations that your time is wasted because you didn't lose but it sure as hell wont let you or anyone else win.Sadly i'd put in too many hours to get a refund and really I don't want one, I want this game to work because it is fun but i've not played it since shortly after release because starting any game with the state it's in now is just asking for a frustrating crash right when things start getting to their best.

												Was a huge fan of Civ 5....played it for a long time...this seems like a childlike downgrade from the previous games. The graphics are derpy and cartoonish, the AI seems very sensitive and easily gets offended at minor things. They took a lot out of this game and replaced it with minimal shiny objects which are pleasent for two or three turns until you have a large landmass of pointless things. The biggest thing that bothers me is there is no exploration like the old civ games...at the start you fart to your left and meet another leader, grunt to your right and bump into another, the third walks into your borders on turn 4...and thats on a huge map. Huge map is now roughly half the size of the old ones by the looks of things, making it seem very quick and pushed. The city states are more independant on this one and not as ""please protect me"" which is good...but when you offer to work with one...2 or 3 other leaders sulk because they can't addapt to being civil with one another...Ghandy still loves nukes and being a C-U-N-T.Overall, this needs to be revised in a few areas, stop being an elementary school learning software and buff up the realism of leaders being selfish, self preservative a-holes democracy controlling the media...would like to see the visuals ammended to being more realistic and the AI being more human-like alongside some good old fashioned Civ and not the sims 5 which is cautious to offend anyone. 4/10...

 DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE NEW TO CIV I will only be touching on the changes in respect of Civ VPROS-the Civics are a cool idea-Leader animations are pretty dope-the new particle system is amazing and also the new sounds -multiplayer isn't terrible, unlike civ 5 -major improvement to the spy system CONS-Firstly, and the most annoying issue by far is that the developers honestly don't even touch the A.I, they have been dumb as a brick for the past 3 games and i have not seen an improvment, almost like the devs don't care about challenging the older fans of the series. -turn 5 in a game and 3 A.I players declare war on me... wait for it....

												A straight downgrade from Civ 5. Maybe it will follow the civ tradition and have every expansion back be a great overhaul of the system, but as it currently stands this game simply isn't worth full price.Visuals: the most subjective category, but I find this game wholly unappealing artistically. The Civ leaders look like pixar rejects and the landscapes are bland and uninspired.UI: The UI is a mess, with often incredibly important information hidden or poorly represented. It also takes an egregious amount of clicks to accomplish simple tasks, like re-assigning spies to a location they are already at. Individually this wouldn't matter as much but the number and rapidity of it across a 300+ turn game is very aggravating.Music: Seems like it's mostly variations of the same track modified over the years. After my first game I was already muting in favor of a playlist in the background. Also the quotes are garbage.AI: Arguably the most incompetent released in the franchise, at least this decade. If you played civ 5 at X difficulty you can basically bump it up by 1-2 in Civ 6 because outside of early game rushes the AI is completely worthless at waging a war. Also, AI are pretty much insane, and establishing reliable relationships with one is all but impossible. Bonus points; even if you do succeed in this, they will still arbitrarily declare war on you just because. There is no late-game diplomacy akin to the U.N., so by industrial period most everyone dislikes you but it doesn't actually affect anything, turning the end of the game into a monotonous slog.Game mechanics: Aside from the fact that the game is still significantly unbalanced, there are many problems plaguing this title. The change to workers being charged base means you have to waste time spamming them into your build queues, but doesn't really add anything to the game in terms of enjoyment or skill, it's just micro-management for its own sake. Wonders take a ridiculous time to build (50-80 turns) and take up a tile, so they're often not worth it at all. Districts, what should have been the great new addition to the title, have mostly been relegated to a few essentials that are spammed forever due to the aforementioned imbalance. Lastly, the removal of any kind of happiness or corruption mechanic means that every empire will go wide every single game because there are no reasons not to. While going tall was a bit too reliable in Civ 5, swinging hard the other way isn't actually better.At the end of the day, I kick myself for buying this game so soon after launch. Take my advice and just tide yourself over with something else until they bother to fix this mess, because until then it's really not worth your time or money.			"

												They fixed something that wasn't broken. Playing in disctricts is not interesting. And there is nothing more really new added. Seriously, they split sciense tree to civic tree and science tree. So what? Changed how you change goverments. Etc. etc... It doesn't really improve the game. So the only really new concept is city building. But what the really lacks is sane AI, good troop and economic balance. Yes. This game is boring, UNBALLANSED and with ridiculously stupid AI.First Civilization 5 was much more Civilization than this game. Shame.			"

												I will answer one and simple question: should you buy this gorgeous, intriguing and filled with innovations game NOW? The answer is NO, and here's why: crippled AI, balance issues, interface issues, tons of things are not explained properly, some nasty bugs, lack of map filters, unit lists, nearby enemy notifications etc.Civ superfans like myself have already got the game and enjoying it, for the rest it would be wise to wait for several updates and pick this 9/10 game when it's polished and discounted.

												Great Game but...A lot of people have complained about the AI (it's not that bright, but thats okay because i'm not very good at the game) the changes to things like diplomacy and districts (I quite like them) but you'll notice it's still a thumbs down.It's the crashes. The game has a number of bugs involvings game length and numbers of cities owned that don't just probably produce a crash but in fact will absolutely guaranteed cause a crash.  10 Hours into your epic game, when you get to a certain turn the game will crash when you hit next turn *every time*On the road to your domination victory, you take an enemy city ready to raze it, game crashes.  Now if you take any city, anywhere for the rest of the game it *will* crash, no way around it.I found myself really enjoying the game but several saves were completely ruined by the fact I cannot continue, essentially automatic invisible declarations that your time is wasted because you didn't lose but it sure as hell wont let you or anyone else win.Sadly i'd put in too many hours to get a refund and really I don't want one, I want this game to work because it is fun but i've not played it since shortly after release because starting any game with the state it's in now is just asking for a frustrating crash right when things start getting to their best.

												Was a huge fan of Civ 5....played it for a long time...this seems like a childlike downgrade from the previous games. The graphics are derpy and cartoonish, the AI seems very sensitive and easily gets offended at minor things. They took a lot out of this game and replaced it with minimal shiny objects which are pleasent for two or three turns until you have a large landmass of pointless things. The biggest thing that bothers me is there is no exploration like the old civ games...at the start you fart to your left and meet another leader, grunt to your right and bump into another, the third walks into your borders on turn 4...and thats on a huge map. Huge map is now roughly half the size of the old ones by the looks of things, making it seem very quick and pushed. The city states are more independant on this one and not as ""please protect me"" which is good...but when you offer to work with one...2 or 3 other leaders sulk because they can't addapt to being civil with one another...Ghandy still loves nukes and being a C-U-N-T.Overall, this needs to be revised in a few areas, stop being an elementary school learning software and buff up the realism of leaders being selfish, self preservative a-holes democracy controlling the media...would like to see the visuals ammended to being more realistic and the AI being more human-like alongside some good old fashioned Civ and not the sims 5 which is cautious to offend anyone. 4/10...

												When I saw that they had announced a new CIV game and I then saw that it wasn’t going to be some silly space or other type of strategy game I was ecstatic. Then when I got to some of the screenshots I was less so. Once I saw the new art style I was less excited and even considering ignoring the game completely, but that was a stupid idea as you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, and to be fair it has grown on me. Now this game is great right now and works very well. There are some things that are missing that use to be in CIV 5, but mainly they’re not a problem for me. The only thing that I miss is the World Congress. There are some minor features that I never used, but were very popular and to be fair not hard to add into the game that should have been there, like being able to name cities. With that being said though there are many, many more things that have been added that make the game better. I now feel that all the different types of victory are much more achievable and interesting. Along with the improved victories there are also some change to the policies and civics that are amazing. They have now moved items that are less tech related and more civic related into their own tree, this makes everything a lot, lot better as it means that less time is being wasted on techs that aren’t really techs. The new policy system is great. Instead of choosing a tree to follow you instead choose a government style like democracy, fascism or communism and then you have a certain amount of policies you can assign and type of policies depends on the government style. So a fascist government will be able to have more military policies than the others. I also like the new way roads are built. And one of the last things that I love before I move onto the negatives is the new way that wonders are built. This new system is great and makes displaying and showing the wonders off amazing. Instead of it just saying that you’ve built a wonder it will now give you a short movie of its construction along with a quote. This is great. And the new levelling for units is great.Now for some of the negatives. There are some minor features that are missing that should be in, like the city naming, and other such things, but I never really used most of these so I haven’t noticed their disappearance. I do miss the world congress. And they still haven’t really fixed AI war. They’re more aggressive when they declare war on you, which I like, but when you ally with them they’re not much use. They’re defence is a lot better though. And the new builders are interesting, I like the way they work, but I also find that I am missing out on a lot of work tiles because I can’t find them. And this use to be fixable as you would just set a work to auto and they’d hook it up.So all in all I would recommend this to anyone. Whether they’ve played CIV 5 or never even played a CIV I would still recommend it to them. To be honest with all the recent games that have come out I’ve been disappointed, but this one of the only ones that I don’t regret it at all.Great game.Great new features and systems.Some minor issues.9/10 "

												I like it overall, although it still has bugs, supposedly buggy multiplayer (haven't tried it yet myself), etc.Pros:- I like the new city and district building system overall (although dunno, having to build wonders, except for some, is kinda meh)- I like that there are different wars which reduce warmongering status- Return of governments (Although personally, I'd rather give them just bonuses, and where players could choose their government positions regardless of the 'color' of position cards)- More inter-civ diplomatic stuff- Love me the soundtrack, especially the main theme and Kalinka song russians haveNeutrals:- Graphics are more cartoony. Not bad, but dunno, most leaders look silly!Cons:- Bugs. (Example: Leaders telling me I'm a warmonger despite someone else declaring a war on me, never capturing any city)- It can get slow in the late game.- Could use more soundtracks- Most wonders could still be built 'in the city centre' instead of around the city, since you could probably use those other areas for more things.

												Longtime CIV player (started with 3 and have played the series religiously since). While I think there is a solid basis here and it is a fun game, the lack of mod tools makes me unwilling to recommend the game to CIV 5 players. It doens't offer enough new content on its own to replace CIV 5 and without the ability to mod it myself and play others' mods, it really wasn't worth the purchase to me.That being said, it's certainly not a bad game and was released in a more finished and interesting state than most civ games are. If the lack of workshop content isn't a big deal to you, go ahead and pick it up. I had fun for a few games and ended up going back to CIV 5 and 4 again. I'll be back to give CIV 6 a more honest go once the mod tools and workshop are up.			"

												Civ VI looks and sounds beautiful; it is a potentially great game with lots of interesting features (districts etc). Sadly, the current experience is tarnished by poor AI and a long list of bugs.Examples of AI stupidity:- Completely ignoring undefended cities and moving units around uselessly- Sending unescorted settlers directly at my army in the middle of a war- Ignoring large empty areas of land rather than settling there- Not bothering to scout the map (I can still find ungathered tribal villages far from my civilisation in the late game)Examples of bugs:- Seeing your own leader declare war on himself- Instant war with a newly-met AI without any declaration of war from either side- Being able to bomb or nuke your own AI allies with no adverse reaction from them- Seeing declarations of war against city states which no longer existThere are plenty of aspects that feel unfinished (you can rename units but not cities; you can queue research but not production; various UI quirks) but these are minor compared to AI performance and bugs.It baffles me that sites such as IGN and PC Gamer are awarding 90%+ scores for the current version of the game. For now, the game plays like a pre-release alpha build; lots of potential, but also plenty of rough edges. I presume that the bugs will be gradually resolved in future patches, although I’m not sure how much further work the developers will put into AI. Judging by its current state, it appears that the developers are not taking AI seriously.Due to the state of the AI, the game is a much better experience in multiplayer than singleplayer. I have experienced a few desyncs in multiplayer, but aside from that I have had some fun playing against a human opponent. If you came for a challenging singleplayer experience, you may want to wait and see if the situation is improved by patches or expansion packs.To Firaxis, if you’re reading: I would value better AI for this game much more than any other new content, such as new civilisations/scenarios/et cetera.

												I gave Civ VI another play through and I still don't recommend it because the game is too narrowly focused on starting location-- it just doesn't have enough balance.  In Civ V, getting the best start location in multiplayer helped, but in Civ IV, you NEED certain tiles near your start location.  Since chaining Eureka bonuses relies havily on certain resources being nearby, you need a good start to get tech boosts; without those, it will take you twice as long to research a tech as someone who might just have better access near their start location.  Tech progression alone dramatically increases the effect of a good or bad start location compared to Civ V.  Similarly, not having a certain strategic resource near your starting location could hamstring your ability to build an army (or even defend against barbarians) for an entire era since some eras have multiple units requiring the same resource (nitre, being key for a while).  The new amenities feature replacing happiness seems under-developed, and success in amenities depends heavily on your starting location.  If you get a bad start and it will be impossible to keep your people happy no matter what your play style, and you'll eventually get rebel barbarians spawning in your territory.  War weariness then makes the game un-fun to play-- in the old games, when things weren't going your way, you could at least try to do some damage, maybe wrest a city or two from an adversary-- here, the war weariness will produce barb units in your territory faster than your best cities could produce similar units, and these will pillage every tile while your army is away fighting (or even winning) a war.  The time scale is also off-- multiplayer quick games on small maps in Civ V could usually be finished in four hours if people kept the game moving.  In Civ VI, it takes drastically more turns to produce anything, creating even slower gameplay; this extended production scale not only increases the effectiveness of units versus building a strong civ, but it also makes even quick games take longer, which means most multiplayer won't be able to be completed in a single afternoon.  The formula for unit disbanding is much more unforgiving in this game, such that if your treasury ever dips even slightly below zero, you may lose several units a turn, instantly eliminating the effort of some twenty or thirty turns it took to produce those units.  This is not at all fun-- especially because a single spy might steal from the treasury, destroying an army in one chain reaction of disbanding events.  There are a number of things I would classify as bugs-- a heavy drone of mechanized units versus other background sounds or unit sounds not playing on some zoom levels-- both are jarring.  Also, in single-player the AI will ask for peace nearly every trun, or to send you some emisarries, no matter how many times you say no; if there were an option to turn off the cutscenes, this might be tolerable, but the repetition quickly eats away any enjoyment of interacting with AI civs in general.

Posted: November 6, 2016
												Before I start let me add a little to what you know about me and Civ VI (beyond the 178 hours I'd played so far). I've played a lot of Civ V too. In Civ VI I've played mostly China (as I prefer to build up first and attack later. “Every battle is won before it’s ever fought.” — Tsun Tsu.) and (as I write this) I wrote the bulk of the Chinese Stategy section on http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Chinese_(Civ6). Now on with the review.Let me start by saying that though Civ VI is not perfect and has some bugs it's a great game. I'm sure they'll fix the bugs – they have a legacy to protect, by which I mean that if they don't fix the bugs they'll make less sales of expansions and other DLC's and version VII too.There's a stylistic change to the gameplay from Civ V:It promotes micromanaging considerably more than V. I'll explain later, which you can skip if you're not interested in the details.It poses horrendous choices all the time, trade-offs between the 4 X's exploration, expansion, exploitation and extermination, which is great.You're still open to concentrate on any one of them and they each have benefits – none is a necessarily a bad choice, but the devil is in the details, as it should be. I know a lot of players strictly min-max, but I think of it not as finding the 'right' style, but as finding the way to make my style work, which promotes the opportunity for replays (as usual). Maybe next time I'll play a civ suited to a conquest rampage from near the start.Exploration is very random. It's quite possible to sail 80% of the way around the globe without finding anything but territory. Then the next game you might find 8 tribal villages and 8 City States right on your doorstep.It nearly always pitches you into combat from the very beginning. Barbarians are aggressive and can be so numerous that certain start positions are impractical. It's not uncommon for three Barbarian scouts to approach your city from different directions and even one barbarian encampment that has started spawning units to attack you can be difficult to deal with. Presuming that you stop one of the scouts that still leaves you with two encampments spawning a unit every few turns – a nightmare that you can either deal with by wasting way too many turns on defences leaving you centuries behind your opposition or that you can deal with by not dealing with it, by starting over. I normally hope for a peninsular start but even when surrounded by open land on all sides sometimes you get lucky and aren't swamped. It's very random, which is good, but I'd have preferred random with less barbarian encampments overall.Be warned the islands map isn't anything like archipelago. There will always be several continents that take up the bulk of the map, but without land you can't build most of the districts, so I guess guess starting on a small island wouldn't be suitable. However, that brings me to my major gripe, the largest map isn't large enough (for my taste).The #onemoreturn thing is alive and well and it will keep you playing into the wee small hours if you let it, so I'd advise setting an alarm clock or a timer plug that automatically shuts down your monitor. It's a far more difficult game to play well than Civ V, because the choices require more commitment by which I'm mostly referring to the districts. It's too soon to tell whether it's more difficult to win.Details follow (i.e. if you're not interested then here's where to stop reading)The micromanaging is mainly about techs and civics. In order to maximise speed to a target tech/civic when you don't already have the boost without sacrificing efficiency it's necessary to research them enough that when you get the boost the tech/civic will immediately complete, but not research any more – and therein lies the issue – there's no warning when you've reached 50% (or 40% for China). So every turn you need to check the two timers (and for China it can be difficult to tell whether you've passed 40%. 50% is easier but still not a certainty). It would be easy to implement such a warning so hopefully they'll add it soon.The barbarians also promote micromanaging. You can't afford to just explore randomly with your first unit or follow the path of least resistance or scrape the coastlines to see as much of the sea as possible – you have to try to concentrate on revealing land and stay relatively close to home and between your city and open territory to give yourself some chance to block barbarian scouts.

												I could not finish a single session without getting bored and losing interest mainly because of the following issues:The AI is terrible and frustratingly stupid. Diplomacy is broken that you are better off playing against barbarians whose actions are, at least, justified unlike the AI Civs. You will certainly get denounced just for not doing what they like like a bunch of 5-year-olds.AI interaction is really bad. The dialogs are almost always not suited with the situation they are in. They are mostly in a rude and demanding attitude even when surrendering or asking for a favor for free. Gone are the sorry attitudes of AIs from Civ V.Religion is pointless. No United Nations / World Congress - a big blow to the diplomacy, which is nonexistent anyways.The cartoony graphics does not really appeal to me. I find it lazy and not really a huge step forward from Civ V.The game presents you a nice feature of custom-building your Civ V with different districts then trolls you by removing your control over when and where you can build your roads. Aparrently, trade caravans handle the civil works on the sides. A minor issue to most maybe.This is perhaps a good game broken by dysfunctional AI and by removing features present in the previous games that are not broken.			"

												Firstly, it seems like a lot of the negative reviews reflect on disliking grinding or challenge and blaming it on AI. Of course, the AI isn't perfect in Civ 6, but neither is reality. It has improved though. Relationships with other countries that expand beyond trade take hard work, as they do in a world where nations with major cultural differences are constantly competing for resources. You have the occasional irrational leader that will declare war for no reason, and beg for peace and mercy 5 turns later. That SEEMS like bad AI, but again, how is that different from reality? In reality, it seems like a waste for the US to spend so much money and resources on North Korea when we should be 100% focused on Russia and China, but it's required.I found Civ 6 a welcome upgrade. Off the bat, I wasn't wishing for more and waiting for DLC like I was with Civ 5. This is a very complete game that leaves very little, for me, to wish for. I think the most impressive feat is that the game is far more complicated than it's predecessor, but SEEMS a bit more shallow and less chaotic. Even after countless hours of playing previous Civs, even coming back after a year long sabbatical usually requires me relearning some fundamentals or even having to tab between a Wiki at times. In Civ 6, I played for hours and never even thought about hitting a help button or using a guide. It just made sense, and more importantly, my first game didn't feel like a ""test game"" before I ""get serious"". I have yet to dive into multiplayer, but from what I'm reading there seems to be a lot of badly needed improvements there. If you're a Civ fan, this should be a no-brainer. If you've never played a Civ game before, then it might be wise to start with Civ V if $60 is what's keeping you away. Then again, I feel like VI has a warmer welcome to new players than previous games in the series.			"

The UI is nice and clean and the visuals are great. The only con I see so far is that the mini map is not exactly clear. It's hard to see on there what's going on (one of the city states I met has almost the same color as the rest of the map, making it almost invisible on the mini map).			"

												Trying to keep it short and sweet.  Moving from Civ V as it is now to Civ VI feels like a step back.  It's been a long time since Civ V came out and my memory of playing Civ V as the ""vanilla"" release is a little old, but Civ V still felt like a better game at that time.  If I assigned a number too it, Civ VI feels more like Civ 4.7.  It feels like they tried to add/adjust too much and it doesn't work quite right.  Things that should be easy are needlessly complicated and things you would like to have more control over are either hidden 3 steps deep in menus or you can't really have any effect on it.  Bottom line is so far it seems interesting but not really great.  It will probably turn into a good game eventually, but if you're comming over from Civ V, you will probably be disapointed.1st Edit:  I play mostly hot-seat with the family so some of my comments will be based on the idea of several human players, huge maps, max number of civs, and long games.  Usually play off-line so as a group, we have a bunch more hours that it shows.Civ 6 adds lots of nice stuff, like the ability to play hot-seat without having to download a mod among the first things I really like.  It has dozens of small changes that I really like for example, when you are making a trade route, it shows which city-states have that as a quest so you don't have to look between menus or you can levy city-state units for money.  But for every one of these nice things they did, they left something nice out, like a menu to find all your units, a cue for building stuff, a slider for how many city-states are in a game (I love having a bunch, some people don't) or the ""what will make this trade work"" button.  It really seems incredibly random what was added and what missed the cut.  Was there any feedback on this from players?  If there was, it must have been from a group that plays in one specific way.I have much beef with the information system.  The pop-ups on the right side in Civ 5 that showed you everything that was going on.  They technically have that in Civ 6, but they contain almost no information, they are super small, and you have to hover over them to figure out what they are...they aren't simple and easily understood like the Civ 5 ones. Pop-ups are horrible.  Find a village and get the rewared...pops up and gone so fast, you have no idea what you got.  This goes along with the general thing of every menu item is sooooo small that you can barely make them out.  The interface is a definate downgrade from Civ 5.The artwork and style of the game makes it feel like a Disney game for little kids.  No more cut-aways to amazing artworks or awesome wonders of the world...just a little graphic that looks like a 6 year drew it.  It was pontificated that that may be to allow people with older systems to play it, well sucks for those of us that have nice new systems that want a great game.  The leaders don't even move or talk.  Major bummer.  It feels like they went cheap.The policy tree is neat concept, but it really falls flat for replayability as it becomes like the science tree vice the huge myriad of choices you had from Civ 5 where you could completely ignore a tree, just get 1 policy from it, or fill it out depending on how your game was going, who you were playing, etc.  Lastly, I want to address a common comment that Civ 6 as released is better than Civ 5 vanilla as released, followed by ""in a couple of years 6 will be better than 5.""  What you think your saying is ""wait and everything will be awesome.""  What I'm hearing is ""I should have waited 2 years to buy this game when it's actually an upgrade from Civ 5, or not bought it at all.""			"

												Well a couple of days of game play and I have to say this game sucks just as bad as their failure Beyond Earth. I'm not a gamer geek but I swear this looks like a ramped up version of Beyond Earth which I tore apart in reviews for the same reasons I'm ripping this waste of money. I have thousands and thousands of hours on Civ 1 - 5 and pretty much mastered all of them. I had a great time playing them from the start, learning the new portions of each game and developing multiple strategy's for each game. This game however is boring and tedious just like Beyond Earth was. The cities grow just as slow as BE if not slower, the limited movements make moving an army 10 tiles a tedious BS proposition. If you want to move armies a long distance they should have a setting for how many women are needed so when all your soldiers die of old age on the way to their enemies cities and then the 3rd of 4th generations can actually engage the enemy. The ability to choose what you want to developed is even more limited than in BE. Notice I don't compare this game to civ 5 as there is no comparison to be made.  They talked about an entirely new interface and game engine and that they did do, they just did it poorly. You now have concerns like housing and amenities to worry about because it's apparent your people can't wipe their own butts without you catering to their every need like some socialist dictator. While pumped up to sound great in early reviews before the release the interface is limiting at best because of the number of turns you have take in order to build all of these new items is ridiculous. You will use up all your resource tiles in you first city building (districts) in order to build your improvements in and next to nothing is actually built in your city. The city growth rates are so slow it's just mind numbing play. Apparently your people are incapable of procreating, probably because all their resources for food are used up housing things like universities. This was touted as you were no longer captured in your city, however you have no choice and limited expansion insures your people have only the steps of your wonders to feed off of. Roads are worthless in the early stage of the game and don't make the mistake of thinking you can choose where you build a road, oh no that would make too much sense instead your traders decide where the roads go (you cannot build your own roads) so forget using road building as a tactical military strategy as you are too stupid to know where roads should be built. Just let the automated traders decide where they should be. You will also spend many turns just building workers since they die after they pull off a couple of jobs so you have to build workers constantly The wonders are so big they take up an entire tile which is a huge chunks of territory. To couple that problem your cities expand at a snail's pace ensuring that you're not going to build much. This just makes the game another boring expensive POS from Firaxis. In addition the graphics look childish, the voice over's are awful and the more I play this game the more annoyed I am that I spent 60 bucks on it. So if you like slow moving games that hand lead you through game play and force you into certain paths of development then Civ6 is your game. If you like games that move along, you have ultimate control of where you go then Civ 6 is not for you. Oh ya you can cut the game time by 33% in quick mode, so it's 33% less tedious, this however is not game changer for me because I'm still guided into playing the game with in the parameters of limited choices in the development of my Civilization.Yes there are a lot of great new options for changing things and moving things around if you're willing to take the 10k turns it takes to get there. So in final review if you liked civ 1-5 (any of them) keep playing them because this game is so far removed from that style of game strategies they should had come up with a new name for it. You might want to try it on a friends computer who has already wasted their money on it to see if you would actually be able to muddle your way through this boring game.  "

One small turn for a man, one giant leap for a civilization...----------tl;drCiv 6 got a lot of potentials, and IMO can become the best civilization series up till now. (yes, even better than Civ 4)FAQDoes it perfect in every way?No.Does the current condition of civ6 is better than civ4 or civ5 (with all DLC)?No.Does it worth the $60?Depends.Should you wait or bought it now?Read forum & watch streamer to see more, and decide for yourself.Do I think it is worth the $60 now?Well.. yeah... kind of worth it. I just played it over 24 hours on the first 2 days, and if I keep enjoying it for at least 60-80 hours. $60 is already well spend for me. that means a dollar for each hour. not too bad of a deal. And I'm quite sure I will easily hit 200 hours or more if Firaxis don't screw up with their updates.~I won't talk about the cartoony graphic style, for me it's not an issue and i kind of like it~~I don't have any issue either with the game performance and i don't own a super elite gaming computer~Pros:+ Unstackin city tiles really change the game.This brings city planning to another level.Not including building that has its own area influence.+ The new Civic/Goverment system is really interestingMan.. those goverment type and policies cards are awesome.+ Wonder and Building bonus are more appealing and unique+ Unique ability of each leader/civs are more creative than prev civs+ City States & Great person bonuses are more unique+ Though it still got lots of issue but the new diplomacy/politics mechanic are really promising (casus belli, agenda, etc)+ Victory conditions are more challenging than before, and have a better UI design+ The new visual detail really add value to the gamethis not about the style, but about the overall detail/quality, such as day/night cycle, more detail animation for each stuff in the game, rotating camera, cool lenses, better strategic view, etc.oh yeah, you can see the visual progress of buildings/districts/wonders being build turn by turn.+ You can put a mark/pin in a tile to leave notes on it+ Barb.. Barbarian everywhere~Cons:- AI are still as bad as before- AI diplomacy and trading are still lacking of common sense (like always)- The UI design can still be improveexample: more toggle setting, adding more info in the tooltips, simplify some of the detail info (make something like collapse/minimize feature for the breakdown list), etc..- Lots of missing feature that are useful in prev civssuch as: hotkey, unit action, detail overview, sorting cities/trade, etc.diplomacy option like protecting city state, asking other leader to back off from your border etc.- Dialog and voice line from leaders are seriously lacking- No end game replay :<- Bugs- Just as addicting as prev civs, which is really bad for your daily lifeWill add more point to the list, but I think this is enough for now.------lots of the issue (bug & missing feature) can be fixed easily via patches, and hopefully it will come soon.looking at Firaxis, perhaps the patch will come within the 1st or 2nd week.edit 1: adding some points.edit 2: adding FAQ.edit 3: typo.

												TL;DR it's not a bad game, but Civ V is superior. DLC might fix it, but it's not worth playing until then.Why don't we have a ""Neutral"" recommendation button? We need it for Civ VI, because while this is an acceptable entry into the series, I can't ever see any reason to play it over Civ V.There are a bunch of great new features (Districts make you feel more like you're playing Endless Legend, though that game still does tile based city building better imo), but they're all held back by some really awful design choices, a few bugs, and horrible AI.Pros:The foundation is clearly here. With 2 or 3 big expansions (DLC's bleh), it could easily be a great game.The inspiration system, makes the science and new civic tech trees feel fresh and exciting without feeling overly powerful.Natural wonders feel far better than they did in Civ V (They now tend to give bonuses to tiles around them, making controlling them far more beneficial).Global happiness is no longer a horrible limiter in the mid game.City-States no longer require massive sinks of gold to get small perks, rather you complete quests and are granted envoys who give you bonuses.Cons:Art style is awful compared to Civ V, personal preference obviously, but Civ V was a beautiful game. This feels too cartoony and isn't whimsical enough to warrant it.AI is atrocious. We're talking absolutely worse than Civ V. They'll make wars with you they can't win for no reason, will build cities in horrible spots, build districts poorly, and even get destroyed by barbarians near the start of the game. As someone who played on immortal difficulty in Civ V and really wanted better AI this is quite possibly the most disappointing thing about the whole game.Movement and combat of units is tedious due to how the system of movement has been changed. You will not catch a scout unless they corner themselves. The actual combat hasn't changed, but the changes to movement and how impactful rough terrain can be makes it all so much slower and less engaging.The UI is bad. Menus don't pop up when you click the city, but rather you need to click other buttons while the city is selected to see actual details. There's no game log of any kind so if you miss the fast messages telling you what just happened you'll never see it again. The UI also seems to be hard to directly interact with. The amount of times I try to view a notification only to select the ground beneath said notification is too high.Lastly bugs. There are tons of them. Bugs with the steam overlay, with not being able to name cities, issues with loading saves, and even a strange issue where I kept getting notified stonehenge was built, 300 turns after it'd been built.

												The New Civ VI  Short version – Like, Yes you should get.Long version from the perspective of a Civ V addict (over 5000 hours). There is a comfort level right away as you recognize some of the wonders and hex movement within the game. Ok comfy now? You can now forget everything you thought you knew about playing Civ.  Religion and trading can no longer be ignored and the old saying, “location, location, location” is never more fitting than in the new game. What you build and where you build can double and even triple your outputs depending on what you are geographically adjacent too. Mountains are now your friends.  The leader bonuses, you will want to pay close attention to, and the stream you chose, (science, religion, domination, culture) are all very diverse and your choice of leader Will Make A Difference. My basic thought on the overall enjoyment level of the game. I’ve had to drop down from playing at prince, to better learn the new aspects of the game, and to spend some time fully exploring all the leader and starting country options, and most importantly, I have yet to win a game, so Fun, YES.Enjoy your game play.

War is more viable in this game than in any Civ game before, even better than in Beyond Earth.- No more stupid penalties for expansion. Civ III had corruption and waste, Civ IV had bureacracy/maintenance costs, Civ V had happiness, Civ Beyond Earth had health. Civ VI takes the reigns off. Welcome back to empire-building.- Diverse leader traits.- Units are balanced better than ever. Previous civs had too many upgrades, making armies obsolete once you built a decent-sized one. Now, units are viable for longer periods of time. - Larger maps. This was the cardinal sin of Civ V. Finally, we can rule an EMPIRE again instead of a city-state.			"

												A lot of people compare Civ VI to Civ V the complete edition, which by lengths is unfair. Civ VI is by far better than the base game of Civ V without the expansions. In due, time we’ll all watch this game flourish even more with the introduction of expansions. Civ VI has breath taking graphics in comparison to any other game of this category in my opinion. I’m comparing this to most 4X games such as Endless Legend, Sorcerer King and previous Civ games. I must also compliment the new combat focus, it’s by far one of the most engaging I’ve come across in a long time. The AI feels more balanced and gives a deeper depth to the game, multiplayer is a lot of fun with good friends for playful banter or a more serious approach. Barbarians are as annoying as ever xD and more aggressive than what I remember in my 175 hours of Civ V. As a fan for 4x games, I’m impressed by this game as a whole; there are a lot of positive points in Civ VI. Please don’t let others alter your thinking about a fantastic game.    "

												Early review for Local Network Play, I haven't tried Single Player Campaign yet..Just been playing this thing for a few days/hours, much less than I intended to though.Why?A LOT of game-breaking bugs. Like the game crashing every few turns, or the game-engine not responding, forcing me to kill the windows-process. Lucky me that I have a second screen, my GF has to reboot the entire computer because she can't see the taskmanager below the game interface :)I could live with the crashes, I really could. The thing is: The AI changes all my settings and research and troop placements while i'm not connected to MP. I also have to tick of every message since the start of the game after reconnecting.The Enemy-AI is terrible, I wonder if they forgot to enable it at all. At least on Prince and King dificulty, there is NO CHALLENGE AT ALL, not even if you have never played Civ at all. The AI will declare war at some point, sends a few very outdated units and then keeps idle until getting captured/begging for peace.Other than that, this Civ might become the best part of the franchise yet; if they manage to bring out a patch and a mechanics-dlc.

												I mainly got this game hoping to be able to play with friends through cross-platform (Mac and PC), and so far it appears that it may never happen. Then playing through, found that the AIs are emo teens who hate everything and will denounce everything for no apparent reason, and trying to win the game through any means BUT by pure domination is VERY difficult. But the game won't even let me win by domination, however......it crashes every time I try to take a specific city :I I even came back to the game the next day saved at the turn I would take this said city, but then it immediately crashes. It is as if I am not allowed to take anymore cities or something. I would think that it is because my computer can't handle the game, but everything has been running very smoothly.Furthermore, this game has great concepts, but it is broken and needs lots of fixing before it has a chance at being good.

												Firaxis has shown us that it is still possible to create a better Civilization game than Civ V, which was already a masterpiece.They only need to add proper support for UI upscaling. Playing in 2K resolution may be difficult since texts and icons are very small.			"

												From the three hours I have played so far, this game may even surpass Civ 5 and 4. I thought I was going to be bothered by the new art style, but it looks great. Like anything else, the menues and interface take a few minutes to get used to, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. So far, the diplomacy and AI is the biggest improvement to me. Highly recomended, I predict I will log hundreds of hours.			"

												Civ VI has problems, but it's definitely a good experience. I was honestly hesitant to buy this at all because it seems to be a common trend for the Civ games to be unplayable until DLC comes out (and for some people in this case, it is- but I did not have any launch problems at all) and I live in maple leaf land so everything here is massively overpriced. But I decided to take the plunge because I have hundreds of hours in Civ V, and I am not disappointed by 6 at all.Firstly, the good. I'm going to go out right now and say that I like the graphical changes, but it's all up to personal preference. People are slamming the graphics like they're objectively bad but it all comes down to if you care about this game being less serious in tone or not. To me personally, in a game where you can slaughter spearmen with machine gunners and research social media before steam power, I don't really care about realism or seriousness. The changes in gameplay are also fantastic, as a person who loves tech trees the culture tree adds a new level of depth to the game and allows cultural civilizations to have their own advantage and strays away from the ""rush great library and national college for every civ"". The only thing removed from Civ V that I can think of off the top of my head (not counting the civs that will likely be inserted for DLC along with maps, we'll talk about that later) is the world congress, which thank god because it was a tedious metagame of rushing the forbidden palace and banning every luxury that isn't yours. In it's place is some delegate placing system where you put points into city states to get bonuses- it's pretty much the same idea as the world congress but without penalty if you choose to not care. The music is absolutely fantastic, this might be the first civ I don't mute while playing to listen to podcasts... Well, at least for a bit. And overall, it just screams polish and care from the day/night cycle and seeing all your wonders get built slowly. (I wonder if we'll get the throne room from civ 2 back)Now the bad. The first thing that comes to my mind is the UI. I need the person who modded that advanced UI into civ 5 to come back pronto, because the UI in this game is so minimalist it actually feels like it's working against you sometimes. I have no quick way to constantly check up on great people, I have no way of knowing what luxuries I have duplicates of, I don't know what is subtracting or adding to each city's ""happiness"" (it's called something else in this game though) without going through a few sub menus, and it's just catering too much to trying to make the game as pretty as possible. The advanced UI in civ 5 made the screen look less like a game and more like a spreadsheet simulator at times, but I'll take that any day over what we're getting in civ 6. Next, it feels like there are very few civs in the game, even though there's quite a bit and almost the same as civ 5 on release. I think this is because we don't really have many varying playstyles in yet, as every civ is good at everything due to the overcomplication of their powers. Each civ has like 5 different special abilities, which is cool- I like asymmetrical gameplay a lot... but it makes every single civ a ""jack of all trades"" making the game exactly the same for every player, you're just doing slightly different things. Overall, I'd say it's worth getting. Just know you can refund it if for whatever reason it doesn't launch on your computer.			"

												Civilzation VI is a wonderful addition the Civilzation series. Personally, I believe this is probably my favourite Civ game and has done better than Civilization V (Don't get me wrong Civ 5 was amazing, had tons of fun) But here's my sum up of the game.Pros :- Movement and Combat looks and feels great, especially the unique animation when a unit deals the killing blow; I thought this was an amazing touch on the game.- The game runs so smoothly, I have had no performance issues as of yet and since writing this I have 8 hours. Not a single frame drop, no random crashes; just an all round smooth experience- City Management/Development, I love the new district addition. It really makes the cities easier to manage and helps give you certain buffs that can get you out of a sticky situation. That said, it also makes a great addition to sieging cities. If you can work out what districts are helping a city or civ out the most, that can be your priority instead of going straight for the actual city.- Great Persons. The new great persons screen makes life so much easier to see how far away you are from grabbing your next great person, you can see exactly what you need, what civ is closer to getting them and they all seem to provide better buffs than last time.- Barbarians, last Civ, barbarians were hardly a challenge. A few units and you could rid them for basically your whole game time. Now thats not the case, straight from the off barbarians are a HUGE threat (In my first game I got demolished by 4-5 barbarian units on the 7th turn) completely wasnt expecting it and it set me back far enough that by the time i'd cleared up the mess, all the other civs were miles ahead and there was no way back (I proceeded to lose the game by getting wiped out by good old England)- AI Improvements (sort of) So the AI is a tricky one but their battling decision are thousands of times better, there are no unguarded settlers or workers, units move around together and they dont send one petty unit at your horde of warriors. They seem to have their heads screwed on a bit and make it more difficult to win.So thats just some of the pros but there are plenty more! Cons:- AI Issues (sort of) so again I ended the pros saying the AI in war are very clever; thats not saying they're perfect elsewhere. I got denounced by someone simply because my army wasnt large enough to meet their standards. There was no war, they just didnt like the fact I was playing peaceful, I had enough units to defend myself but clearly not enough to class me as worthy. Also trading is a bit stupid. I got offered one luxury resource for a reasonable price. I tried adjusting it to see if I could get a better deal, but once you've adjusted, theres no going back, the older deal has been withdrawn and you can't get it again. - Artwork (Weak point) So this point is VERY weak and hasnt really affected gameplay too much. But surprisingly im not going to say I hate the new style, in fact I love the new style! But, I tend to play Pedro (Brazil) and that gives you a start bias of Rainforest, but oh my god, the rainforest design is a mess. Especially when theres loads of it together, its incredibly hard to see everything. I tried turning resource Icons on for a second. Nope that just made the mess worse, instead I just sacrificed part of my bonus and cut down the rainforest as its just a mess. Other than that the art work is fine. Oh, the fog of war is cool too, I dont know why everyone is complaining about that.- Bugs (Again weak point) So I havent actually experienced any of these bugs, but im speaking on behalf of people who have. Yes, this game has bugs. But jesus, its been out for one day. I dont really know a game that has came out completely flawless of bugs. Plus they're hardly game breaking. Ultimately, this game isn't perfect, but hardly any game is now. But this game is great! If bugs are going to annoy you, hold off. But if you love the Civ Series, I really doubt this game will let you down!			"

												I mainly got this game hoping to be able to play with friends through cross-platform (Mac and PC), and so far it appears that it may never happen. Then playing through, found that the AIs are emo teens who hate everything and will denounce everything for no apparent reason, and trying to win the game through any means BUT by pure domination is VERY difficult. But the game won't even let me win by domination, however......it crashes every time I try to take a specific city :I I even came back to the game the next day saved at the turn I would take this said city, but then it immediately crashes.

												I will start off by saying I have not played Civ V or Beyond Earth. The last one I played was IV, so It's been a while. Overall the game is quite entertaining. I have had a lot of fun playing a online game with a friend. However, a few things as of right now prevent me from recommending this game.--Cons-AI actions are a bit strange. Rome for centuries just stacked warriors as I played as his German friend across the water. He had no stats that showed that he disliked me, constantly complemented me, and we even announced our friendship. However, when I sent a settler a good distance from his one city( Mind you he had only Rome after centuries) he sent his legions of warriors and chariots(I had knights and eventually musketeers ) over to surround his  ""friend""s new found border. Then declared war right when the frienship expired. I just don't get the behavior. (Played difficulty: Warlord)-Game Killing bugs: Several times have run ito issues of game progress stopping. Says a unit needs order, but everyone has moved and will not progress. Played Multi with my friend and after our turn, the AI would not finish their turn. I recommend saving a lot, atleast every 20 turns if you do play.--Personal Con/RantI am not a fan of their leader picking, it is extremely odd and forced. Gorgo being the main example, barely mentioned anywherein history besides being Leonidas's wife. Greatest achievement was scraping some wax off of a tablet that had an encoded message.  She did not rule anything, her husband however did.(Even after his death, her son was king and  Cleombrotus the tutor) So if you want to play the we need more women game, pick one that makes sense and actually did something. Historically most nations were ruled by men; Sorry. Same goes for Catherine of France, was excluded from ruling  by the Kind, sons took over afterwars. Joan of Arc would have been a better choice.--End RantPros- --The art style in my opinon is awesome. Great work. Creates a fun feel to the game.--The tutorial is a great refresher, I recommend it.--Game mechanics work well and make for some good strategies and competition.-- Sean Bean :)End Note: I will gladly change my review, when the bugs have been worked out and the AI acts a bit more reasonable.Though if you don't mind the cons I listed and can hold out, then I say go for it.

												Absolute positive. At first, it seems to be simple (tech tree, city management, etc.) But later time it is complex and interesting (science, civs, etc.). Graphics is nice, however completely different from previous CIV 5. I found only a few bad things, like lack of roads, crazy AI attaking without any sense, etc....but later on there are ways to go.Playing more, I still keep my rating positive. But there are many issues makes me nervous.- AI is dumb.- City states stockpile unrealistic amount of units.- Due to this, unable to move on the map to anywhere- After a while, evrybody hates evrybody, especially you.- Due to this, no way to trade.- Diplomacy is marginal. Make no sense to spend any time on it.- Religion: same as diplomacy. Do not have prophet or have it: does not matter.- Reach Democracy, Communism, etc. as soon as possible. After that, do not spend a minute on civics. - Added value of many of late game civics are marginal.  All in all, much better than Beyond Earth :)			"

												This game improves many aspects of Civilization 5. First, diplomacy is a much more meaningful portion of the game. The addition of agendas: one random and one fixed, is a great way to make the AI leaders come alive. I was able to negotiate a truce with an AI on King difficulty, which was a difficult feat in Civlization 5. Second, the districts are an engaging new mechanic, which determines how your cities will be shaped. In the early ages, many buildings and districts get large bonuses being located near a river, as a result you often can tell how old a city is by looking at how it is layed out. The final largest change is policies. Policies and government types are a great way to customize your nation. By limiting each player to a set number of policies, which can be changed at any time for a fee, each player can tailor their nation to match their current goals.9/10.			"

												Civilization IV:6 is more than 5.++ Culture has been revamped, its now retooled into a branching tree much like science.  Advancing in culture means unlocking new government types, policies, and certain wonders and buildings, its a big improvement over the way culture is handled in 5.++ The new districts system allows you build towards the way you want to play, with a bunch of positioning and adjacency bonuses. If you do a little planning ahead you can get some very optimized outputs. Its an improvement. ++ The way wonders are handled is arguably alot fairer now. You have to give up a tile per wonder built, so you can't just stack wonders all into a single city like you could in prior games (you can still do it, but you're probably going to have to plan growth a bit more carefully)++ The city states system is a total improvement, no longer will you have to keep throwing gold at them just so they'll like you.+ There's a day/night cycle which you can enable in the options menu which is very easy on the eyes.+ Each AI civ has particular likes, Trajan of Rome likes expansive empires that fight barbarians, Harald Hardrata of Norway likes civs who have a strong navy and high cultural output, etc. This allows you to make naturally aligned alliances with other civs (Or know how exactly to antagonize or provoke a war with other civs.)• You can make national parks in the later half of the game, a four tile area of un-improved land that creates tourism and provides amenities. (They replaced ""happiness"" with ""amenities"".)• There's different critical kill animations, and the animation for the infantry crit killing an opponent is him jumping behind the opponent while turning mid air and shooting them in the head, mid-air no-scope.+/- Transitional units like the longswordsman are no more.+/- Stacks are back (sort of), combine ships to make 'fleets', infantry 'corps' etc.(-) I don't think the music is quite as good as in 5. Its not bad, but its more generic.(-) You're going to have to adjust to the UI a bit.- There needs to be more natural wonders, I'm tired of seeing the dead sea.- Mvemba a Nzinga of the Kongo is almost always mad at you.I was wary of Civ 6, but after playing it, I feel its a big step-up from Civ 5.(Also, they fixed the crazed AI in a patch just recently, they're less blood thirsty now.)The only thing left now is to wait for the game to be opened up to the steam modding community.

												There is one thing that I do not like about this game. First it is the graphics in the game, I really do not like the art style they use in it, it looks a lot like Civ Rev. on the Xbox 360. I also do not like how the Fog of War looks, it is just a grey over of all the colors, I would just prefer the graphics and art style that were in Civ 5. The Civs looks WAY too cartoony for my taste. The worker system is meh for me.There are so many bonus' over Civ 5 in this game. The biggest one is the new culture system, that card system is so good and blows Civ 5 out of the water in that aspect. I also like the movement system that they have, takes one turn to move across hills and forest/ jungle tiles. This game is a lot less min. maxy than Civ 5.I like that City States will go out and hunt barbarian camps and take them over.Barbarians are really good, they are really barbarians and you have to fear them and take them as quick as you can or they will keep you in the stone age. The days of wonder ♥♥♥♥♥ing are over, you cannot do that anymore in this game, and  it makes people have to really fight wars against the barbarians, as if you leave them alone for a good while they will show up on your doorstep and steal your ♥♥♥♥ing cookies, and also kick you in the balls as they leave.

The underlying game is great - not only a worthy successor to Civ V (ignoring BE, because, yikes) but Civ VI's additions are really special - the new civs, the districts, the graphic overhaul (I really like it!), it's all fantastic. A bug here or there (especially with the AI) but those'll be patched out any day. The real issue is the UI - it's a train wreck, and I can't understand how it got out of beta like this.I know it's nitpicking, but it's like there are a million little nits.

												As an fan of the Civilization series, in fact one who still thinks Civ II was the greatest for its time and era, Civilization VI is a very well done game, at least from what I see for the limited amount of hours I have put into this game. There is ofcourse a lot of ""Un-Learning"" and also with the new districts the game will seem to take one out of their comfort zone and familiarity of the mechanics we have grown used to playing prior versions of the game. Its this very uncomfort that can either be viewed as positive or a negative by players and probably the reason some have stated that its a step down from Civ. 5.  Toi me these un familiar aspects makes the game challenging and also rewarding. I like the sort of  integration of civics and science and also how one needs to grow the cities to grow the empire, which means this game involves planning never seen before in civilization series. I must admit I cannot understand why we are not allowed to rename cities (or maybe I have not figured it out as yet) and I also am grapling with finding out some reports I would like to see such as list of all units in ones army, or maybe they dont exist, maybe its time for me to open that tutorial :) Overall this game is a big thumbs up.

Its not bad, but its more generic.(-) You're going to have to adjust to the UI a bit.- There needs to be more natural wonders, I'm tired of seeing the dead sea.- Mvemba a Nzinga of the Kongo is almost always mad at you.I was wary of Civ 6, but after playing it, I feel its a big step-up from Civ 5.(Also, they fixed the crazed AI in a patch just recently, they're less blood thirsty now.)The only thing left now is to wait for the game to be opened up to the steam modding community.

												Much like a any Bethesda game if you come into it with certain expectations you can come out of it very satisfied. Civilization has historically always had rough launches in regards to AI, multiplayer stability, and various mechanics that need to be smoothed over by patches. So do not buy this game now if you want a polished game, Civ V is still amazing. That being said this is my favorite Civilization game. They took the best aspects of previous civs, enhanced those mechanics, and added a few new changes that really change the game for the best. Elements Kept:  Hex System (civ 5) Movement System (pre-civ 5)Multiple Leader Civ Ability (pre-civ 5, only for greek civ as of now)Modding AvailableElements Enhanced:  GraphicsPolicy SystemGovernment SystemReligionDiplomacy (Also see negatives)More Detailed Diplomacy (also see negatives)Civs More Aggressive (also see AI negatives)MusicCity States (more involved)Happiness now city to city (pre-civ 5)Great People now visually competitiveGreat WondersElements Added:  Barbarian Raid System (barbarian scounts will bring raiding parties)Religious BattlesDistrict SystemQuicker *Online* Speed OptionLenses (changes view for religion, settlement ect) Individual AI Leader TempermentOverall Negatives:  AI needs a LOT of work Diplomacy needs some numbers seriously tweaked & more explicitSome mechanics need to be more explicitHad a few disconnects from MultiplayerFew things should be added in the options (ex. unit auto selection)Mini-Map looks pretty awfulI'll probably edit this as I play and as my opinion evolves but I'm personally very happy with this launch and am looking forward to the upcoming patches to fix the negatives.

												Sadly, for all it's fluff, this is not a game worth paying for.  Civ V is the last decent Civ game, only because there were a lot of mods for it, but even unmodded it was not a bad game.  Civ VI is just crap; a company preying on the success and popularity of a title, and in the process giving Sid Meier a bad name.  If there were a way to get my $ back for this underwhelming disappointment of a game, I would go for it.  My recommendation: do not buy.Pros: Looks pretty.Cons: Not very playable, poor AI, no mod tools (yet).			"

												CIV 6 takes the concepts of previous CIV games and borrows additions to the 4X genre explored by other 4X titles, such as districts, to refine and tweak familiar CIV gameplay. CIV 6 feels complete and unique enough to stand alone compared to previous titles. Tutorial windows are informative for both CIV veterans and unfamiliar players. Additionally, the research dialogue has charm, courtesy of Sean Bean. Overall, a positive experience.A problem I had at release was the AI being silly (not upgrading old units, no escorts for workers/settlers), but the latest patch has addressed some of that behavior (unattended workers and settlers at higher difficulties) and tweaked some of the UI. I am hopeful that the AI will continue to improve with patches.Overall, I recommend for fans of the series and 4X games as a whole.  I would argue this game is a good entry point into the 4X strategy genre.			"

												Absolute positive. At first, it seems to be simple (tech tree, city management, etc.) But later time it is complex and interesting (science, civs, etc.). Graphics is nice, however completely different from previous CIV 5. I found only a few bad things, like lack of roads, crazy AI attaking without any sense, etc....but later on there are ways to go.Playing more, I still keep my rating positive. But there are many issues makes me nervous.- AI is dumb.- City states stockpile unrealistic amount of units.- Due to this, unable to move on the map to anywhere- After a while, evrybody hates evrybody, especially you.- Due to this, no way to trade.- Diplomacy is marginal. Make no sense to spend any time on it.- Religion: same as diplomacy. Do not have prophet or have it: does not matter.- Reach Democracy, Communism, etc. as soon as possible. After that, do not spend a minute on civics. - Added value of many of late game civics are marginal.  All in all, much better than Beyond Earth :)			"

												I've been waiting for this game for a LONG time, and as my playtime would suggest (54/96 hours), I'm not disappointed.The visuals are different from Civ5, but I like them and game mechanics keeps you wanting to play more and more.The soundtrack is great, Sean Bean takes a little while to get used to when you think of the previous narators, but it's not a bad thing.The ""One More Turn"" tagline really holds true, it's also really nice to have espionage and religion in the base game. It's easy to see how they can add new components in further expansions with these and with the Diplomacy system too.I would still like to have the option to make comments to other civilizations (so they could get a feel for my ""traits"" or interests), but that's something I've wanted since I started playing Civ1.I've not played with mods etc yet, or multiplayer, so I'll update the review once I have.

												Hi Guys, I tried this game for a few hours but ended up requesting a refund. Just didn't see the enjoying that I used like in this game, found that I wasn't able to stack the units and felt more like a chess game which was the main reason. Just didn't see the value of putting hours of my time into this game which was a personal decision. Overall it looks great and it was a toss up to keep this game, however that was something that annoyed me to much.			"

												I really can't recommend this game at the moment. I'm playing Civ since part One, and never (ever) have I been so disappointed when winning a game as in Civ VI. It is a game with great mechanics, but it lacks... I don't know what, exactly, but it feels I was robbed of my Civ experience at the end of the game. Bugs aside and all. I mean, how can you ""forget"" to implement the ""roundup-movie"" at the end? That has been a signature goodie of all my wins since... well, ever. This is just something very small, but significant - and in the sum of those small things, I was almost disappointed - I will refrain from playing Civ VI in the next months.My advice for you: Go play Civ V. It's excellent. Wait for this game until Xmas 2017.			"

												This game improves many aspects of Civilization 5. First, diplomacy is a much more meaningful portion of the game. The addition of agendas: one random and one fixed, is a great way to make the AI leaders come alive. I was able to negotiate a truce with an AI on King difficulty, which was a difficult feat in Civlization 5. Second, the districts are an engaging new mechanic, which determines how your cities will be shaped. In the early ages, many buildings and districts get large bonuses being located near a river, as a result you often can tell how old a city is by looking at how it is layed out. The final largest change is policies. Policies and government types are a great way to customize your nation. By limiting each player to a set number of policies, which can be changed at any time for a fee, each player can tailor their nation to match their current goals.9/10.			"

												It's civilization. What do you want, a real review? Fiiiiiiine.For the most part, civilization continues from civ 5 rather then civ 4, using hex tiles and the one unit per tile limit that some people did not enjoy in civ 5. Personally I feel this allows for more thought in city placement and unit movement, but the 1 unit per tile debate has lasted for too long with no concensus from either side, so let's abandon it.The biggest change would be districts and wonders actually occupying a tile around your city. This allows the player to be a bit more thoughtfull with what they build and where to maximise a cities output.Leader agenda's (goals they strive for or appreciate) are also a nice addition to the game, allowing you to manipulate the AI's opinion of you more directly.Speaking of AI, it could use improvement. Early in the game, they're rather capable. Churning out units like no tomorrow. But during the medieval ages, they sorta forget to upgrade their units. They'll be the swarm. Lots of units, but all ♥♥♥♥♥♥ compared to up-to-date units. After losing a war, they'll climb back up purely because they have to build the up-to-date units, but otherwise they are in a quagmire and continuesly sinking.All in all though, it's a promising start for a civ game. Civ 4 and 5 both had their rocky starts and improved greatly with their expansions, but Civ 6 has a fairly solid beginning. It will be interesting to see how much more it will improve with expansions.			"

												I love that Civ VI is enough like Civ V so that I know how to play the game but that it's different enough to need to learn new systems. The victory conditions are much more involved, the graphics are amazing, the sound track evolves with you as you grow and advance and the voice of Sean Bean as narrator is absolutely perfect! I have over 300 hours game play on Civ V and, because of that, assumed going for a science victory would be a piece of cake. It's NOT! I've finished one game of Civ VI so far and won on score alone because I did not plan my cities in a way so that I could get a science win. I can't wait to start a second game and put some of the ideas I have after playing once into play and see if that helps. In short, I'm having a blast learning this game. It's, to me, the perfect addition to the Civilization series!Editing because I forgot to mention what I didn't like about the game. I wish the Builders lasted longer than 3 jobs!! I don't like not being able to see countries/city-states I don't have really good relationships with (can *see* them but not in bold colorful detail). Those are the two main things. I have an issue with religion and it's spread but, in all honesty, I think my issue is that I don't understand how freaking FAST my neighbor country was able to spawn so many apostles so fast. My cities were converted before I could benefit from my own religion.			"

												My experience with Civ6 has compelled me to write my first ever steam review. I really would like to recommend this game, but in its current state the game has enough problems that you should wait some time for them to all get hammered out. Fortunately most of the issues seem very fixable. A bit of background, I've played every civ game since 2, logged almost 300 hours on Civ5 and have logged almost 75 hours on civ6, having beat my last playthrough on Emperor difficulty. The Good: I really like the new district system. It's added a level of complexity and 'urban planning' to the game that previous iterations lacked. It encourages you to develop many cities rather than stacking 10 wonders in your power capital like you would do in previous civs. The new cultural, policy, and government system is also a welcomed new addition. The added flexibility is nice versus in Civ5 where once you had made policy decisions you were stuck with them for the rest of the game.The eureka/inspiration system is also a cool way to add side quests to your decisions to help boost a certain policy or technology. Finally, having great people actually do different things is another interesting way to vary up gameplay, although it would be nice if some of the writing/artist/music great people could do something other than create great works. The Ok: I don't think the new city-state 'envoy' system is an improvement. I do like the unique bonuses that each city state can give you, but I think civ5's system of actively courting (well, bribing) city-states to be your friend was a stronger system. I do like how happiness (now called amenities) is now per city, but it's so easy to maintain happiness level that building as many cities as possible is the best possible strategy. In civ5, there were repercussions to building/conquering too many cities, and I think civ6 went too far in the opposite direction.I don’t mind the new art style and there are some changes to the map and UI that are helpful, such as lenses that give more pertinent information about the map based on context (such as seeing religion levels when moving a religious unit), but for some odd reason a lot of useful features have been taken out of the UI. For example, in most information screens, you can’t sort information. Scrolling through a list of 20 cities to see which one is producing the most science becomes more difficult than it should.  The Not So Good: As has been said in many other reviews, the A.I. has problems. Contrary to what I've seen others say, I actually find the A.I. in the early game to be somewhat respectable. Despite the fact that they sometimes are hyper-aggressive, it is challenging to fight them, along with the ever roaming barbarians. However, part of this early challenge is due to how bad the A.I. cheats on harder difficulties. On my emperor playthrough, every other civilization I encountered had 2-3 cities with multiple workers and military units within the first 30 turns. I had barely built my first worker. When the A.I. declared war on me, units appeared to just spawn from nowhere. I don't mind a challenge, but spawning units for free in a game like this is very frustrating. Because of these bonuses, the AI will also completely dominate in culture/science. I think in the year 200 A.D., I saw Kongo change its government to a Democracy and enter the modern era. 200 A.D.! Yet despite all this cheating, the A.I. has major flaws in the mid to late game that makes them nearly harmless towards the end game. For one, once they've built around 5 cities, they stop.  They will try to conquer each other (and you), but their tactical management of units isn't very good. But this biggest issue, is that for some reason, the A.I. will not upgrade their units. An A.I. in the atomic era will still have spearmen and slingers. One tank army can almost single handedly destroy an entire A.I.’s military. I'd almost wish they'd cheat and spawn throngs of tanks and infantry to just provide a challenge, but after the medieval era, they just stop caring about their military.And to pile on to the diplomacy-side of things, once you decide to conquer a city, you can forget about diplomacy for the rest of the game. Warmonger penalties, even for wars you didn't start, cannot be surmounted with any amount of diplomatic good will. For a frame of reference, an Alliance is worth +18 in relationship with the A.I. Conquering one city is -15. Conquer two cities, and you are at -30, and your ally will denounce you. Never mind you conquered the cities of a civilization your ally is also at war with. It's nonsensical. Beyond the A.I., there are a few other issues. The pace of the game doesn't feel right. I think it's because you can now 'research' two trees at once, so you get through the tech and policy trees faster. Eureka and inspiration bonuses also cause this. In Civ5, I would reach a certain era at least within a century of when that era actually happened in history (e.g., industrial era around 1800 A.D.). In civ6, I discovered flight in 1100 A.D. This is on standard speed. It feels like there are gaps in both trees that might get filled in with new techs in later expansions, so hopefully this issue improves over time. The Biggest Issue: If you were new to the civilization franchise, there really would be no reason to play Civ6 over Civ5. Every civilization game has been fairly different than the previous. Whether you liked Civ5 over Civ4 or not, no one can deny that Civ5 was a completely different experience than Civ4. Civ6 feels like Civ5 with a few things refactored. And with the current A.I. and pacing issues, Civ6 isn't as enjoyable as Civ5. The Good News: Nearly everything that bothers me about Civ6 seems easily fixable. I remember when Civ5 first came out, it had a lot of problems, but with two expansions and many patches, it is a really good game. Civ6 feels like it is a few balancing patches and one expansion away from being a good game. The glaring omission of a United Nations in Civ6 leads me to believe the nearly absent diplomacy of this game will be fixed in the future.So, should you buy this game now? No, don't waste your time. Buy Civ5 if you haven't already or if you already have Civ5 then start another Civ5 game. Or try another 4x game. But just like Civ5, give this game a year or two to hammer out it's issues and it will probably be great.			"

												While there are still some annoyances, like- Tactics AI is pretty much the same as Civ V and with the new additions of unit stacking is even less able to cope with warfare- Desync issues in MP- Clunky/Slow unit management.the new additions like districts, civics and religious war make the game much more complex, but its not meaningless complexity. On the contrary, it feels much less arbitrary than ""burn a great scientist for 1000 science"" and it switches things up.So in the end, while this is not perfect, it is better than Civ V in every regard and there is no reason to play Civ V over this.

The tutorial is well done and makes it the easiest CIv game to introduce new players into the genre.  The voice and sounds are on par with what you would expect, I don't think they will ever surpass Leonard Nimoy’s voice acting from 4, but it was pretty close this time around. This one feels like it's already had an expansion and I think that was the best move they could have made.			"

Theres a few decent new additions like districts which adds a new element of city planning to the game which is a nice touch and the civic tree, basically a tech tree for culture which is my personal favourite addition.

But then, this game doesn't even follow through like a Civ IV sequel. Instead, Civ VI is created to get new fans and brushes off the old ones in a great money-grab. Then again, there does need to be some introduction for new fans, that is a necessity, but it is completely ridiculous to advertise your 25th annniversary and then basically leave a sign that says: ""No loyal, good-game seeking fans allowed! Just suckers who want to waste their money!"". A company that hurts the consumers who would pay an unprecidented amount of money for a good game and then takes the $59.99 price to feed them a lousy excuse for a McDonald's hamburger of a game aren't entrepreneurs, their con-artisits.I'm not THAT angry, I'm just dissapointed. I know the people at Firaxis thought they were doing a good, and I'm sure they put hours of hard work into this game. I, even, was impressed at the spectacle of the game, but I don't want any more consumers to buy themselves a game for such a high price they probably won't ever enjoy and will even grow frustrated with. I'm sure what Firaxis was thinking was that they would scrap Civ V (like they did Civ IV in the making of Civ V, which was an extremely successful maneuver) and then create a new basis of the game while more-or-less keeping the same theme: 'Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!'You may even realize that the game, however, isn't as breath-taking as they made it out to be. For example, I specifically recall that in every add they had for ""First Looks"" (and in others) the AI cahracters, like in Civ V and in Civ IV, would move as they spoke to you, or atleast had some life in them. When I got the game during Christmas, I found none of them move and they all had exasperated, sceptical faces would never whether they liked you or not (which they regularly hate you for no reason and are prone to declaring war on you even if they are supposed to be pacifist allies of yours and do so for, again, no apparent reason). Is there something I'm missing? Clearly I was and still am, because when I bought this game it was filled with very positive reports, now it says ""Mixed"" with no ""Thumbs-up"" reports if you get my drift.What I am trying to say, and other good commentators would agree with me, that Civ VI is not a classic, complicated, character building, intense, and exciting game. Civ IV fans who were upset with Civ V and Civ V fans who were so impresed by the game that they nearly doubled the fan base and everyone else who had been so dedicted to the high-quality series of games since 1991 will be dissapointed and quite possibly upset with Civ VI.I personally either want my money back, or would like to exchange the game to re-install another game of firaxis. I will try to find a way to succeed at this, but I doubt the odds.			"

												I have  1400 hours on civ 5, and in my opiniion, In its current state, this game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥- The AI, as everyone else has said, is useless. You can play exactly to another nations preferences, and they sill declare war on you sooner or later. I mean, take Cleopatra; Primary agenda: likes civs with large armies. Hidden agenda: Dislikes civs with large armies.- The barbarians are intensely annoying and make no sense. They will ride halfway across a continent to attack your city/units, but won't attack the civ right next to them, even though you don't even know where their encampment is.-There's no workshop, and my guess is they will probably charge people to get workshop access- DLC: 1 DLC adds an extra civ+some scenarios for $7 (NZ, I think about 5USD). the other adds some scenarios, and some city states for the same price. In the base games current state, this should have all been added for free. I might not have been compelled to write this review if that wasn't the case- The games cost 100NZD (about 60-80USD)  on steam at the moment. What the ♥♥♥♥. Lucky I didn't buy it from steam. Wherever you buy it, it's well overpriced for the content.At least the graphics are nice.Wait for a sale, wait for more content, buy civ 4/5 if you're new to Civ. don't buy this game in its current state. Do the game industry a favour and don't put up with extortionism. I will not be ordering any more firaxis titles anywhere near release. "

												One long♥♥♥♥♥review coming from your biggest fan Firaxis :)Honestly this game is fun despite the flaws. And yes the complaints with regarding the AI dumbness and diplomacy and all that mumbo jumbo. With all due respect I use a AI mod ( which is slighty better ) for those problems, however I hate to be bias but diplomacy isn't that big of a deal to me ( with the exception of trading resources, cause who doesn't want free luxuries from your friendly neighbour :) ) especially when I only ever do domination only games like the amazing boardgame risk, but again don't get me wrong diplomacy is cool but if it just a domination game then it just pointless. I not here to be your buddy, I here to be your enemy. Even if their is one civ remaining and that happens to be your bbf since childhood, welp sorry man but I got to take your captial, we're still bros right? Probably not he just going to get all salty and denounce me like crazy. Now I feel like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ That how I see it xD.The problem with Civ 6 is are those stupid walls. Late game war was no fun at all, knowing the AI would do absolutely nothing but just station it units around your walled city and stare at it for the whole duration of the war. I gave up the game afterwards and went to google and typed in ""Civ 6 remove walls"" click the first link and thank god for a solution I did what the website told me.""Open the file ""Buildings"" and look for the code ( OuterDefenseHitPoints=""50"" OuterDefenseStrength=""2"" ). This text is found in three places of the file. Change both ""50"" and ""2"" to ""0"" in all of the three. Save the file and close it.In the file ""Civics"", edit it by first searching for the text ( DefenseValue ). Once you found it, there is a number 200 under that line. Change it to 0.""So I did afterwards I save it, I also subscribe to the Minimized warmongering penalties mod, set the game to 20 civs, Deity and Inland Map ( land only map ). Fast Forward to the Modern Age and outta of 20 civs only 8 civs remained alive O_O (not one was conquered by me ). And soon to be me as poor Brazil since Peter already took my captial and soon all my cities ;-;. Which I don't care I say massive improvement with wars and I never been happier to start a new game once I wipe out that is. All because of removing the walls features :DNow vouching for the negative reviews. for the love of god Firaxis fix the AI for the fans and newcomers sake and me included cause it getting ridiculous. I highly recommend suggesting is postpone doing whatever you guys are doing and focus all your manpower on fixing and improving the AI asap and I know it not easy but the sooner the AI is satisfactory the sooner we can all be one big happy family again instead of a dysfunctional one. Cause right now your recent reviews is mixed and that is depressing.			"

This game is a very good edition to the Civilization series. I enjoy the AI and how they are much smarter (even the barbarians). However, they are really annoying. Within the first 10 turns the Aztecs declared war on me as I had another luxury that he did not. As this happened, the other civs that he befriended within those 10 turns also instantly declared war on me. As this happened the next 2 turns were equally as worse. I had met 3 other civs (playing on Continents) of whom instantly denounced me. They are really hard to befriend. Even after 300 turns of one game.I do miss the feature that you can't rename cities or religions (or I just can't read). But you can rename units and put them into ""Corps"" or ""Armies"" which is very useful (basically a hybrid army that consists of 2 or 3 of the same unit).This game is amazing. I would recommend buying it, only if you are willing to do some research, learn the game and play much more aggresively than you normally would in any other Civ game.			"

												This game is liberal as hell:1. Warmonger penalties out the wazoo.2. Women leaders of ancient civs!?! (TOTAL LACK OF REALISM)3. The AI declares wars, but sucks at them or never even shows up.4. Aircrafts are bad for global warming, dont expect to see the the AI use them.Other things include:1. Diplomacy is garbage. AI allies and enemies are useless.2. Unnecessary DLC. (FIX YOUR GAME FIRST)3. Bugs, Bugs & Bugs. Did they even play test this game? I loved it when I declared war on myself!Bottom Line:CIV VI is the worst of the series period. It takes strides to be great with some cool new features such as city districts and wonders being shown on the map, etc..... But, the game falls extremely short of the Civilization standard. Buy CIV IV or V, don't waste your time or money on this garbage!			"

												VERY overtuned.Barbarians will swarm you to no end within the first 10 turns, forcing you to poor all your production into combat units.  Did I mention they're up farther than you in the tech tree with horseback riding, archers, and spearmen?While you're fighting off the 20 Barbarian units knocking on your door, you'll find some leader.  This leader HATES that you are either not expanding or have a big army.  Guess who else wants to kill you now?Lastly, the district system.  You can't build everything in your main city, meaning you have to juggle the new housing system, the new amenitiesm system, in adition to having to occupy various tiles for their districts, which you can't build anyway due to those barbarians.And, no, you CAN'T block the barbarians from finding your capital.  In most cases they will find it on Turn 2.Save yourself some money and go back to Civ 5.			"

												If you're coming from Civ 5, you will be hugely disappointed. Some of the biggest things that stand out to me:AI is just nowhere near what it should be. Playing on Emperor difficulty, I never once had a single city attacked, or even had a unit attacked more than a handful of times, even after Roosevelt massivley outproduced my army. This isn't even limited to military aspects- the AI doesn't really seem to focus on tech or culture development either. Production is hugely unbalanced. Forget focusing on culture or tech, just put all your efforts into hammers and you win. I think the idea the devs were going for was to force each city to choose a specialization, however without careful balance this just turned into making production centers hugely overpowered. The Diplomacy AI is just unfinished. Its really surprising that this feature made it out of play testing tbh. There are plenty of better reviews in here about this, but such things as Civs denouncing you as a warmonger for rescuing one of their cities, praising you for nuking one of their cities, or declaring war on you for jointly declaring war with them on someone else just have no place in a $60.00 game.This game does have a lot of potential though, and I want to keep tabs on it because of how much Civ 5 changed between its release to its current state. Before expansion, Civ 5 was thought of as the worst in the series, now its arguably the best. Hopefully the devs will keep working on 6.			"

												For months even after release they advertised that workshop support would be in this game. It is still not in the game and now they don't advertise it anymore. They may never get around to completing their promise.This is just one of the examples of why this game feels unpolished. Don't buy this game unless its on sale or they actually get around to finishing this game.Also: Civ 6 is a good step forward, but it's poorly executed. So it's kinda like you took a step forward but broke your ankle as a result.			"

  My experience with strategy games 	  This is just a chapter which you can read if you'd like to know how experienced I am with strategy games.	 I am not new to strategy games, starting my strategy game career as 13-year-old boy when I picked up total war shogun 2. I picked up civilization V (which is my only experience with civilization series) in 2014. Which is the game I will be comparing this game to.  Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI game review	When you hear Sid Meier’s Civilization, what is your first thought? It might be simplified version of every strategy game out there, or it might be overly complicated like every every strategy game out there. In this review I'll be offering some light on this subject.  First impressions	When I first ran Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI, I was a bit overwhelmed by the content. But I got used to it after one hour of play time. I would compare it to civilization V like this, ""Like V, but with all the DLC and more features."". When I saw the graphics, they seemed a bit too vibrant, like a mobile game style of graphics. Which I had to get used to. Combat system is  very	 similar to civilization V's and that is good, brings more familiarity to the game. They also did some funky stuff to the social policies we had in civilization V, as they are gone. There is a new system called the civics, which are like social policies but not at all. Giving you bonuses depending on your government. The also added Eureka mechanic which give you a bonus to researching a technology if you do certain things. Which I quite like.  Gameplay and mechanics	 Mechanics	When I say that its like civilization V but with all the DLC and more content, I mean it. Gameplay is almost the same, add in the unstackable cities, more units and city-state mechanics. You usually find yourself doing the same strategies as in civilization V, but with different build orders. Like you might skip monument as your second build order in favour of a slinger that gives you a bonus towards archery if you get a kill with it. Or a second scout. The possibilities are endless but limited at the same time. City-states	You might remember city-states from civilization V, they have changed them. Towards a better tomorrow I might say. You no longer play a bribe simulator 2015, but rather its more political and time consuming. You no longer send gifts to a city-state, you send envoys. You get these by completing city-state missions, like bulding an encampment whic you can use to build more units, or a campus which you use to get more sience. Most of these missions are good and points you toward the direction you might pursue. You can also generate envoys but it takes a bit longer, so you are better of doing the missions most of the time. Once you get you envoy from a mission it sends it to the city-state, and depending on the number of envoys you have sent there, you get a bonus to production, sience, faith or culture. If you have generated the onvoy via envoy points, you can send it to enywhere you like. If you have sent the msot envoys to a certain city-state, you get to be their suzerain, which means that you are their allie and you can get some gifts from the city-state depending on what kind of city-sate they are. You can also drag them into a war against others, but they do nothing. Districts	Districts are a new thing they have added. Since you can't stack your cities, it promotes building an early military against the barbarians. There are 13 different districts these are campus, encampment, entertainment complex, industrial zone, commercial hub, neighborhood, harbor, aqueduct, theater square, holy site, Aerodrome, spaceport and the city center. I won't get into these in detail because it would make this review so long that even I wouldn't read it. But all you need to know about districts that they get bonuses from terrain features, being close to other districts, and tile improvements. I usually find myself rushing the campus as fast as I can to get the early sience, since you usually find an other civilization within 20 turns and get the Eureka bonus for writing which unlocks the campus. Depending on the civ, I usually never build the holy site, because it takes away the production from more important things like a settler or a worker.  Unit movement	Unit movement doesn't work like it does in civilizaiton V.  You can't move to rough terrain if your unit has only one movement point left. I find this change more logical and strategic. It makes defending against a horde of legionaries easier. Combat	As I stated earlier, unit combat is very similar to civilization V, like terrain giving you defence and attack bonuses. Some special units have combat bonuses depending on unit adjacencies, terrain features and so on. Some civilizaitong have bonuses to all units, like Japan who has ""Divine wind"" that gives all units on coastal terrain a combat bonus. Quite strong on islands map.Combat is also fought with unit strenght, quite straing forward, units from newer era are stronger than units from older era. But if we take an fictional unit that has 20 + 7 combat strenght, and put it against a unit that has 25 combat strenght, the fictional unit wins. But it's not out of the game yet since units have health, the lost unit stick to live an other day. The combat system is basic at best, and lacks complexity, but I bet that newer players will appriciate it. Gameplay	 overall	Gameplay is fluent and addicting, usually I play civilization titles for days non-stop. The way that the gameplay has been made is relaxing in the mix of millions of FPS titles. The feeling might fall apart due to AI almost never upgrading heir units and sticking with their special ones. Like hoplites in the modern era. Districts have added so much needed replayability, it's like breathing in some fresh outside air after five hours of playing CS GO.  AI	As always in civilization games, AI is not the best on the market. At least currently. Doing stupid mistakes and never upgrading their military. It wouldn't be so bad if the bonuses on higher difficulties weren't so evident. But the AI varies between civilizations. In my experience, AI Britain, Germany, France and Japan are the best ones.  Graphics and sound desing	 overall	I like the graphic design of civilization IV, it brings more vibrant colours into my already dark and realistic looking games. Sound design and soundtrack are something to be applaused and I usually find myself in civilization VI's soundtrack folder just to listen to those gems. Graphics	As I stated before, graphics are mobile like. Vibrant colours and cartoon-ish civilization leaders are something to get used to if you have only played civilization V. But these cartoony graphics aren't a design choice out of nowhere. Its from older civilization titles that used to have funny leader designs and vibrant colours. Sound design	As I said, I like it. But if I had something to point out is that heavy cavalry sound a lot like light cavalry. It's like there is no weight difference between light and heavy cavalry. Also there's the sound design when swordsmen attack other units, I can hear a sound that would be made by a club. Which doesn't really make much sense. These details are quite small but something that should be improved when we talk about immersion.Soundtrack is superb, I  love  it! Something that I will be listening to many years to come!  My final thoughts 	 Civilization IV is the best game so far in the whole Sid Meier’s Civilization® game series. Something that I will be playing for good three or four years to come. With superb soundtrack and funky graphics and new features, its amazing!  9/10  "

												Hello everyone,Steam sadly got only YES or NO. I would give that game 60% which would qualify as a Yes, but I have to vote No this time.For a triple AAA title this game was launched AGAIN in a seemingly non tested BETA state (at best).I love Civ (got quite some hours on the previous titles Civ I-V). But for a game for that price It ain't done yet.Complete imbalanced and bugged. The AI is literally not existing and gets advantages simply by cheating. It is even worse than Civ V.Diplomacy is a complete mess. Well it doesn't really exist tbh.Do not try to get a religion on higher difficulties. Just ignore it. Religion doesn't really exist for the Player. It is an AI privilidge.AI got none whatsoever Diplomacy consequences. For example:If your troops are close to AI Boarders (even if it is inside your borders) AI will complain.AI will move troops next to your capital and you can't complain it is no reason to declare war.Troops will remin there for centuries. Nothing you can do bout it.AI will convert your cities, you tell them to stop that. They agree. They do it again (promise broken) nothing you can do about it. It doesn't qulify as ""causal bell"" for war. same goes for spies.They attack you. YOU ARE THE WARMONGER.If you want to play the game higher than prince prepare to feel the entire game as you were Hitler.Every AI will hate you the entire game. Even if you started out to do a peaceful game.I'm not talking here about the little annoying bugs which are plentyhere a few.-Land units will attempt to engage your naval units (they encircle your ships and you can kill their entire army witha few ships)- Completly overpowered races (Germans, Sumerian)-Missionaries overrun your cities and encircle them making it impossible to move around in your own country ( I counted up to 30 units on my city)I'm used to issues with Civ shortly after launch. But this time it is even worse. Same with Civ V it was really a god game with the first expansion.A playable Civ version cost like 90 bucks here Game + first expansion.I feel that is too much...If you are a civ fan and you can wait I suggest you do so and wait for a bundle price with the first expansion.I hope that review was helpful.

												My wife and I were a bit skeptical to buy this Civ game after being disappointed in the Beyond earth version a few years back. Well for anyone that's on the fence as we were because of that you need not be worried. If you enjoyed Civ 5 and all the expansions then you're going to love this one. Speaking of expansions it seems that almost everything that was in Civ 5 and all its DLC's have been rolled over into this game, which has me excited for whatever they may include in the future. The addition of districts makes each city a little different. Want a city that specializes in making military melee units while another city that’s further away from the front specializes in calvary? You can do that! Want on city to be focused on science while another pulls in all the gold? That can be done as well. It's a system that I feel works very well in this series and hope it’s here to stay. Not only that, near end game your cities with all their districts and wonders that actually build up around your city, your cities will look huge, vibrant, and like...well, actual cities! Giving you that satisfaction when you see your starting city or whichever one you took effort in spread across all the hexes. Definitely worth the full price tag as we couldn't wait to play it!			"

Like anything else, the menues and interface take a few minutes to get used to, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. So far, the diplomacy and AI is the biggest improvement to me.

												There is one thing that I do not like about this game. First it is the graphics in the game, I really do not like the art style they use in it, it looks a lot like Civ Rev. on the Xbox 360. I also do not like how the Fog of War looks, it is just a grey over of all the colors, I would just prefer the graphics and art style that were in Civ 5. The Civs looks WAY too cartoony for my taste. The worker system is meh for me.There are so many bonus' over Civ 5 in this game. The biggest one is the new culture system, that card system is so good and blows Civ 5 out of the water in that aspect. I also like the movement system that they have, takes one turn to move across hills and forest/ jungle tiles. This game is a lot less min. maxy than Civ 5.I like that City States will go out and hunt barbarian camps and take them over.Barbarians are really good, they are really barbarians and you have to fear them and take them as quick as you can or they will keep you in the stone age. The days of wonder ♥♥♥♥♥ing are over, you cannot do that anymore in this game, and  it makes people have to really fight wars against the barbarians, as if you leave them alone for a good while they will show up on your doorstep and steal your ♥♥♥♥ing cookies, and also kick you in the balls as they leave.

												How can a game be so good and yet drive me completely up the wall with dumb issues like this one does? The underlying game is great - not only a worthy successor to Civ V (ignoring BE, because, yikes) but Civ VI's additions are really special - the new civs, the districts, the graphic overhaul (I really like it!), it's all fantastic. A bug here or there (especially with the AI) but those'll be patched out any day. The real issue is the UI - it's a train wreck, and I can't understand how it got out of beta like this.I know it's nitpicking, but it's like there are a million little nits. Still an excellent game, but it could be so much better. Hopefully the devs will get it there in short order.			"

												VERY overtuned.Barbarians will swarm you to no end within the first 10 turns, forcing you to poor all your production into combat units.  Did I mention they're up farther than you in the tech tree with horseback riding, archers, and spearmen?While you're fighting off the 20 Barbarian units knocking on your door, you'll find some leader.  This leader HATES that you are either not expanding or have a big army.  Guess who else wants to kill you now?Lastly, the district system.  You can't build everything in your main city, meaning you have to juggle the new housing system, the new amenitiesm system, in adition to having to occupy various tiles for their districts, which you can't build anyway due to those barbarians.And, no, you CAN'T block the barbarians from finding your capital.  In most cases they will find it on Turn 2.Save yourself some money and go back to Civ 5.			"

												As someone with 2230 Hours on Civilization 5, and a genuine love for the Civ series, this game feels fantastic. It's a breath of fresh air after the mediocre disappointment of Civ: Beyond Earth, Civ6 is incredbily satisfying and has tons of charm. The soundtrack is an amazing orchestral score, and the way it changes between Eras help to keep it enjoyable to listen to for a game that might last 300 turns. The changes to Espionage and Religion are also really fun, they're much more interactive than what was offered in Gods & Kings and Brave New World for Civilization 5. One of my biggest complaints it the AI seems to get confused and doesn't know what to do with itself most of the time past the Medieval Era, granted I've only played on Prince and King so, the AI might get smarter at higher difficulties. Overall, I'd say it's definantly worth picking up if you enjoyed Civilization 5.			"

												It's an interesting take on Civ mechanics. I happen to be enjoying most of the changes done to the tech tree, as well as the addition of a civic tree and a district system. However, I have to agree with the majority of reviews, this game is filled with hair-pulling bugs. I haven´t experienced a single crash in the 20+ hours I´ve played, but the bugs are really annoying. Clearly more development time was needed in order to finish the game. + Great design and animations+ Love the tech and civic trees+ Barbarians!- Incomplete character dialogues- Dumbest AI yet- Unbalanced features (everything from civis to tech to relationships)- Crazy district repair turns (Too much production needed to repair. Sometimes cost me over 50 turns)Overall I´m happy with it. I´m pretty sure It´ll end up being like the last time and they´ll have it patched up in the months to come. Until then, I can´t fully recommend the game just yet.			"

												Oh my god, where to begin...I had ""barely"" played civ V (250 hours) and I beat Diety multiple times, and I must say civ VI gave me a run for my money, it is a great game for turn based strategy beginners, and veterans.If you go in expecting Civ V (like I did) you will be dissapointed, this game doesn't hold your hand as much as civ IV or Vand you will probably lose multiple times before your first victory.It is definitly the best civ since BNW, if that means anything to you.

												This game is a great addition to the Civ fanchise. However, for me a game breaking bug manifested itself after about 19 hours of play, causing the game to crash everytime I attempt to confirm a change of my policies. Check for updates before buying. Aditionally the AI shows some rather silly behavior, like declaring war on me with spearmen when I have tanks. Continent and Island campaigns can easily get imbalanced if a player is isolated and can develop unimpeeded.			"

												Hello everyone,Steam sadly got only YES or NO. I would give that game 60% which would qualify as a Yes, but I have to vote No this time.For a triple AAA title this game was launched AGAIN in a seemingly non tested BETA state (at best).I love Civ (got quite some hours on the previous titles Civ I-V). But for a game for that price It ain't done yet.Complete imbalanced and bugged. The AI is literally not existing and gets advantages simply by cheating. It is even worse than Civ V.Diplomacy is a complete mess. Well it doesn't really exist tbh.Do not try to get a religion on higher difficulties. Just ignore it. Religion doesn't really exist for the Player. It is an AI privilidge.AI got none whatsoever Diplomacy consequences. For example:If your troops are close to AI Boarders (even if it is inside your borders) AI will complain.AI will move troops next to your capital and you can't complain it is no reason to declare war.Troops will remin there for centuries. Nothing you can do bout it.AI will convert your cities, you tell them to stop that. They agree. They do it again (promise broken) nothing you can do about it. It doesn't qulify as ""causal bell"" for war. same goes for spies.They attack you. YOU ARE THE WARMONGER.If you want to play the game higher than prince prepare to feel the entire game as you were Hitler.Every AI will hate you the entire game. Even if you started out to do a peaceful game.I'm not talking here about the little annoying bugs which are plentyhere a few.-Land units will attempt to engage your naval units (they encircle your ships and you can kill their entire army witha few ships)- Completly overpowered races (Germans, Sumerian)-Missionaries overrun your cities and encircle them making it impossible to move around in your own country ( I counted up to 30 units on my city)I'm used to issues with Civ shortly after launch. But this time it is even worse. Same with Civ V it was really a god game with the first expansion.A playable Civ version cost like 90 bucks here Game + first expansion.I feel that is too much...If you are a civ fan and you can wait I suggest you do so and wait for a bundle price with the first expansion.I hope that review was helpful.

  My experience with strategy games 	  This is just a chapter which you can read if you'd like to know how experienced I am with strategy games.	 I am not new to strategy games, starting my strategy game career as 13-year-old boy when I picked up total war shogun 2. I picked up civilization V (which is my only experience with civilization series) in 2014. Which is the game I will be comparing this game to.  Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI game review	When you hear Sid Meier’s Civilization, what is your first thought? It might be simplified version of every strategy game out there, or it might be overly complicated like every every strategy game out there. In this review I'll be offering some light on this subject.  First impressions	When I first ran Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI, I was a bit overwhelmed by the content. But I got used to it after one hour of play time. I would compare it to civilization V like this, ""Like V, but with all the DLC and more features."". When I saw the graphics, they seemed a bit too vibrant, like a mobile game style of graphics. Which I had to get used to. Combat system is  very	 similar to civilization V's and that is good, brings more familiarity to the game. They also did some funky stuff to the social policies we had in civilization V, as they are gone. There is a new system called the civics, which are like social policies but not at all. Giving you bonuses depending on your government. The also added Eureka mechanic which give you a bonus to researching a technology if you do certain things. Which I quite like.  Gameplay and mechanics	 Mechanics	When I say that its like civilization V but with all the DLC and more content, I mean it. Gameplay is almost the same, add in the unstackable cities, more units and city-state mechanics. You usually find yourself doing the same strategies as in civilization V, but with different build orders. Like you might skip monument as your second build order in favour of a slinger that gives you a bonus towards archery if you get a kill with it. Or a second scout. The possibilities are endless but limited at the same time. City-states	You might remember city-states from civilization V, they have changed them. Towards a better tomorrow I might say. You no longer play a bribe simulator 2015, but rather its more political and time consuming. You no longer send gifts to a city-state, you send envoys. You get these by completing city-state missions, like bulding an encampment whic you can use to build more units, or a campus which you use to get more sience. Most of these missions are good and points you toward the direction you might pursue. You can also generate envoys but it takes a bit longer, so you are better of doing the missions most of the time. Once you get you envoy from a mission it sends it to the city-state, and depending on the number of envoys you have sent there, you get a bonus to production, sience, faith or culture. If you have generated the onvoy via envoy points, you can send it to enywhere you like. If you have sent the msot envoys to a certain city-state, you get to be their suzerain, which means that you are their allie and you can get some gifts from the city-state depending on what kind of city-sate they are. You can also drag them into a war against others, but they do nothing. Districts	Districts are a new thing they have added. Since you can't stack your cities, it promotes building an early military against the barbarians. There are 13 different districts these are campus, encampment, entertainment complex, industrial zone, commercial hub, neighborhood, harbor, aqueduct, theater square, holy site, Aerodrome, spaceport and the city center. I won't get into these in detail because it would make this review so long that even I wouldn't read it. But all you need to know about districts that they get bonuses from terrain features, being close to other districts, and tile improvements. I usually find myself rushing the campus as fast as I can to get the early sience, since you usually find an other civilization within 20 turns and get the Eureka bonus for writing which unlocks the campus. Depending on the civ, I usually never build the holy site, because it takes away the production from more important things like a settler or a worker.  Unit movement	Unit movement doesn't work like it does in civilizaiton V.  You can't move to rough terrain if your unit has only one movement point left. I find this change more logical and strategic. It makes defending against a horde of legionaries easier. Combat	As I stated earlier, unit combat is very similar to civilization V, like terrain giving you defence and attack bonuses. Some special units have combat bonuses depending on unit adjacencies, terrain features and so on. Some civilizaitong have bonuses to all units, like Japan who has ""Divine wind"" that gives all units on coastal terrain a combat bonus. Quite strong on islands map.Combat is also fought with unit strenght, quite straing forward, units from newer era are stronger than units from older era. But if we take an fictional unit that has 20 + 7 combat strenght, and put it against a unit that has 25 combat strenght, the fictional unit wins. But it's not out of the game yet since units have health, the lost unit stick to live an other day. The combat system is basic at best, and lacks complexity, but I bet that newer players will appriciate it. Gameplay	 overall	Gameplay is fluent and addicting, usually I play civilization titles for days non-stop. The way that the gameplay has been made is relaxing in the mix of millions of FPS titles. The feeling might fall apart due to AI almost never upgrading heir units and sticking with their special ones. Like hoplites in the modern era. Districts have added so much needed replayability, it's like breathing in some fresh outside air after five hours of playing CS GO.  AI	As always in civilization games, AI is not the best on the market. At least currently. Doing stupid mistakes and never upgrading their military. It wouldn't be so bad if the bonuses on higher difficulties weren't so evident. But the AI varies between civilizations. In my experience, AI Britain, Germany, France and Japan are the best ones.  Graphics and sound desing	 overall	I like the graphic design of civilization IV, it brings more vibrant colours into my already dark and realistic looking games. Sound design and soundtrack are something to be applaused and I usually find myself in civilization VI's soundtrack folder just to listen to those gems. Graphics	As I stated before, graphics are mobile like. Vibrant colours and cartoon-ish civilization leaders are something to get used to if you have only played civilization V. But these cartoony graphics aren't a design choice out of nowhere. Its from older civilization titles that used to have funny leader designs and vibrant colours. Sound design	As I said, I like it. But if I had something to point out is that heavy cavalry sound a lot like light cavalry. It's like there is no weight difference between light and heavy cavalry. Also there's the sound design when swordsmen attack other units, I can hear a sound that would be made by a club. Which doesn't really make much sense. These details are quite small but something that should be improved when we talk about immersion.Soundtrack is superb, I  love  it! Something that I will be listening to many years to come!  My final thoughts 	 Civilization IV is the best game so far in the whole Sid Meier’s Civilization® game series. Something that I will be playing for good three or four years to come. With superb soundtrack and funky graphics and new features, its amazing!  9/10  "

												Sadly, for all it's fluff, this is not a game worth paying for.  Civ V is the last decent Civ game, only because there were a lot of mods for it, but even unmodded it was not a bad game.  Civ VI is just crap; a company preying on the success and popularity of a title, and in the process giving Sid Meier a bad name.  If there were a way to get my $ back for this underwhelming disappointment of a game, I would go for it.  My recommendation: do not buy.Pros: Looks pretty.Cons: Not very playable, poor AI, no mod tools (yet).			"

												Much like a any Bethesda game if you come into it with certain expectations you can come out of it very satisfied. Civilization has historically always had rough launches in regards to AI, multiplayer stability, and various mechanics that need to be smoothed over by patches. So do not buy this game now if you want a polished game, Civ V is still amazing. That being said this is my favorite Civilization game. They took the best aspects of previous civs, enhanced those mechanics, and added a few new changes that really change the game for the best.

												This game improves many aspects of Civilization 5. First, diplomacy is a much more meaningful portion of the game. The addition of agendas: one random and one fixed, is a great way to make the AI leaders come alive. I was able to negotiate a truce with an AI on King difficulty, which was a difficult feat in Civlization 5. Second, the districts are an engaging new mechanic, which determines how your cities will be shaped. In the early ages, many buildings and districts get large bonuses being located near a river, as a result you often can tell how old a city is by looking at how it is layed out. The final largest change is policies. Policies and government types are a great way to customize your nation. By limiting each player to a set number of policies, which can be changed at any time for a fee, each player can tailor their nation to match their current goals.9/10.			"

												In my opinion, the cartoonish look in the characters depicted and overall graphics was a step in the wrong direction from Civilization 5. However, the core gameplay mechnaics recived a huge change. The city managing and disctrict customization is new and refreshing, as well as seperate progress trees for Government and Technology. In a year's time when there will be more DLC, the game will more than likely be a true successor to Civilization 5. In the game's current state I would recommend it, but wait for a discount if you can.			"

												I love that Civ VI is enough like Civ V so that I know how to play the game but that it's different enough to need to learn new systems. The victory conditions are much more involved, the graphics are amazing, the sound track evolves with you as you grow and advance and the voice of Sean Bean as narrator is absolutely perfect! I have over 300 hours game play on Civ V and, because of that, assumed going for a science victory would be a piece of cake. It's NOT! I've finished one game of Civ VI so far and won on score alone because I did not plan my cities in a way so that I could get a science win. I can't wait to start a second game and put some of the ideas I have after playing once into play and see if that helps. In short, I'm having a blast learning this game. It's, to me, the perfect addition to the Civilization series!Editing because I forgot to mention what I didn't like about the game. I wish the Builders lasted longer than 3 jobs!! I don't like not being able to see countries/city-states I don't have really good relationships with (can *see* them but not in bold colorful detail). Those are the two main things. I have an issue with religion and it's spread but, in all honesty, I think my issue is that I don't understand how freaking FAST my neighbor country was able to spawn so many apostles so fast. My cities were converted before I could benefit from my own religion.			"

												Absolute positive. At first, it seems to be simple (tech tree, city management, etc.) But later time it is complex and interesting (science, civs, etc.). Graphics is nice, however completely different from previous CIV 5. I found only a few bad things, like lack of roads, crazy AI attaking without any sense, etc....but later on there are ways to go.Playing more, I still keep my rating positive. But there are many issues makes me nervous.- AI is dumb.- City states stockpile unrealistic amount of units.- Due to this, unable to move on the map to anywhere- After a while, evrybody hates evrybody, especially you.- Due to this, no way to trade.- Diplomacy is marginal. Make no sense to spend any time on it.- Religion: same as diplomacy. Do not have prophet or have it: does not matter.- Reach Democracy, Communism, etc. as soon as possible. After that, do not spend a minute on civics. - Added value of many of late game civics are marginal.  All in all, much better than Beyond Earth :)			"

												It's civilization. What do you want, a real review? Fiiiiiiine.For the most part, civilization continues from civ 5 rather then civ 4, using hex tiles and the one unit per tile limit that some people did not enjoy in civ 5. Personally I feel this allows for more thought in city placement and unit movement, but the 1 unit per tile debate has lasted for too long with no concensus from either side, so let's abandon it.The biggest change would be districts and wonders actually occupying a tile around your city. This allows the player to be a bit more thoughtfull with what they build and where to maximise a cities output.Leader agenda's (goals they strive for or appreciate) are also a nice addition to the game, allowing you to manipulate the AI's opinion of you more directly.Speaking of AI, it could use improvement. Early in the game, they're rather capable. Churning out units like no tomorrow. But during the medieval ages, they sorta forget to upgrade their units. They'll be the swarm. Lots of units, but all ♥♥♥♥♥♥ compared to up-to-date units. After losing a war, they'll climb back up purely because they have to build the up-to-date units, but otherwise they are in a quagmire and continuesly sinking.All in all though, it's a promising start for a civ game. Civ 4 and 5 both had their rocky starts and improved greatly with their expansions, but Civ 6 has a fairly solid beginning. It will be interesting to see how much more it will improve with expansions.			"

												My experience with Civ6 has compelled me to write my first ever steam review. I really would like to recommend this game, but in its current state the game has enough problems that you should wait some time for them to all get hammered out. Fortunately most of the issues seem very fixable. A bit of background, I've played every civ game since 2, logged almost 300 hours on Civ5 and have logged almost 75 hours on civ6, having beat my last playthrough on Emperor difficulty. The Good: I really like the new district system. It's added a level of complexity and 'urban planning' to the game that previous iterations lacked. It encourages you to develop many cities rather than stacking 10 wonders in your power capital like you would do in previous civs. The new cultural, policy, and government system is also a welcomed new addition. The added flexibility is nice versus in Civ5 where once you had made policy decisions you were stuck with them for the rest of the game.The eureka/inspiration system is also a cool way to add side quests to your decisions to help boost a certain policy or technology. Finally, having great people actually do different things is another interesting way to vary up gameplay, although it would be nice if some of the writing/artist/music great people could do something other than create great works. The Ok: I don't think the new city-state 'envoy' system is an improvement. I do like the unique bonuses that each city state can give you, but I think civ5's system of actively courting (well, bribing) city-states to be your friend was a stronger system. I do like how happiness (now called amenities) is now per city, but it's so easy to maintain happiness level that building as many cities as possible is the best possible strategy. In civ5, there were repercussions to building/conquering too many cities, and I think civ6 went too far in the opposite direction.I don’t mind the new art style and there are some changes to the map and UI that are helpful, such as lenses that give more pertinent information about the map based on context (such as seeing religion levels when moving a religious unit), but for some odd reason a lot of useful features have been taken out of the UI. For example, in most information screens, you can’t sort information. Scrolling through a list of 20 cities to see which one is producing the most science becomes more difficult than it should.  The Not So Good: As has been said in many other reviews, the A.I. has problems. Contrary to what I've seen others say, I actually find the A.I. in the early game to be somewhat respectable. Despite the fact that they sometimes are hyper-aggressive, it is challenging to fight them, along with the ever roaming barbarians. However, part of this early challenge is due to how bad the A.I. cheats on harder difficulties. On my emperor playthrough, every other civilization I encountered had 2-3 cities with multiple workers and military units within the first 30 turns. I had barely built my first worker. When the A.I. declared war on me, units appeared to just spawn from nowhere. I don't mind a challenge, but spawning units for free in a game like this is very frustrating. Because of these bonuses, the AI will also completely dominate in culture/science. I think in the year 200 A.D., I saw Kongo change its government to a Democracy and enter the modern era. 200 A.D.! Yet despite all this cheating, the A.I. has major flaws in the mid to late game that makes them nearly harmless towards the end game. For one, once they've built around 5 cities, they stop.  They will try to conquer each other (and you), but their tactical management of units isn't very good. But this biggest issue, is that for some reason, the A.I. will not upgrade their units. An A.I. in the atomic era will still have spearmen and slingers. One tank army can almost single handedly destroy an entire A.I.’s military. I'd almost wish they'd cheat and spawn throngs of tanks and infantry to just provide a challenge, but after the medieval era, they just stop caring about their military.And to pile on to the diplomacy-side of things, once you decide to conquer a city, you can forget about diplomacy for the rest of the game. Warmonger penalties, even for wars you didn't start, cannot be surmounted with any amount of diplomatic good will. For a frame of reference, an Alliance is worth +18 in relationship with the A.I. Conquering one city is -15. Conquer two cities, and you are at -30, and your ally will denounce you. Never mind you conquered the cities of a civilization your ally is also at war with. It's nonsensical. Beyond the A.I., there are a few other issues. The pace of the game doesn't feel right. I think it's because you can now 'research' two trees at once, so you get through the tech and policy trees faster. Eureka and inspiration bonuses also cause this. In Civ5, I would reach a certain era at least within a century of when that era actually happened in history (e.g., industrial era around 1800 A.D.). In civ6, I discovered flight in 1100 A.D. This is on standard speed. It feels like there are gaps in both trees that might get filled in with new techs in later expansions, so hopefully this issue improves over time. The Biggest Issue: If you were new to the civilization franchise, there really would be no reason to play Civ6 over Civ5. Every civilization game has been fairly different than the previous. Whether you liked Civ5 over Civ4 or not, no one can deny that Civ5 was a completely different experience than Civ4. Civ6 feels like Civ5 with a few things refactored. And with the current A.I. and pacing issues, Civ6 isn't as enjoyable as Civ5. The Good News: Nearly everything that bothers me about Civ6 seems easily fixable. I remember when Civ5 first came out, it had a lot of problems, but with two expansions and many patches, it is a really good game. Civ6 feels like it is a few balancing patches and one expansion away from being a good game. The glaring omission of a United Nations in Civ6 leads me to believe the nearly absent diplomacy of this game will be fixed in the future.So, should you buy this game now? No, don't waste your time. Buy Civ5 if you haven't already or if you already have Civ5 then start another Civ5 game. Or try another 4x game. But just like Civ5, give this game a year or two to hammer out it's issues and it will probably be great.			"

												I will start off by saying I have not played Civ V or Beyond Earth. The last one I played was IV, so It's been a while. Overall the game is quite entertaining. I have had a lot of fun playing a online game with a friend. However, a few things as of right now prevent me from recommending this game.--Cons-AI actions are a bit strange. Rome for centuries just stacked warriors as I played as his German friend across the water. He had no stats that showed that he disliked me, constantly complemented me, and we even announced our friendship. However, when I sent a settler a good distance from his one city( Mind you he had only Rome after centuries) he sent his legions of warriors and chariots(I had knights and eventually musketeers ) over to surround his  ""friend""s new found border. Then declared war right when the frienship expired. I just don't get the behavior. (Played difficulty: Warlord)-Game Killing bugs: Several times have run ito issues of game progress stopping. Says a unit needs order, but everyone has moved and will not progress. Played Multi with my friend and after our turn, the AI would not finish their turn. I recommend saving a lot, atleast every 20 turns if you do play.--Personal Con/RantI am not a fan of their leader picking, it is extremely odd and forced. Gorgo being the main example, barely mentioned anywherein history besides being Leonidas's wife. Greatest achievement was scraping some wax off of a tablet that had an encoded message.  She did not rule anything, her husband however did.(Even after his death, her son was king and  Cleombrotus the tutor) So if you want to play the we need more women game, pick one that makes sense and actually did something. Historically most nations were ruled by men; Sorry. Same goes for Catherine of France, was excluded from ruling  by the Kind, sons took over afterwars. Joan of Arc would have been a better choice.--End RantPros- --The art style in my opinon is awesome. Great work. Creates a fun feel to the game.--The tutorial is a great refresher, I recommend it.--Game mechanics work well and make for some good strategies and competition.-- Sean Bean :)End Note: I will gladly change my review, when the bugs have been worked out and the AI acts a bit more reasonable.Though if you don't mind the cons I listed and can hold out, then I say go for it.

												Civilzation VI is a wonderful addition the Civilzation series. Personally, I believe this is probably my favourite Civ game and has done better than Civilization V (Don't get me wrong Civ 5 was amazing, had tons of fun) But here's my sum up of the game.Pros :- Movement and Combat looks and feels great, especially the unique animation when a unit deals the killing blow; I thought this was an amazing touch on the game.- The game runs so smoothly, I have had no performance issues as of yet and since writing this I have 8 hours. Not a single frame drop, no random crashes; just an all round smooth experience- City Management/Development, I love the new district addition. It really makes the cities easier to manage and helps give you certain buffs that can get you out of a sticky situation. That said, it also makes a great addition to sieging cities. If you can work out what districts are helping a city or civ out the most, that can be your priority instead of going straight for the actual city.- Great Persons. The new great persons screen makes life so much easier to see how far away you are from grabbing your next great person, you can see exactly what you need, what civ is closer to getting them and they all seem to provide better buffs than last time.- Barbarians, last Civ, barbarians were hardly a challenge. A few units and you could rid them for basically your whole game time. Now thats not the case, straight from the off barbarians are a HUGE threat (In my first game I got demolished by 4-5 barbarian units on the 7th turn) completely wasnt expecting it and it set me back far enough that by the time i'd cleared up the mess, all the other civs were miles ahead and there was no way back (I proceeded to lose the game by getting wiped out by good old England)- AI Improvements (sort of) So the AI is a tricky one but their battling decision are thousands of times better, there are no unguarded settlers or workers, units move around together and they dont send one petty unit at your horde of warriors. They seem to have their heads screwed on a bit and make it more difficult to win.So thats just some of the pros but there are plenty more! Cons:- AI Issues (sort of) so again I ended the pros saying the AI in war are very clever; thats not saying they're perfect elsewhere. I got denounced by someone simply because my army wasnt large enough to meet their standards. There was no war, they just didnt like the fact I was playing peaceful, I had enough units to defend myself but clearly not enough to class me as worthy. Also trading is a bit stupid. I got offered one luxury resource for a reasonable price. I tried adjusting it to see if I could get a better deal, but once you've adjusted, theres no going back, the older deal has been withdrawn and you can't get it again. - Artwork (Weak point) So this point is VERY weak and hasnt really affected gameplay too much. But surprisingly im not going to say I hate the new style, in fact I love the new style! But, I tend to play Pedro (Brazil) and that gives you a start bias of Rainforest, but oh my god, the rainforest design is a mess. Especially when theres loads of it together, its incredibly hard to see everything. I tried turning resource Icons on for a second. Nope that just made the mess worse, instead I just sacrificed part of my bonus and cut down the rainforest as its just a mess. Other than that the art work is fine. Oh, the fog of war is cool too, I dont know why everyone is complaining about that.- Bugs (Again weak point) So I havent actually experienced any of these bugs, but im speaking on behalf of people who have. Yes, this game has bugs. But jesus, its been out for one day. I dont really know a game that has came out completely flawless of bugs. Plus they're hardly game breaking. Ultimately, this game isn't perfect, but hardly any game is now. But this game is great! If bugs are going to annoy you, hold off. But if you love the Civ Series, I really doubt this game will let you down!			"

This game is a very good edition to the Civilization series. I enjoy the AI and how they are much smarter (even the barbarians). However, they are really annoying. Within the first 10 turns the Aztecs declared war on me as I had another luxury that he did not. As this happened, the other civs that he befriended within those 10 turns also instantly declared war on me. As this happened the next 2 turns were equally as worse. I had met 3 other civs (playing on Continents) of whom instantly denounced me. They are really hard to befriend. Even after 300 turns of one game.I do miss the feature that you can't rename cities or religions (or I just can't read). But you can rename units and put them into ""Corps"" or ""Armies"" which is very useful (basically a hybrid army that consists of 2 or 3 of the same unit).This game is amazing. I would recommend buying it, only if you are willing to do some research, learn the game and play much more aggresively than you normally would in any other Civ game.			"

												I really want to give the game a positive review but they need major patch work to AI and new systems first.+ Beautiful+ Unit stacking in mid to late game+ Districts+ In many ways an improvement on previous games- Diplomacy is broken or misexecuted (relationships don't exist & are essentially meaningless)- Promise system needs major work- AI as pertains to agendas and diplomacy is not good (the principle behind the changes is great, just poorly executed)- Warmongering and Cassus Beli needs to be rebalanced (it is crippling)- Religious combat is a bit strange (having hordes of apostles storm your territory is a major annoyance)- Many other small gripes revolving mainly around AI			"

												- Don't know why people are giving this game so much hate, personally i think that this CIV game is quite good, ive played many CIV games over the years for many many hours and i think CIV 6 is a wonderful addition to the series.- Sure there are some bugs with it, but honestly ask yourself what game have you ever played thats released and not had any bugs, this game isnt unplayable, there are some exploits but if you wanna play the game without them then just dont use them easy as that.- The game takes alot less to run than previous games which is nice- I love the new army managment system it allows you to mass a much larger and powerful army for less cost per turn and easily moving units as Squadrons instead of individual single units. (combining up to three of the same units together)- The faith and diplomacy are great and will be better once the few bugs have been fixed with it and when they expand on it- Love the new map layout/design as well as the character models.- All the difficulties are harder than in previous games which is a nice addition- Game feels like CIV 5 with a major upgrade in a very good way-Love that you dont get as bad effects of having multiple cities, you can make as many cities to your hearts content without any major debuffs affecting you- A downside would be that the AI need adjusting, they sometimes get angry for no reason or make very very unfair trade offers, for example AI: Give me all your resources and 30 gold per turn for 90 turns and i will give you 1 gold, and while your at it you might as well give me 4 of your cities. With saying that you can still alter the deals to make them more fair and they will generally accept the deal- Another downside is that the Teams option isnt implamented in the game yet in multiplayer and singleplayer modes, but you can alter a game file to activate the Teams option on bothOverall i think the game is amazing and cant wait for DLC to come out to expand the game even further			"

The map tells you a story and it’s a beautiful one.  Fans of Strategy games or just people who like good games, you will enjoy this.  The tutorial is well done and makes it the easiest CIv game to introduce new players into the genre.  The voice and sounds are on par with what you would expect, I don't think they will ever surpass Leonard Nimoy’s voice acting from 4, but it was pretty close this time around. This one feels like it's already had an expansion and I think that was the best move they could have made.			"

												VERY overtuned.Barbarians will swarm you to no end within the first 10 turns, forcing you to poor all your production into combat units.  Did I mention they're up farther than you in the tech tree with horseback riding, archers, and spearmen?While you're fighting off the 20 Barbarian units knocking on your door, you'll find some leader.  This leader HATES that you are either not expanding or have a big army.  Guess who else wants to kill you now?Lastly, the district system.  You can't build everything in your main city, meaning you have to juggle the new housing system, the new amenitiesm system, in adition to having to occupy various tiles for their districts, which you can't build anyway due to those barbarians.And, no, you CAN'T block the barbarians from finding your capital.  In most cases they will find it on Turn 2.Save yourself some money and go back to Civ 5.			"

Have your workers cut down trees to spam out more workers, then start  building other things.Step 8: Focus on building commercial then campus districts. Build encampments only in emergencies.Step 9: Stay defensive for a while and spam out traders to create infrastructure for future mass produtction of military units.Step 10: Find a good target for your first war of ""Liberation"" and mass up an army and laugh when you have them outnumbered over 2:1 and out teched.This is not a brokenly OP strategy at all.

												I think people are being way too hard on this game. Sure the AI is awful, Sure there are a few bugs here, sure there are certain things that bug me about the game, and sure the AI is complete garbage. But if we look back at Civ 5 for instance I think we'll soon find that the AI back at launch was terrible as well and it was missing several things from Civ 4 such as religion. Civ 6 doesn't do this to us and instead includes nearly all the features of Civ 5 from launch with promises of DLC on the way. Civ 5 vanilla was a decent game but the DLC's are what really made it shine and I think that with some bug fixes, DLC's, and community made content this game will grow to become just as good if not better than any other civilization game. Now does this mean the developers get off the hook easily? No not at all, the AI is one of the biggest things holding the game back and it obviously needs tweaking, but multiplayer is still fun and fighting incompetent AI's can be fun from a purely non competitive stance. So in conclusion,-Please tweak the AI so it's somewhat competent-Continue giving us patches to address some of the more common complaints-Oh and also can we name cities like in civ 5 that was one of my favorite parts in multiplayer plz (although I do love the unit naming mechanic)Overall Civ 6 has a lot of room to grow and improve and despite all its flaws I would still recommend it to anyone looking to check it out because there's a lot of good stuff in here.7/10			"

												2K is one of the worst. Don't buy it now like I did. Wait for a stable release, when it doesn't crash or hang at loading. Why pay full price to line their pockets for a half baked game... It will also drop in price with time, so just as an added bonus! Now with that out of the way. About the game: I can sum it up in one word. Pointless. I have always enjoyed the Civ series, but this version really doesn't offer much value. I'm not a fan of the sprawl effect. I really didn't find the micromanagement that came with selection city tiles enjoyable. And I hated the fact that the tech tree only went so far. There was so much room for more that could have been designed into it. At least some near future tech would have been fun to build and play with.  Civ 5 went farther and was by far the more interesting. But if your a fan, by all means try it. Just wait until a more stable release and the eventual price drop!			"

												Between scouts not starting with the ability to move freely through rough terrain, rough terrain not enterable if you only have one move point left, and not being able to build roads wherever you want, my scouts are only moving like one tile per turn. What's the point? Might as well have a horse do their job.Also the fog of war map, while a cool concept, is really visually indistinct. The unexplored parts are the same color as the explored-but-unseen parts and it's really irritating.Workers can only build three things. Then you have to build another worker! Between this and the scouts, the early game is much slower than civ 4 and 5.All that being said, as far as I can tell the developers appear to be listening to a few of the complaints (they eventually put the ability to name your cities back in, which wasn't in from the start for some reason), so it'll likely eventually be worth buying. Maybe wait until after the expansions are released.			"

												Right now, I cannot recommend this game.  I had to stop playing because the late game turns into a slog of issuing and reissuing orders to trader and spy units.  Turn times are still long... even with the game installed on an SSD.The UI is designed poorly.  Bright/cartoony map colors and art styles blend in with every bit of information or indication that you need to play the game.  It's hard to see what you need to see.  Units auto-cycle at a slow pace after getting orders, leading to many misclicks.  You may even plan to move two units.  They're right next to each other.  Seems intuitive you'd move one right after the other.  Nope.  Move one.  Expect to move the other (there's a delay... everything in Civ 6 comes with a delay).  Next thing you know, the game lumbers across to the other side of the world so you can switch to planning a trade route in the middle of a battle.You do a lot of trade route planning.  Sid Meier's Trader Planning Simulator 2016 would be a more appropriate title.  Right now I got 10 trade routes that I have to reassign to the same cities... at a pace of about once per ten turns.  So every ten turns, I have to issue one hundred trade route orders.  That's a lot of orders.  Each one takes a bit of time as the game processes your clicks, a second or two at a time.  That is, if you don't misclick during these delays.Many of the game features seem simplified compared to past titles.  Potentially deep and meaningful things like espionage and religion are very shallow and don't seem compelling or useful.  Civilization is a game about numbers and data.  These two modes could be shut off entirely with little impact on the game itself.  Missionary combat is another layer of warfare.  However, it's just two melee units vying for what amounts to a miniscule bonus.  But hey, they seem to put a lot of work into the animations... which I turned off because turns take forever if everyone has to show me their little song and dance.The game doesn't suffer from any performance issues as far as I can tell.  It just is designed to move at a slower pace.  A one second delay here, a one second delay there... it adds up.Sluggish, unresponsive, and at times, buggy UI frustrates.  Tedious reassignment of trader and spy units bogs the late game almost as much as the turn times.  You can move through 250 turns pretty easily.  The next 50 will start to frustrate you more.  The AI still doesn't know what it is doing.  Only now you get the benefit of hunting for the data you want.  Why is a leader suddenly unfriendly towards you?  Search in the submenus.  You'll find it.  Well, you won't find what you want to know.  You'll find some numbers without explanation.  Some leader ""agendas"" that often contradict each other.  China's leader was threatened by the number of world wonders I had, but yet also looked down on me because my culture was low.There are also some weird unit design quirks.  Catapults and archers can shoot twice as far as machine guns and rangers.  I tried to research the effective range of ancient weapons.  The ballista seemed like it had the longest real world range at 800 meters.  Guns can shoot further.  It might fit in with some idea of balance in the game, but it doesn't make sense.Combat also seems to move at a slower pace due to a new design in movement points.  You now need a full two points if you hope to move on to those hills.  Don't expect a unit to move into a grassland and then into a forest unless you've got special upgrades.  From a balance perspective, ranged units are now much more powerful due to the lack of mobility.  Your melee unit can get stuck moving one square at a time as archers obliterate it.  Or, you can roll across a continent picking off the enemy AI's suicide runs.  They throw weak melee units at you all day with little tactical planning.  Their archers are formidable.  But they don't use any kind of coordination.  With support units, combat is now more about the bonus from adjacent tiles.  I think this just makes the AI ever weaker.If you do want to wage war, prepare for your entire game to be about warfare.  The AI seems to remember everything bad thing you do and forget the good things.  Lucrative trade deal for +10 relationship bonus?  Gone in a few turns.  Raze a city in 2600 BC?  Well, everyone hates you in the modern era because of it... even the AI on other continents.30 hours in and I find myself rage quitting because of these nagging issues.  Save your money.  Wait for some DLC's.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Civ series so I'm really sorry to not be able to recommend this game.The AI is what makes Civ a great strategy game series; whether it's the backstabbing Montezuma, the calculating Queen Elizabeth or the reliable old friend Ghandhi -- they're your opponents.  The very artificial intelligence in Civ 6 cannot win battles, accept (or offer) good deals for both parties, and is schizophrenically erratic where it comes to decisions of war and peace.On my very first and only game (on prince -- where the AI and I are on equal footing), I managed to have war declared on me twice and I built fewer than ten military units the whole game.  The first time I easily conquered France (who declared war on me for some reason), while the second time Greece accused me of sending missionaries into their territory -- which I didn't even do.  After conquering them both without losing a single unit, I decided to focus on technology.  At the point I reached the atomic age, I realized that culture was like tech for civics.  Ooops.  And then I got a message that my largest rival Civ (who had a greater population) had just entered the Renaissance.The AI can't even beat me in my first game -- how is this a challenge?  People gave Mafia 3 terrible reviews despite the solid graphics, great voice acting, and fun basic mechanics mostly becausse of a terminally moronic AI.  That's very much the case here as the sound track, leader animinations, voiceovers, and possibly good mechanics (we'll never know without a worthy opponent).  However, at least in Mafia 3 the AI had discovered gunpowder before I finished the game.			"

												   At this point, Civilization VI is a watered down version of V that fixed one flaw of the previous game, but enhanced the endless endgame and the terrible diplomacy.     Just so you know where I'm coming from--I loved Civilization Revolution and that got me started on Civ V.  It was a beautiful game and a nice step up from the simplicity of Revolution while maintaining the same feel.  However, after playing a round or two the problems became clear.  That being said, I still enjoyed it enough to play hundreds of hours.  I can't say the same for VI.   Civilization VI moves the happiness system back into the background so it's no longer an issue, but the diplomacy is worse than V was.  No matter how you treat your allies, the moment the alliance ends they will join the denouncing circle of poo that always seems to form.  Every turn you will be denounced by the people you just fought off for being a warmonger--until they declare war on you, only to loose--and then everyone else declares war as well.     In short, while I enjoy aspects of this game, I won't even bother to play it again except as a guilty pleasure for the short fun periods of initially arranging your empire before you have to deal with the endless slog of stupid AIs and the ten hours it takes to actually finish things. /End Rant.

												I was a little sceptical at first, the only other Civilization games i've played previously were Civilization 5 and Civilization: Beyond Earth, at first I wasn't a big fan of the cartoon-y look of the graphics that were put into Civilization 6, however after playing a full game from start to victory, the layout of the game took a bit of getting use to but very shortly i became familiar with the new layout and quickly was starting to feel very similar to Civilization 5, something i was noticing midway through the game was everything was starting to feel a little too easy, the highest difficulty i've played on in other Civilization games was Prince, when victory finally came i felt i could have very easily clicked on Just One More Turn but i felt that round was too easy and i was excited to try difficulty King or Emperor or maybe even Immortal for my next round.

												Abysmal game... just abysmal.  Worse than Civ V on pretty much every level.The game is so laggy, slow (and I'm running this on an top end i7/gtx970 rig) and just poorly designed it baffles me to how any one can give this game a thumbs up.  So many small changes that are just endlessly infuriating.  Units now move much slower, so just getting around the map (something that was already slow) is now ridiculously annoying.  Barbarians are everywhere, so now scouts are just fodder if not endlessly micromanaged.  Scouting is a complete PITA.  Loading saved games, ridiculously slow.  Trade and diplomacy, so slow.  Its like every action you would perform in Civ V, the equivalent in Civ VI take 3-4x longer.  Its just... so painfull to play.Civics are a mess, districts unbalanced and buggy, wonders need an empty tile (so you now have no room to build anything), workers are consumed on use???  Clearly I want to do nothing but build workers the entire game.  The tech tree is now, for all intents and purposes, linear (no jumping ahead a bit to get an early wonder).Stay away... stay far away.			"

												I don´t recommend this game. I´ve played Civ 2,3, 4 and 5 and  I´ve liked them all have a few hundred hourse of gameplay.What I don´t like about civ6:-City management. I like to have total control of what is produced and in which tile. You can no longer ""go into the city"", but you are able to micro manage, but it´s too many clicks away and it´s buggy.-""Set city focus"" is buggy, in civ5 you could easily change from production to food. Now you have to click like 5 times to change from one to an other.-You can´t view city production at the same time as managing citizens. This is annoying as well, especially when if you like to micromanage like me.-The splitting of the tech and civ trees. I played on ""Prolonged"" game speed and still felt like the research is too fast. I end up with just clicking on something in the civ tree.-Feels like they have made civ 6 ""simplified"". I can´t exacly explain why but it feels like that. Maybe to reach a broader audience?That´s what I came up with after a few hours of playing this game. I gave it a chance but the things above is too annoying for me to enjoy this game. It´s not for me. now I´m going back to civ 5.  "

												I really like this game. I like the Artwork and Atmosphere and I think the changes with the districts was a great Idea. Sadly the ""intelligent"" AI is as I actually kind of expected not really that smart. I would really like to vote for ""needs some rework"", but as that doesn't exist I will vote for recommend, as all in all it's fine. I mean I always like the civ series, but the AI is kind of always bothering me. Also I'm not that happy with some of the fighting mechanics.So, what bothers me about the AI (I played twice on emporer)?Trading with the AI can be horrible. I mean sometimes you can try to give them 2 luxury ressources for 1 and even then they're not happy. Then again you can get your spies back for 1 gold over 25 turns, despite you just ignored them when they asked you not to spy in their territory. They're lack of overall strategy. I was at war with an AI, they attacked the city  state I was allied with and killed all units there. After that they just continued without even pillaging something (including my trade routes). Other situation, I declared war and tried to attack a city. I saw that he was coming with quite some units and retreated a bit. He just keept attacking me for some time with single units and after that I took the city without problems. Another situation I had a completly defensless city (I got it from a peace treaty earlier) and declared war because I wanted his capitol and did expect to loose my city, but I didn't care. Well he didn't even attack my city -.- It's totally oblivious to the hole Situation and I actually wouldn't even mind if the AI would cheat here a bit more in sense of information.The agendas of the different AI's have sometimes really weird triggers and I have the feeling that it hinders them sometimes to work together because they have each other as much as me. It really needs some mechanics that they're working together also if they hate themself. I mean in my second game I was warmongering the whole time, but noone really cared. One declared war on me, but never attacked... I mean the only reason I made peace sometimes was because the unhapiness of my towns would skyrocket with warweariness. I personally think a city shouldn't have warweariness if it's not really close to the battles and there is no counter war propaganda (new options for spies?).Now something about the combat system. I really don't like it how it is now. This adding of stats is absolutely stupid. I had the situation where I didn't want to attack a catapult with my legion, because it would just have been a minor victory or so. His unit had defender of the belief (+10 melee strengh) makes with basic stats 33 melee vs 40 melee + he gets his +2 from the difficulty so it's already on 35, a standard swordsman. Meaning also the catapult does probably more damge when defending against an attack then when doing a ranged attack... This is just ridiculous. Stuff like this happens when you try to make stuff to simple. It makes sense to have stats, but I would strictly divide stats and bonus damage. Stats are used to compute a basic damage and afterwards you get some boni lets say for AT against tanks (in percent of the base damage). The stats would be only the main stats + unit upgrades			"

												Well I have recently started playing Civ 6. And as a long time fan of the series somethings I say are meant only for those whom have that similar experience.1st off I am biased. I loved CIV5 to the point where I didn't know how they could improve it in a meaningful way. Pros - Civ 6 Has a decent flow to it. It seems slower in some regards but more or less a better progression. It is divergent your thinking about economy, religion, war, money, trade in a much more cohesive and meanigful manner. It is vastly a step up in this regard.Cons - I think the harsh UI change from Civ5 to CIv6 is not so much an art direction issue as it is hard to look at. There are issues like UI/lines that are too contrast focused with white and blue glaring lines for country outlines etc. The AI is excessively dumb.  ( this was in civ 5 too I don't know why they still have such stupid tactics by relying on attacking you with overwhelming odds. For one, every attack is preceded by troop build up near by you ( giving away their strength, numbers, and position ) in real life this would never be a smart tactic and ultimately it just makes you get prepared. In civ its much easier to defend than it is to attack. Secondly I feel like the game's focus on fighting a relgiious war and a physical war is smart but its also time intensive away from the point of the game. But the point of the game moves back and forth from physical, to spirtual, to well you'll see. That's a plus but what I am getting at is that even though the religous wars have meaning they don't make me happy to say the least as a gamer its boring, and it can lead to wars with nations that agro you with religion. Lastly every god damn AI in this game either hates me or wants to hate me very 30 seconds and pretty much fore the rest of the game. I get it that they are triggered by your actions but boy these narcissistic AI's remind me of social justice warriors they always get ticked off when you need to attack a neighboring country that's about to attack you. It's excessive, especially when envoys are coming to write you in the dark ages or earlier every two seconds from around the world. I'll leave you with this and since its early I may change my review at a later date right now  I think it was an impossible task to improve upon Civ5. I don't think this one will keep my interest like civ 5 did. But I will play it. Its kind of like going from civ2 to civ3. Civ2 was an equal to civ 5 in its performance updates. This is a step backwards a bit more like windows 4.0...I give it a 5.5/10			"

												How quickly people forget. The AI in previous Civ games was not exactly genius. They just increased the difficulty level artificially. The AI & balancing in a strategy game like the Civilization series will always be a work in progress. At this point I consider patches almost to be content updates because it changes the way you play and adds replayability.The game is vastly superior to Civ V and takes the franchise in the right direction.

												Currently the game is very close to unplayable for me.  For starters a lot of the features are missing f/ earlier versions.  Why can I not put units on sentry?  They're either fortified, and thus let enemies walk by, or awake.  The civilopedia is woefully inadequate for explaining features and details about the wonders/units/etc.  Seems more time was spent on the fluff.Finally we reach the main reason for this review and my inability to recommend this game.  Google ""Civ 6 game crash"" and behold the realy joy of this game.  In my specific example I'm playing as China and in the game about 200 turns or so.  Everytime I click end turn the game crashes down to desktop.  I've done all the suggestions (declare war on AI, change policies, etc) and game crashes now everytime.  I suppose I could just start another and save the China one till the patch fixes it, but I'm worried I'll spend another few hundred turns in the game only to be denied finishing the game.  What's funny is they rushed like mad to nerf the chopping of trees outside borders, deleting units and getting gold, etc but actual game breaking bugs that make the game unplayable can wait it seems.TLDR: Game is unplayable, unless you enjoy risking wasting your time getting stuck w/ a crash to desktop.  Combined w/ missing basic features that every Civ in recent years has shipped w/ it's the first time I'm giving a negative review to a Civilization game..			"

The game doesn't feel complete and I suspect they intend to finish it with DLC rather than enhance it with DLC.

												Da Good:- Game runs butter smooth compared to the previous one.- New game mechanics feel a lot more in depth, and solid in this game. Brings much more variety and strategy into the game.- You can always see your relations to other nations, since their icons as well as their opinion of you are all right on the game screen. Don't have to access a menu to see it.- Great nation music themes that build up over the course of time. Not as sleepy and boring as previously.- Despite being different than it's predecessor, the game is suprisingly easy to get into, and to learn the basics.- Great animations of the leaders, very well done and charming.- Overall a lot more clear, better to see what's currently happening, despite not forcing everything right into your face.- Good art style, despite many people complaining about it. It's not as cartoony as some claim.Da Bad:- Main menu music is still almost as annoying as in CIV V.- There seems to be some kind of bug with the music while in match.- Mulitplayer seems also a bit buggy to set up.- Greece is the only nation that let's you choose between two leaders.- No option to set unit on ""alert"" so it will activate once enemy is near. Which conflicts with auto end turn. Meaning the game will end the turn despite a unit being in attacking range.- Not many different religions to found.- Not many maps to pick from. But since you have a random map, i assume there are infinite maps. But it'd be nice to have more premade maps. Especially earth like!Overall i still recomment this game, because i think that the buggy parts will be patched out soon. And despite the content being a little thin, it is still a very solid game that runs MUCH less frustating than the previous one.			"

												Civilization VI is better at launch than the GOTY edition of Civilization V. You can safely ignore the few negative reviews of Civilization VI. I had doubts myself before buying the game, but most of that was due to the disappointment of Civilization V. Gone are the permanent, nazi policies of Civilization V. In terms of policies, this game is much more fluid, similar to Civilization IV. Gone are the settler spamming ♥♥♥♥♥s of Civilization V, as settlers now increase in production cost. Gone is the 100% no unit stacking garbage of Civilization V. Now, you can stack complimentary units, and also combine identical units as you research corps. Civilization VI at launch is already better than the GOTY edition of Civilization V, and it can only get better with dlc.			"

												Feels more tedious than previous Civ games.  There is a higher degree of variability in resources and choices but that doesn’t seem to translate to a more dynamic experience.  Between all the various civ, tech, policy, adjacency and other bonuses I often find myself feeling like it was less of a hassle to just build what my advisor suggested than bother with all the math – rendering all the depth of the new version rather hollow.  I don’t doubt that with several playthroughs you could really figure out how to maximize a civilization’s potential, but that feels more tedious than epic.  All of this is thrown into even starker contrast with the AI, which doesn’t seem to be any more dynamic than previous versions.There’s some creative stuff in the game (districts are interesting, wonders on the map, separate science and culture trees).  Without the benchmark of previous Civ games it would probably seem pretty good, but high expectations have been set and not met.			"

To them I say: Yes they have always been screwing us and frankly they shouldn't be. Include it in the game or the expansions or give some free love for all the money we give you.Edit: Oh also fix cross platform PC - Mac capabilities. You said you would do it months ago.Also, add more future tech and units.I mean incorporate some technologies of the future, the game shouldn't stop at 2020, then have a gap and some how there is a space victory. Read some stuff from technologists to incorporate, there could be satellites, there could be space ships in the above layer. Who knows.			"

												Alright so this is more of a first impressions kind of thing. I'm not going to talk about any technical issues because whining about the tech issues that the game has currently (such as the audio bug) all have fixes available, and if you take that or take the advice of someone who's PC doesn't match specs who says that this game is bad because they can't read or research then I'm afraid you're easily misled.Anyway, moving on. I would write a full-blown review but I haven't played it for anywhere near as long as I would like to so I'll hold off on that for now and just briefly describe what I like and dislike.Pros:- Building and managing cities is sigificantly more challenging and strategy is more heavily involved. Gone are the days where you can build as much as you wanted with ease, as well as the days where you could have 1 or 2 cities but still have literally every building and unit in the game due to ridiculously high production.- The soundtrack is astoundingly good. Christopher Tin and Geoff Knorr have done it again, every piece of music is beautifully crafted and thus easily surpasses any other soundtrack released this year. Doom, Mankind Divided, Shadow Warrior 2 - they all had good soundtracks but anything with Christopher Tin's touch is automatically skyrocketed into the realms of god-tier music.- The aesthetic is pretty. It doesn't look overly cartoony and it's a nice lick of fresh paint for the game. I absolutely adore the fog of war too, the map doesn't go dark and foggy when your units move around; instead the map looks more like.. well, a map. There's some wonderful post-processing and I think that the textures look magnificent. You have to bare in mind that Civ is NOT intended to compete with games like Crysis 3 or Battlefield 1, the game is meant to set new standards for 4X games and those games have never been about visual fidelity or how pretty a polygon looks. But saying that the game is really, really good looking, there's great details that I continue to discover as I play.- The UI isn't as dire as everyone says it is. To say that it's a chore to use or that it's ugly would imply that it's in the realms of Beyond Earth's UI which truly was awful. The UI in Civ VI is closer to Civ V but it does lack some key information (such as eras). However, most of the information that you'll need is presented to you - the research screen tells you how far you are in comparison to other empires that you have met, as well as what research you need and what it'll allow you to do (as expected). - Builders are no longer overpowered. They - as well as other great people - are limited use. Great people were always limited use but they act similarly to builders in that some of them have 2 or 3 people within the 'unit'. That will allow you 2 or 3 uses of said unit, builders can build 3 improvements until they're all used up which will prompt you to either build more or focus on districts to try to capitalise on housing and production.- Culture researching is a welcome addition. Culture isn't as limited as it was in Civ V (it was pretty good, but Civ VI does it better). It allows you to change your government and policies, which will allow you to shape your empire into something different every time - so long as you're the kind of player who enjoys experimenting, rather than going for the policies and tactics which are always going to win.- There's lots of pros to this game, but the last one I'll point out are envoys. You can no longer just infinitely pay a city state to like you, envoys replace that. The more envoys you have, the more benefits you unlock. Simple! Envoys can also be sent to other great empires in order to improve relations and act as spies, they'll relay important information back to you.Cons:- Diplomacy is a bit silly. The system feels REALLY nice, it's much better than it was in Civ V, however the diplomacy AI seems to randomly denounce you without much reason. Not only that, but I feel as though some of their demands (such as Kongo's demand of religion) are quite hard to meet as they have ridiculously short deadlines, especially if you meet them early on in the game. It's very inconsistent, and is kind of annoying. That being said there is multiplayer and mods will be on their way soon (which I am looking forward to).- As I mentioned, the UI does forget to mention some information which can be key or useful. The notifications are quite fiddly, and the icons for housing and amenities look exactly the same on a quick glance. More of a variation between the two could be useful.- This is more nitpicky than anything else, but you can't rename cities or units. I'm only putting it in cons so I can try to fill it out a bit more, but I really don't care too much about not being able to re-name Sheffield as something rude that Steam'll block if I write it out here.----I'll be waiting until mod support comes out as well as the first few patches before updating the review. I'm sure that Firaxis are aware of the problems with the game, but there are no outright issues which make the game unplayable.If you're a long-time Civ player and you're very particular about how the game plays then I'd suggest waiting. If you're like me and you love Civ, but don't let the game be ruined by a couple of issues then get it. I'd also suggest getting it if you're new to Civ, but pick up IV and V too as they're both superb games!			"

												As it currently stands, CiVI is a game with well-crafted gameplay mechanics, numerous minor bugs / brainfarts and an AI that disappoints.Absolutely loved the way the game handles its economical side; this is a definite upgrade from what I experienced with CiV; the civic-government - and amenity-housing -systems keep the decisionmaking surprisingly fresh all the way to the end. Great persons tailored to different timings and victory conditions are an interesting twist, which adds to the game-planning in a good way. Stacking more than 1 military unit to corps / armies work fine; although the increased military strength from stacking feels currently a bit weak, the major reason to do it at the moment is upkeep cost.The AI left me with a half-disgusted feeling with ""why you do dis"". You know, that feeling when the only-positive-modifier-ally with no other friends in the game turn insane and backstab me with classical era units vs tanks just because I'm about to snatch a science-victory, or when Roosevelt first agrees to pay me for a joint war and then nags me about declaring wars on his continent; or when they talk their personal-agenda -related things that just feel.. unrealistic. Why would England suddenly tell me I tread dangerous waters with their colonies when they a) have 0 colonies and b) we have had 0 interaction except sending a trader and opening borders. Also why the f*** does Rome still declare holy wars to me for converting all his cities over thousand years ago? I don't think modern day Iran declares holy wars because someone converted them from majority Zoroastrianism over 10 generations ago.I guess the way AI remembers history, or plays to win and not to preserve itself, is not an actual issue if you consider CiVI as a board game with permanent players rather than leaders that evolve along with the history of the world. To me, this is disappointing.I did not even start to speak about the way AI manages wars. The unit management is a tough part for even human players to optimize, but the AI seems to be utterly incapable of conquering cities vs civs that should be overran in terms of pure military strength. In one out of 6 games did I see an AI actually overrun another, and never did they manage to grab a city from me if I had even a minor defensive army around. Also a valid offensive strategy for human players vs AI is to declare a war from defensive positions and wait for the AI to waste all its units against your fortresses.After trying out all different victory types on Emperor difficulty, racking in 90hrs of gameplay, I can say that I won't be returning back to the game until the AI or diplomacy is improved, or the SDK released.Nevertheless the game deserves a 4/5 -grade for its gameplay mechanics alone. Worth the money and fun, but the lack of meaningful AI starts to hurt after a while. Also, a plethora of minor-annoyance-things (such as traderoute and spy micromanagement) could drop the rating to 3/5 if you're feeling unforgiving.			"

												The ""I don't like the way it looks, 0/10 freemium trackfone game"" anti-negative-review-early-impression-review-review of Sid Meier's Super Civilization Six.TLDR: The graphics are a nice change of pace from Civ 5 (you'll get used to them). All those gameplay obstructions that were super irritating to deal with in Civ 5 have either been removed or modified. Game is well optimized, but is also lacking in some options.*This is in no way, shape, or form a full review, but an early impression. I'm not a Civ expert and I'm not going to try and wow you with big words (like callipygian), nor am I going to call these dumb♥♥♥♥ negative reviewers any names*PRO$-So they changed the graphics because (this is going to blow your ♥♥♥♥ing mind) they wanted to appeal to a larger audience. God forbid they are striving to make their game more accessible to younger/older audiences alike. Regardless, they pull off the trendy-cartoon look WAY better than any mobile game I've ever seen. Stylization allows for things to pop out, and this game excells at making the icons/units/buildings visibly different. Also, how can you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s say this game isn't graphically impressive for a 4X? Have you seen the dope♥♥♥♥♥leader animations? Teddy R. appearing on screen with those exaggerated shoulders has made me♥♥♥♥♥every time.The look of the game honestly bothered me for all of two minutes and that was only because my brain needed some time to adjust from Civ 5 to 6, and people complaining about this will eventually adjust too. But who cares about graphics whats that gameplay like? Dope, with a zero and the euro. Here are some things I like:-Took out worker-based road building and made it way easier to connect cities to cities, while making the whole process more natural. -The barbarians are an actual concern for once, not being able to blast them with your city from turn 1 was a great change. -The split between civics and technology is amazing, doesn't corner you into a position where you want to have the ability to make allies but want to focus your tech on another area. -I have yet to have that stale, ""click next turn for 50 turns"" portion of the game. Every turn forces you to make choices.-I would boink Victoria.-Exploring feels well thought out.-I no longer feel like I'm just spamming tile improvements lazily and queing the entire line-up of building production at my cities. Again, the game forces you to participate.-Happiness no longer gets wrekt when you want to make a few satelite cities.Other than that I have yet to have a crash or even a bug, and I wouldn't be bothered by either because its been out for *0* days, those things are 100000000000 percent going to get fixed. The game is ridiculously well optimized compared to Civ5 even with 6 years of updates and 2 expansions.CONS-Things I don't like tho:-How the game WHIPS THE CAMERA ALL OVER THE PLACE WHEN THINGS HAPPEN, but its not like this issue can't get patched, and I know the Civ guys are good about listening to feedback.-If I wanted to listen to drums everytime I clicked to attack I would just blare the Roots Phrenology album over the in-game sound. Wouldn't be surprised if the drums just get outright removed from the game.-I would boink Victoria and that makes me very depressed because she's both dead and a video game character.-I'm bad at this game.-AI RANT-The AI have always been dumb, forever, in every strategy game ever made since the beginning on time and it's never going to be on the same level as a human player for a loooooooooong time. Either it cheats and it's unfair, or it's just plain irrational, and the latter has only ever improved my gameplay experience. If this is your negative point IDK why you're playing strategy games with bots.END REVIEW-Extremely fun and addicting, I've been having a great time and I know it'll only keep getting better. I have some nitpicks, but I know that everyone's feedback will lead to some great patches.*UPDATE*I think it's hilarious that those giving the game negative reviews have eitherPlayed 0.6 hours of itorAre still playing it after 23 plus hours.

												I like this type of game, I really do, but the game is literally INCOMPELETE.1. They dont fix the bugs, I understand that this game is still at its early stages, but the bugs need too be fixed. when you paly the harder levels, the intelligence of the AI does not impove, they just simply build more troops, having a higher rate of growth of everthing, then they invade you. you can hardly survive in the early game.2. diplomacy system is literally broken, you allies constant spy on you. civilizations constantly denounce you for literally no reason. 3. After you get all the researches done, there is nothing! nothing you can do excepet invading other civils.Anyway, this game is not recommended unless they fix their problem, which I don't think they will.because it has been a long time since last time they update the game. they are only focusing on making more money by making more DLC!

												When the first screenshots came out I was wary of the chosen art style as those pictures looked very offputting. When the gameplay videos started coming out it looked better and I started getting excited.Now that I have finally gotten my hands on the game, and experienced it first hand, I cannot say anything but that it is a very solid game! It is miles ahead of Civilization 5's release, and nearly equal to Brave New World (only thing that keeps Civ 5 ahead with its DLC is the number of available civilizations and the ability to rename cities, but districts and religious combat make up for it greatly in 6).The game's strategy requirement has gone up with the inclusions of Districts, forcing you to think further ahead on placing cities besides hill/river/coastal/mountain-adjacency, but rather you have to think about all the tiles in its future 3-tile radius. Add to that the need for walls to be able to bombard, and the increased strength of barbarians if you don't deal with them swiftly, the early game requires a lot more thinking than ever before.Wonders are a lot harder to get with their requirements, making them truly an achievement to obtain. Also requiring a full tile on the map adds to the district strategy as well. With over 1000 hours in Civilization 5, and countless more in even older installments, Firaxis has truly delivered a very good vanilla product, and I am already excited to see how future DLC and Expansions will upgrade it even more to become the ultimate in 4X gaming!

												EDIT 14/01/17In my original review, I did not recommend Civ 6.  A few months later, some good mods have come out and I recommend this game now.Here are the mods I use (get them from Civ Fanatics)AI Siege HelpAI+Better Trade ScreenMore LensesRED modpackResearch ReminderSmoother DifficultyUnit Report ScreenEven with mods, the AI is pretty poor, but the mods help give a fun and interesting gameHere is my original review which is based on vanilla game...TL:DRI WISH I could recommend Civ 6;  it's got some great features, is addictive (as ever) and has lots of potential.  However, the AI is REALLY bad,  I won't be playing this again until devs fix AI or release SDK so modders can.Long versionAs I write this review, I've played Civ6 for 222.6 hours, so I've had a fair run.  Do I recommend it?  No, not currently.  Why?  Simply because the AI is so bad.  In fact, I won't be playing it again until the AI is fixed.Cons- AI is active for first 50 turns, then seems to give up doing anything  - AI doesn't improve it's cities logically.  Why improve 15 tiles around a 5 pop. city?  Why doesn't it build districts?  Why does it build a settler when there isn't anywhere to found a city?- AI either expands like mad and has lots of tiny unproductive cities.  Or it hardly expands at all and stagnates- AI doesn't build decent number of military units- AI doesn't attack / defend with any kind of logic- AI doesn't upgrade it's military units- AI declares war then, moves it's units near your cities, then allows you to pick them off 1 by 1- AI declares war then sues for peace as soon as it can, offering lucrative deals- AI still doesn't know how to fight on water- Strange UI decisions by devs (can be fixed by mods)- Total silence from Firaxis as to when they are going to fix this game.  ADVICE TO FIRAXIS - Take note of how Frontier Developments communicate with their customersPros- Graphics - while not a fan at first, they've grown on me.  Watching wonders being built is a joy- Sound - Good- Music - Excellent- Gamplay  / 1 more turn - As addictive as ever- PC stability - Not 1 crash/bug in 222.6 hours - Wonderful- Performance - Superb.  Everything on UltraFast forward 6 months and I'm sure this game will be great.  My advice?  Get it on 50% sale & learn the new game mechanics, then wait for the patches.			"

												I was a little sceptical at first, the only other Civilization games i've played previously were Civilization 5 and Civilization: Beyond Earth, at first I wasn't a big fan of the cartoon-y look of the graphics that were put into Civilization 6, however after playing a full game from start to victory, the layout of the game took a bit of getting use to but very shortly i became familiar with the new layout and quickly was starting to feel very similar to Civilization 5, something i was noticing midway through the game was everything was starting to feel a little too easy, the highest difficulty i've played on in other Civilization games was Prince, when victory finally came i felt i could have very easily clicked on Just One More Turn but i felt that round was too easy and i was excited to try difficulty King or Emperor or maybe even Immortal for my next round.

												I don´t recommend this game. I´ve played Civ 2,3, 4 and 5 and  I´ve liked them all have a few hundred hourse of gameplay.What I don´t like about civ6:-City management. I like to have total control of what is produced and in which tile. You can no longer ""go into the city"", but you are able to micro manage, but it´s too many clicks away and it´s buggy.-""Set city focus"" is buggy, in civ5 you could easily change from production to food. Now you have to click like 5 times to change from one to an other.-You can´t view city production at the same time as managing citizens. This is annoying as well, especially when if you like to micromanage like me.-The splitting of the tech and civ trees. I played on ""Prolonged"" game speed and still felt like the research is too fast. I end up with just clicking on something in the civ tree.-Feels like they have made civ 6 ""simplified"". I can´t exacly explain why but it feels like that. Maybe to reach a broader audience?That´s what I came up with after a few hours of playing this game. I gave it a chance but the things above is too annoying for me to enjoy this game. It´s not for me. now I´m going back to civ 5.  "

												Abysmal game... just abysmal.  Worse than Civ V on pretty much every level.The game is so laggy, slow (and I'm running this on an top end i7/gtx970 rig) and just poorly designed it baffles me to how any one can give this game a thumbs up.  So many small changes that are just endlessly infuriating.  Units now move much slower, so just getting around the map (something that was already slow) is now ridiculously annoying.  Barbarians are everywhere, so now scouts are just fodder if not endlessly micromanaged.  Scouting is a complete PITA.  Loading saved games, ridiculously slow.  Trade and diplomacy, so slow.  Its like every action you would perform in Civ V, the equivalent in Civ VI take 3-4x longer.  Its just... so painfull to play.Civics are a mess, districts unbalanced and buggy, wonders need an empty tile (so you now have no room to build anything), workers are consumed on use???  Clearly I want to do nothing but build workers the entire game.  The tech tree is now, for all intents and purposes, linear (no jumping ahead a bit to get an early wonder).Stay away... stay far away.			"

												Terrible AI, possibly worse then Civ5, seriously bad AI. This game suffers from the ""Civ Syndrome"" - It's essentially in Beta, until a couple content patches later. Just like Civ5 was not really a good game until BNW, this game will not be complete until it's content patches are done.Skip it for now. If you feel the urge for civ, just fire up 5 with BNW and wait this one out.			"

												Da Good:- Game runs butter smooth compared to the previous one.- New game mechanics feel a lot more in depth, and solid in this game. Brings much more variety and strategy into the game.- You can always see your relations to other nations, since their icons as well as their opinion of you are all right on the game screen. Don't have to access a menu to see it.- Great nation music themes that build up over the course of time. Not as sleepy and boring as previously.- Despite being different than it's predecessor, the game is suprisingly easy to get into, and to learn the basics.- Great animations of the leaders, very well done and charming.- Overall a lot more clear, better to see what's currently happening, despite not forcing everything right into your face.- Good art style, despite many people complaining about it. It's not as cartoony as some claim.Da Bad:- Main menu music is still almost as annoying as in CIV V.- There seems to be some kind of bug with the music while in match.- Mulitplayer seems also a bit buggy to set up.- Greece is the only nation that let's you choose between two leaders.- No option to set unit on ""alert"" so it will activate once enemy is near. Which conflicts with auto end turn. Meaning the game will end the turn despite a unit being in attacking range.- Not many different religions to found.- Not many maps to pick from. But since you have a random map, i assume there are infinite maps. But it'd be nice to have more premade maps. Especially earth like!Overall i still recomment this game, because i think that the buggy parts will be patched out soon. And despite the content being a little thin, it is still a very solid game that runs MUCH less frustating than the previous one.			"

												Civilization VI is better at launch than the GOTY edition of Civilization V. You can safely ignore the few negative reviews of Civilization VI. I had doubts myself before buying the game, but most of that was due to the disappointment of Civilization V. Gone are the permanent, nazi policies of Civilization V. In terms of policies, this game is much more fluid, similar to Civilization IV. Gone are the settler spamming ♥♥♥♥♥s of Civilization V, as settlers now increase in production cost. Gone is the 100% no unit stacking garbage of Civilization V. Now, you can stack complimentary units, and also combine identical units as you research corps. Civilization VI at launch is already better than the GOTY edition of Civilization V, and it can only get better with dlc.			"

												It's only been 3 hours of playing the game, as of the time I'm writing this, However Civilization 6 is just everything I anticipated for and more. It's colourful textures and awesome soundtrack as well as avery in depth city and district system doesn't take away but actually adds to the experience of the game, which I'm sure a lot of Civ 5 veterans were not sure would work. Heck even I didn't think it would work very well, but it's a new and refreshing element that goes highly in depth. If you are a big fan of Civilization franchise, pick this game up. It is worth the cost.			"

												It's basically Civilization V with all it's Add-Ons on the Base Game. The Value you get for a Vanilla CiV Game is great and certainly much bether than it was in CiV 5. However there are still plenty of flaws to get rid of, until this game reached the playability that CiV V has to date. I hope the developers will fix the countless bugs and playability so that we will one day get the great Civ V predescessor we all deserve.I still recommend this game and thumb it up, because i can not put it away and will continue to play it with my friends. If i could rate i would give it 70 out of 100 at it's current State.			"

												What a functionally terrible Civ game. As a player since Civ III was released I am incredibly disappointed for how dumbed down, lazy, and overally hacky this game is. It's sickening. Don't misunderstand my play time, I left the game on in the background a few times.Just so everyone knows, the harder difficulty settings just result in the AI getting tons of free troops. They are still completely and utterly inept though, noticably dumber than even the earliest Civ games and infinitely more confusing. Why on the standard difficulty would a nation in the modern era build an entire army of spearmen?! WHY?! Come on.This game is painful to play and I can't bring myself to continue playing. It's depressingly thin. No more maps included, so expect to play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ random maps forever until a third party fills the gaps for a company that screwed you. Try Civ V or tell Firaxis to suck it and try Making History if you want a game that has performance over flashy garbage. Making History is only the World Wars and it's still functionally far better than this abortion.			"

												Where do I begin? Oh yes, this game has so many downgrades which I didn't expect. Here are all the cons:-The AI is more idiotic than Civ 5!-The soundtrack mechanic in this game is horrible! Civ 5 did a way better job at this. A good example of that is that in Civ 5, when you declare war on someone or someone declares war on you, the music changes from peaceful to a more aggressive war song. Is beyond annoying to hear this peaceful garbage of a song when I am at ♥♥♥♥ING WAR!-The Barbarians put more of a fight than the Civ AI's -The advisors for new players is gone. They decide to add new systems to the game which I am fine with that, but at least teach the new players how to use those game mechanincs if they are playing their first game!-I took a capital city with no siege weapons...and that capital had a wall...WTF! Are my archers shooting dynamite arrows?-The AI is way too damn passive. -If they aren't passive they just give you empty threats, basically like Kim Jung Un without the ♥♥♥♥ing bite. -Barely any maps to play, CIV 5 has more ♥♥♥♥ing maps than this. -Montezuma DLC? Wow someone is thirsty for money.-This ""rumor"" system, is not a rumor when the whole world knows is a fact. So what are the pros?Well, the graphics and game look good, but that doesn't make the game good. So at this current state I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												Feels more tedious than previous Civ games.  There is a higher degree of variability in resources and choices but that doesn’t seem to translate to a more dynamic experience.  Between all the various civ, tech, policy, adjacency and other bonuses I often find myself feeling like it was less of a hassle to just build what my advisor suggested than bother with all the math – rendering all the depth of the new version rather hollow.  I don’t doubt that with several playthroughs you could really figure out how to maximize a civilization’s potential, but that feels more tedious than epic.  All of this is thrown into even starker contrast with the AI, which doesn’t seem to be any more dynamic than previous versions.There’s some creative stuff in the game (districts are interesting, wonders on the map, separate science and culture trees).  Without the benchmark of previous Civ games it would probably seem pretty good, but high expectations have been set and not met.			"

												I can't not to recommed Civ. It's great anyway. But comparing my previous experience - it's worst Civ start I remember.I started from Civ 3 (played Civ 2 but not much to feel it). It was great. I explored every mechanic in it. I was thinking I'm a Civ Master.Civ 4 was like a kick in the balls. Everithing was new to me. I had to learn totally new game. And this was wondeful.When Civ 5 came out I knew it would be the same. And I was right. I can't say all chages in Civ 5 were for good - but it was new game with new mechanics. I had to explore it once again. But god damn it was awesome when I first time beat 8 (God) level!Civ 6 had to be the same. But it was not. Districts - interesting, armies - not bad, mood for every city - how it had to be. But overall gameplay is very similar to Civ 5. If not new graphics (which in my opinion is worse then in Civ 5) it would look like mode to Civ 5.It is still interesting to play. But I will not play it hundreds of hours like in days before - cause after 3 parties I know all mechanics and there is nothing new. Untill DLC will appear.God-level for Scythians was like walk in a park. I even can't force myself to finish all adversaries cause it's annoying.Maybe I just grew old? Don't think so, there are new games exciting me. Unfortunatly it's not Civ 6.Some small minuses must be fixed:1. Mood-affecting resources are not shown nowhere. I only can see those I have in my country - but not those I traded for. I need to know which recources I have and how exactly they affect mood in my cities: which resourse is used for which city.2. Many mechanics are not explained in Civilopedia. That's bad.3. I can't open Civilopedia by right click on buildings already build and icons of units already on a map like it was in Civ 5.4. Playing in window with resolution 1024 I can't see # of turn and current year - they are hidden entirely after saltpeter is discovered. I could not find year anywhere else in the game.5. Spearmen line of units is useless. I built 1 spearmen in 3 games only for fun and did not upgrade them untill the end of all science exploration because the pikeman is a dead end in exploration line. Possible solution: change pikemen to landsknechts I could buy and throw in battle the same turn.6. There have to be an option to skip motion of airplanes but not other battles. I like to look on battles, but planes are flying too long time. When I make 10+ airstrikes every turn - it's horrible. "

												Gameplay just feels awkward. I'm not sure if it holds your hand too much or just doesn't challenge you, but the AI feels like you're playing a bunch of grumpy toddlers. America starts pouting for no reason at all and starts attacking my city, but I easily knock them back and end up taking over everything of theirs, no contest. Taking cities feels so much easier for some reason. On top of it all, you will have the enemy leader complaining every turn trying to make a deal, and the cartoon-ish aspect to them just makes the whole thing feel childish. There's no sense of awe, like an actual world war or anything like that. Nothing about it feels inspiring. It just feels like playing checkers with a bad AI at some point.Then the rest of it does feel very tedious. Another reviewer put it well and mentioned that it doesn't feel like there's any real change in gameplay over time. I went from warrior to riflemen and still felt like nothing about the game changed. I might've had more science, maybe a few more cities with a few more population, but nothing about the gameplay evolved. There's no feeling of real progress, just a slow capture of neighboring cities.I think Beyond Earth was a much better game, sadly. Their tech web and supremacy/purity/harmony gameplay made it much more interesting than this civilization's flavored checkers.			"

At this point the only city I had left was Cumae. I decided to create an army of legions and archers and managed to take Rome back. But it wasnt enough, I had to completly destroy them. I built an even bigger army and took one of their smaller cities, then I gradually worked my way up until only their capital remained. They offered to make peace about 5 times but I always declined. I took over every single city they had and Brazil was crushed under my Roman sandals.Great game would plunder again			"

												By far the best CIV i've played, it combines the best of both IV and V while retaining all features added through DLC in V. The game is incredibly polished which is rare these days, more uniqueness in each civ then ever before. The new city 'sprawl' feature adds a whole new depth and complexity. The encampment for instance is like a real world military base with it's own defence values and optimization for infantry or calvary. With no one clear path in the begininning i can see the game having even more endless playthrough value than any other previous civ game and thats saying something. The graphics are actually really good which i thought was surprising, the units move cleanly and combat is interesting (such as a horseman getting knocked off his horse and the horse runs away). The government and policies are awesome and really add to the customization of one's empire. I'm not even mad about paying full price, this game is AMAZING! 10/10. Easily.			"

												I feel like a bought a beta release. Even with the latest Winter update, there are still quirks that I find unforgivable. It's as if the programmers do not actually play the game they've developed to see if they've missed anything. Like the Alert function - was its inital omission intentional, and enough people complained that they added it back in... or did they just forget? Water units still have no Alert function.  From reading other reviews, it appears this is has been the norm for a while now. While unacceptable, enough people are out there that are always going to buy a new release, and we live in an age where companies' primary concern is money.The new features and changes to the game are interesting. I've played a few games and do find it somewhat enjoyable. However, the interface is awkward and a step backwards from Civ V, in my opinion. There are a few irritating quirks. For example, I frequently have to repeatedly mouse-over the side notifcations before they actually display the description, and then once it finally displays, I can't read it because it gets blocked by the tile description pop-up for the tile that happens to be under the notification icon. Seriously? No one on the development team noticed this?? Or am I just doing it wrong?Bottom line: do not buy this until the price goes down.  Stick with Civ 5.  I was really looking forward to Civ 6, and this was the first time I've bought a game soon after its initial release.  Lesson learned.			"

												I have been a huge fan of the Civilization games since I played the fourth title. I have spent many hours on Civ5 and I loved every minute. I never experienced problems and the gameplay was smooth. That can't be said about Civ6. Civ6 adds many new features. For example districts and unit stacking. But it suffers from a very poor AI. You will get denounced, declared war upon and get asked to trade all your resources for 3 GPT by every single country every 5 turns. Also, after advancing a few eras you will go insane from the road mechanics. Firaxis thought it'd be nice to buff the roads every few eras, so when you have walked the maximum distance, you will still have the 0.5 movement left which will result in you having to click fifty extra times every turn. The map is also very small. I have only played on the 'Continent' type map, but if you like playing against many opponents, expect at least two nations right next to you. It'd be a fun game if it actually worked properly. My computer is constantly experiencing shutdowns caused by this game. Even though my computer can run every single other game on the highest settings, it can't run this game on the lowest. As you proceed further into the game, it will gradually take more and more time between turns. Most people also knows this from Civ5. However, later in the game, if you take over an enemy's capital or cause a big event to unfold, the game will simply crash and let you experience it all over again. I really want to like this game, but Civ6 is currently so bugged it isn't enjoyable to play. I really hope they will fix these bugs in the future, because it really got some great potential. Out of five stars, I will give it two. It's close to unplayable (at least for me), but when it works I have had some fun moments.			"

												It's finally here. It's a beautiful untamed beast for me at the moment. I've always loved Civ games but probably put most my time into Civ 5. Civ 6 brings a whole heap of changes.The cities now take some serious planning, rather than having a super tile that contains everything you city builds across multiple tiles which brings a new level of planning. You need to carefully plan where to place districts to gain the most from adjaceny bonuses but also you still want basic tiles to work for food, production etc. One of my favourite changes and possibly the greatest difference is the AI, the barbs for a start are much more troublesome to deal with. First they send scouts and actually get an idea of where to attack your cities from. Then they will send multiple units to assualt yo. It's a much bigger threat than they have been in previous games. Once they have lost a decent size of their force they retreat forcing you to push out after them and deal with them. AI civs have agendas which cause they to treat you different. This I like and don't like. I like the fact they feel they have a set personality but sometimes it feels punishing when I honestly don't think it should. I've yet to have a game where I haven't♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off another AI civ within a few turns of meeting them because I've lacked on a certain part of my empire, got too far on another thing or I've traded with a city state.It's a system I'm worried that may make the single player games grow flat quicker than previous. When I see a certain AI civ now I know almost instantly how they will act and it kinda killed diplomacy for me a little. Multiplayer seems like it will be the stronger suit for this game over the single player. Thankfully so far from the multiplayer games I've played with buddies the game works great online with very few issues compared to previous games. So far a very good entry into the series which hopefully will keep getting better as it evolves and expansions get added.Highly recommend for 4x fans or turn based strategy fans. I've started a potential series on this game on my YouTube, if you are interested please head over and check it out.

												I've been playing Civilization since the third release. I've spent thousands of hours on Civ 5 alone. I was absolutely disappointed with Beyond Earth... and as much as I wanted to love this game, I feel strongly that Civilization 6 is just another missed opportunity. Shame.It's hard to describe one thing about this game that makes it feel broken. My comments are from having played two games (one to finish) on Prince difficulty.  MovementThe movement system has been adjusted in such a way it's become more difficult to intercept or kill another unit. There seems to be less emphasis on using the terrain for travel short cuts, but rather more emphasis on key terrain placement to intercept and kill other units. I strongly feel that this was better managed in Civ 5. ExplorationI felt that exploration was much easier to do in Civ 5. Given the constant Barbarian threats, my scout never really made it that far into exploration before becoming surrounded. Additionally, if the Barbarian threats were too cumbersome early on and threatening my founder city, I tended to shy away from scouting all together - whether that was with a scout or a combative unit. AI Isn't Working RightThere were several instances where the AI, particularly concerning ranged attacks, did not initiate an attack when it should have against a unit. This occurred when I was attacking a city. I had a severely damaged catapult that was attacked by the city a number of times, and then the city and its units just stopped fighting me. A similar situation also occurred with a Barbarian archer. It simply would not fire upon my units - even when it would be advantageous for it do so.WorkersThese are now termed as 'builders', which are removed after using them to upgrade 3 terrains. There are opportunities from the Pyramid wonder and from the skill trees to slightly improve the number of upgrades builders can make before being exhausted and the unit is removed. This is incredibly bothersome. More turns are being used to upgrade tiles. Placing the units on auto also is no longer a feature. Two features I thought was done very well in Civ 5. Skill TreesThere are a number of skill trees present (i.e. technology and cultural). All these trees have their own selection options and work parallel to one another. I found this incredibly unnecessary. While I was interested in hearing many of the audio plays for unlocking a skill my first run through, I ended up just clicking past them mid- to end- game. The notifications felt like pop up spam messages occurring every other turn. And I felt saturated with too many options and became unclear what direction to take to remain competitive. This might become more clear with more game plays. WondersI really loved the cinematic effect after completing Wonders. A huge improvement on Civ 5. Visually, the Wonders have become more striking. However, this is quickly retracted because it doesn't feel that wonders are necessarily worth the risk. If a competitor beats you to the wonder, it wasn't obvious to me if there was any return - such as gold in Civ 5. Additionally, if you're constructing a wonder on a tile that has some sort of luxury or other improvement, it will permanently remove the feature - whether you complete the wonder or not. Wonders also take up space, unlike in Civ 5, discouraging a player from building a large numbers of wonders in one city. Placement of wonders may significantly challenge and influence the outputs and construction of other districts and improvements, so be very mindful of positioning within the boundaries of a city. Micromanagement GaloreI love turn based strategy games. But at the end of the day, a game needs to be fun. The level and amount of micromanaging between each city and its districts just wasn't my cup of tea. This seemed like a very interesting idea, but fell short. This may be in large part that the user interphase seems incomplete. In some areas, the UI seems to present too much information and in other areas not enough. I felt that in comparison to Civ 5, Civ 6 took a giant step back on the user interphase. Overall, the micromanaging system doesn't seem very intuitive. And by mid to late game, I ended up placing less emphasis on micromanaging tile and district improvements in each city by warring over civilizations and taking their cities and their improvements to compensate.  Other CivilizationsWhile the cinematic interactions of other civilizations are beautiful, they quickly become annoying to see every time you meet a civilization and when they have an opinion on your affairs. I ended up just hitting ESC to quickly get past it. The need for two separate screens, where the first is a cinematic AI response, followed by a response option page for you is unnecessary. Building a meaningful relationship with another civilization seemed pointless. The AI seems to act in irrational decision making. For instance, having a close relationship with a civilization and then being declared war on for no apparent reason or strategic benefit. In defense of the Civ AI, a welcomed feature is that the unit composition and placement seem more strategic than previous Civ games, and the AI opponents are less likely to give up. However, when they do give up, it seemed that the AI was willing to meet nearly every demand I made of them - whether for resources or cities. Game felt stagnantMid to late game felt stagnant, both in unit and building production. Despite having many production dedicated tiles and improvements in my founder city, it would still take significant number of turns to output. Oddly, I was still miles ahead of my competition. The micromanagement seems to make each turn much longer than any previous game. TurnsThe turn based unit selection doesn't seem very fluid compared to Civ 5 or previous versions either. The game seems to want you to select units in a particular order. The end result was that I had misclicked several units throughout the game and sending them in directions I had not intended for.  There were also several occasions where I thought I was finished with my turn, only to realize a few minutes later, that other units still needed to be selected and have an action performed. Sleep/Wake ResponseI placed a number of units into sleep to negate the amount of micromanaging necessary and attention needed for each unit; placing these units in strategic locations. Unlike in Civ 5, these units do not wake when an enemy is nearby. Fairly frustrating to have a horde of Barbarians or other enemy units stroll past these units and destroy tiles. Which then of course requires at some point that you use more turns to develop builders to repair said tiles.			"

												I haven't played a Civ game since Civ III, after getting tired of dumb-as-doornails AI opponents and other frustrations with the series, but I thought I'd give this one a go. The city-building aspects of the game are clever and fun, requiring some real thought into design of your empire. And other aspects, like religion and the dual tech trees and society cards, are intriguing as well and fun to play around with.Alas, the AI remains dumb as doornails. No amount of good design can make up for an utterly incompotent AI design - especially when other games manage a decent if unexceptional plausibility in AI opponents. Diplomacy also lags far behind contemporary design - the diplomatic model in games like EU4 is just far more interesting, plausible and enjoyable. In Civ VI it's a pointless exercise in frustration and irrelevance.Finally, the pacing seems off - technology seems to advance way too fast for production. It often seems that you've barely produced a unit before you're off into the next age, without having had any time to do anything noteworthy in the age you were just in. The tech progress can be slowed down - but unfortunately that slows down production as well. So the relativities remain basically the same, but the game is slowed to a glacial pace. There's a lot to love in the game design, the innovations like museums and tourists and a very interesting take on great works and great leaders. Many of the flaws above can probably be fixed in some fine tuning in patches - but I suspect the completely incompetent AI will not be fixed. It's a pity, perhaps the Civ community can come up with a bit of magic modding to create an opponent worth playing - but for now I reluctantly have to give this a thumbs down.After all the criticism of bad AI in Civ V, one would have hoped Firaxis could have made more of an effort. I'm not getting burned again, no Civ VII for me...			"

												It's only been 3 hours of playing the game, as of the time I'm writing this, However Civilization 6 is just everything I anticipated for and more. It's colourful textures and awesome soundtrack as well as avery in depth city and district system doesn't take away but actually adds to the experience of the game, which I'm sure a lot of Civ 5 veterans were not sure would work. Heck even I didn't think it would work very well, but it's a new and refreshing element that goes highly in depth. If you are a big fan of Civilization franchise, pick this game up. It is worth the cost.			"

												What a functionally terrible Civ game. As a player since Civ III was released I am incredibly disappointed for how dumbed down, lazy, and overally hacky this game is. It's sickening. Don't misunderstand my play time, I left the game on in the background a few times.Just so everyone knows, the harder difficulty settings just result in the AI getting tons of free troops. They are still completely and utterly inept though, noticably dumber than even the earliest Civ games and infinitely more confusing. Why on the standard difficulty would a nation in the modern era build an entire army of spearmen?! WHY?! Come on.This game is painful to play and I can't bring myself to continue playing. It's depressingly thin. No more maps included, so expect to play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ random maps forever until a third party fills the gaps for a company that screwed you. Try Civ V or tell Firaxis to suck it and try Making History if you want a game that has performance over flashy garbage. Making History is only the World Wars and it's still functionally far better than this abortion.			"

												Been playing since Civ IV. This has more cons than pros, and I do NOT recoomend buying this game in this state.Cons:- basically the same game as Civ V, same unit names, same unit upgrades, almost same technology tree and tech names.- loading times are long, as you progress turn times go up as well, and I play on i7 6700k 4.5 GHz, its still really bad- create game settings reset each time you visit the panel, horrible, just lazy and disqusting....- AI is just abysmal, I mean AI declares war on you for no reason, after you repel attack and you make peace, every single civilization denounces you and calls you warmonger, making it impossible to make friends, trade deals, alliances etc.- just no innovation since Civ5, same old except few exceptions- religion works almost exactly the same as Civ V- happiness works almost exactly the same as Civ V- strategic resourrces work almost exactly the same as Civ VPros:- I like the graphics, really piece of art, despite what people say- districts are good, you have to strategically place them or you wont get good bonuses- have not seen any major bugs so far or any bug that would annoy me			"

												Where do I begin? Oh yes, this game has so many downgrades which I didn't expect. Here are all the cons:-The AI is more idiotic than Civ 5!-The soundtrack mechanic in this game is horrible! Civ 5 did a way better job at this. A good example of that is that in Civ 5, when you declare war on someone or someone declares war on you, the music changes from peaceful to a more aggressive war song. Is beyond annoying to hear this peaceful garbage of a song when I am at ♥♥♥♥ING WAR!-The Barbarians put more of a fight than the Civ AI's -The advisors for new players is gone. They decide to add new systems to the game which I am fine with that, but at least teach the new players how to use those game mechanincs if they are playing their first game!-I took a capital city with no siege weapons...and that capital had a wall...WTF! Are my archers shooting dynamite arrows?-The AI is way too damn passive. -If they aren't passive they just give you empty threats, basically like Kim Jung Un without the ♥♥♥♥ing bite. -Barely any maps to play, CIV 5 has more ♥♥♥♥ing maps than this. -Montezuma DLC? Wow someone is thirsty for money.-This ""rumor"" system, is not a rumor when the whole world knows is a fact. So what are the pros?Well, the graphics and game look good, but that doesn't make the game good. So at this current state I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												EDIT 14/01/17In my original review, I did not recommend Civ 6.  A few months later, some good mods have come out and I recommend this game now.Here are the mods I use (get them from Civ Fanatics)AI Siege HelpAI+Better Trade ScreenMore LensesRED modpackResearch ReminderSmoother DifficultyUnit Report ScreenEven with mods, the AI is pretty poor, but the mods help give a fun and interesting gameHere is my original review which is based on vanilla game...TL:DRI WISH I could recommend Civ 6;  it's got some great features, is addictive (as ever) and has lots of potential.  However, the AI is REALLY bad,  I won't be playing this again until devs fix AI or release SDK so modders can.Long versionAs I write this review, I've played Civ6 for 222.6 hours, so I've had a fair run.  Do I recommend it?  No, not currently.  Why?  Simply because the AI is so bad.  In fact, I won't be playing it again until the AI is fixed.Cons- AI is active for first 50 turns, then seems to give up doing anything  - AI doesn't improve it's cities logically.  Why improve 15 tiles around a 5 pop. city?  Why doesn't it build districts?  Why does it build a settler when there isn't anywhere to found a city?- AI either expands like mad and has lots of tiny unproductive cities.  Or it hardly expands at all and stagnates- AI doesn't build decent number of military units- AI doesn't attack / defend with any kind of logic- AI doesn't upgrade it's military units- AI declares war then, moves it's units near your cities, then allows you to pick them off 1 by 1- AI declares war then sues for peace as soon as it can, offering lucrative deals- AI still doesn't know how to fight on water- Strange UI decisions by devs (can be fixed by mods)- Total silence from Firaxis as to when they are going to fix this game.  ADVICE TO FIRAXIS - Take note of how Frontier Developments communicate with their customersPros- Graphics - while not a fan at first, they've grown on me.  Watching wonders being built is a joy- Sound - Good- Music - Excellent- Gamplay  / 1 more turn - As addictive as ever- PC stability - Not 1 crash/bug in 222.6 hours - Wonderful- Performance - Superb.  Everything on UltraFast forward 6 months and I'm sure this game will be great.  My advice?  Get it on 50% sale & learn the new game mechanics, then wait for the patches.			"

												It's basically Civilization V with all it's Add-Ons on the Base Game. The Value you get for a Vanilla CiV Game is great and certainly much bether than it was in CiV 5. However there are still plenty of flaws to get rid of, until this game reached the playability that CiV V has to date. I hope the developers will fix the countless bugs and playability so that we will one day get the great Civ V predescessor we all deserve.I still recommend this game and thumb it up, because i can not put it away and will continue to play it with my friends. If i could rate i would give it 70 out of 100 at it's current State.			"

												I can't recommend this game in its current form.  The AI is horrible.  As noted elsewhere there's no rhyme or reason as to why other civilizations do the things they do.  I've had them declare war on me when they had no military.  Civ placement is also atrocious.  On continents you can have 5 civs on one continent and one by its lonesome on another with yet another continent with nobody on it.And the balancing is really, REALLY off.  Want to win?  Go Germany, forgo religion, and put everything into science, money, and production.  About the time everyone else is entering the Renaissance era, you're most of the way through the Industrial revolution and rounding the corner for the Modern era.  While I appreciate the irony of no religion equaling a massive science advantage, it kind of throws the game off.I like some of the concepts here and with some expansions, this game can be saved and brought into the pantheon of the truly great Civilization games.  But for $60 bucks?  Pass until they put it on sale with an expansion release.  At a minimum.			"

												First Impressions of Civ VI after playing for 115 minutes are as follows:UPDATE: 50 ish hours as of now, my opinion has changed on many things. Pros:MUCH deeper than its predecessor (at launch).Despite the hate, the graphics are excellent. It looks a bit cartooney, but firaxis really outdid themselves with the details.Sound design is top-notch.Sean Bean's voice acting is a nice touch.All AI Civs have their own personalities and agendas based on the real country and leader. A huge improvement from Civ 5's seemingly wildcard leaders.Even the city-states have unique personalities, and all have their own unique bonus for their allies.Espionage has been greatly improved. Neutral:Although it is deep, many mechanics have changed significantly, which requires a bit of time to adjust to.City districts can go either way - they can be awesome or really p---s you off.Steep learning curve that may thwart newcomers to the series.Requires some tedious micromanaging, which can be overwhelming at times.Not as many Civs as Civ 5, but hopefully this changes with expansion packs.The game doesn't feel very organic. There's no internal issues other than amenities.Cons:Tutorial is patronizing to any Civ veteran, and there's no option to just learn the new stuff. You have to sit there and be told what settlers do for the 4th time in a row.Civilopedia is laughably condiscending, and does an absolutley horrible job of answering questions. Don't even bother using the built-in civilopedia, find an external one online.As you play on, the deepness of the game fades away, as all the management becomes more insipid and seemingly pointless.Some huge oversights in the general game design.Soundtrack is way smaller than Civ 5, and there aren't region-specific themes anymore (you will just hear other civ's themes.)Poorly optimized and slow. Recommend installing on your best hard drive.Pre-order exclusive civ (WTF Firaxis. Not cool).Overall, Civ 6 is a good game, but it doesn't have the 'it' factor that Civ 5 used to blow me away. There have been some huge oversights in the production and some overall confusing creative choices they made. However, this is the best civ game at launch, and the most complete. Hopefully Firaxis really hears the criticism and irons the problems out.			"

												As someone who has spent countless hours pouring over Civ games throughout the majority of my high school and college years, I believe I can accurately describe myself as a ""fan"" of the games. I'll do a shortlist and then go into more detail as to why I give it the recommendation and score that I doThe Good: The Graphics, although a little 'cartoonish' are superb. The dialogue and the narration is wonderful. The music is probably the best I've ever heard in a Civ game. The AI is a lot more finely tuned and is more challenging now. Districts completely rework the way the game is played. (In a good way!) The 'middle game' is less repetitive and allows for more depth in the gameplay.The Bad: Some of the animations seem to be a bit buggy/silly (Leaders as well). The AI tends to be a little bit overtuned/overly agressive at the lower levels compared to prior Civ games. The advisor, in all respects, is complete trash and does nothing to help you. Movement pathing for units can sometimes be very bad. Barbarians are grossly overtuned even on lower difficulties. Enemy AI can be hyper aggressive, and break rules you can't, yet suffers no penalties.TL;DR: Good game, some minor issues with imbalances in the AI and a slightly higher res graphical update is needed. However, overall the game is beautiful and I highly reccommend buying.Now for those interested, here is the long version:1.Overall the graphics are extremely well done and despite being cartoonish they're still high res enough to look pretty and not detract from the game. Now there are some known optimization issues and this game does have issues running on crap PC's. (Notice how I didn't say ""middle of the line"".) As far as this game goes, I'm running it in maxed out settings on a 1.5 year old gaming laptop with a 970M and a i-7 5700HQ in it along with a 500gb SSD. I have absolutely no FPS drops and no issues at all with performance. So if I can do that, most anyone with a sub par rig can run it in medium+ settings. If your pc can't run this game, it might be time to upgrade and say goodbye to the old one. o/2. Sean Bean did the narration. Nuff said. In all seriousness he's a very good narrator and has done cinema work across all walks of life. Most notably in Game of Thrones and in Lord of the Rings. I personally think he did an excellent job capturing the voice(s) that he needed to in this game. But then again, it's all personal preference. Anyone saying it's 'horrible' either just hates Sean Bean or is one of the people who wanted 'insert name here' to do it because they're extremely infatuated with 'insert name here'.3. The music is phenomenal. Christopher Tin did the opening music for Civ IV titled ""Baba Yetu"" and wrote the opening and title piece for Civ VI titled ""Sogno di Volare"". I personally love his compositions and absolutely adore the main theme for both games and am glad he came back to do this. On another note, the in game music varies based on what civilizaiton you're playing. The music also ties into what stage of the game you're in, by that I mean what Age. As you progress through the game the music actually evolves along with your civilization. It progressively gets more and more complicated every other age on from the Ancient Era and finally comes together as a grand orchestral piece by the end.4. One of probably the most debated topics when it comes to Civ in general is the AI. Personally, I believe the AI is right where it needs to be in the top 3 tiers of difficulty (below and aside from Diety as I have yet to test it out). On King+ the AI seems to be perfectly in line with where it needs to be challenge wise and will give you a run for your money even on King/Emperor. Now this has another side to it as well. The AI is GROSSLY overtuned at Prince and below. Prince is more or less intended to be a 'stagnant' difficulty in prior civ games. It's not overly hard, even for new players, and isn't overly easy, so returning players who want a slight challenge can still sometimes get that feeling. Now I may be overestimating the AI in this regard, and this also ties into one of my cons above, the AI can break rules that you can't and get away with it (without ANY penalties). In all of my 3 test runs (playing on Prince Difficulty, Standard across the board on all settings) there were always 1-2 hyper agressive AI personalities that tended to cross into your borders (without repurcussions) and have units sitting there. Then they would proceed to befriend you, send you things, trade routes, etc. And not 3-5 turns later, would declare a ""suprise war"" on you. This repeated for the rest of the game. I would defend my cities as best as I could. Having to go out of my way to purchase units for these ""surprise wars"" and being forced to invest into the military side of tech and culture trees just to keep my cities (even though I wasn't going for a domination victory, which ALL of my test playthroughs wound up going this way). So I believe the AI on Prince and below needs to be reworked to be less aggressive.5. Districts, oh Districts you beautiful addition. I absolutely love the district reworks. Let me go into a bit of detail as to how disctricts work. You have a city, in this city you have the option to build specialized districts that you unlock through the Technology Tree. Each disctrict has a specific specialization. Here is a list of all the districts: City Center (What you start with), Campus, Holy Site, Theater Square, Harbor, Commercial Hub, Industrial Zone, Entertainment Complex, Aqueduct, Neighborhood, Aerodome, Spaceport. Now most of these are self explanatory as to what they can contain. City Center will have things like the Granary, Monument, Walls, things of this nature. The Campus will have buildings like the Library, and the University. The Cmmercial Hub will have a market, etc. These are all the same buildings that you would normally find back in Civ 5, however, they're split into the specialized districts that you have to construct and once you have built one of these districts, you can then build the buildings that are available inside of them provided you have the tier of research required to build them. I believe this is a great addition to the game as it allows your cities to be more expansive and cover more tiles. And it allows for you to constantly have new things to improve upon throughout the entire game, rather than new cities just being a turn magnet in the middle game while you build old buildings in them, they become vital additions to your empire. There's so much more to these, but I won't spoil it all for you. Go! Learn!6. Animations. Not much to be said, could use some work, slightly buggy.7. Advisor = Garbage. Just google what you need.8. Movement pathing for units. Had a settler try to go around a mountain range through undiscovered territory because it was 'quicker' by 1 turn than going the side that was already discovered. Wound up taking me 18 turns because the range kept on going. Really annoyed by this since it could have just gone the other way.9. Barbarians seem to be extremely overtuned on the lower difficulties and seem to be farther ahead in military tech units in the early game at times. Just needs minor reworks.10. Wonders. There isn't a huge amount to go into detail here, some people will love or hate the new system. Now you have to place wonders on a tile and certain wonders have to be placed on specific types of tiles (hills, flood plains, etc), and some next to types of tiles (such as rivers, mountains, etc). Anyone who says this is a bad change obviously has never played on any type of hard difficulty, as most higher level players know, wonders can snowball the AI in the early game on Diety.Final Score: 9.5/10			"

												This is a flawed game that I ultimately like, which is why I'm giving it a thumbs up. If Steam allowed star reviews, this would be a three star game for me. I've been playing Civ games since the very first one and this iteration of the franchise has some cool and interesting systems that I like very much. I enjoy the policy mechanism and the government system a lot: it alows for tailoring your government for your aprticular needs at a particular point in a game very well. I also like the changes to great people. And, the biggest change of all -- the way geography structures yoru attempts to build cities -- is a great development in Civilization games.And now the bad. I find the AI civs are too aggressive. It is almost impossible to play a more peaceful civ because you will be attacked. Repeatedly. And the AI is not good at fighting wars, so even if you get surprised, you will be able to come from behind and win. The diplomacy is erratic and not transparent. You will be denounced and praised by the same civilization in subsequent turns. Religion is also annoying in this game with missionary spam a problem at various points in the game. There is a ton of potential here, but there are some rough edges that are frustratign and annoying.Ultimately, I give this a thumbs up, because it's still got this addictive quality that has been a part of Civ since the first game. But the annoyances are signifiacnt enough that I don't think this game will have the staying power of Civ IV, which to me still stands as the pinnacle of the Civilization games.			"

												It's finally here. It's a beautiful untamed beast for me at the moment. I've always loved Civ games but probably put most my time into Civ 5. Civ 6 brings a whole heap of changes.The cities now take some serious planning, rather than having a super tile that contains everything you city builds across multiple tiles which brings a new level of planning. You need to carefully plan where to place districts to gain the most from adjaceny bonuses but also you still want basic tiles to work for food, production etc. One of my favourite changes and possibly the greatest difference is the AI, the barbs for a start are much more troublesome to deal with. First they send scouts and actually get an idea of where to attack your cities from. Then they will send multiple units to assualt yo. It's a much bigger threat than they have been in previous games. Once they have lost a decent size of their force they retreat forcing you to push out after them and deal with them. AI civs have agendas which cause they to treat you different. This I like and don't like. I like the fact they feel they have a set personality but sometimes it feels punishing when I honestly don't think it should. I've yet to have a game where I haven't♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off another AI civ within a few turns of meeting them because I've lacked on a certain part of my empire, got too far on another thing or I've traded with a city state.It's a system I'm worried that may make the single player games grow flat quicker than previous. When I see a certain AI civ now I know almost instantly how they will act and it kinda killed diplomacy for me a little. Multiplayer seems like it will be the stronger suit for this game over the single player. Thankfully so far from the multiplayer games I've played with buddies the game works great online with very few issues compared to previous games. So far a very good entry into the series which hopefully will keep getting better as it evolves and expansions get added.Highly recommend for 4x fans or turn based strategy fans. I've started a potential series on this game on my YouTube, if you are interested please head over and check it out.

												I have been a huge fan of the Civilization games since I played the fourth title. I have spent many hours on Civ5 and I loved every minute. I never experienced problems and the gameplay was smooth. That can't be said about Civ6. Civ6 adds many new features. For example districts and unit stacking. But it suffers from a very poor AI. You will get denounced, declared war upon and get asked to trade all your resources for 3 GPT by every single country every 5 turns. Also, after advancing a few eras you will go insane from the road mechanics. Firaxis thought it'd be nice to buff the roads every few eras, so when you have walked the maximum distance, you will still have the 0.5 movement left which will result in you having to click fifty extra times every turn. The map is also very small. I have only played on the 'Continent' type map, but if you like playing against many opponents, expect at least two nations right next to you. It'd be a fun game if it actually worked properly. My computer is constantly experiencing shutdowns caused by this game. Even though my computer can run every single other game on the highest settings, it can't run this game on the lowest. As you proceed further into the game, it will gradually take more and more time between turns. Most people also knows this from Civ5. However, later in the game, if you take over an enemy's capital or cause a big event to unfold, the game will simply crash and let you experience it all over again. I really want to like this game, but Civ6 is currently so bugged it isn't enjoyable to play. I really hope they will fix these bugs in the future, because it really got some great potential. Out of five stars, I will give it two. It's close to unplayable (at least for me), but when it works I have had some fun moments.			"

												     First game of Civ 6 had Gandhi less then ten tiles away from me. His second and third cities were placed even closer to my capital. I played on warlord my first go around, and there's stuff that's great, and stuff to annoy the living hell out of you. Not saying that the game isn't fun, barbarians are just effing everywhere, seemingly random, ransacking your trade routes, snatching your people up. The AI civs are just insane, my relationship with Victoria was like an old married couple that should have divorced after the first war. It never failed, make war, peace, then war, then denouncement, then she likes me again. I feel that the UI may need to be cleaned up a bit, everything seems way too busy, especially in the late game.     Busy isn't necessarily a bad thing, it sometimes gets difficult to tell who is coming from where and why, especially when unit sight is three feet in front of them. I swear I chased the same barbarian scout around a mountain for at least 8 turns, he was always just out of reach, even when I moved next to him. I haven't tried a domination victory yet, and honestly I'm a little afraid to, seeing as how the AI has seemingly limitless resources to just pump out unit after unit after unit and squeeze them in just anywhere.     With that being said, late game is just a cluster bang, everyone has these huge armies and I'm just trying to maintain borders and keep people off my stuff just so I can see what the hell I'm doing. This isn't a bad game, I'm having tons of fun with it, I like the stripped down graphics, even though it seems the camera is never quite where I need it, and it's just too easy to make a slip on where a unit needs to go.     Day one, I'm in love with all the trees, I love creating my own religion to have apostles battle it out for supremacy, and I love that it pisses off the AI, especially (Bloody)Mary Tudor's husband Phillip II. The Duke of Milan so far is my favorite personality, of which this game has no shortage of. The AI civs are beautifully animated, and are easily where Firaxis made their game look it's best.Can't wait for a patch, so I'll continue to smack myself in the testicles when that happens with this game which I want to love so bad in spite of it's flaws. There's enough of a great game here to warrant a recommendation, but too much is out of whack for me to not say anything.7.5/10 "

												When compared to previous Civs, without the inevitable expansion packs the game seems a little shallow. However Civ VI has added some interesting new ideas, like expanding cities. I don't care for the cartoony graphics, and I think the AI needs some improvement. Overall though, it's as addicting as any Civ game, and I think it's off to a good start.			"

												This game is great.  Does Civ the way it ought to be done, and adds enough new game mechanics to make it entirely new again.  Could use a little polish on the AI, but regardless, I will be playing this game for many, many hours.  Whether you're new to Civ, or have played it before, this game is worth picking up.			"

												First Impressions of Civ VI after playing for 115 minutes are as follows:UPDATE: 50 ish hours as of now, my opinion has changed on many things. Pros:MUCH deeper than its predecessor (at launch).Despite the hate, the graphics are excellent. It looks a bit cartooney, but firaxis really outdid themselves with the details.Sound design is top-notch.Sean Bean's voice acting is a nice touch.All AI Civs have their own personalities and agendas based on the real country and leader. A huge improvement from Civ 5's seemingly wildcard leaders.Even the city-states have unique personalities, and all have their own unique bonus for their allies.Espionage has been greatly improved. Neutral:Although it is deep, many mechanics have changed significantly, which requires a bit of time to adjust to.City districts can go either way - they can be awesome or really p---s you off.Steep learning curve that may thwart newcomers to the series.Requires some tedious micromanaging, which can be overwhelming at times.Not as many Civs as Civ 5, but hopefully this changes with expansion packs.The game doesn't feel very organic. There's no internal issues other than amenities.Cons:Tutorial is patronizing to any Civ veteran, and there's no option to just learn the new stuff. You have to sit there and be told what settlers do for the 4th time in a row.Civilopedia is laughably condiscending, and does an absolutley horrible job of answering questions. Don't even bother using the built-in civilopedia, find an external one online.As you play on, the deepness of the game fades away, as all the management becomes more insipid and seemingly pointless.Some huge oversights in the general game design.Soundtrack is way smaller than Civ 5, and there aren't region-specific themes anymore (you will just hear other civ's themes.)Poorly optimized and slow. Recommend installing on your best hard drive.Pre-order exclusive civ (WTF Firaxis. Not cool).Overall, Civ 6 is a good game, but it doesn't have the 'it' factor that Civ 5 used to blow me away. There have been some huge oversights in the production and some overall confusing creative choices they made. However, this is the best civ game at launch, and the most complete. Hopefully Firaxis really hears the criticism and irons the problems out.			"

												As someone who has spent countless hours pouring over Civ games throughout the majority of my high school and college years, I believe I can accurately describe myself as a ""fan"" of the games. I'll do a shortlist and then go into more detail as to why I give it the recommendation and score that I doThe Good: The Graphics, although a little 'cartoonish' are superb. The dialogue and the narration is wonderful. The music is probably the best I've ever heard in a Civ game. The AI is a lot more finely tuned and is more challenging now. Districts completely rework the way the game is played. (In a good way!) The 'middle game' is less repetitive and allows for more depth in the gameplay.The Bad: Some of the animations seem to be a bit buggy/silly (Leaders as well). The AI tends to be a little bit overtuned/overly agressive at the lower levels compared to prior Civ games. The advisor, in all respects, is complete trash and does nothing to help you. Movement pathing for units can sometimes be very bad. Barbarians are grossly overtuned even on lower difficulties. Enemy AI can be hyper aggressive, and break rules you can't, yet suffers no penalties.TL;DR: Good game, some minor issues with imbalances in the AI and a slightly higher res graphical update is needed. However, overall the game is beautiful and I highly reccommend buying.Now for those interested, here is the long version:1.Overall the graphics are extremely well done and despite being cartoonish they're still high res enough to look pretty and not detract from the game. Now there are some known optimization issues and this game does have issues running on crap PC's. (Notice how I didn't say ""middle of the line"".) As far as this game goes, I'm running it in maxed out settings on a 1.5 year old gaming laptop with a 970M and a i-7 5700HQ in it along with a 500gb SSD. I have absolutely no FPS drops and no issues at all with performance. So if I can do that, most anyone with a sub par rig can run it in medium+ settings. If your pc can't run this game, it might be time to upgrade and say goodbye to the old one. o/2. Sean Bean did the narration. Nuff said. In all seriousness he's a very good narrator and has done cinema work across all walks of life. Most notably in Game of Thrones and in Lord of the Rings. I personally think he did an excellent job capturing the voice(s) that he needed to in this game. But then again, it's all personal preference. Anyone saying it's 'horrible' either just hates Sean Bean or is one of the people who wanted 'insert name here' to do it because they're extremely infatuated with 'insert name here'.3. The music is phenomenal. Christopher Tin did the opening music for Civ IV titled ""Baba Yetu"" and wrote the opening and title piece for Civ VI titled ""Sogno di Volare"". I personally love his compositions and absolutely adore the main theme for both games and am glad he came back to do this. On another note, the in game music varies based on what civilizaiton you're playing. The music also ties into what stage of the game you're in, by that I mean what Age. As you progress through the game the music actually evolves along with your civilization. It progressively gets more and more complicated every other age on from the Ancient Era and finally comes together as a grand orchestral piece by the end.4. One of probably the most debated topics when it comes to Civ in general is the AI. Personally, I believe the AI is right where it needs to be in the top 3 tiers of difficulty (below and aside from Diety as I have yet to test it out). On King+ the AI seems to be perfectly in line with where it needs to be challenge wise and will give you a run for your money even on King/Emperor. Now this has another side to it as well. The AI is GROSSLY overtuned at Prince and below. Prince is more or less intended to be a 'stagnant' difficulty in prior civ games. It's not overly hard, even for new players, and isn't overly easy, so returning players who want a slight challenge can still sometimes get that feeling. Now I may be overestimating the AI in this regard, and this also ties into one of my cons above, the AI can break rules that you can't and get away with it (without ANY penalties). In all of my 3 test runs (playing on Prince Difficulty, Standard across the board on all settings) there were always 1-2 hyper agressive AI personalities that tended to cross into your borders (without repurcussions) and have units sitting there. Then they would proceed to befriend you, send you things, trade routes, etc. And not 3-5 turns later, would declare a ""suprise war"" on you. This repeated for the rest of the game. I would defend my cities as best as I could. Having to go out of my way to purchase units for these ""surprise wars"" and being forced to invest into the military side of tech and culture trees just to keep my cities (even though I wasn't going for a domination victory, which ALL of my test playthroughs wound up going this way). So I believe the AI on Prince and below needs to be reworked to be less aggressive.5. Districts, oh Districts you beautiful addition. I absolutely love the district reworks. Let me go into a bit of detail as to how disctricts work. You have a city, in this city you have the option to build specialized districts that you unlock through the Technology Tree. Each disctrict has a specific specialization. Here is a list of all the districts: City Center (What you start with), Campus, Holy Site, Theater Square, Harbor, Commercial Hub, Industrial Zone, Entertainment Complex, Aqueduct, Neighborhood, Aerodome, Spaceport. Now most of these are self explanatory as to what they can contain. City Center will have things like the Granary, Monument, Walls, things of this nature. The Campus will have buildings like the Library, and the University. The Cmmercial Hub will have a market, etc. These are all the same buildings that you would normally find back in Civ 5, however, they're split into the specialized districts that you have to construct and once you have built one of these districts, you can then build the buildings that are available inside of them provided you have the tier of research required to build them. I believe this is a great addition to the game as it allows your cities to be more expansive and cover more tiles. And it allows for you to constantly have new things to improve upon throughout the entire game, rather than new cities just being a turn magnet in the middle game while you build old buildings in them, they become vital additions to your empire. There's so much more to these, but I won't spoil it all for you. Go! Learn!6. Animations. Not much to be said, could use some work, slightly buggy.7. Advisor = Garbage. Just google what you need.8. Movement pathing for units. Had a settler try to go around a mountain range through undiscovered territory because it was 'quicker' by 1 turn than going the side that was already discovered. Wound up taking me 18 turns because the range kept on going. Really annoyed by this since it could have just gone the other way.9. Barbarians seem to be extremely overtuned on the lower difficulties and seem to be farther ahead in military tech units in the early game at times. Just needs minor reworks.10. Wonders. There isn't a huge amount to go into detail here, some people will love or hate the new system. Now you have to place wonders on a tile and certain wonders have to be placed on specific types of tiles (hills, flood plains, etc), and some next to types of tiles (such as rivers, mountains, etc). Anyone who says this is a bad change obviously has never played on any type of hard difficulty, as most higher level players know, wonders can snowball the AI in the early game on Diety.Final Score: 9.5/10			"

												The Launch (at least for me) has been FAR superior to that of cIV and ciV. No major bugs, just a few little quick like animations of horsies running on water haha. It feels like a complete ciV... every tile is for strategy, it is all critical now. Grouping up to 3 units to form Armies or Fleet is nice. Graphics are buttery smooth and look delicious. I don't want to assume anything regarding future expansions, so as it stands, its a great game, solid as a rock for me, but could do with some optimizing as games take forever to start, and there's no teams option.HAMMURABI / 10			"

												An amazing game at first.  Having logged over 3,000 hours on 5, and played all of the others since Civ 1 I consider myself a fan of the series.  This game has so much potential but falls flat on it's face as of right now.  If you thought the AI was bad in Civ 5 (improved somewhat over time), well welcome to the Civ 6 horror show.   The AI is clueless on how to play its own game.  The barbarians will actually give you more trouble.  The AI can't wage war, and can't capture your cities even on the hardest difficulty levels.  In a YouTube video directly from the Dev's they said in every single (out of many) AI vs AI matches no one ever wins by domination.  No kidding.  Diplomacy is horrendous.  Nearly impossible to get the AI to like you, and if it happens your lucky and it's most likely short lived.  They almost always hate you regardless of the victory type you go for.  So they created this wonderful complex game that's so much fun initially, but then you find out there's zero challenge because AI can't make any sense of the new features.  It could barely figure out 1upt (1 unit per tile) in Civ5 although got a little better, but in Civ6 forget about it, DOA.  I think I knew the minute I upgraded my Battleships into the Missle Cruisers that look like tugboats that they screwed up.  They should focus all their efforts on improving the AI and reworking diplomacy so it makes sense.  The Devs have fixed a huge amount of bugs etc, but nothing doing so far on the AI.  Same team from Civ5 so I think any AI improvements will be marginal but I really really hope I'm wrong.  And ditch the tugboat, we want an actual Missle Cruiser.  Thanks.			"

												Civ6 could have been a worthy successor to Civ4 but sadly is unfinished, unbalanced, and unreliable. There are certainly some interesting concepts here - distracts add a lot to the game, as do eureka moments and the split tech tree and city states, and terrain is a lot more interesting now - but there are just too many places in which the game doesn't work properley.Reliability is the biggest issue - the game sometimes gets into situations where it is guaranteed to crash on a particular turn during the AI phase (after you've played a map for 30+ hours and are in the end game, this is an absolute showstopper - there's usually nothing you can do go play past the 'crash turn' even if you try to revert to an earlier save and play differently). For this reason alone, I cannot recommend this game - it's just too frustrating when this happens. It appears to be quite a widespread issue, as well, and not fixed by the first patch. There are other problems with the game too, though:Some game concepts haven't been balanced or thought through correctly. If you conquer the founder of a religion after they've coverted some of your cities you can be left with a dead religion to which you are unable to evangelise any futher believes or declare an inquisition but which you can't do anything about. The division of units into light cavalry, heavy cavalry, melee, anti-cavalry, ranged, and bombard sometimes leaves obsolete old units hanging around for much too long before an upgrade.Limited-used builders are a good mechanic. I like how they increase the prioritisation of scare resource rather than being an exponential multiplier (as they were in earlier Civ games).The AI is terrible. Doesn't know how to move units effectively in a 1UPT world, doesn't plan attacks well, lets settlers wander around unprotected, often makes apparently random diplomatic actions (eg. declines a proposed deal, then instantly comes back and accepts a worse-for-them deal), doesn't act in own interest when up against a wall.The user interface is missing a lot of things. You can't get a list of your current trade deals. You can't get a diagram of who is at war with whom. You don't get a warning when your trade deals have expired. You can't see your exact science progress towards a technology you're researching, only an approximate progress dial - so can't work out whether managing your production differently will get you there a little earlier or not. You can't see what the benefits of a district project will be.  You can't see which cities have one of your trading posts. The diplomacy screen is a giant animated leader with all the important stuff crammed in to a tiny side bar with a bunch of tabs, requiring a lot of scrolling up or down. The city info pop-out is also too narrow, forcing a lot of vertical scrolling. Sometimes city summary boxes don't update to reflect changes you make. In the end-game, turns take ages to process, and you are bombared with unnecessary dialogues (eg. you've researched all the techs - your only option is to research ""future technology"" - why do you have to reselect it every three turns? There's the same problem at end of the culture tree.) Trade route selection and city build selection are similar - there's no option to say ""carry on with what I told you last time"" so you find yourself reselecting the same thing turn-after-turn. Really, it seems as if the UI was released without proper testing cycles.The distict system really adds a feel of urban planning, and I like micromanaging placement to optimise adjacency bonuses. There is a major issue with water tiles though - they're just wasted potential. Cities founded near the coast are largely useless. There's only one type water district and a handful of wonders so almost every water tile feels wasted because the yields are poor and you can't build districts there, which means an isthmus city cannot build most of the buildings it needs. You find yourself trying to build ""coastal"" cities two tiles inland and positioning them so that they will only have one or two water tile within their eventual boundary, for the harbour and maybe one sea resource or a wonder. This is daft! This touches on something else - there don't seem to be as many buildings as in Civ4. Once you've kitted out the main districts, the only thing left for much of the later part of the game is building a neighbourhood occasionally until the city caps out. The tech tree runs pretty low on buildings after a while. No supermarket, customs house, no trade offs for different types of power plant, no hospital, no bunkers or any other additional defences once you get past city walls. This is particularly bad for coastal cities since it was these late-stage buildings that made water tiles feasible. There probably needs to be some sort of new, unlimited sea district (like a neighbourhood) that you can use to improve water yields to solve this.I like the trade route system (other than the way the UI makes it tedious) and it's fun watching roads emerge from it. However I think military engineers come a little too late, particularly as the 1UPT forces your units to sprawl all over the map - a way of building some early roads ""where you want them"" would be good, even if it were restricted to connecting cities or districts to each other - this avoids the situation where traders always build roads in the ""wrong place"". Also rather odd how roads get better based on era - I would prefer it if you had to research some mobility technologies to get these benefits, and actually had to spend resources improving them (via builders / engineers) in the modern era (as you had to do to get the benefit of railroads in Civ4).All in all, the game just doesn't feel finished. Coupled with the tedium of the UI towards late game, and the chance that your current map will become unplayable (crash) past a certain turn, and I would say to give it a miss, Which is a shame, as this could have been much better.

The only positives which can really be said about this game are the interesting district system and that it has a good soundtrack.

												Game is not ready yet, I think. That's why no.I found several UI and gameplay bugs (blinking of UI, declaration of war from unknown player is shown as I declare war from me to me and etc.). AI is primitive, or I didn't understand new AI )) They always declare war to me, every nation. I can be aggresive or peaceful, it's no metter. Can be big or small. Sometimes somenations is more smart, but I played twice and I met two or three or them. Maybe theirs hidden goals are balanced bad from game to game, but it's bad too. And when I kill one or two its warriors (but still have more powerful army, then mine), they ask me to end the war and give me money. And it happens always with all nations.If telling something good. I like graphics, like districts, like culture, like new moving mechanics (saw someone dislikes it, but it's more logics to move like this). I think, I like most of new features in game mechanics, but the game is still raw.It will be good, if we will see new update soon, which will make this game better.			"

The changes are good, improving game mechanics and scrapping annoying things. Sure, not everyone likes it, thats ok. But ask yourself: How often we complain about a franchise doing the same every year and charging money. But if games are trying to make some changes, we complain that previous games were better. Give it a try with an open mind and not a biased one from previous games. Almost everything from civ 5 is there, and this is only the core game, without addons or dlc.

This kind of glitch is really unacceptable in a game that's this expensive and 'polished'. I have played all the Civ games since Civ2, and I have never had technical problems with any of them like I have with Civ6. Absolutely, incredibly disappointing. So far, I have loved the gameplay, but that doesn't make up for the frustration when you're close to finishing the game and the save file apparently becomes corrupt. Unacceptable.			"

												The barbarians are overpowered massively.Most other changes from civ 5 to now suck.Game claiming to support mods doesnt, so i cant fix any of the MANY issues with playing this. Requesting a refund and going right back to civ 5. Anyone else who bought this should do the same. Anyone who hasn't bought this should go buy civ 5 instead (go play civ 5 instead if you already own civ 5).			"

												Coming from civ 2, civ 3, civ4 and civ 5, i find Civ 6 misses the mark. the weakest point of the game is promotions, only limited to 7 and then thats it.  Modded Civ 5 had approximately 20 promotions for units and I would have expect Civ 6 to take that onboard and develop the promotions further, but they are severly lacking.   Scouts are useless by about turn 100 as they have no upgrades and become cannon fodder for all and every unit.  Civ 5 again allowed you to upgrade the scout to archers etc once they have no use as a scout.The graphics are cartoony, yes,  but I actually like that.Religion has been hammered to be almost useless now, Civ 5 was far superior.Spys in Civ 5 were important and played a big part in stretgy, in Civ 6 again they are pointless and if you ignored them entirely your game is unaffected.Governments are also lacking, and have small impact on gamepplay, unlike civ 5 where they were important and dramtically affected gameplay/style.I like the boosting to research for doing other actions , this is a clever idea and well implemented.I normally play Japanese and for some reason I am yet to work out, I have actually yet to build a samurai believe it or not.  the progression of technology seems to bypass them, even though they are the quintessential Japanese unit, go figure.The concept of districts is a copy of the concept from ""another game"" and though its a good idea, works well, it does force you to building on larger land masses and makes building gateway cities on narrow strips of land completely useless other than creating a passage for ships but the city will be so restricted so as to be nothing more than a gateway between oceans.  Progression in the game in terms of technology takes substantially longer than in Civ 5.  I always get to nukes in civ 5 but i have yet to get beyond 1900 technology in any game i have payed so far which again is odd considering I have played for 50+ hours already.  Even the AI is just getting battleships, no ww2 tech.I hope they produce mods and DLC which improve the game but given to basic concepts seem flawed I am unsure if this game will ever match up to previous incarnations of Civ, which is a huges shame.I can't recommend it in its present form.  You might like it so maybe give it a go just dont pay top dollar and perhaps wait for the mod scene to kick into gear more.			"

												Awful AI ruins an otherwise fantastic game. All they know how to do is war. Arbitrary war. Many difficultys, the early ones are too easy. Civs are passive and bad at aiming towards other victories. Crank up the difficulty even to normal and its just war, war, war. No reasons, just suprise war. Have allies? They won't help unless you have defensive pact. So allies are pointless early game. Not even good for reasearch until you have research pact. I was fine at first just being militiristic and wiping other civs off the map. But god does it get samey. Its not a war game like Starcraft. There are other ways to play. But EVERY map on Prince difficulty or above is just all out war all the time. Even people who say they like you, suprise war. If allies at least would help you out it would be better. But I am not interested in just fighting every time. Game needs massive update to AI. Add some variety. Sid Meier is not working on Civ anymore, but his whole reason for making Civ 1 was that he was tired of making war games. I am not saying you should never have war, and never be attacked. But its out of control. Last game I played I was the target of 3 suprise wars. And 4 Formal wars by 1700. And I had been just doing my thing. Trading with people, trying to keep them happy. Not being agressive. And eventally retired when 3 civs declared war on me at once. 1 who was friendly with me! I levy some military from city states, was not enough. Meanwhile my ""Ally"" was right next to me with the biggest army in the game. Not helping me at all. The last 2 Civ games have really had this issue. But its far worse in 6. I was a focus tester at 2K Marin on Civ 5. Wish I could have been one for 6 as well. Get some answers on why they made it this way!			"

												Maddening game that takes great ideas and implements them in the worst ways possible.  With a bare fraction of the options or gameplay features of previous titles in the series, this game falls short in so many ways that the frustration is overwhelming.  I want this game to be good, and having already invested hundreds of hours in playing it, trying my damndest to find a way to play and like it, I finally just give up.  Maybe I'll circle back when they finally decide to finish things that should have been included at launch, but at this point, it looks like my decades long love affair with Civilization is over.			"

												As a long time civ player I was really looking forward to civ 6. The design features in the run up to release looked promising. The youtubers with pre-release copies made the game look a bit too easy, but it was pre-release and only available on 'prince/average' difficulty. We thought - OK - by October the actual production release will improve - but no. Sadly the game is all front in terms of graphics and no substance in terms of strategy. This is meant to be a strategy game where you could maybe make friends/alliances with one AI over another but no - it's all but impossible to play peacefully at any higher levels and any war declaration causes 95% of the AIs to instantly denounce you. All of Firaxis resources have been spent on sales/marketing, thinking up features and probably testing the first 100 turns or so of a game - hardly any was spent on making it a playable strategy game in terms of AI. Following the winter update I tried a couple more games but no improvement - I have now deleted this game from Steam and will leave uninstalled for probably another year or more. I managed to avoid Civ BE after waiting for reviews - wish I had done the same for civ 6 - don't make the same mistake as me - save your money and/or be patient for a long time until the game matures			"

												Civ VI will take me a long time to assess properly, but here are some early observations:Positive observations:-Sean Bean.-The district minigame puzzle has got potential.-The wonders are pretty.-Gold is easier to get, and plays a bigger role (cities are not always quite as dependent on hammers).-The AI agendas (visible and hidden) is a good idea.-Standard game speed seems a lot slower now, I no longer have to play on epic or marathon.Neutral observations:-There is a lot of early aggression. Barbs and AI make it very risky indeed to prioritize early expansion over building a strong military. In some games I get crushed in 50 turns by 20-30 units large AI armies. Sometimes barb camps start massive invasions pre turn 10. It is hard to imagine any way to defend properly against that.-The AI prioritize founding a religion. In order to get one of your own, you usually need to build holy site very early, even if your capital is not suited for one.-It is profitable to sell builders once they have got only one charge left, and just buy a new one. I'm not sure if this expliot is intentional or not, but it seems odd.-The randomness in the early game has got huge variation. Sometimes you can steal two settlers and build a huge empire unchallenged, other times you get overrun by five barb camps from turn 3.Negative observations:-There is a lot of info missing. I can't tell when my borders are going to expand. The wiki explains what stuff IS, not how it works (like it explains what envoys are, but not how you generate them).-There is too much to do in the early game, and next to nothing for your cities to do from mid game and onwards (other than building armies).-AI starts complaining about my civ being weak or lacking culture and whatnot pre turn ten. Give me a break, will you? I'm still building my first slinger.-Gameplay is too one dimentional. You need to build large armies and crush everyone. The peaceful civ game is dead.-""Continents"" are still almost always two huge blobs of land.-Access to hammers, I mean cogwheels, are still too vital for choosing starting location.			"

												I rarely write reviews, but I am writing a basic one because I feel that CIV 6 truly deserves one.  First, I noticed that most of the reviews are back and forth in what people think about the game.  What I learned is that each CIV game always gets better and there is always a learning curb that holds some people back.  Also, expansion backs are always required to get the game up and going.  Anyways, here are my few thoughts on the game.1. Design: CIV 6 has a beautiful interface and design.  The game flows and it prevents you from getting in the weeds as CIV 5 has done.  I can tell that FireAxis must have spent quite a number of testing hours to ensure that game ran smooth and that interface was simplistic enough to use.2. Music: As with most people say, the music in the game is great.3. AI:  Now, the AI in this game is not to great.   It's better than it was in other CIV's, but there are times where the AI does not develop it's tech or culture and is way too far behind.  I know, why not increase the difficulity.  I do, but I have to put it on Emperor.  On that mode, it's as though all the CIV are cheating and way too far ahead.  I wish this was improved upon.4. Playabilitiy:  I can play this game over and over again.  I love how your not just trying to build all wonders or just one building in a city.  The concept of the districts are uniuqe.  It forces you to really think what your doing and how to go about certain objectives in the game.5. Final Thoughts:  I know it's short, but the game is worth it.  Do not get stuck back in time trying to play Civ V.  I can understand that the game maybe has to mature, but embrace the learning curve and enjoy CIV6 for what it is.			"

												I admit, the game is not where it should be. There are still bugs and balance issues a month after release. With that said, it's still a great game and it improves on the features that Civ 5 had. Here are a few of my favorite improvements:City States - They are much more interesting now as they each have a unique bonus as well as the bonuses you get for multiple envoys. Also there are more types (i.e. scientific and industrial). There is a great variety of quests the city states will give you which I really enjoy. Overall, the city states add alot more depth and character to the game than they did in the previous game.Great People - Another big improvement in a similar fashion. Each great person has a unique bonus. For instance, one great merchant may give a unique luxury, while another one may increase tourism, etc. Also there is a window for viewing the next available GPs and who is likely gonna receive them. You have the option to purchase a GP with faith or gold if you want to grab them before anyone else! This adds another layer of depth to the game and it's alot of fun.Governments - You have the ability to change your government, which houses different types of policy cards. This gives you the ability to customize your government according to what you have researched so far and and you have the ability to change your policies frequently. This is very different from the static policy trees of Civ 5 and it gives you alot more flexibility.Overall, I enjoy the game more than Civ 5. If you're still unsure about the game, then wait until it gets ironed out more with patches. Otherwise, what are you waiting for? Grab it while it's on sale!			"

												I think people are being way too hard on this game. Sure the AI is awful, Sure there are a few bugs here, sure there are certain things that bug me about the game, and sure the AI is complete garbage. But if we look back at Civ 5 for instance I think we'll soon find that the AI back at launch was terrible as well and it was missing several things from Civ 4 such as religion. Civ 6 doesn't do this to us and instead includes nearly all the features of Civ 5 from launch with promises of DLC on the way. Civ 5 vanilla was a decent game but the DLC's are what really made it shine and I think that with some bug fixes, DLC's, and community made content this game will grow to become just as good if not better than any other civilization game. Now does this mean the developers get off the hook easily? No not at all, the AI is one of the biggest things holding the game back and it obviously needs tweaking, but multiplayer is still fun and fighting incompetent AI's can be fun from a purely non competitive stance. So in conclusion,-Please tweak the AI so it's somewhat competent-Continue giving us patches to address some of the more common complaints-Oh and also can we name cities like in civ 5 that was one of my favorite parts in multiplayer plz (although I do love the unit naming mechanic)Overall Civ 6 has a lot of room to grow and improve and despite all its flaws I would still recommend it to anyone looking to check it out because there's a lot of good stuff in here.7/10			"

												I'm new to the series Civilization and coming from one who hasn't played past games, this game is awesome! The graphics are cool and the game is very tactical.A lot of people will complain about the bad AI (honestly the only reason people even give bad reviews you'll notice), but it isn't that bad. The ai plays at a level that still makes it challenging, funny sometimes. The civs are extremely cool to interact with and the tech tree is very accurate, coming from a history geek.Advance through time and create the greatest civilization ever known as you listen to nice music in the background that isn't annoying like other games.The one thing I do recomend is that you look at some tutorials or walkthroughs before playing your first game because the game is very complex and requires some good thinking! Good luck advancing your civilization!			"

LOL), often both; and in over half the cases, parts of the island was cut off by impassable mountains (on the last three I set the world to old to reduce mountains and hills only to have my starting island cut in half by mountain ranges).I am deleting local content, as I have with the other two ""Civ"" games that have come out post Civ V.

												I've been playing the Civilization games since Civ 2... and I'm very pleased with Civ 6. When Civ 5 first came out, before all the DLC, it was pretty bad, it was glitchy and the content was just blah-- I couldnt even run it on my PC until they patched it a few times; and even though my PC is way above spec. I still have some occasional tech problems. For me, Civ 6 has been running perfectly. No random crashes, or any tech issues at all. It's been really nice to be able to actually play a game I've spent money on. As for content, I'm really loving the new additions. The districts give the feeling your cities are really growing, and offer a fun way to customize a city for a specific purpose. Similarly, being able to choose where to place Wonders is really fun, and it's nice to actually see them clearly. The new Civic tree is awesome, it gives you more control over the path you want your civ to take, and it's been fun to play around with different choices. The new government options are interesting-- and I'm liking the new policy cards, because you get alot more options to choose from, especially with the wildcard options. It's nice to be able to multitask military agendas alongside economic and diplomatic stuff.  Furthermore, in every game I've played I've had a number of opportunities to change my policies--or if you're desperate you can pay gold to alter them whenever you want. I've read a bunch of reviews that are critical of the new builder system, barbarians, and the AIs. I actually like the new builders. In Civ 5 the majority of the time you set your workers to auto, and forget them. Lol. However, even on auto they would often not build improvements, and they'd constantly have issues building roads. I always ended up having to take them off auto. and direct them to things I wanted done; and in late game play they became sort of useless. In Civ 6, your Tech. advances and Traders make your road systems-- your own civ's roads are automatic, and Traders make roads as they travel their route. As for the Builders themselves, they last for three turns (unless you increase that number in your policies), and instantly improve the resource tiles. The instant improvement makes up for the number of turns it takes to create a Builder, so I'm not finding myself put out by having to occasionally make one. I've never liked barbarians, I always turned them off in Civ 5, because they always seemed to have a personal grudge against me. When I started Civ 6, I decided to see what they'd changed, so I left barbarians on. Are there a ton of barbarians? Yes. However, I'm not as bothered by them. In Civ 5, if you were attacked by groups of barbarians, they'd just keep coming, even if you'd done significant damage. In Civ 6, because they're ""smarter,"" more often I found that a barbarian unit will just flee. So I'm not feeling as overwhelmed. Plus, I've found getting rid of their camps to be easier. The AIs are interesting, and it's going to be challenging learning all of their personal likes and dislikes. Are some things kind of ridiculous? Yes. But this is Civ-- where Gandhi usually ends up building nuclear bombs, and then uses them. In my first game, I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Japan, England, China, and America. China (didnt like that I had more Wonders) and Japan (didnt like that I'd explored more than him) denounced me. I was seriously worried about war, because I'd been focusing on Science. In order to get myself out of the situation, I had to actually think, and create a strategy. England like Civs who are productive--so I added industrial districts to two of my cities, and a few turns later Victoria and I were BFFs. Then I checked America's choice of government, changed to that, and suddenly Teddy and I are setting up embassies, then we're friends too. The AI's little quirks keep you on your toes, and force you to think a bit harder about your choices... which I prefer over Civ 5, where a country would declare war simply because your borders were too close. Random last comment, once reviewer commented that he didnt like the fact you cant put your scouts on auto.-- yes you can. You can put nearly every unit on automated exploration. When you click a unit, they're UI pops up, and there's a little plus sign that lets you see their other abilities. Auto. mode is there. TL;DR: Been playing Civ for years. The new systems in Civ 6 are cool.			"

												This is, in my opinion, a fantastic game and a definite improvement on Civilization V. The graphics are an enourmous improvement, as can be expected. The art style is highly debatable but I'm personally a fan of it. The district system works well and isn't hard to learn, and the victory types are an improvement from Civilization V - the religious victory in particular is a nice touch. The civic system is also very good, although I can see the system having one or two perfect routes in the future. I'm also a fan of the civilizations themselves, but I would like more of them in the future.There are a few problems though. The AI isn't perfect - they don't always make use of the escort system very well when it comes to Builders and Settlers and Barbarians are very strong early game; I've considered turning them off more than once. Diplomacy still needs a little work, and the envoy system took more than a few glances at to understand.As someone whose used the Enhanced UI mod for Civilization V, I also found the UI a little difficult to understand for the first few hour, but I've gotten used to it by now.

However, for me, personally, these problems were more things I noticed and made note of than problems that ruined or negatively effected my gameplay (except perhaps the Barbarians - it was a shock initally). For others, these issues might be more irritating so, despite the fact I'm enjoying Civilization VI immensely, they are worth noting.I also know people who dislike the artstyle. As I've stated earlier, I'm personally a fan of it. The music is pretty cool too. Overall, Civilization VI is a game that, as of my first impressions, I recommend both as an improvement to Civilization V and as a game in its own right. I wouldn't say that it was a monumental improvement over Civ V Brave New World, but it certaintly is comparatively to Vanilla Civ V, and of course through expansions it has the potential to be even better.

												Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, released Oct. 21, is a polished game that will have veteran Civ players and new fans of turn-based strategy telling themselves “Just one more turn” until their alarm clocks go off the next morning.Civ 6 is the latest in the series, which started with the first game’s release in 1991. Its success spawned the entire genre of video games known as 4X: explore, expand, exploit and exterminate. In each of the Civilization games, you take over a civilization and must lead your people to victory. Just as with the previous installment, Civilization 5, players can win through science, military might, the power of their culture or simply by having the highest score by 2050. Civ 6 does not keep the diplomatic victory option that was present in Civ 5. Instead, it introduces a religious victory, which requires players to make their religion dominant within every other surviving civilization.Players start off in 4000 BCE with one settler, which they can use to build a city, and one military unit, which they can use to explore the world or defend their city. Each leader and civilization has a unique ability and unique units based on that civilization’s real-world history, and the game attempts to place civilizations on the map on terrain resembling where they ruled. For instance, someone playing as Egypt is likely to find their first settler in a desert near a flood plain, while someone playing as Russia would probably find their civilization starting out in tundra.Players will spend most of their time in the game looking at the map, so the developers rendered it beautifully. Unexplored areas have a “Here there be dragons” feel to them, while areas that are explored but not visible are rendered in sepia tones. Visible areas are colored with a light, aesthetically pleasing format. After a civilization sets up its first city, it will begin to research both science and civics. Science provides technological improvements, allowing players to trade warriors for swordsmen, while civics allow a civilization to adopt more flexible and powerful forms of government. The Civics concept is new to Civ 6 and introduces a lot of ways for players to fine-tune their civilization’s growth and development through dragging and dropping “cards” into economic, military, diplomacy and wild-card slots. As cities grow, players will have to determine how to use the land surrounding a city. Civ 6’s cities expand using districts that occupy the spaces around the city center. Other turn-based strategy games, such as Endless Legend by Amplitude Studios, have played with this concept before. However, it feels more polished in Civ 6, which gives players bonuses to a cities output if they’re smart about where they build their cities and districts.Players will interact with computer-controlled civilizations through the course of the game, each of which with its own agenda: Cleopatra, for example, likes civilizations with strong militaries and dislikes civilizations with weak ones. The leaders are individually animated, and they speak in their civilizations’ language. The artwork and animation style are inviting and make you actually want to interact with them.When you’re not talking with other leaders, you’ll pick up on the music and other ambience. Geoff Knorr is the principal composer for the game music, with Christopher Tin writing the game’s main theme. The ambient music changes as you progress through historical genres and was mostly pleasing, though the Renaissance-era portions felt a bit repetitive. Sean Bean — yes, that Sean Bean — narrates the game’s introductory video — and yes, the character he’s voicing dies in the video. Bean also narrates quotes related to technologies you discover and the intro text for each civilization.While the game’s artificial intelligence is generally smart, it has its weak moments, particularly involving late-game trading. In my playthrough as Sumeria, I declared war against Gandhi. I clearly held the upper hand, but as I conquered more of his cities, his peace deals became more cringeworthy. Civilizations should realize when unconditional surrender is the only option left to them, but in Civ 6, they don’t seem to have this self-preservation instinct. Civ 6 also appears to be prone to lagging or crashing in the later stages, but these bugs are infrequent, and the game’s autosave feature keeps frustration from this at a relative minimum.The greatest value in Civ 6 comes from its replayability. The graphics, music and gameplay will make fans of almost anyone, and with 21 civilizations and limitless randomly generated maps, players will keep coming back for hundreds of hours.			"

												If you are an experienced Civilization V, Civilization VI will be a real breath of fresh air. There are a lot of new mechanics in the game, with the city-states (via emissaries), neighborhoods, Wonders (which are physically present and occupy a square,) happiness (transformed into amenities), culture (politics, government ...) ... Some are clearly better (including city-states and activities), others, at first, will be a serious nerve a lot of good old techniques (possible to farm illustrious arrangements for example) ... But it is ultimately its a change, other ways of understanding the game will be changed gradually, no worries. Overall I would say that Civilzation VI is a worthy successor to V. Civilization V I found great, Beyond Earth was garbage. So I was skeptical about the game, but I bought it anyways:What I like:- Graphics: I like the new graphic style very well and in my opinion, more synonymous to a ""Civ""- Soundtrack: The soundtrack is as always good- Day-Night cycle- All components that the predecessor did not receive with DLC (for example, establishing religions) are included in Civilization VI- City districts: Cities are larger, more realistic, and livelier (cities are now no longer tied to one tile, but spread out through the districts)- Buildings: Built buildings, e.g. Grain stores or monuments, are now placed visibly in the city- Miracles: miracles now need their own terrain; The game does not add miracles to the landscape any more- Exploration: I like the new exploration system very much (everything you have already explored but where there is no unit or city, is sketched / drawn in the style of an old map)- Performance: The game runs smoothly, the overall performance is very goodWhat I do not like:- AI: The computer opponent AI is not quite as bright. Some factions are building huge armies (20 units, which are all around my city and just block everything but do not attack); Friendships are very difficult to close (every AI player seems unfriendly)Hopefully this will be fixed with future updatesConclusion:As noted above, Civilization VI is a worthy successor and it offers all the features of previous games and more. The little shortcomings of the AI ​​hope Firaxis is still in order. For these reasons: Definitive a recommended purchace!9/10			"

												Damn, this game is spot on.  I still feel I have a lot more to experience, only with more hours can I grasp how it compares to previous versions.I really like the redesign in most aspects, and there are some truly complex things to grasp to have a perfect end game. PROs:-New Culture System-Districts-Arranging Districts-Map, Military & District intergration-Smarter AI-City-State InteractionsI love how intricate the strategy is, there are just so many different variables to get a brilliant village as its based on the land tiles themselves what you can eventually build in your village.  The AI seems to realise a bad trade better, meaning you cant go selling your luxuries at 10 Gold each.  The City-State now has a lot more purpose and a better benefit for being well traveled.CONs:-Fog of War effect-Limited LeadersWhile I like parts of the simplicity of the Fog of War effect, I would rather have the option of unfading what I have already seen.  There is less variety in leaders (so far?).Update:I seem to be having issues when closing the game.  Have to restart my pc to close it 50% of the time.  Clicking ""Close to desktop"" results in it completely freezing, not even allowing me to close via task manager.			"

												1. The AI really has me worried about the longevity of the game. Can't really fix this with mods, best you could hope for is a bandage until proper AI is introduced.2. The games pacing is really not in a good spot. Production, which is an important function of the game, is too slow to have any meaningful impact on units and buildings early on.3. The games mini map is unreadable, I'm honestly confused how this is a problem since Civilization 5's mini map was clear and represented the formation of borders and countries really well.I waited years for the release of civ 6, with much anticipation. While the game genuinely does have many new and exciting features theres just way too many issues bogging the game down to fully let them shine.			"

												Normally, I would wait to pen a review, but this game is simply that good. Virtually every system is improved on its own and now most are more interconnected than ever. Ever stage of the game feels like a competition - a very good thing. The two most impressive changes are to the cities and the tech trees: namely splitting them all up into more distinct parts. The tech tree has been streamlined by moving many important innovations into one culture-based civics tree, and the cities now have specielized districts which house  most of the most important buildings. Gone are the days of almost entirely neglecting science or culture for the other. Gone, too, are the military slogs of Civ V. Now, the decision to get rid of Civ IV's ""stacks of doom"" in Civ V really makes sense. Instead, to ease congestion and add strategic and tactical depth, units can stack in various formations which become more useful as the game progresses. With this ability and a wider array of units overall, wars feel much more realistic. Unless your goal is to utterly crush an even matched foe 300-year-long wars are rare. The combat is entertaining in every era.If I had one criticism, it may be reserved for the victories, namely the Religious Victory. In the one game played to completion so far, Norway managed to sneak a religious victory past my American culture without even clearly meeting the express conditions because only one other civ of six even tried to hold out. Did Scythia have an extra city I didn't know about or is the majority status based on population? This I do not know and could not have known - very annoying when intentionally playing for a true late game victory. My new rule until a change is made is to immediately destroy any civ which overwhelms another civ's religion with its own. Otherwise, it's a great game which already has my vote for the best in the series.....And for those who complain about the art style - Why so serious? ;)			"

Posted: April 22
												Okay so here goes super long OTT review of the game as it stands following the release of all the early expansion packs.  (TLDR: I think the game is okay, which as far as the franchise is concerned is a worrying and terrible thing)A lot of the reviews on here so far have focussed heavilly on the obvious progress made since Civ V and the blatant balance and AI issues at launch.  While all these points are valid and I understand the frustration at investing a hefty chunk of money into a game which arguably doesn't work, I was willing to believe the devs would quickly rebalance these issues.  They have had time, they have released the bonus content which I paid a premium for and from here out, any additional content will see them asking for more of my money.  Here is my balanced assessment of the 200+ thoroughly unfulfilling hours I have invested in this game so far and why I won't be rushing to pay for any more content for this game.Firstly, the good.  Considering how BE was such a mess, being too similar to Civ V and lacking the historical anchors to immerse the player in I totally understand the need to overhaul a lot of the game.  If nothing else can be said about Civ VI it is definitly a bold step forwards from where the final edition of Civ V ended.  New approaches to city placement which has a footing in how cities were historically founded as well as added complexity from the requirement to place districts and wonders on the map adds a whole new strategic dimension.  I like this, Civ is a strategy game and increasing the ammount of trade offs which occur when decision making is absolutely a good thing and something which should be commended.  No longer are you just plopping cities based on nearby luxuries, there are a whole plethora of factors to consider and districts such as the aquaduct and entertainment complex add further variety to this.  The other major improvement is in combat, particulary in attacking cities.  You can use combat units far more freely now and if your civ specializes in a certain unit, you're pretty much at liberty to use that unit to lead a campaign with.  This is IMO a great progression from Civ V where in every SP game my army consisted of pretty much the same setup of one meat shield, one fast (with medic), 2-3 ranged and as many siege as I could maintain.  Presently, if I have abundent horses, I then I will use horsemen en masse, if I have iron, then knights are the dish of the day, if I have nothing, then I wait for catapults and go that route.  This is FUN!  Combat is a big part of the game and added diversity is a great direction to take the game down (however there are issues I will address)  Military progression also ties in nicely with the other major overhaul of the game which is the tech and civic (culture) boosting system.  Gaining tech boosts from how you play the game is a nifty addition.  Want to boost archery?  You'll need to get a slinger kill.  Want to rush crossbowmen?  You need to have 3 archers.  This again removes a bit of the linerarity from tech progression as you no longer find yourself beelining for writing > philosophy > education etc.  Because it pays to research techs you have boosted you often find yourself playing off of the situation rather than a prooven formula.  Finally, the last major improvement is the added wealth of ways to find marginal gains through micromanaging your empire and planning out every minor detail using the card system.  The increase in the ammount of game changing decisions you can now make is a lot of fun when playing off the higher difficulty levels and I have enjoyed tweaking the civic queue to squeeze the maximumm potential out of each decision I plan on making.  All this combined with vastly more diverse civs each with historically linked playstyles gives the game a great framework to build on.Now the bad.. Ohh so much bad...  I'm just going to get this one out of the way first of all because I can live with a broken AI as you play around it.  What I cannot cope with however is the brutally abhorent sountrack.  A game of Civ can last 5-10-15 hours depending on speed setting.  During this there is almost no variety in what you hear and what you will be hearing is a distracting and  bombastic muddle of rythem and repetition which I would liken to dropping a bucket of golfballs on a xylophone.  Its really weak and they will almost certainly not fix this even though it sets the tone for the game as being a bit of a joke.  Yuck.  Visually it seems too that they decided to step back the realism and make the overworld look slightly dull, 8 replica tree sprites represent a forest, the fog of war is almost indescriminate from much of the terrain and much of the terrain is daubed in a ghastly pallette of orange, yellow, light orange and brown with the odd splash of green.  Like a door with a handle you have to push to open, this just smacks of bad design and I am still having to constantly hover over certain tiles to determine wether or not the terrain is a hill as forest hills are almost impossible to spot without displaying yields.  I consider these to be the biggest issues as they will almost certainly never get adreesed and patched even though the vast ammount of mods altering the colour bias implies I do not stand alone here.  Next is the smoothness of the game as it plays.  I skip a units turn, I hit end turn, there is a pause, I have to then return to said unit, skip turn again, hit end turn again, game realizes one unit stil has movement points left even though it can no longer move where I want it to so it hovers over this unit until I hit spacebar, then it cycles units again then I hit end turn again then the AI moves and I have to navigate repeated requests to engage in diplomatic actions I have no interest in doing, then my next turn starts but I have to wait for 3 screens of diplomatic news about what economic policies my opponents have decided to pick up (Knowing AI is using ""press gang"" policy is hardly game changing knowledge)  then I can finally move again.  This is a MASSIVE dent to the fluidity of the game and over an epic game speed playthrough will easilly add an hour onto the game time than if the round ended when I hit end turn and I was allowed to engage in diplomacy on my terms.  An example of this from my last game was that Norway wanted to ""be friends"" because I happened to own 3 boats which got him all excited.  I refused as he was being a bit of a jerk to others on the continent but he asked again, every turn, for the next 30 turns.  I denounded him in the end just to put an end to it as I couldn't bear hearing the same scriped lines anymore but I felt it was kind of lousy making diplomatic decisions based on the length of time it takes to finish a turn.  My other big issues are pretty dumb things that I'm sure will get fixed anyway given time.  As it stands right now horse units outclass mellee and ant-cav in every aspect which is a bit of a shame because ideally you want the units to work in a sort of rock paper scissors format where melee looses to range, range looses to fast units, fast looses to anti cav and anti cav looses to melee.  As it stands in the game so far, everything looses to fast horse units and until we see a promotion at least where melee can attack into rough terrain and anti cav this will be the permenant order of things.Finally a word about the DLC packs, Maybe I was being naive but I bought the extended edition under the assumption that I was getting all DLCs to come with the game.  Turns out no, and while I can understand that patches like BNV and G&K were game changing I feel totally scammed by the flimsy extra few civs that were lumped into each dlc drop.  If there is one thing I hate its base game content withheld as dlc and shame on firaxis for mugging their loyal fanbase with this cheap skullduggery.  All in all I'm probably going to put thid game down for good and I think I just hit the word count so t			"

												This game showed so much promise but ultimately I really regret paying for this. The AI is completely and utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the ""diplomacy"" could be replaced by a visual display of rolling dice which would dictate what the AI players do that round. There's absolutely no causality between your actions and the reactions from the AI. The one neighbor that has continuously denounced you since the first century of the game might never declare a war on you no matter what you do. Another one, with whom you've been friends since the beginning might suddenly declare a war while declaration of friendship is still active, then after 10 or so rounds, come back with a peace offer backed by a substantial gift. After accepting they're your friend again and offer a declaration of friendship if it happened to expire during the war.A random AI player might offer you a trade where you give them a solid lump of money, another sum each year for many rounds and even throw in a handful of various luxury resources. Oh yeah, and you get nothing in return. But trade's a trade, right?And of course AI loves to build new cities right against your borders, then complain about your military near their border. Eventually they'll declare a war and utterly crush your puny army of tanks and artillery with their indomitable war machine of two spearmans and a crossbowman.More major annoyances and countless of minor ones, but the AI issues are so gigantic that I can't even.tl;drIf you like Civilization, don't buy this. They might eventually fix it but for the love of gaming, don't let them get away with releasing crap like this.			"

												It is getting a negative vote just to counter the hype.It is the most dumbed down version of the game i have played. And i have been playing since Civ 1. Ofcourse earlier Civs are seen in the context of the year they were made.Unhappiness is not a thing anymore. Cover the entire map with cities. No problem.Steamrolling the map is easy now. No more massive unhapiness penalties or need to create puppet states. You can just keep every single city you conquer. No penalties.Developing science and civics is incredible easy with the boost system. Also no penalties for number of cities.All in all you can have 100 cities and there is no penalties or difficulty of running such a huge empire.Information menus are gone or poorly made. List of military units? The list of your cities can't be sorted by production, science, or whatever. So when you hit 20+ cities get ready to micromanage for 10 minutes every turn. Also no more auto-production.Overall information on anything is bad or non existant.Districts are a gimmick. They dont make the game harder or immersive. They just make you trade off a resource tile to put buildings on. Improving and exploiting resources is still important. Builders (workers) that disapear after they have done their number of upgrades is dumb.Everything is streamlined, science, civics, city states, so there are no major trade-offs to consider anymore. Everything has their separate resource and function to make it easy (and boring). Government cards is the worse idea ever. Havent dozens of cards and being able to use 4 or 5...AI is the typical launch garbage. Diplomacy is bad as usual. Combat AI is terrible. AI civ management and victory pursuit is really bad. And once again we have the scenario of tank vs spearmen back in a Civ game.It is fun enough but dont belive the hype. It is worse than previous titles.			"

												This game is put together very well, has very few bugs, and has a nice appearance.  It's an armchair game that you can play with just the mouse.After playing this game for awhile there really is very little challenge to the single player game because the computer opponents won't attack you unless you go out of your way to make them mad and if they do they don't use tactics and are easily defeated.  It ends up just being an economic game (which is just clicking and clicking the mouse for hours on end.  More importantly, and the biggest failure, (researching technologies is a big part of the game) and you really don't feel like your research decisions make a difference.Overall, it's plain to see that the optimization towards multiplayer and tablet play has sucked the life out of what could be an amazing game.   Just too much clicking and not enough challenge due to a 'dumb' AI. "

												I have played every single game in the Civilization series, from Civilization 1 onwards and loved every game.this version is very much like Civ 5 but it has some cool improvements, the gameplay is good - however there is a GAME BREAKING BUG that currupts your game and makes the game crash every single time you reach a certain turn and there is no fix. I'm more than a little irritated that after spending well over 10 hours going through around 300 turns, the game keeps crashing for no reason at all every time I press next turn (on the same turn each time)Its very frustrating that there is no way I can complete the game which I invested a lot of time into and was enjoying, Outside of this bug, i'd reccomend the game highly albeit that it seems far too expensive for what it is.

												All around ok game, But gunna give this thing a negative as the game specifically screws you out of building wonders. I noticed that every time I was 1 turn from completing a midevil or classic wonder, some other turd civ would just then complete it. It became a regular thing as I have played this game, so I decided to run an exeriment.For example. I selected the french to get the initial wonders build bonus. then I left and created games until I got an ideal location for lots of production and food. I ran this experiment 3 times to get my production as high as possible, while having   enough food to grow quick. each time i got within 1 turn of finishing and the computer would beat me. Then i made a 1v1 map, and found the civ quick with the same set up. It didnt take long to find him building a district as I built the stonehenge wonder. somehow this turd, whom was not even building stonehenge, completed it the turn before I did yet again.I dont know if Sid does this to make the game harder or just to annoy its fans. Maybe there is a bet to see how much annoying crap they can put into the games before people quit. I for one have simple switch to the ""let the others build your wonders then murder those fools and take it"" approach. I suppose this is the more realistic method. Maybe that is the leason Sid is aiming for.			"

												In its current form, I cannot recommend this game. I want to, but I can't. There are just so many little annoyances that continue to add up until a game just isn't enjoyable unless you want to go for a domination victory with everyone hating you from the start, and even then its a push. Initially, it seemed great and after waiting so long for an actual successor to Civ 5 I was delighted, however the longer you play the game the more and more obvious issues got.Big negatives for me are:- AI - every game seems to choose to annoy you rather than play tactically. every trade deal was only a deal to the other nation, you could never get a favourable deal, or even a like for like swap in most instances like in Civ 5. If you are doing better than another nation, they will denounce you. Everytime. Without fail. Not only that but nations will go way out of their way, nearly half the map in one instance, to settle a new land beside you to box you in. This, coupled with not being able to ask nations to not settle near you until after they already had, meant that to expand you had one choice. war. Which leads to the next problem...- War- this probably annoyed me most of all. There are now lots of different types of wars, each which add a little more diversity to how you conduct yourself around other nations. Surprise wars will gain you large warmongering penalties, but really these don't matter. If you have any warmongering penalty, everyone will treat you like an insane war lover. Even the nations that declared war on you and that you only fought back. If you are lucky enough to not have to fight them, rare but happened to me a few times, they will ask for peace, and throw resources and gold at you to accept. This happened to me quite alot, with nations going to war with me and after not even seeing one of their units, they would ask for peace and give me all their gold. While this was nice, it did end uip making the game very easy for a while, until everyone denounced me for warmongering.- Barbarians - unlike Civ 5, it appears raging barbarians (were barbarian units and camps will spawn alot quicker) is always on. ths means that early game, especially on larger maps, you have to spend alot more of your time, building up an army to tackle the problem, as they will not relent in attempting to attack your cities and units. also, they will be more technologically advanced than you. making it very annoying trying to combat a couple of freshly spawned barbarian units that are oikemen while you only have warriors. If this was intentional, then fair enough, however the large amount of troops you need has another consequence. Nations will fear you, and then denounce you. meaning that any attempt to brefriend them is gone before you even had a chance to make it work.Other than the above, I have had a few issues withcrashes changing civics policies later in the game, but I imagine these will be addressed sooner rather than later.Hopefully, after another patch or this will become the game it has the potential to be, but at the moment, that looks a long way off...

												Yes, Civ V was not great on release, but that should be no excuse for Civ VI to continue the tradition. Civ VI is just not good enough. It should be obvious to anybody looking at the roster of leaders that Firaxis intentionally held back many features at launch which they intend to charge for later. That is just plain unethical and emulative of the beast EA. Many things are changed from how they were in Civ V, often these changes appear to be made just so they can justifiably say this game is different which somehow is understood as better. It isn't better. The unpacking of cities is a fun idea but it is not executed superbly. It is just so so. Leaders are more cartoony (the whole game is) which seems to follow in CIv Rev's footsteps not Civ V's. Things take too long to build for some reason. You have to build the district and then the buildings. Wonders look cooler but are way too big on the map. Game had obvious bugs on launch. Yes, they were patched soon enough, but still.Biggest annoyance though was buying the digital deluxe edition and finding it only included some of firaxis's cheap DLC's like, oh, here, we added one measly new leader. Yaay! No, that is not ok.Also, city states are even more irrelevant than they were in CIV V, how they pulled that if is no small wonder.Wait for the bundled version at 7.50 or so like Civ V has been for ages now. Huge letdown. Yuge!			"

												That's the end of the Civilization series to me... I've played all of them from the very start... And now they finally did it. 1) Gameplay is EXTREMELY simplified. Idea is to broaden the audience I guess... But the game doesn't really make you THINK at all anymore. You don't select what your citizens do anymore... Your improvements are done momentarilily. The whole development is simplified and unified.2) cartoon-like UI? Really???? I gues kids aged 7 can now play this just fine.... But, i mean, SERIOUSLY???? Complete waste of money on my side. I gues they can just as wellto make it RTS in CIv7... :)Net-net is that if you're new into the series or never really were a fan of Civilization because it was too ""long"" or too hard - that's what you need.If you liked multiplayert games on tiny-tiny maps finished in 15 minutes - you will like it.If you enjoyed spending long nights in Civ3 playing biggest maps and longest games - don't buy it.It will really ruin your experience....

												for all the praise I've seen about this game, I felt like it was worse than Civ V. Civ V has a merable soundtrack, I love just playing it, a very memerable soundtrack.Civ VI on the other hand has only a few actual tracks, if there are more I haven't noticed, they all sound the same. Other than that, the graphics have a very Sims 4 feel, (and no, that is not a good thing), as in it feels more like a cartoon.This game does do some good, I liked the government feature and the policy system were both very good in my opinion, but that's about all the praise I can give this game. I really wanted to like this game, especially because I spent $60 on it, but in the end, I would much rather play Civ V			"

												The ""I don't like the way it looks, 0/10 freemium trackfone game"" anti-negative-review-early-impression-review-review of Sid Meier's Super Civilization Six.TLDR: The graphics are a nice change of pace from Civ 5 (you'll get used to them). All those gameplay obstructions that were super irritating to deal with in Civ 5 have either been removed or modified. Game is well optimized, but is also lacking in some options.*This is in no way, shape, or form a full review, but an early impression. I'm not a Civ expert and I'm not going to try and wow you with big words (like callipygian), nor am I going to call these dumb♥♥♥♥ negative reviewers any names*PRO$-So they changed the graphics because (this is going to blow your ♥♥♥♥ing mind) they wanted to appeal to a larger audience. God forbid they are striving to make their game more accessible to younger/older audiences alike. Regardless, they pull off the trendy-cartoon look WAY better than any mobile game I've ever seen. Stylization allows for things to pop out, and this game excells at making the icons/units/buildings visibly different. Also, how can you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s say this game isn't graphically impressive for a 4X? Have you seen the dope♥♥♥♥♥leader animations? Teddy R. appearing on screen with those exaggerated shoulders has made me♥♥♥♥♥every time.The look of the game honestly bothered me for all of two minutes and that was only because my brain needed some time to adjust from Civ 5 to 6, and people complaining about this will eventually adjust too. But who cares about graphics whats that gameplay like? Dope, with a zero and the euro. Here are some things I like:-Took out worker-based road building and made it way easier to connect cities to cities, while making the whole process more natural. -The barbarians are an actual concern for once, not being able to blast them with your city from turn 1 was a great change. -The split between civics and technology is amazing, doesn't corner you into a position where you want to have the ability to make allies but want to focus your tech on another area. -I have yet to have that stale, ""click next turn for 50 turns"" portion of the game. Every turn forces you to make choices.-I would boink Victoria.-Exploring feels well thought out.-I no longer feel like I'm just spamming tile improvements lazily and queing the entire line-up of building production at my cities. Again, the game forces you to participate.-Happiness no longer gets wrekt when you want to make a few satelite cities.Other than that I have yet to have a crash or even a bug, and I wouldn't be bothered by either because its been out for *0* days, those things are 100000000000 percent going to get fixed. The game is ridiculously well optimized compared to Civ5 even with 6 years of updates and 2 expansions.CONS-Things I don't like tho:-How the game WHIPS THE CAMERA ALL OVER THE PLACE WHEN THINGS HAPPEN, but its not like this issue can't get patched, and I know the Civ guys are good about listening to feedback.-If I wanted to listen to drums everytime I clicked to attack I would just blare the Roots Phrenology album over the in-game sound. Wouldn't be surprised if the drums just get outright removed from the game.-I would boink Victoria and that makes me very depressed because she's both dead and a video game character.-I'm bad at this game.-AI RANT-The AI have always been dumb, forever, in every strategy game ever made since the beginning on time and it's never going to be on the same level as a human player for a loooooooooong time. Either it cheats and it's unfair, or it's just plain irrational, and the latter has only ever improved my gameplay experience. If this is your negative point IDK why you're playing strategy games with bots.END REVIEW-Extremely fun and addicting, I've been having a great time and I know it'll only keep getting better. I have some nitpicks, but I know that everyone's feedback will lead to some great patches.*UPDATE*I think it's hilarious that those giving the game negative reviews have eitherPlayed 0.6 hours of itorAre still playing it after 23 plus hours.

												A review 5 hours in:Will update later on gameplay as I play morePros:- Thought I would hate the cartoony graphics but they aren't bad- Corps are op- Includes one more turn syndrome- great soundtrack- Lots of variety and new stuff -> aka Districts and Civics are awesome- I see alot of potential with the game (mods & dlc)- AI seems to be improved- Gold isnt too hard to manage early game. (unlike civ 5 where it was start with +5 gpt and build a few buildings to be in debt) or i just sucked early gameCons:- I personally dont like the map reavealing, it stays as the ""fog"" and doesnt just darken the area like in civ 5- In game UI can be a bit confusing and you can get lost trying to find stuff- the resources blend in the with stuff around it so I loose track of them, even with yields and icons on.- The mini map is a bit hard to see (is hexagon shaped)- I should've probably played the tutorial & maybe wouldn't have gotten lost in the UI.- still bugs but it literally just got releasedOverall:So far 8/10 - UI could definitley use some fixing IMO.I really do enjoy it and I think other Civ fanatics like myself will enjoy the game. The cons are really just me being nitpicky mostly but I'm sure ill get use to it eventually since it is a brand new game.Would definitley recommend picking it up, I see alot of potential in it being on par with Civ 5, if not better.If you're unsure still then wait for my more in depth review or a sale			"

Posted: October 24, 2016
												I suppose the first thing a lot of returning players will be asking is whether Civ6 is more like Civ5 or Beyond Earth. To which I would say tentatively both, yet neither. Which is a bit of a copout without any explanation, so I'll explain my reasoning. Since gameplay is pretty varied, I'll further break this down into smaller categories, namely City Management, Research/Civics, Religion, Combat, and Diplomacy/AI.City ManagementFirst things out of the way, Civ6 rewards building wide more than building tall, with your average city capping out at around the low 20s in population. However, 20 something citizens is usually more than enough citizens to work every important tile and citizen slot in a city, assuming you have the normal 2-4 districts per city.Which leads to the nitty gritty of city management. Gone are the days of just blanketing your tiles with improvements as a worker and stuffing your city with every conceivable building/wonder. Workers now start with only 3 uses before they are expended, but are significantly cheaper to produce, and improvements take much less time to improve (as in instantly). Furthermore, some buildings are only able to be constructed if your city has contrstructed the appropriate district to house them, which requires a separate tile outside of the city tile, and give additional bonuses to resource generation based on adjacent tiles. Furthermore, wonders require an unoccupied tile to be built, and more advanced wonders often require specific adjacent tiles or placement tile requirements to be built. As such, building improvements around your city will require getting used to, and effective district/wonder placement will require experience, and some amount of preplanning for the more demanding wonders. Your first few games will inevitably force you to pass over these wonders, but Firaxis has done a good job in making most wonders feel like nice suppplements to your empire, rather than pivotal for gaining an early advantage.Research/CivicsThe biggest difference from other Civ games is the separation of the Technology tree into two different trees, the conventional Research tree (earned through Science), and the Civics tree (earned through Culture). Essentially, the Research tree contains all your normal scientific discoveries and inventions, while the Civics tree contains cultural and government development. I find this a nice change, as it reduces Science's overall power as a resource. Sure, having a good Science output is always a nice thing, but by making certain advancements now dependant on Culture enables some drastically different styles of play.Furthermore, accomplishing certain tasks while playing will spark ""Eureka"" or ""Inspiration"" bonuses to Research and Civics, respectively, providing at least 50% of the Science or Culture costs to unlock that advancement. While later in the game, these moments are more of a fortunate boon, in the early game, these bonuses can shake up how you planned to play the game. As an example, Astrology gets a bonus if you discover a Natural Wonder, and it enables building Stonehenge when finished, which is one of the fastest ways to start a Religion.If I have a complaint, it's that it feels a little too easy to blast through the trees. I had finished the Research tree during one playthrough around the 1900s. Compared to Civ5, where I would normally get guns around 1800s, I had anti-tank units by the 1600s. The rewards for later research also feel less rewarding, since by then it's mainly unit upgrades that you unlock.ReligionOh boy what a change. Religion actually can be a path to victory now, instead of a tool for another victory. Essentially, if you can get every Civilization to worship your religion in the majority of their cities, you win a Religious victory. By itself, that can be hard, but combined with some Religious Wars, you can easily whittle down the number of Civilizations you need to embrace your religion to a manageable level.But how does that happen? Well, first, you need to attract a Great Prophet and found a religion. You can then upgrade your religion with additional Beliefs (up to a cap) by purchasing/earning Apostles and expending them in your territory. Second, you need to start spreading the good word to your neighbors. How you do that can be one of two main ways. You can do it like you normally did in Civ5, letting it spread naturally through pressure or with the help of Missionaries/Inquisitors. Or, you can go about Religious Combat. Essentially, you take Apostles and you smack opposing Religious units with your holy book in the general vicinity of cities until they collapse under the weight of your religious superiority, thus impressing upon those cities that your religion is the superior religion, and should be worshipped as such.Again, a single complaint, and it's that Religious Comabt is far too linear to be enjoyable, and can be slightly irritating to deal with at times. As an example, England, may she rot in hell, sent a good 15 Apostles to my Civilization to convert my cities, so I had to repel them with my own Apostles. Unfortunately, she was a Theocracy (a government type, which I will explain later) which gave her Apostles bonuses to Religious Combat, and she sent two Apostles that had a further additional bonus to Religious Combat. That simple +15 bonus to Religious Combat essentially made me trade 3 Apostles for 1, and the +5 on the normal Apostles would necessitate 1.5 Apostles per 1 Apostle. Managing my Apostles in such a one-sided engagement was probably the most frustrating part of that playthrough.CombatHere's a welcome change. Aggression is viable at any point of the game. Yes, even Classical Era wars are worth waging if you prepare for them. Since Cities don't naturally have the ability to perform ranged attacks (you need to research the right Technology and then build the improvement), performing early attacks against your Civilization neighbors is not only plausible, but a common occurrence. This lets early game Civilizations, like Scythia or Sumeria, capitalize off their early units to establish a foothold to survive in the late game.Word of warning, City States flood their borders with early game units, so they're arguably one of the hardest targets to invade in the early game, but become nice targets in the middle to late stages of the game.Finally, unit stacking is back to some degree, with the inclusion of merging units into Corps/Fleets/Armies/Armadas. Combat bonuses snowball exponentially, so the +20 you get from merging two units can meen a large growth in power. However, the production cost to build these stacked units is quite steep, and they still have the normal 100 hp, so losing one of these stacks is a huge blow.Diplomacy/AIAI can be somewhat stupid at times, but at least it's predictably stupid. By checking the Civilization's page, you can see what the ""goals"" of the Civ are, which will influence how they interact with you. Gandhi once got angry at me for not having a large army. Go figure.Espionage is more similar to Beyond Earth, so your spies will perform specific actions, rather than just afk do stuff like in Civ5.Finally, you adopt government types and enact Policies, which you typically earn through the Civics tree. Essentially, they're interchangable bonuses that you can swap out to meet your Civ's needs.Final thoughts.It's not Civ5 reskinned, and it's not historical Beyond Earth. It's definitely enjoyable, but it's very different from previous Civ games. There's something in it that makes me want to play again as somebody new. It's comfortable like Civ5, but more dynamic, so each game feels like a true alternate history. And with 4 expansions to come, it leaves me in anticipation for the future of the game.			"

												Civilization 6 is at its core still a very solid turn based strategy game. Many improvements have been made to diplomacy, the structure and usage of city states, and imo ai in general. The music is phenomenal and the narration by Sean Bean leaves you hoping that he might actually survive until the end of the game for once. If you enjoyed previous installments of the Civilization franchise you will likely enjoy this one as well if you can get over the one major flaw of this game: The art style. The bubbly and cartoony graphics appear more at home atop a frosted cake or a set of lego mini figures than during a battle between clashing giants. Gone is the sense of a real sweeping empire, and instead despite controlling entire hemispheres it feels like all you control is a series of doll houses. The character models look bizarre, and certain portraits and menus look plucked straight from a f2p childrens game. Overall this has been a solid addition to the Civilization line up, but you should take a good hard look at the graphical changes. They have made it all the easier to NOT take that ""one more turn"" since you wont have to look at the colorful bubbly world any longer.			"

												It definitely has potential, I just can't wait until they actually finish it. I'll give this a recommend when they've made it a complete game with patches and DLC and expansion packs, as for right now though I'd recommend you wait.Here's a short list of some of the things that aren't in the game that are in Civ V:- The ability to rename cities- An Earth map, or any real variety in your map choices- An AI only mode like they displayed in their livestream a couple of days prior to release- World Congress- No way to play as a team with other human players (which is exactly when you'd want to play in a team)- The ability to set your units to alert- A good amount of dialogue from the leaders outside of denouncements and their initial greetings- The ability to queue productionThere's also bugs here and there like your own Civ declaring war on yourself and all sorts of little things here and there you'll pick up if you play it for a while. And that's not even mentioning the still abhorrent AI, I was really hoping it would be better this game with all the talk of agendas and gossip stuff but to be honest it feels even worse. I've had Civs that were friendly with me declare war for no reason, then totally fail to do anything with their enormous army and proceed to give me a city or 30 gold per turn to peace out when they have a way bigger military than me. Everyone seems to immediately hate you as soon as you meet them and it makes use of the new diplomacy system pointless because they're all gonna dislike you for no reason anyway. I feel like the barbarians are a little too much aswell, I don't mind a challenge early game but it basically forces you to immediately build up an army just to defend from the barbarian spearman and 2 horseman on turn 20. I expect they'll fix most of this and add most of the stuff I mentioned to the game over time but really most of this should have been in the game on release and if they needed more time they should've just pushed it back until Christmas. There's no excuse for a developer as big as Firaxis to release something so riddled with bugs and to be so incomplete. Maybe I'm being unfair and comparing it to Civ V too much but honestly you shouldn't have to wait 2 years for expansions and DLC to make a game as good as it's predecessor. Anyway in conclusion just play Civ V for now until we get some patches and DLC and stuff, then I can definitely foresee this being a pretty dope game, and when that happens I'll update my review.

												Game is not ready yet, I think. That's why no.I found several UI and gameplay bugs (blinking of UI, declaration of war from unknown player is shown as I declare war from me to me and etc.). AI is primitive, or I didn't understand new AI )) They always declare war to me, every nation. I can be aggresive or peaceful, it's no metter. Can be big or small. Sometimes somenations is more smart, but I played twice and I met two or three or them. Maybe theirs hidden goals are balanced bad from game to game, but it's bad too. And when I kill one or two its warriors (but still have more powerful army, then mine), they ask me to end the war and give me money. And it happens always with all nations.If telling something good. I like graphics, like districts, like culture, like new moving mechanics (saw someone dislikes it, but it's more logics to move like this). I think, I like most of new features in game mechanics, but the game is still raw.It will be good, if we will see new update soon, which will make this game better.			"

												I've started playing civ with the second game. I like the changes in this game. The nations have great bonus traits. The changes are good, improving game mechanics and scrapping annoying things. Sure, not everyone likes it, thats ok. But ask yourself: How often we complain about a franchise doing the same every year and charging money. But if games are trying to make some changes, we complain that previous games were better. Give it a try with an open mind and not a biased one from previous games. Almost everything from civ 5 is there, and this is only the core game, without addons or dlc. If you like 4x games, civ and turn based games, this game is for you!			"

												At this stage, I cannot recommend this game. I have spent over 100 hours playing, and half the games I have played have become unplayable at a specfic turn in the game, no matter how far I go back through the autosaves. This kind of glitch is really unacceptable in a game that's this expensive and 'polished'. I have played all the Civ games since Civ2, and I have never had technical problems with any of them like I have with Civ6. Absolutely, incredibly disappointing. So far, I have loved the gameplay, but that doesn't make up for the frustration when you're close to finishing the game and the save file apparently becomes corrupt. Unacceptable.			"

												Civ6 could have been a worthy successor to Civ4 but sadly is unfinished, unbalanced, and unreliable. There are certainly some interesting concepts here - distracts add a lot to the game, as do eureka moments and the split tech tree and city states, and terrain is a lot more interesting now - but there are just too many places in which the game doesn't work properley.Reliability is the biggest issue - the game sometimes gets into situations where it is guaranteed to crash on a particular turn during the AI phase (after you've played a map for 30+ hours and are in the end game, this is an absolute showstopper - there's usually nothing you can do go play past the 'crash turn' even if you try to revert to an earlier save and play differently). For this reason alone, I cannot recommend this game - it's just too frustrating when this happens. It appears to be quite a widespread issue, as well, and not fixed by the first patch. There are other problems with the game too, though:Some game concepts haven't been balanced or thought through correctly. If you conquer the founder of a religion after they've coverted some of your cities you can be left with a dead religion to which you are unable to evangelise any futher believes or declare an inquisition but which you can't do anything about. The division of units into light cavalry, heavy cavalry, melee, anti-cavalry, ranged, and bombard sometimes leaves obsolete old units hanging around for much too long before an upgrade.Limited-used builders are a good mechanic. I like how they increase the prioritisation of scare resource rather than being an exponential multiplier (as they were in earlier Civ games).The AI is terrible. Doesn't know how to move units effectively in a 1UPT world, doesn't plan attacks well, lets settlers wander around unprotected, often makes apparently random diplomatic actions (eg. declines a proposed deal, then instantly comes back and accepts a worse-for-them deal), doesn't act in own interest when up against a wall.The user interface is missing a lot of things. You can't get a list of your current trade deals. You can't get a diagram of who is at war with whom. You don't get a warning when your trade deals have expired. You can't see your exact science progress towards a technology you're researching, only an approximate progress dial - so can't work out whether managing your production differently will get you there a little earlier or not. You can't see what the benefits of a district project will be.  You can't see which cities have one of your trading posts. The diplomacy screen is a giant animated leader with all the important stuff crammed in to a tiny side bar with a bunch of tabs, requiring a lot of scrolling up or down. The city info pop-out is also too narrow, forcing a lot of vertical scrolling. Sometimes city summary boxes don't update to reflect changes you make. In the end-game, turns take ages to process, and you are bombared with unnecessary dialogues (eg. you've researched all the techs - your only option is to research ""future technology"" - why do you have to reselect it every three turns? There's the same problem at end of the culture tree.) Trade route selection and city build selection are similar - there's no option to say ""carry on with what I told you last time"" so you find yourself reselecting the same thing turn-after-turn. Really, it seems as if the UI was released without proper testing cycles.The distict system really adds a feel of urban planning, and I like micromanaging placement to optimise adjacency bonuses. There is a major issue with water tiles though - they're just wasted potential. Cities founded near the coast are largely useless. There's only one type water district and a handful of wonders so almost every water tile feels wasted because the yields are poor and you can't build districts there, which means an isthmus city cannot build most of the buildings it needs. You find yourself trying to build ""coastal"" cities two tiles inland and positioning them so that they will only have one or two water tile within their eventual boundary, for the harbour and maybe one sea resource or a wonder. This is daft! This touches on something else - there don't seem to be as many buildings as in Civ4. Once you've kitted out the main districts, the only thing left for much of the later part of the game is building a neighbourhood occasionally until the city caps out. The tech tree runs pretty low on buildings after a while. No supermarket, customs house, no trade offs for different types of power plant, no hospital, no bunkers or any other additional defences once you get past city walls. This is particularly bad for coastal cities since it was these late-stage buildings that made water tiles feasible. There probably needs to be some sort of new, unlimited sea district (like a neighbourhood) that you can use to improve water yields to solve this.I like the trade route system (other than the way the UI makes it tedious) and it's fun watching roads emerge from it. However I think military engineers come a little too late, particularly as the 1UPT forces your units to sprawl all over the map - a way of building some early roads ""where you want them"" would be good, even if it were restricted to connecting cities or districts to each other - this avoids the situation where traders always build roads in the ""wrong place"". Also rather odd how roads get better based on era - I would prefer it if you had to research some mobility technologies to get these benefits, and actually had to spend resources improving them (via builders / engineers) in the modern era (as you had to do to get the benefit of railroads in Civ4).All in all, the game just doesn't feel finished. Coupled with the tedium of the UI towards late game, and the chance that your current map will become unplayable (crash) past a certain turn, and I would say to give it a miss, Which is a shame, as this could have been much better.

												This game is put together very well, has very few bugs, and has a nice appearance.  It's an armchair game that you can play with just the mouse.After playing this game for awhile there really is very little challenge to the single player game because the computer opponents won't attack you unless you go out of your way to make them mad and if they do they don't use tactics and are easily defeated.  It ends up just being an economic game (which is just clicking and clicking the mouse for hours on end.  More importantly, and the biggest failure, (researching technologies is a big part of the game) and you really don't feel like your research decisions make a difference.Overall, it's plain to see that the optimization towards multiplayer and tablet play has sucked the life out of what could be an amazing game.   Just too much clicking and not enough challenge due to a 'dumb' AI. "

I'm more than a little irritated that after spending well over 10 hours going through around 300 turns, the game keeps crashing for no reason at all every time I press next turn (on the same turn each time)Its very frustrating that there is no way I can complete the game which I invested a lot of time into and was enjoying, Outside of this bug, i'd reccomend the game highly albeit that it seems far too expensive for what it is.

												i would give this game a 6/10 as it is currently... the AI is worthless, see notes below.  play humans if u must.the AI is simply given a math advantage.  the ""harder"" the setting choice (like deity, king, etc,)  means the computer gets more more more.  and faster.  and easier.  this has zero to do with AI, there is no artificial intelligence in any national behavior of any kind.  you will see every surprise attack and assume all neighbors will for no reason declare war on you.  prince is the even level but feels so shameful since i dont think i have played prince level since Civ 1.what i hate about this game and drives me away is that the computer will either do nothing OR build so many cities and spam you with units that you might as well choose small map every time.  i will watch a civ that is lets say 15 hexes away build its first settler five hexes away from my capital.  every time.  some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nation will always build near you to the point it has to involve war.  you cant build heartlands or use map geography to be clever.  if i put up a screen shot of a huge panagea and show you how darn crowded it is first 100 turns you would assume i was playing a small map.  there are mods for distance between cities and i recommend like 12.  now tie the two comments together: you have every single neighbor on crack cocaine speed advantages building everywhere you wish you could on the map and in the mean time worthless wars will take you attention away.  oh someone in a distant land you never met just built their 5x wonder you dont have.  if u play higher levels it is because you are a wargamer and that works for me.  but trying to do anything else just causes so much ""how does he have 11 scouts already and they are near me and nowhere near his lands?"".1200 hours in civ5, probably twice that in civ4.  mods made all of those games 2 years after first release into JOY games.  so the mod community will work on the AI, the city spacing, the wars-for-dummies, and other imbalances... i recommend this game in late 2018 or after 2 more major DLC... dont forget civ5 and all DLC was selling for $5 last year, so patience on this series gets you the most return imho.

Adjacency bonuses are ridiculously low.The only good thing I find is the impossibility to have a wonder grabbing player, although benefits from each wonder are very reduced compared to previous  iterations of the game.They could invest time and money making another Civ V extension instead this blushingly shameful ""Endless Legend"" copycat.

												I was really looking forward to this game after all the enjoyment I got out of Civ V, but, unfortunately, Civ 6 just constantly tests my patience.There were some good design decisions brought in with Civ 6, but the AI seems to have really suffered for it. I'm not even talking about the constant, random denouncements or joint wars either. I mean the AI, literally, cannot use ships or planes. The AI is also pretty bad at district placement which means most AI cities won't even be worth capturing. But, of course, you have to because of the massive warmonger penalties to razing cities.The final straw for me though was discovering a bug when retaking a captured city that can cause the ""cede city"" option to just not appear on the trade screen. This means said city is just under perma-occupation and basically worthless. I've never really enjoyed combat in Civ 6, but a bug that's been in the game for months which makes defending yourself/retaking territory pointless just adds to the frustration of it all.Civ 6 is still a mess in its current state. It's hard to say if one expansion can fix it, but I certainly hope so.			"

												Civ VI is a very good game, so why give is a thumbs down?`Because it has HUGE balancing issues. So it is mostly a ""not yet"" button.- The AI is crazy, it spawns endless numbers of troops and keeps them on stone age level throughout the game. By 1000 AD the map is FULL with starter level AI troops. It's just insane and it is cheating, since there is NO way the Ai can fund all these AND build up their cities like this at the same time.- All AIs are no insanely warmongering. By 50 turns I see 1-2 civs always wiped out already. Some Civs seem very weak, like Germany as AI, while others as AI are insanely strong.- The barbarian swarming is ridiculously high. The camps spawn way too often and then you spent 90% of your time in early game fending them off. It's a chore, but shutting them down in options would make the game too boring.- As others have mentioned, the Civ AI doesn't care rats♥♥♥♥♥about what it promised. We dont settle to you, we dont convert you, no matter, seconds later the promise is forgotten.- The super aggression of the AI leads to the fact that by mid game EVERY AI Civ hates EVERY OTHER. None of them actually cooperates.- in the long run they new, brown fog of war is not so good, I liked the Civ 5 one better, where you could see the colour mode beneath. This makes finind appropriate terrain a bit challanging.- Religious victory is way too easy for the AI. Unless you become a real warmonger or go totally into religion yourself, there is no way to slow down some enemy AI from spreading it's faith like super fast.Great game in the making, but lots of tweaks needed.

												I honestly can't get past the awful new movement rules. Right off the bat, they cripple enjoyment. There's a myriad of other problems too. You're better off going with Civilization 5, or 4. Civilization 5 has a very large number of modular mods, and Civilization 4 has some of the best total conversion mods you've ever seen, but you'll have to pop over to the Civilization Fanatics forum to find most of them. I highly recommend Planetfall and Fall From Heaven 2.It's also been three months since launch, with still zero word on mod support, which was promised and marketed both before and a bit after launch. As you may note, the game no longer has a tag advertising mod support. As you may note, they say that it's somehow still a work-in-progress.

												Not an improvement over Civ 5 yet, unfortunately.Everything that Civ 6 improved upon seems to be superficial issues. City planning and district building added a new level of depth to the game, which was exciting at first, but not enough to fix the other issues.- Navies are now underpowered.- AI only supports a game for warmongering, as they will FORCE you to take over the world by force.- As such, Religion & Culture victories are out the window.- Trade routes are extremely tedious to maintain, and I've abandoned them altogether.- Spies are extremely tedious to maintain.My god, this game is a mess to try to finish. I wanted to have some intense diplomacy. To create a world stage for me to slowly inch out my kingdom's influence. But no, EVERY GAME, every AI player decided I was the devil and aspired to attack me. They get even more upset when I defend myself, and it is impossible to maintain even a single ally on the world stage.I can't really recommend this game. It is enjoyable up until the point you just give up out of the tedious/repetitive nature of the late game.Workshop support would have saved this game easily, but they seem to have abandoned that in favor of overpriced $5 DLCs (that modders could have made hundreds of in a week).Buy something else.

												There is a lot of promise here but it all amounts to nothing because the AI is completely hopeless. The biggest issue seems to be that the AI has no intention to actually ""win"" the game. It doesn't seem to realize that it's even playing a game. The AI is stuck conforming to these moronic personality rolls and the score is the last thing on its mind. It may stumble Mr Magoo-like into a victory if you let it, but no matter what difficulty you put it on, the game is just too easy, particularly the late game.The major AI issues currently are:-The AI doesn’t know it’s playing a game.-The AI doesn’t know it should be trying to win.-The AI won’t build new cities unless there are perfect locations available.-The AI won’t settle half the map even if there are perfect locations available.-The AI can’t tactics.-The AI can’t strategy.-The AI just isn't interested in playing CIV VI...I really want to play this more but until the AI is fixed it just leaves a disappointing aftertaste every time any early game challenge melts away and victory is a certainty.

												Personally, I've enjoyed this latest addition to the Civilization series, the focus on each civ's abilities and unique bonuses give the game a greater variety and emphasis on which civ the player chooses. At the same time, the bonuses of each civ are spread out so a certain civ isn't limited to a single victory type. Compared to previous civ games,  the biggest changes are in the districts/wonders and diplomacy. I like the new requirements for wonders and the fact that they take a tile, as it prevents one civ from building all the wonders in a single city, although sometimes the requirements might be a little too picky (ie The Great Zimbabwe needing to be adjacent to a cattle resource and commercial hub) and often prevent wonders from being built until much later in the game. In terms of the diplomatic game changes, I'm surprised and slightly disappointed  by the removal of diplomatic victory and world congress. I enjoyed the world congress in civ 5 and it needed some work, but it definately added to the gameplay. I enjoy the new casus belli system, and I think it could be developed further to add more reasons. An additional casus belli for claimed land and forward settling (if a couple requests to stop settling near a player in the future are ignored/denied or a promise is broken, a small casus belli could be added for any cities within 6 tiles of one your own cities) could be added to deter overly expansive ai/players.Biggest Complaints:The art style of the civs is chaotic ranging from decent to garbage- leaders such as gandhi recieved rediculous cartooned features, while victoria recieves atleast a somewhat realistic image, but still cartoon. I'd prefer a return to the attempts at realism in civ 4.Diplomatic relations are next to impossible, to be friendly with a civ, you must appeal to both of their agendas and even then any little thing can set them off, and a friendship doesn't really grant you anything-in civ 5 your friends might denounce those you denounce or even declare war with you, not so in civ 6, everyone denounces eachother and declare meaningless wars.Civ 6 is a decent game, but its not worth $50+, the price needs to be atleast halved to be worth it.

												I have put many many hours into the Civ franchise, over 100 on Civ VI alone, and while the game isn't terrible I cannot recommend it. There's a lot of small changes to get used to, not a big issue, however a lot of important functionality has been lost in the process. One of the biggest peeves I have is the chaining of road building to merchants. No reason to send a merchant to any one of your many cities? Well most likely there will never be a road leading to that city. It's a terrible way to manage roads and serves no purpose except to make the incredibly stupid idea of disposable builders hurt a little bit less.Two, disposable builders: this is the worst change in the game. You get a few ""charges"" to construct improvements and then they're gone. Whomever thought this was a good idea needs to skip the planning meetings going forward. It's an awful idea that leaves a player spending loads of turns wasting away making builders. There's no longer any strategy to protecting them, simply churn out a new unit and build your improvements. There's no improvement upgrades as far as I have noticed, so once their wad is blown that's that. It's insipid at best. Also no roads get built by builders, as mentioned previously, it's impossible to connect your cities if you don't waste 20 turns of your trader's time. Considering 20 turns can be in-game equivalent to 200 years you can see how mental of a system this is (seriously 20 turns to establish a road to a city 6 hexes away in the early game is just stupid).Three, it's boring. The game very quickly becomes dull and lifeless with no real point. You pretty much have to play aggressively which means you pretty much only ever get conquest wins unless you purposefully retard your army and hold back. Not fun. There's no real sense of accomplishment, just this repetitive cycle of tech, war, and building that doesn't really matter. Just build a big army of archers in the first 50 turns and kill everyone, game over. Dull.I wanted to like this game, maybe they're saving a nice update that will make the game fun for a future $60 expansion pack, either way I'm done with it. This is a sad and unenjoyable chapter in the civ franchise, lacking basic common sense functions like road building and generally taking way too long to get anywhere in the game if you want to play other than Ghengis Khan style. Mid-game is a dull slog up the tech tree to the atomic era where you're still bored, but now have nukes. I appreciate all of the work that went into the game, but can't recommend this game at all. I have no idea why the Civ team seems to think they need to reinvent the wheel with every iteration of the game but this reinvented wheel is mostly square and doesn't roll along very well.			"

												Sadly, I don't see this game being playable until 2018.  It might be a great game by then, but it fails right now.  The new concepts are promising but not balanced.  Your ability to manage an empire is severely strained because you don't have proper overlays.  And although the stack of death is gone, the replacement is this weird abstraction of a tactical battle being fought across a strategic map.  Civ V had that same issue as Civ VI, but I had hoped they would have found a way to make war feel more natural.			"

It's just not fun playing you anymore.I've played civ since the original and seen its progress with way too many hours invested than I would like to admit. It has had its ups and downs but was always an adventure. I think the francaise has lost its way.I want to play a game that I remember before, creating a civilization and seeing it thrive! I sick of this horrible digital board game with arbitrary rules that add nothing. It has no sense of realism or fairness but sticks with a few stupid rules that contiue to get bogged down by other more stupid rules. The concept is amazing but the execution has gotten worse and worse. Civilization has not kept up with the times. It's potential is so utterly amazing with a large staff and monetary backing as well as huge fan base that supports it but it has fallen short. Who is your creative director? The one who actually makes up the way the next game will play like. Can I have his job?You need to modernize with the times Civilization. The old board game of my rules my way, even if its not fun, needs to end. It's painful feeling like I've wasted my money on a fraincaise that I love. I can forgive vanilla Civ 5 once,  but now civ 6 is practically the same game. Boring and limited. No imagination for how much potential it has.			"

												Great game, but without cross-platform functionality (Mac to PC), I can't play with my buddy who has been playing all the versions with me for almost 25 years.  Please add this to the next update.			"

												I really enjoy several of the new concepts with this edition. The enmeshment of civics and science and it's impact on your civilizations advancement is great. However, the religion component all buut ruins the game for me. Not since CIV IV has the religion part of the game worked. It's all about having to continually religion spam other players and they you. What would have made it more compelling is, like in CIV IV, the ability to spread religion and have multiple religions present at a time would have made that aspect much smoother. But you will continually be bombarded by religion units that it brings down the overall quality of the game dramatically.			"

												I would like to recommend this game however the limited diplomacy, gameplay issues such as a lack of balance between the different constuction costs (spending 50 years to build a wooden harbor or training a single swordsman makes no sense)  are making this game barely unplayable.There seems to be too few military units on the board, several UI wont have a single war boat during the whole game! AI cannot control the unstaked war principles either. They will send small waves of units, easily defeatable. There will rarely be a single city swap during a whole marathon game which is a shame!Bring back unit stacking and decrease the production cost of creating units. Civs declare war with No Units to defend their border city! Still I want to believe they will have this covered soon...hopefully!			"

												There is a lot of promise here but it all amounts to nothing because the AI is completely hopeless. The biggest issue seems to be that the AI has no intention to actually ""win"" the game. It doesn't seem to realize that it's even playing a game. The AI is stuck conforming to these moronic personality rolls and the score is the last thing on its mind. It may stumble Mr Magoo-like into a victory if you let it, but no matter what difficulty you put it on, the game is just too easy, particularly the late game.The major AI issues currently are:-The AI doesn’t know it’s playing a game.-The AI doesn’t know it should be trying to win.-The AI won’t build new cities unless there are perfect locations available.-The AI won’t settle half the map even if there are perfect locations available.-The AI can’t tactics.-The AI can’t strategy.-The AI just isn't interested in playing CIV VI...I really want to play this more but until the AI is fixed it just leaves a disappointing aftertaste every time any early game challenge melts away and victory is a certainty.

												Personally, I've enjoyed this latest addition to the Civilization series, the focus on each civ's abilities and unique bonuses give the game a greater variety and emphasis on which civ the player chooses. At the same time, the bonuses of each civ are spread out so a certain civ isn't limited to a single victory type. Compared to previous civ games,  the biggest changes are in the districts/wonders and diplomacy. I like the new requirements for wonders and the fact that they take a tile, as it prevents one civ from building all the wonders in a single city, although sometimes the requirements might be a little too picky (ie The Great Zimbabwe needing to be adjacent to a cattle resource and commercial hub) and often prevent wonders from being built until much later in the game. In terms of the diplomatic game changes, I'm surprised and slightly disappointed  by the removal of diplomatic victory and world congress. I enjoyed the world congress in civ 5 and it needed some work, but it definately added to the gameplay. I enjoy the new casus belli system, and I think it could be developed further to add more reasons. An additional casus belli for claimed land and forward settling (if a couple requests to stop settling near a player in the future are ignored/denied or a promise is broken, a small casus belli could be added for any cities within 6 tiles of one your own cities) could be added to deter overly expansive ai/players.Biggest Complaints:The art style of the civs is chaotic ranging from decent to garbage- leaders such as gandhi recieved rediculous cartooned features, while victoria recieves atleast a somewhat realistic image, but still cartoon. I'd prefer a return to the attempts at realism in civ 4.Diplomatic relations are next to impossible, to be friendly with a civ, you must appeal to both of their agendas and even then any little thing can set them off, and a friendship doesn't really grant you anything-in civ 5 your friends might denounce those you denounce or even declare war with you, not so in civ 6, everyone denounces eachother and declare meaningless wars.Civ 6 is a decent game, but its not worth $50+, the price needs to be atleast halved to be worth it.

												Civ VI was the opportunity to revise and refine the AI, war, and what would drive opinion in the game. Sadly, Civ VI takes three steps backward. Other Civs denounce you if: you build more wonders than them or build fewer, succeed against them in war or fail, have fewer spies than them or more, expand too much or too little. There seems to be no way to earn or keep allies in this game. Hopefully in expansions to this game, the programmers will realize that warmongering is not a zero sum game and focus more on the declaration of war vs. who actually wins that war as a penalty on the player.

												I cannot recommend this game at this time.  it feels like a polished Early-Access game instead of a full release, which is all the more a shame considering who it is coming from.  The bones of a fantastic game are there, and I have no reason to believe that Fraxis won't flesh them out in the months to come.  The unstacking of cities, combining military units together, researching civics like techs, boosting techs and civics.  There is a lot to like here in what they have changed.  Hell, you can build more than 4 cities with no noticiable penalty, which really is nice if you want to make a huge civilization.However, there are problems.  Other reviewers do a great job but I just want to echo ones that stand out to me as the worst.  Bugs and the AI.For a complete game, the amount of technical issues is sad.  None are game breaking, but I would expect better.  Sure, in two months they will probably be fixed, but I am pretty sick of how many games are being released in this sad state.  The audio for the people talking in the intro video and all in game voices are too quiet and impossible to hear.  I didn't even know Sean Bean was involved because he was impossible to hear, until randomly the victory screen you can hear him fine.  I put a support ticket into 2k one the day the game was released and they only wrote me back today, although none of their suggestions fixed the issue.  The game also randomly hangs when I go to exit it and annoying other things.  Again, this will probably all be fixed, but pretty sad for basic things like this to be messed up.The AI is also awful.  Sure, Civ games are way more complex then just about any other game and I cannot imagine the nightmare of making a compotent AI oppent, but the AI in Civ 6 is laughably bad.  Worse than Civ 5.  I would hope asking for AI that is at least as much of a challenge as it was in Civ 5 would be the base line.  Instead, diplomacy is all over the place and the AI has yet to take a single city from me, even when I purposely left one undefended with no walls to see if they would take it while we were at war and they had units next to the city.  Instead, the units danced around.  Hell, they barely even pillaged.  This problem goes away in MP, but I primarily play Civ against the AI, so this is a sad development.TL;DR: Great potential of a game with too many issues in its current state to recommend, but will probably be fixed in the future.

												I regret buying a copy of CIV 6 early before all of the DLC has been released. Like always, another CIV has been released as an unfinished game with horrible balancing issues. These issues are but limited to, an overly aggressive AI, laughable Barbarians invasions that grief you pre turn 30, and religion units that can go into your borders and block your movement without invoking war. I’m sure the game will get better in a year from now when the game has been sorted through, but right now I’m wishing I didn’t pay for the experience I’m receiving with the current game. There just isn’t enough unique content included in the game yet to justify playing this game over the complete edition of CIV 5. It’s sad that I’m having to wait for content that’s already been included into previous editions of the game. You would think after more than five previous titles that have virtually the same mechanics they would stop repeating prior mistakes. It’s almost as if they are trying to sell the game in segments. Oh wait…Edit: The new winter update has come out and although I am underwhelmed by the amount of content I’ve received from the season pass (two scenarios and one civ), it has brought update improvements. Most notably, I have seen improvements in the AI’s diplomacy and their rationality when deciding to declare war and build militaries. Meaningful alliances are now possible and there is actually a point to communicating with other civilizations now. I just played 100 turns since the update and I have made and alliance with both China and Germany. These alliances have put me into a state of cold war with France and put me into a joint war against another civ with my Chinese allies. The game is looking more promising but I still think that people should hold onto their money before purchases this game. These improvements aren’t things that we should be grateful to get. The civilization franchise has been out too long for updates like these to just now be taking affect into the game. I’m hopeful that when all the DLC and fine tuning is done this will be the best civ yet.			"

												Start game, Medium difficulty. Two nations spawn close to me. One declares war turn 21 even though I have more army and we have positive relationship. Destroy him, wasnt him just waste of time.Second faction declares war on me for fighting the first faction. Meet another two factions both declare war on me for fighting the first two.No challenge at all. Constant tedious boring AI and horrible mobile gameplay. How after multiple paid DLC have they still not fixed the game? It is pathetic, how could you take pride in your work if your work is this?			"

												Still in my first two paralell playthroughs, but the CIV feeling is there again. The unstacking of the cities and the split of the science tree (incl. the Inspireation/Heureka moments) are great concepts that have increased the amount of decision making and thus the immersion into the game for me.On the downside I have to admit I do not find the AI overly challenging and plus the tech speed in relation to the production output requires IMHO a re-balance, but this is not impacting my fun with the game.Again really happy with the new Civ and looking forward now to the first patches and DLCs.

												Unfortunately in this games current state, this game would not be something that I would be willing to recommend. Firstly, the games performance is fantastic, coming from early Civ V's consistent crashing and disconnecting in multiplayer, you will find Civ VI's loading screens and multiplayer performance a pleasant surprise after coming from Civ V. I have experienced absolutely no issues while playing this game. I feel that this game visually appears a bit crowded and difficult to decipher, the colours aren't very distinct from each other in some environments and when zoomed out the map kind of appears just like a big blob of very dull colours, when in environments like the desert however the game feels bright and visually appealing. There is something about it that I can't quite place my finger on, but with the current look of the game I struggle to get the same immersive feel that I can get in Civ V, possibly as a result of the new cartoonish art style that takes the game away from feeling like you're controlling an expansive empire and closer to the experience of a casual mobile game. Similar to a casual mobile game, the DLC are uninspiring, boring and honestly a complete waste of money. A single civilization and 'scenario' are hardly worth the $5 USD, especially if you intend on just having the DLC civilizations as an AI nation in your single player games.The AI are awful. There is simply no other way to put it. Diplomacy feels completely void of any real effect to the game, upon meeting an AI it is not whether they will be a vital ally or mortal enemy, but rather how long until you inevitably anger them to the point where they will hate you for the rest of the game? I have failed to have at least one successful alliance with any AIs in the game. Inviting their delegations appears to have no effect, and if it does, I would not know what it is, a feeling you will commonly have in this game where tool tips are either unhelpful or non-existant. Casus Belli system while welcome seems useless because worrying about your warmonger status is pointless due to the fact that everyone already hates you. In addition to the terrible diplomacy regarding other AI nations, the city-state system, while I actually appreciate the envoys that have been added to the game, losing the ability to pledge protection to a city state, be called into their wars and gift units to a city state makes it utterly useless to have any real alliance with them as you would be able to acheive in Civ V. You will now find yourself making the decision of declaring a war upon the AI invading the city-state itself and having a full scale war, or allowing them to destroy your faithful city-state ally, losing the ability to fight a form of proxy-war where you are providing units but not formally at war again allows Firaxis to continue to completely destroy any immersive feeling that may have existed in Civ VI.The UI is minimalist, and disappointing, things such as your GPT and science per turn are now presented as tiny little numbers in the top left corner. While this in itself is a bit annoying, as it really doesn't draw your attention like the previous Civ V top bar did, the real thing that disappoints me is the fact that when you are in negative GPT, it doesn't even change colour or warn you. You now have to keep up with the job of pulling out your magnifying glass every turn to see whether or not you are even making money. A similar experience with the new minimalist notifications, which again are completely unable to grab your attention with the crowded visuals of the game and you will frequently miss events. I thoroughly enjoy the new districts, religion and wonder changes, seeing your wonders stand tall next to your cities is fantastic and a great addition to the game, religion is similar to Civ V and works like a treat, the only fault that I would give it is the waves of missionaries that infect your land as you get further in the game as well as the poor AI 'agendas' which will leave you as an enemy forever despite any other diplomatic events that had occured if you do not match another nations religion. Overall, the words that I would use to describe this game is; disappointing and boring.  "

												Okay, I get that they were trying to add a lot of new mechanics, but I think maybe they went overboard.  Having to designate a specific tile for wonders and for districts while adhering to the myriad rules about which wonder/district can go where gets ridiculously difficult, especially if you also want to be able to feed and house your citizens when only certain kinds of tiles can be farms, etc.  And it's many times worse if you're unlucky enough to be on a small island.  Once you're well into the game and your cities stop gaining new tiles at any reasonable rate and are large enough that you can no longer purchase new tiles yourself, you're pretty much stuck as you can't do anything to remove districts/wonders if you discover later that you have a more pressing need for something else.  Once not even focusing your city on food is enough, you may get into a situation where your city is shrinking and you can't build anything and even if you can research something that will give you more access to food, it may only be able to be built in a district you don't have and have no place to put.  I'm finding it very frustrating even on settler level.  I wish you could turn off housing requirements in the advanced game setup or that something as useful as neighborhoods was available significantly earlier.			"

												Sadly, I don't see this game being playable until 2018.  It might be a great game by then, but it fails right now.  The new concepts are promising but not balanced.  Your ability to manage an empire is severely strained because you don't have proper overlays.  And although the stack of death is gone, the replacement is this weird abstraction of a tactical battle being fought across a strategic map.  Civ V had that same issue as Civ VI, but I had hoped they would have found a way to make war feel more natural.			"

Once not even focusing your city on food is enough, you may get into a situation where your city is shrinking and you can't build anything and even if you can research something that will give you more access to food, it may only be able to be built in a district you don't have and have no place to put.  I'm finding it very frustrating even on settler level.  I wish you could turn off housing requirements in the advanced game setup or that something as useful as neighborhoods was available significantly earlier.			"

												Playing all civ games over the years here is my review on this game.+disctricts and city managment. This one feels nice and gives a lot of thought to city development+maps look good+resources have more meaning+wonders have more requirements on where to build+policy cards mean better civ customization+less unit cluter and now you can link settlers+army unit-religion is either go all in or turn it off as a victory setting.There is no option for a crusade kind of war, talking to AI about not converting does nothing, no banding together vs a religion, no anti religion if you have no religion-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI-diplomacy is bad-warmongering is ridiculus(you get declared war, you defend and maybe go on aggresive a bit, dont want to take their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ peace offer, instantly you get denounced by half the nations)-trading with AI is just stupid(they wont take any offer 1:1, even 1:2).You can even give them a better offer that they gave you and they just dont take it(eg. they offer 15gpt for something but you want lets say inta gold so you offer them it for 400 gold and they refuse till something like 200 gold or 10gpt)-you can do nothing about nations warring your suzeirans till late game-nations released as dlcEdit march 2017:+some minor changes+mods+some AI improvementsThe game is slowly moving in the right direction where you can play some enyojable games, if they fix the AI a bit more and tweak some numbers then i can recomend the game, its very close to being an enyojable game but not quite there yet			"

Pros:A good starting point for people who are new to the 4X genre.Gorgeous graphics and effects.Great soundtrack.Very detailed and well animated civ characters, that speak their native language.Runs very stable, the only time I've noticed any stuttering was when I changed policies late in the game, and only for about 5 seconds after I changed them.New districts/city building mechanics.New culture tree.Builders running on charges instead of taking turns per terrain upgrade.Neutral:Eurekas and inspirations. I like the idea of it, but in practice it feels like you spend too much energy trying to unlock eurekas rather than just going for the upgrade path you'd prefer.Cons:DLC. I bought the season pass when the game came out, it was absurdly expensive. Had I not done that I think I'd be very frustrated with the nickel-and-diming going on. Aside from the money, the biggest problem is dividing the community. If you're going to charge for additional multiplayer modes at least make it like the additional civs. I should be able to host a DLC game type even if a friend doesn't own it. Just like I can play a DLC civ in the same game as someone who doesn't own it. It's frustrating.Unbalanced wincons. To me at least, Culture victory in a competitive game seems impossible, same for religion in any game above 4-6 players.AI.  It's bad.Teams AI. The AI don't work well together and will frequently get into religious wars amongst themselves.Diplomacy and agendas. This also ties into AI. Regardless of their hidden motives, they should play to win. Ally themselves with other players and generally have a better military presence. Despite it all I'm still enjoying my time with Civ VI. I recommend it, but barely. (Seriously, please fix the AI.)Computer Specs: Intel i7 5930k (O.C. 4 GHz), EVGA GTX 1080ti FE (O.C. 2,000~ MHz), LG 34UM95 (3440x1440, 60hz), 500GB Samsung 850 Pro SSD.

												A great installment into the Civilization series Civ6 changes a few things up in a major way. With a full game and a half under my belt in 22 hours I'm definitely enjoying the game. However, nothing is without some flaws, so while I wholeheartedly recommend getting Civ6, these are the things that bother me, and may bother you. Movement: The change to movement that requires your unit to have enough MV to move into a hex is definitely a huge impact to combat and moving around in general. In case you are unaware of the change, now a unit needs to actually have the 2mv points in order to move into a hill or forest area, as opposed to in Civ5 where you only needed 'some' amount of mv points, and if you didn't have enough to move into the hex it would bring you to 0 and stop your unit from going forward. The reason this hurts is because it costs you extra turns to just move units around. For example getting to a river with 1 of 2 mv points you have to end your turn get the 2mv points, cross the river (which takes 2mv points) and then end your turn in order to continue forward. Previously you would have gotten to the river with 1mv point, crossed it which brings you to 0 and end your turn. On the next turn you'd have 2mv points and continue your march into the distance. AI Leaders:I was hoping that the new system would make for slightly smarter / better AI now that they had agendas. But that still didn't stop my strongest friend (Japan) from surprise war declaring on me, even though I had a very strong military, and 2nd highest religion (behind him) and culture (behind Russia) which are all part of his Bushido agenda, and was very financially stable which was his secret agenda (Money Grubber). This was after he pulled me into a war with Russia, who he then made peace with 10-15 turns later, and left me alone to fight them for around 50+. (Still not sure how that happened, Russia just would NOT let me negotiate peace with them) The few other things, that have been awkward getting used to is amenities, and how unclear it is at first glance why / how to increase them (until you get the recreation district). The Barbarian raiding parties when you fail to catch a scout before it gets back to it's base. One of my playthroughs almost ended short because I had three raids hit my capital at once. Again, I still totally recommend the game, and plan on dumping many more hours into it, but it definitely isn't a ""perfect"" game either... but anyone expecting that is foolish to start with.			"

												I do not recommend this game in its current state for a few major reasons, but first I will list the pros of this game (since there are a few):- Drastically overhauled gameplay from Civ V. Now for some this may not be a pro but for me it definitely is since shaking up the gameplay in a meaningful way is what keeps the franchise fresh, and in Civ VI the new features like district building, the two distinctly different tech trees (science and civics), the revamped and now actually dangerous barbs keep the game feeling radically different from its predecessor. Unfortunately, there's only one large problem in the way that prevents me from giving this game a thumbs up.- AI: In a word, atrocious. Absolutely terrible even after two major patches. The tactical AI is pitifuly lacking as units are shuffled around endlessly, ranged units are put at the front lines, and naval and air units aren't even utilized whatsoever by AI players. The strategic AI isn't much better either, often asking for precious resources and not wanting to give anything in exchange, or the exact reverse situation happens where the AI will offer everything it's got after you've only razed/captured one of its two cities. Multiplayer is existent and much more stable than Civ V, but the playerbase is dwindling. So yeah, doesn't look like I will purchasing any more Firaxis games. A lot of people play single player and don't have the time for multiplayer, and I am one of those people. I would like a competent AI that is at the very least as good as Civ V's AI, and right now that is most certainly not the case.			"

												It's time to find something else to play.  Civilization, you've had a good haul.  I've been an avid player since III.  I've tried to like Six... I really have.  But it doesn't work.  The natives are too agressive.  The other civ's are just beyond dealing with.  I feel the limitations of their AI as soon as we meet.  I hate the animations and graphics.  It would be half way decent if there was a way to shut them off and just deal with them in dialog mode, but no.  The amature graphics and animations persist.  It has some good concepts!  I like the trade system.  I like the duel tech and civics trees (without the fact you burn through them way too fast!)  I like the general direction of the game.  I wish there was more good things I could say.But the bad concepts have more weight than the good.Take the map for example.  It's not a world, it's a map.  If my ship is going around the world, even one tile too far, the whole thing flips, like some over-excitable puppy doing something nasty for your attention.  You loose your sense of disconnect the pervious games give you way too quickly.  You go too far north and suddnely you are getting Sagitarious and Pices signs.  Not cool.   It also feels like an age or two are glaringly missing.  Just as you finish wiping out the barbarians, here come more.  You have no time to build, expand, or colonize.  You're constantly defending yourself from the spawn of hell.  It gets old and it gets boring and repitious way too quickly.  Then suddenly you're researching rockets.  Knights to rockets... no time to linger and watch the world grow... no, now you're off to Mars and off to bed.  It's too bad really.  I've put in about five-hundred hours, but no more.  So long and good luck Civilization!			"

												After putting many hours into this, I can't really recommend this, at least until it goes on deep discount. The problem is that there's just way too much damned micromanagement in the mid to late game to be fun. It was taking me a profound amount of time to get through the later turns. This isn't helped by the return of the same problems that plagued Beyond Earth, namely the fact that trade routes are really powerful, and that infinite city spam is highly rewarded. By the end of my Rome small game I had 15 or so cities, 20 trade routes and a decent sized army to deal with, culture, a bunch of spies you have to click every few turns, diplomacy, city states, assigning your great people every few turns... you are just constantly pouring over the same stuff again and again and again, and it gets incredibly tedious. Early military is also a bit too strong for some civs. The combination of having low warmonger penalties and cities that lack attacks make early military very strong for any civ, and almost absurdly so for the three ""early rush"" civs. Look, having any abilities this strong out of the gate is potentially broken in multiplayer and will lead to unsatisfying play experiences. AI is also.. whacky. There are plenty of absurd situations that form from the combination of adjendas. I've counterproposed more favorable trades and and been refused, been denied peace requests only to have one come a turn later offering me cities, I've declared war on myself.. these bugs are really minor, but the behavior of the AI is incredibly irratic and broken, sometimes never settling beyond the first city, and other times spamming dozens and dozens of units from it's 2 or 3 cities. All in all, the game doesn't really do enough to draw my interest, despite the fact I've greatly enjoyed all the CIV's and a ton of other 4X's up until Beyond Earth. Civ 6 is a bit better than Beyond Earth, but makes too many of the same mistakes, which is inexcusable, considering they knew about the problems. It's ok, but needs a lot of work in terms of streamlining and AI improvements, first.			"

												Civ 6 is like Civ 5 on reverse steroids that just make you suck. Production is completely crippled so you end up just clicking ""next turn"" over and over. There is no steam workshop because apparently they didn't think of that, so you can't even do their job for them and adjust the game to your liking. For $60 I expected a finished, polished product with some significant improvements over its predecessor, but this is basically just ""hey maybe we can squeeze some more money out of our fanbase.""

												I have been playng to all the CIV games since 1993.I liked them all. Also this last one is in the same line but..The game concept design is innovative and very appropriate to the all game.the new politics structure is a good alternative to the former ones.the units use and aggregation system is a good development.the AI is much more challenging and the barbars more active.But, the graphic component is very often confusing, not easy to distinguish the units or the perspective, and the all map becomes too clumpsy.you cannot run through the screen with the mouse as before and is very difficult to see the situation of your various units or commercials, The shooting is often delayed - my machine is not slow at all, and there are some mismatch among the units development.units that are able to shoot from/to the sea, archers able to damage a battleship, fog of war unrealistic, as you loose most of the knowledge of what you somehow got to know.I am back to CIV 5, sorry for losing €80.wait a good year to see if 2K have fixed some bugs and changed some features.

												I've given Civ VI a try...over 220 turns worth of it so far.  Enough to have a good feel for the game.  As a Civ veteran I was able to pick it all up pretty quickly and it's not too much different than Civ V.  But it is different.  Not sure if I really like it or not right now, kind of on the fence.  I like the map, especially the effects regarding the unknown and areas you've explored.  I actually rather like the districts for cities.  It's different and seems to work OK.  I also like that you can't spam every wonder you see.  Like others, I think the AI is not very good...but it's never really all that good in a Civ game so that's nothing new.  I don't like the rather cartoony feel of the explored map and the units.  I don't dislike it either but it's glaringly different in look from Civ V so will take some getting used to.  I am mixed about the cartoony feel of the leader screens too.  Is Civ VI the best yet?  I reserve judgement for now.  Overall the game has a good feel and flow about it and it's certainly got that Civ 'just one more turn...' addiction going for it.  And so far it hasn't felt buggy, no crashes or anything.  And it works well on fairly minimal specs.  But I'm also not going to stop playing Civ V yet either.  Still I like Civ VI and we'll see what it looks like after they add updates to it.			"

												Civilization VI is a welcome addition to the series that fine tunes the gameplay of Civilization V in many ways. It is a much better launch title than Civilization V, containing virtually all the content of previous Civilization games and then some. However, some long standing issues in the franchise still remain, and may even be worse than before.First off, Civilization VI is not going to revolutionize how you play Civilization. It has many adjustments and additions, but the formula is fairly standard. The districts and the culture tree are the two biggest additions. The former adds a new layer to city building. Districts have better bonuses than standard buildings in previous games, but they take more production to build, and also use up an entire tile near your city. They are highly specialized, and locked by population count, so your cities can't possibly hope to acquire them all. In the end, you have to pick and choose which district is more viable for which city. The civics tree is also a very cool new way to handle the culture mechanics. Let's face it: culture in Civ V was dull. You open a screen, find your favored bonus, and press a button. The system has now been completely changed. You are given a civics tree, which can unlock buildings and governments, but primarily unlocks policies. Your government type restricts you to a certain number of policies of each type (there are 3 policy types and a wildcard policy). This creates a very dynamic way of managing culture.City-state interaction has also been vastly improved. Now, you gain influence in a city-state by sending envoys. These are primarily gained through diplomatic policies. The more envoys you send, the more bonuses you unlock from the city state. Militaristic city-states grant bonuses to unit production. Mercantile city-states grant additional gold. Religious city-states give you more faith, and cultural city-states give you, well, culture. If you have more than 6 envoys AND more envoys than other civilizations, the city-state becomes your vassal. They help you in war time and such, and also grant massive bonuses.Graphics aren't super important to Civilization, but my opinion on the graphics of Civ VI is mixed. On one hand, the animations are great and the environments are as gorgeous as ever, but I am not a fan of how the cities look. I liked the dynamically expanding cities of Civ V that grew with population count and actively incorporated wonders and buildings into the scenery. Everything is out of scale and cartoony now, but this will likely make older Civ players feel right at home. I also wasn't a fan of the music. The main theme is gorgeous, as always, but the in-game music is rather weak by comparison. Chances are, you will turn it off after 10 minutes and listen to a podcast instead.The only area the game really suffers is the AI, and by extension diplomacy. The AI is terrible. You are guaranteed to be at war with every other civ at some point in a match. They don't make alliances or friendships, not even for strategic gain. They wait until you are weak and declare war on you, all while berating you for being evil (I'm looking at you Saladin, you ♥♥♥♥ing hypocrite). There are almost no interactions that you can have with other civilizations besides trade deals (that they won't honor), requests to stop screwing with you (that they won't follow), and demands (that they won't cave to). The AI goes beyond stubborn and falls into outright psychotic territory at times.The game also lacks some features of Civ V, believe it or not. All of them relate to customization. You are far more limited on map types now. There are a grand total of THREE scenarios to chose from, which is pretty sad. There are not nearly as many toggleable options like Raging Barbarians (probably because it seems to be set to on by default, judging by how hard the barbarians in this game are). You can no longer name civilizations, leaders, or cities. All of these things will be missed, but they aren't bad enough losses to really hold the game down, and it adds so much in other areas that it becomes a worthy trade-off.All in all, Civilization VI is certainly a good game. It is a shame that flaws that are endemic to the series (like bad AI) have not been addressed, but none-the-less it is still a fantastic title and well worth it to long time Civilization fans.			"

Product received for free
												Civilization 6 is a game that brings alot to the table when it comes new mechanics and a general overhaul of many of the systems; Everything from Science/Civic system to the new agendas. The Wonder system is something I personally really like, I used to farm wonders and had a set way to play so I almost always secured the best wonders in multiplayer, but now that they all need their own seperate tile and have their own unique requierments.The districs also play a giant role in the new title. Some places give you extra adjacent bonuses, making them good spots, but you might need that tile to build a wonder later, so you actually have to think about what you are doing now.When the first pictures were released many people complained about the graphics, me included, but they bring a new perspective to the game, more color and not too cartoony. Some complaints I have is that Civs always denounce you right away when you don't fulfill their agendas, sometimes they would do it twice in a row before declaring a so called ""Formal War"" on you. The warmonger penalties are also ridiculously high and still after a nerf, decays too slowly. I once tried liberating Japans capital, but I was still denounced for being a warmongerer.After the recent patch the Leaders seem a bit more reluctant to declaring a war they can't win, but that doesn't mean it won't happen.Personally I believe that Civilization 6 will become better than Civilization 5, but at its current stage its too unbalanced and before DLC comes out, a little few leaders, but that doesn't mean Civ 6 is bad, not a all, it just needs some extra love and care from Firaxis to make this rough diamond shine "

												Positives:-The game looks fantastic-- and if you play on a crappy old piece of machinery like me, meaning graphics are hard, the Strategic View is actually a viable way to play the game. It is my preferred way to play.-The map is actually relevant to the game, in that you have to actually use it and do some proper land planning, instead of just spamming farms and mines.-The Wonders system makes Wonders much more unique than in other Civ games, with very specific requirements, leading to unique gameplay. Plus, there are a lot more of them.-The Inspirations and Eureka Moments sytem is great-- getting a huge boost towards developing a technology or an idea based on what you do in the game is a very smart move and, again, leads to large diversity of play.-Different playthroughs are not samey like they were in Civ V, given the unique way the tech/culture trees develop and the player is forced to use the map. I've found each playthrough unique and I value that.Negatives:-The game is too easy; not a complaint of mine, but one that I agree with, as Quill18 demonstrated a few days ago on Youtube when he beat it on Deity and doesn't think he deserved it. I don't think he did either.-The AI is actually trash. I did not believe it could get worse from Civ V. It did. I'm leaving this short and simple because if I listed all the ways the AI sucks right here this review would be way too long.Overall, I feel very positively about the game, especially given that, at release, it has a lot of room to be expanded upon. Remember, Civilization V at release was far different from Civilization V a year on, especially with all the DLC and updates. Civilization VI, whatever people think of it at release, is actually quite a good game if you give it a chance, and can only get better. Therefore, buy it in a year or two when you can get it and all the DLC for like $40.			"

												OK, waited until I had put at least 25 hours into this game before I reviewed it.if you liked any of the prior games you will like this.I was cautious about the art style from what I saw in trailers but once you get your hands on it, I found I wouldn’t have it any other way. The Game has more content then civ 5 with all its expansions (except different civs)so far its the best civ game i have played yet. so im giving it a solid 9/10 only becuase there are a few bugs they have to work out. ( i once had my own country declare war on me ) ( fixed itself in game but was pretty silly )			"

And then If I hosted, and invited him, he could join, we could play our first turn, and then there would ALWAYS be a disconnect between turn 1 and turn 2, in which it would always say ""You are the last remaining human in the game"" to both of us....

												A.I is still garbage. It cheats by getting unfair advantages early on and does not compte on skill, making the whole game suck when you try to advance difficulty, the lower levels are too easy, the harder ones are unfair.   All the gamplay is a bit faked as your often only just playing against a dumb A.I.  They added better graphis, annoying Civ leader animations and a whole lot of polish, but it's still a dumb unfair game.			"

												Civ 6 is a two-steps forward, one step back.Pros Barbarians are an actual threat and continue to be a threat later on in the game. Declaring war on another country requires planning and patience.  It's not at all necessary for you to initiate a war that you actually want to start.  But if you do want to declare war, proper procedures will allow you to have minimal fallout. DX12 and visuals are a clear step-up over Civ 5 and even on a late game, performace stays consistent at max settings. Strategy and planning requires far more thought than in Civ 5.  Though there are a few annoying things. Workers have charges now, so you can use them 2-4x on developing land and then they go away. Cons There is a large rift when looking at how they handled workers and points of focus.  It is *easy* to completly skip your turn without being notified that you can fire on an enemy from a state base.  You have to manually scroll through the entire map to see if you have this ability or not.   Like-wise I would prefer to have a general workflow for my workers to automatically gear my land for Production first, food second. Generating great leaders in any field can be useless if you don't have the pre-requisites.  And if you sleep the unit and later on build the requirement, you'll have to scrub through everything looking for where you left them.I still recommend Civ 6.  It's definitely on the right track but they need to speed up some segments of the game and also assist the player with action notifications so things don't go by the wayside.  I'm not looking for a long drawn out tutorial section, I'm just looking for clear-cut cases that you can be notified and respond within a second.			"

												Let's get one thing straight, in the big picture, I think Civ VI is a rather fun game. It's got the gameplay that I expected and has changed a lot of things that bugged me in the past. It has more of an emphasis on building in general, but I always was an avid builder in the other games, so I got used to it pretty fast. With all that, I can easily recommend this game.But, the small things, the small things are what really tug on me.When I play this game, the small things are what I notice the most. The core gameplay is there, so the small details are what stand out the most.Good Things:City States: In Civ V, I pretty much ignored city states, unless I knew I could get away with conquering them or had money to spare. However the interaction is much better. Using infleunce to create envoys seems like a much better way. And they don't slowly hate you more as time goes by.Sprite Differences: are always nice. Anything that makes your sprites different depending on your culture. It feels like they did this a bit more than Civ V.Insta Builders: really was weird to me at first, but I've grown to like it. Why should it take 200 years for me to build a farming improvement? Being able to do it in one turn seems a bit more interesting.OK Things:Graphics: A bit too cartoony for my taste. The map is perfectly fine, though it looks a bit too clean if that makes any sense. The wonders are pretty damn cool to see on the map though, they are much more impressive having their own tile rather than just being smooshed in. Leaders are animated, but some look a bit dumber than others. Cleopatra in particular has something weird about her eyes and facial expression that go uncanny valley.Great People Generation: is a bit weird. Basically you compete against other nations to get them with your great person points. Whoever gets the amount first, gets the person. Or if you're rich, you can buy them. Great people do differ from each other, which is cool,  but I wish they made that more clear. For instance, I was focusing on a scientific run, no religion whatsoever, and I was able to create a great scientist. Much to my dismay, I found out that you can only use her on holy sites... Yeah, wasted a lot of time on nothing.Annoying Things:Map Sizes: I dunno why... but for some reason, the map almost seems smaller. I've always liked to play on the biggest maps available, with vast oceans separating me from some of the players. You know, like earth. But it seems even if I choose Island Plates with high water, I can easily access every continent using the most basic of boats, meaning that I have no need to enter the actual ocean tiles. Maybe I've just had bad luck, but I've not found it yet after starting 4-5 games.Waves of Religious Units: Christ, this became unbearable in some games. For some reason, the AI sends waves of religious units. In most cases I didn't mind, I either got rid of their religion once they were done with me, or I used mine to keep them at bay, but damn, the time I didn't focus on religion, it actually affected my economy. I just wanted to build a few improvements, but for some reason, the AI decided to fight a religious war right in the middle of my land. I'm talking about two different religions killing each other, 5 religious units each, in the middle of my territory. I literally could not do anything cause I didn't care about religion. I had to wait for them all to retreat before I could start building improvements again.Bad Things:AI Diplomacy - At this point I'm beating a dead horse, plenty of people have said this. But damn, the AI is butt hurt. The AI is extremely hostile, they just want you dead. Get used to seeing all but a few leader portraits with angry or sad faces on them, cause that's how it is. And they will get mad over you for everything. There was one game I had where another civilization insulted and denounced me unstopping since the moment I met them in the ancient era, because I didn't have any spies, a renaissance era technology. I play on marathon too, so this harassment was going on FOR AGES!Declaration of Friendship? Good Luck. I have never once gotten them to accept, even if they are outrageously happy with me. Only way is if they ask you.Warmongering penalties? Only if it's you. Say goodbye to most of those cities states, the AI loves to take them down as soon as possible. Hell, most of the time war is declared on you, it's multiple people.In conclusion, it's as I said. The small things that matter. Even AI diplomacy is still a small thing, I had to adjust to it, and adjusting to it was hard. But once I did, it didn't make the game any worse, just made it more challenging. That's why I can still say I recommend it.			"

												What REALLY suck in this game is the game speed. I mean the number of turns per hour done if comparing with CivV. It is extremelly slow specially if you play the Standard map (size). This make the experience boring, speally when you need to reload some turns before. I REALLY recomend the developers to manage the AI so they create fewer units. Some improvements in the performance could benefit the game too. If you don't care with the game speed, I can tell that the game is very good with new interesting mechanics. The game is not bad. But can't recommend until I prefer play Civ V then VI. Hopefully this can change. Today is 13/Feb/2017 See updated information before decide.			"

												It will be good.  Eventually.  For now, it is death of a thousand needles. No one thing is wrong, but the game is full of so many minor flaws (with 2K/Firaxis giving no indication that they are rushing to fix things) that I cannot recommend it right now.Some of the issues:-Unbalanced civs-Stupid AI (If you thought Civ V AI cheated but was stupid, wait til you see this)-AI personality is overshadowed by stupid AI/diplomacy balancing/bugs (they declared war on you 5 centuries ago and now consider you to be a warmonger because of it)-Terrible UI, both in-game and in the menus-No support for Steam Cloud game saves (which Civ V had)-Very limited custom game options or maps (no teams, and less than 10 map options with most of those being bad to play on. 6-pointed start with 10 players? Sounds legit)-Maps are limited to smaller and less players than Civ V-City-states are more random chance and luck than previous. (All players essentially get equal points to assign to city-states, so you can't really focus/ignore them)-Bugs.  Bugs.  Bugs.For now, it is fun but frustrating. Once these get fixed, then I will consider it good, but until then, stick with Civ V.			"

												I have been a fan of Sid and all his games since I first played Civ #1 back in the early 90's. I have played all the Civ's, Colonization, Alpha Centare, Pirates and the new X-Com. I have to say this game of Civ 6 is by far the most disappointed I have ever been with a game.How the hell do you release this game without the “wake” option for units?Why do city states get placed all around my starting position?The World Woders feel dull and are not worth going after and they take up a hole space that your city needs.And why do we not have an option to set the number of city states?The new builder unit is total crap! You have to do 5 times the work for ½ the control.The mini map looks as if someone threw up confetti, absolutely unreadable. AI is so messed up I can't go into this all but what the blue moon is it doing? It loves you one turn and the very next declares war on you. I have no problem with this as a possibility however, it happens all the time and with every Civ.The turns and game time takes forever. Now I know Civ 5 had 20 and 30 hour games on huge maps and all but Civ 6 just feels like work- not fun gaming. The civic system needs to be completely redone and balanced. And once again they just added a lot more work to the game.Why do we still have the same stupid future tech as the last versions? We research and get points only. Why not add something for the work?The new city districts take away vital space. I like the ideal however it is not well installed.The mouse scrolling is a mess. For god sake it works in civ 5 but you couldn't figure it out for 6??I will shelf this game and come back after some real serious patching. I know it took some time for civ 5 to come around and play well, I just did not think they would do this to us a second time. I hate when companys release a game as finished when it is realy just eraly access.			"

												This game is only worth getting if you plan to play singleplayer or online multiplayer with friends. If you plan to play this for its public multiplayer dont online game speed combined with simultaneous turns is pure cancer. GOOD LUCK getting a multiplayer game that has its settings on quick or dynamic turns. I already wrote a pretty long review why online game speed and simultaneous turns is just pure cancer individually and togther especially but it didnt upload properly so to sum it up real quick. Simultaneous turns same old problem whoever clicks first wins removing all strategy from the game. Online speed allows even low production cities to build units in ludicrously quick amounts of time even allowing for units to be completed in a single turn for much of the game this helps to further kill any hope of tactics and strategy that you might wish to employ on your own. As basically online multiplayer is just a spam click fest were people just spam units and click till their mouse explodes in order to win.			"

												This iteration of Civ can be very strong, if they patch it properly. I love the core mechanics and the improvements from earlier chapters. Why the downvote then? Well, at present status the game is just not worth its pricetag. Main problems are the subpar tactical AI and skirmish-like diplomacy system. Granted, AI and diplomacy are not a big deal if your goal is to play online. However, I only play singleplayer and the lack of development in these fields totally destroys a game for me. Tactically, the AI is unable to attack: it deploys a carpet of doom which doesn't even try to seize a city and then forgets to keep units up to date. Leaders seem to be bipolar and  slaves of their agendas and seem unable to evaluate a military/political scenario. This is inexcusable, given that Firaxis was able to deploy a great diplomacy system years ago with SMAC.Honestly, I was expecting a bit more, for this price. While I'm able to forgive bad AI and diplomacy in a game like endless legend (which costs 1/3 of this), I can't do the same for a game developed from a company who used to set the standard with their products (and whose games are so pricey).

												Another great  graphics game but and its a big but, its just civ 5 for another lump of money.  Civ 4 is the model they should be improving not civ 5. Very very slow waiting for the turn to end, so slow that I can do the dishes in the time it takes to complete a turn. Everything is messed up from the lack of unit stacking to the combat system. Be warned pretty on the outside but very shallow on the inside. Also I hate spies and they pretty much ruin the game.			"

Posted: December 22, 2016
												This game needs a lot of work.  Some of the key issues include:1) Completely asinine AI.  Absolutely the worst AI of any of the CIv games.  Go from ally to enemy in one turn, denouce you for simply having a different government type, and every AI thinks you're a warmonger for defending yourself.  One good example is, I launched a war to liberate England, including their capital.  What did I get for it?  Everyone denoucning me, including England.  Moreover, they will denounce you and then try and trade with you the very next turn.  It's almost as if it was late on a Friday for the dev team and they just ""went with it as is.""2)  Game is simply too slow in the latter ages.  Even with cities that have a strong industrial focus, it takes way too long to build anything.  It shows with the AI.  Their armies are typically very small, which makes the game boring.  Most wars are over too fast, because no one can afford to build enough.3)  No United Nations?  This seems like a major oversight, as it plays a big role in Civ 5.  Half of the reason to get city states on your side is lost.4)  If you lose the game, you'll never know why.  It simply pops up and says....you lose, game over.  No stats, or details behind why you lost.  Unbelieveable.  5)  Religion is TERRIBLE.  I disable religious victories.  All you do is spam as many apostles and missionaries as you can...all over the world.  That's it.   Relgion should go back to what it was, a branch of culture.  All of this drives the game into one simple direction.....war.  It's way too easy to just roll over everyone.  Why struggle with anemities and resource trading when you can simply take it all?  This game feels very polished in some areas, and terribly underdone in others.  I'm hopeful they will fix this with quick updates.   "

Posted: December 11, 2016
												I have played Civ since I was in college and played way too many hours of the first version in my dorm room. I've played every mainline version of it since (but not the spinoffs) and It is probably my favorite game franchise of all time. I'm disappointed to report that Civ 6 has the seeds of some innovative ideas, but overall it is worst version of Civ I have yet played.  I don't have too much to add to some well-written reviews already posted, but I would add a few points of emphasis.1. The AI in Civ VI is by far the worst AI in the history of the game.  Computer players are absurdly, inexplicably incompetent when it comes to fighting wars, even at high levels of difficulty. An AI player may well show up at the doorstep of your city with a huge army, but upon attacking a majority of the units on any given turn won't do anything; by that I don't mean they don't do anything useful, I mean they literally sit there and skip their turn.  If you attack them, individual units will usually run away, showing no sense of overall strategy of risk or sacrifice.  Attacking an enemy city is the same: enemy units will act completely illogically.As other reviewers have noted, while the new system of diplomacy has interesting ideas, they are incompetently enacted by the AI.  You can do everything right with another civilization, but after a certain point they will turn and declare war on you.  At higher difficulties, the designers apparently made things tougher by making other civs less friendly, but it begins to make diplomacy seem superfluous- why bother with secret agendas and such if they are going to inexplicably change their mind and try to kill you at some point anyway?2.  Civ 6 takes a big step backwards in terms of providing you clear information about your civ. How many different luxury resources do you have?  In diplomacy, what trade routes do you already have, and for how much longer? What is the rate of population growth for your civ compared to the world? All these things, just for examples, are either difficult to ascertain or simply impossible without resorting to pen-and-paper notes. Older versions of Civ had many graphs and tables to figure such things out, but the new Civ 6 is simplified in a negative way.  Even the Civilopedia is worse with fewer internal hotlinks. The bugaboo of Civ games has always been avoiding micro-management, but the designers have gone way too far the other way so that now you can't even figure out what is going on.  They even took away one of my favorite moments of Civ: the post-game wrap-up. I loved reading my final stats compared to the world and watching the little timeline video of the history of the my game: all gone.  Now there's just a few hard-to-read graphs and a final score.3.  Count me amongst those who dislike Civ 6's use of roads.  It is wrong conceptually and for game play. Instead of ""workers"", straight-forward units who have been making roads and improvements since Civ 1, there are now ""builders"" who instantly make improvements by using up a certain number of charges they have when created. And these builders don't make roads at all: these are made exclusively by trade caravans, who build them as they go from city to city.  The idea of instantly built improvements I can take or leave- I suppose they address the problem of micro-management so you aren't constantly looking for something for workers to do.  Being unable to direct where roads go or how quickly they are constructed, though, can be frustrating.  If you want a  road over a particular tile, or DON'T want a road there, it's tough luck.  Why?  This makes no sense to me conceptually- while trade caravans or their modern equivalent used roads, they rarely, if ever constructed them.  According to one book I read (""World lit only by Fire""), the best roads of mideval Europe were still those built by the Romans 1000 years before, not by then-modern merchants.  Then Civ 6 simply writes railroads out of existence, except as a technological concept that allows you to discover coal.  Never mind this key time in the game of Civs 1-5 when you could begin to move units across a continent in a turn, or in history when railroads revolutionized trade and warfare.  Instead everything is just a ""modern road"", as if the game was underwritten by a trade group of long-haul truckers.  Similarly, there's no trade bonuses, now that I think about it, for being along waterways, never mind their historical significance as conduits of travel.  These changes make Civ 6 seem dumber than its predecessors, rather than smarter.Otherwise, it's Civ, and it still sucks me in if I get started with it.  The new graphics are beautiful, and the idea of districts that limit how a city can develop are appropriately innovative, even limiting how many wonders can be in a city which makes historical and game-play sense.  Maybe the AI problems can be patched up, but I'm afeared that the Civ 6 developers at some point decided they just needed to get the game out the door and modders would make the game more playable over time.  At this time, I can't recommend this game against its predecessors (Civ 4 remains my favorite) but hope it can improve over time.			"

												OK, waited until I had put at least 25 hours into this game before I reviewed it.if you liked any of the prior games you will like this.I was cautious about the art style from what I saw in trailers but once you get your hands on it, I found I wouldn’t have it any other way. The Game has more content then civ 5 with all its expansions (except different civs)so far its the best civ game i have played yet. so im giving it a solid 9/10 only becuase there are a few bugs they have to work out. ( i once had my own country declare war on me ) ( fixed itself in game but was pretty silly )			"

												Great and proud continuation of the Civilization series, and my new personal favourite. The new game introduces a variety of fun and indepth features and as a Civ fan all the more neat stuff to learn and explore. On my first playthrough, and while only barely into Modern era, I've already experienced the power of conquest, effects of intricate democracy and ideological warfare. Playing as Rome and being placed onto a continent between two city states, and alongside the Spanish empire, I knew things would get interesting real quick when barely into Ancient era the Spanish empire had put its conquest agenda to play after wiping out an unknown neighbor civ and then turning it's gaze to a city state right on my door step accross an entire continent. After seeing the Spanish horde surround my neighbor I had to step in and the battle for Jerusalem became the turning point in history. The victory was short lived however, and after but a short period of peace, the Spanish empire had become aggressively expansive again, settling a city outpost right next to Jerusalem, no doubt to launch a bigger invasion, and this time with a proper supply line. Constant influx of military equipment and soldiers, as well as constant provocations and tresspasses on the territory of my national interests, and all around my newly formed outpost, had pushed Rome to act and declare a war on Spain once again. This time however the Spanish horde was no match for the might of Roman legions. Not only I pushed Spain back, destroying and razing its forward outpost on my borders, I took the fight all the way to their capital. After Madrid seige and conquest the Spanish empire was no more but a broken people with loud barks of denounciations but no power to back them up. Rome had finally proved and established its place as a continental military power with no match, only for new civilzations to take up a different kind of warfare, war of the mind. Scythia and Brazil which surround Rome on continents on either side had turned Rome into an ideological battlefield sending hordes of missionaries and religious zealots. But as things looked bleak, and while almost being completely overwhelmed by foreign influence, a chance presented itself. Brazil thought its actions would be without consequence when they attacked my dear Toronto, a city state on their continent, however Rome officials were not swayed by Brazilian religious propaganda, and finally they had a reason for a defensive war against the aggressors as a suzerain and protector of Toronto. Rome, being a shining light of technological progress, was able to overwhelm Brazilian outdated military. With musketman and knights rampaging throughout their lands Brazil had no choice but to cede the capital and two additional cities after their conquest. Having Brazil's capital, and their only religious center, under Rome's control had eased and put a stop to Brazil's religious convesions under the banner of Islam, and their hopes at world domination through religion. This exersion of Rome's political and military might with Brazil had influenced Scythia to formally agree not to convert and spread their ideology within Roman borders. With this, Rome was able to free itself from the spread of foreign ideology and return to their own roots and traditions. What kind of adversities and challenges lay ahead and will Rome be able to persevere, it remains to be seen ...			"

												This game is a broken unfinished mess. AI civs can generate a dozen apostles every turn, this is fair and balanced - the devs playing this game I can consiantly bombarded with enemy missionaries and apostles, i have no way to keep up because the AI can produce them so cheeply, if you ask the AI not to do ANYTHING settle, spy, convert, they will either ignore you, or wait the minimum amount of time before resuming. Denouncing or declairing causus beli just makes other civs hate you. On teh bright side, it's an improvement from ""GO TO WAR WITH ME!"" ""k, give me 5 turnes""*goes to war*""YOU WARMONGER YOU ATTACKED OUR FRIEND!""from the last game, this was aso never fixed and I have no doubt that the broken mess that is the religious victory  will stay broken until an expansion, that we will have to pay for ""fixes"" it by completely redesigning the basic mechanics of it. This game is unplayable on prince or harder. The AI only understands war, do not but this if you were a fan of Civ 1 2 or 3 .			"

												From what I can tell, it's a decent game. The visuals look cartoony and in general come off as a low quality mobile game, but the mechanics are good all round with a variety of options and new mechanics that make it more than a rehash of previous games. The problem is, the game doesn't work, and all I have discovered about the game has been in twenty to thirty minute increments, as the game crashes to desktop without fail in less than an hour every time I try to play it.As it is, I will be demanding a refund as soon as soon as this review is posted, as after several weeks of their support staff sending me a list of pre-written sounding basic troubleshooting instructions, they have simply told me to screw off, it's not their problem.Maybe I'll get it after some DLC comes out and it drops in price and is on sale, just to see if the game actually works by then, but as it is now, it is entirely unplayable.

												Ill make this brief and helpful.  Compared to Civ 5, this is a mobile game.  It has smaller maps, less troops, less techs, less options.  The tech tree is linear and bound by what resources are near your starting point, but it always plays out the same way.  Splitting the tech tree into Purple and Blue paths does nothing but make each one more linear.  AI is just ridiculous.  They do not engage in anything after the Iron Age, and just stagnate.  Civs will STILL randomly declare war on you or hate you for no reason.  Diplomacy is completely monodimensional.  There is no negotiation or communication.  You can give them gold or not.Other Civs are monomaniacal and will base their entire interaction with you on whether or not you do one certain thing or not do that thing.  If you have a big army,  one Civ (the same one every time) will like you and another will not.  It's always the same, it's always one dimensional, and after putting over 500 hours into Civ 5, it's nothing new.The Fog of War and map are hard to discern.  The colors don't work.  The graphics are cartoony and silly, without adding anything to the game.  I can play it at 4k, which is nice, but still adds nothing.In fact, Civ 6 is nothing new.  Every system here is just a watered down version of a previous Civ title.  The beginning of the game is so similar that you could easily forget which game you were playing, 5 or 6.  I can't even bring myself to start another game given how many times I've played Civ 5, which I loved, and Civ 4, which I really liked.  This whole endeavour reeks of money grubbing salesmanship.  They take a venerated title like Civ, cut the budget as low as possible, make screenshots look cool and make a big deal out of simple features, and rely on the brand's past to sell the initial copies of a broken, incomplete game.  After the initial influx of cash, the developers patch things that should have been done before release, and start the arduous process of squeezing out DLCs to further weaken your wallet, preying on your hope that the DLC will fix the game and make it what you know it should be.In summation, all fluff no substance, yet.  DLCs seem to be pathetic.  Its not easy to make a game like this, I get it.  But with a name like Civilization and Sid Meyer, it has to be good.  This one is not.  Maybe subsequent DLCs and patches will liven it up a bit, but right now, stick with Civ 5.			"

Posted: December 11, 2016
												I have played Civ since I was in college and played way too many hours of the first version in my dorm room. I've played every mainline version of it since (but not the spinoffs) and It is probably my favorite game franchise of all time. I'm disappointed to report that Civ 6 has the seeds of some innovative ideas, but overall it is worst version of Civ I have yet played.  I don't have too much to add to some well-written reviews already posted, but I would add a few points of emphasis.1. The AI in Civ VI is by far the worst AI in the history of the game.  Computer players are absurdly, inexplicably incompetent when it comes to fighting wars, even at high levels of difficulty. An AI player may well show up at the doorstep of your city with a huge army, but upon attacking a majority of the units on any given turn won't do anything; by that I don't mean they don't do anything useful, I mean they literally sit there and skip their turn.  If you attack them, individual units will usually run away, showing no sense of overall strategy of risk or sacrifice.  Attacking an enemy city is the same: enemy units will act completely illogically.As other reviewers have noted, while the new system of diplomacy has interesting ideas, they are incompetently enacted by the AI.  You can do everything right with another civilization, but after a certain point they will turn and declare war on you.  At higher difficulties, the designers apparently made things tougher by making other civs less friendly, but it begins to make diplomacy seem superfluous- why bother with secret agendas and such if they are going to inexplicably change their mind and try to kill you at some point anyway?2.  Civ 6 takes a big step backwards in terms of providing you clear information about your civ. How many different luxury resources do you have?  In diplomacy, what trade routes do you already have, and for how much longer? What is the rate of population growth for your civ compared to the world? All these things, just for examples, are either difficult to ascertain or simply impossible without resorting to pen-and-paper notes. Older versions of Civ had many graphs and tables to figure such things out, but the new Civ 6 is simplified in a negative way.  Even the Civilopedia is worse with fewer internal hotlinks. The bugaboo of Civ games has always been avoiding micro-management, but the designers have gone way too far the other way so that now you can't even figure out what is going on.  They even took away one of my favorite moments of Civ: the post-game wrap-up. I loved reading my final stats compared to the world and watching the little timeline video of the history of the my game: all gone.  Now there's just a few hard-to-read graphs and a final score.3.  Count me amongst those who dislike Civ 6's use of roads.  It is wrong conceptually and for game play. Instead of ""workers"", straight-forward units who have been making roads and improvements since Civ 1, there are now ""builders"" who instantly make improvements by using up a certain number of charges they have when created. And these builders don't make roads at all: these are made exclusively by trade caravans, who build them as they go from city to city.  The idea of instantly built improvements I can take or leave- I suppose they address the problem of micro-management so you aren't constantly looking for something for workers to do.  Being unable to direct where roads go or how quickly they are constructed, though, can be frustrating.  If you want a  road over a particular tile, or DON'T want a road there, it's tough luck.  Why?  This makes no sense to me conceptually- while trade caravans or their modern equivalent used roads, they rarely, if ever constructed them.  According to one book I read (""World lit only by Fire""), the best roads of mideval Europe were still those built by the Romans 1000 years before, not by then-modern merchants.  Then Civ 6 simply writes railroads out of existence, except as a technological concept that allows you to discover coal.  Never mind this key time in the game of Civs 1-5 when you could begin to move units across a continent in a turn, or in history when railroads revolutionized trade and warfare.  Instead everything is just a ""modern road"", as if the game was underwritten by a trade group of long-haul truckers.  Similarly, there's no trade bonuses, now that I think about it, for being along waterways, never mind their historical significance as conduits of travel.  These changes make Civ 6 seem dumber than its predecessors, rather than smarter.Otherwise, it's Civ, and it still sucks me in if I get started with it.  The new graphics are beautiful, and the idea of districts that limit how a city can develop are appropriately innovative, even limiting how many wonders can be in a city which makes historical and game-play sense.  Maybe the AI problems can be patched up, but I'm afeared that the Civ 6 developers at some point decided they just needed to get the game out the door and modders would make the game more playable over time.  At this time, I can't recommend this game against its predecessors (Civ 4 remains my favorite) but hope it can improve over time.			"

												Best vanilla Civ I've played. Just one disclaimer, to those complaining about the diplomacy: If you play it like a typical 4x, chances are you'll make everyone hate you pretty quick. Think about how a real world kingdom would be viewed during the colonial era, if they were to build early, often and everywhere, right up to the borders of another empire. Do that, and other civilizations will see you as greedy expansionists who will surely come for their land in a matter of time, and of COURSE they'll hate you.Further, you have to take into account what each individual civilization's agendas are, as they go a long way towards dictating relations. I've been good friends with Greece for over 250 turns because I've stayed out of their back yard and haven't competed with them for city state attention. Meanwhile, Harald hates me because my navy is weak, and he respects a strong navy.I've had the AI actually come to ME with reasonable trade deals that are utterly reasonable, and accept reasonable offers from me... so long as they didn't hate or distrust me. So while I've seen some of the complaints on the diplomacy in Civ VI, I'm here to say that I personally haven't come across some issues, but it may be due to my unorthodox playstyle. (I play to enjoy the journey and ""roleplay"" more than I play to win.)I'll just address a couple points from a review that ALMOST made me avoid buying the game, as these are points where my actual experience showed something very different:CLAIM: AI CIVS WILL HATE YOU WHEN YOU'VE DONE NOTHING WRONGMY EXPERIENCE: This is generally due to the leader's Agendas, one of which is clearly visible on the diplomacy screen. Victoria is a colonizer and literally hates other civs just because she doesn't have a city on their contient. Essentially she distrusts (or is perhaps jealous...?) of nations who possess land she has no claim to.Likewise, Harald looks down on those with a weak navy, and Cleopatra those with a weak army. I've also heard complaints about being denounced simply because your government systems aren't the same, but look at how friendly nations in the real world will officially trash an element of the other's political process despite being on good terms. Denouncing another civ doesn't ALWAYS mean you loathe them, no matter how sour the expression of the leader.CLAIM: TRADE IS POINTLESS, THE AI EXTORTSMY EXPERIENCE: Recently, I was offered Open Borders for Open Borders by Cleopatra, and Victoria asked me for one of my two Mercury units in exchange for 5 gold per turn in the early game, 5 gold up front, and opening her borders to me. We weren't even on particularly friendly terms.CLAIM: YOU ARE DENOUNCED BY EVERY NATION FOR REFUSING TO ACCEPT PEACE WHEN ATTACKED. YOU CAN BE A WARMONGER WITHOUT EVER DECLARING WAR.MY EXPERIENCE: Tested it out and it does seem to be the case, but it's logical. I mean let's stop and think about it for a moment. You literally are.Think about how it would look in real life if one nation attacked another, got beaten up, then sued for peace, complete with offers to pay for damages incurred by the defender. Now imagine the defender said ""Nope, we're gonna use our defense as a casus belli to take everything from you."" It would be the definition of warmongering.No one in Civ VI holds being attacked against you. But once the attacker asks for peace, you're no longer under threat. There is no defense. Continuing to fight after that point means you become the aggressor, for no other reason than petty revenge. Throwing more lives - theirs as WELL as your own - into the line of fire because you were slighted by a rival would logically be seen as despicable by other world powers. Particularly if you use it for conquest.Hell, this is essentially Rome by definiton, and there's not a scholar in history who doesn't think Rome were warmongers.			"

												Beautiful game, great concepts...NOT CIV.  It departs from rational history (districts did not come before markets, banks, military camps, etc.). They are trying too hard with the whole civics thing, and R&D has become just plain silly.  I have been playing CIV since CIV was CIV and this latest CIV VI is trying too hard to be new, and innovative.  I would give them a 2.5 out of 5 and in most cases I would give CIV a 5+.  Nice try guys, but you fell short of the amazing CIV hertiage, that said please start to encourage the Modders to correct the situation.  Enough said keep the beauty of this game, but work on the concepts they are very poorly done.			"

												Main reasons why negative review:- AI is bad, realy stupid: In Civ5 when a unit was wounded AI tryed to switch him with a healthy one and then heal. Civ6 - sucide squads, AI just throws units at you without anny strategy.Dont kow if a bug or stupid AI, anyway its a problem: AI didnt repair pilaged tiles at all, even when builder was around.AI spams troops and does nothing with them - huge army of war elephands just chiling in the sea, moving few tiles forward and back. - some minor bugs (cant quit game properly)- annying unit control - slow auto selection of another unit (give order and at that moment unit switches and order is given to completely another unit)hope it will be fixed/improved, otherwise its just slighty better Civ5 - not worth 60 eu- AI city placemen, looks like AI has no strategy where to place a city, packing lots of citys just 3 tiles away from each other,what means that AI doesnt thinks about district placment at all.- no restar button to reseed map with yoor selected preset (its in the game code, just not added)- no ability to select the number of citystates when seting up the game- balance, starting city place is crucial, plains are useles, you grow fast but with small amount of production you cant manage the housing and amenity needs. Hills on the other hand are overpowered			"

												The game crashes with a notorious bug that was inadvertently inserted during the first patch. After investing hours of time into a game session, in midgame a crash will occur during the processing of the Civ AI's turns. The game crashes to the desktop. Any attempt to progress from a save game for that game session will crash in the same place, on the same turn. 2k/Firaxis are asking their customers to try various hardware techniques, some based on the operating system, some on graphics cards. It has been widely reported thru the 2k and Steam forums that this problem is widespread, and none of the techniques provided fixes the game stopping issue. This game is unplayable if you run into whatever AI routine is causing the game to crash. It might be several AI routines. 2k/Firaxis is not communicating any progress or when a patch can be expected.I consider the game currently unplayable beyond turn 150 to 250. The 'next turn' crash is very serious. Many who have responded to forum threads that 'it doesn't happen to them' are now having it happen as well.			"

												I like the new builder features, I think they're the most-improved-players in this version compared to CIV 1-5 (I didn't play 3 tbh).The graphics are pretty, but they always have been and after a while you don't notice too much anyway.Amenities and housing works well for population control and war weariness is an effective deterent against constant rampaging.I think Civ 5 works better and is more balanced but there are some good ideas here and some brave steps.I really hope the team continues to improve the AI, their personalities, and the logical progression of techs to avoid contnual anachronisms and a quick end game.   These are things that spoil it for me, the AI's as has been well documented are one dimensional, stupid and difficult to interact with or care about.The win/lose sequences are awful and come without warning or explanation unless you continually track the victory tab.To charge extra for more civs when the core game seems unfinished and beta is a little insulting; I would like to see more updates released over the next 2-4 months.All in all; keep the team that did the conceptual thinking and sack the team that managed the project resulting in an early release of a beta version a year earlier than it should have been made public; and stick to Civ5.

Steep negative penalties for things out of your control. (Such as not spreading religion to a civ on the other side of the map)Current game rewards going wide (6+ cities at the least) with no options for micromanagement3 districts are a tier above the rest which makes every game feel the same, unless you want to make it hard on yourselfSpies bug you every few turns3 months and no SDK or Workshop supportVery few techs/policiesZerg spam of religious units. Can't work a tile because of other civ's missionaries is a normal occurrenceReligion rewards are underpowered. I ignore religion most gamesLackluster end-game screenEnd tech needs to be clicked on every single time, every 2-3 turns. Auto-renew?$5 'DLC' for a single civOK game with a good foundation. Not up to Civ standards. Unless you can get it at a steep discount, stick to Civ 5.			"

												You waste whole day on 1 match that you forfeit in end anyway. Multiplayer desyncronize and reload every turn so people get mad and abandon. They make you pay 5 USD to play 1 more civilization. AI are just as bad as previous games. I hoped they would solve some of previous stuff but no. They barely do anything. Will never buy CIV again. Go download illegaly if you want to try. They don' t deserve to be paid.			"

												It's alright, better than V at release. But the sheer amount of shortcomings (UI, AI, missing features), combined with an amount of bugs that's not atrociously bad, but bad enough to really annoy you at least once a session. Though we should not have to do this - wait 1 or 2 years until more content exists, and check the game out again then. I've personally gone back to IV/V in the meantime.			"

												After putting some hours into the game i think i can now actually comment on it.And sadly this means that i cannot recommend this game in its current state (12-4-2016).This doesnt mean that the game has no good points to it, because there are quiet a few. The music is nice except for the menu music - that one is awesome. The graphics are a matter of taste obviously, but i found them to be nice to look at - which is important when a game takes such a long time. And of course its a civilisation game - so a lot of concepts are in the game just as expected. Oh yeah, and it is surprisingly enough fun to play in spite of its shortcomings.So why not recommend it ? Simply put - with a pricetag such as this product has its flaws are - in my eyes - unforgiveable.Exiting the game after playing for ""too long"" (time would have to be estimated) it will just not terminate and either force you to restart your computer or find a workaround to kill the game process. Bugs like that are major things that had to be known prior to release.And then we get to the ""design choices"" that are seriously impeding the fun for me.Like denouncing. You will get denounced by 70% of all civs for about 70% of the game (totally not made up numbers). For just about everything. You are a warmonger. Or have a different government. Or you have no spies in the ancient era. Or too little territory. Or to big of one. It actually doent matter - its the favourite past-time of the ai.Like the warmonger concept itself. Declare war on someone ? Warmonger. Get declared on ? Warmonger. Take a city ? Warmonger. Raze a city ? Guess for yourself. Do something like that (or have it done to you) and you are a warmonger. Forever. I think its like a certifikate of participation. Everyone gets one. No idea what it should accomplish, but as of now its just a reason for getting denounced. Not that the ai needs any reason for that.Like the religion thing. Doesnt work at all. The ai send myriads of religious units over the map in order to do some sightseeing i guess. Because theres not too much conversion happening while they stroll around your country happily blocking the way for anyone. There even was a war where one ai declared on me and then couldnt get any units through the clump of religios desaster that Pedro had seemingly exiled into my country. I think our armies fought each other via radio using harsh language until in the end Pericles payed for peace. Obviously it was the religious system at work here. Following the ai logik the best use for inquisitors is to round them up, herd them into enemy territory and then sacrifice them by attacking an obviously way superior unit - thereby eradicating any trace of the corresponding religion in the area. I can only guess the design process involved a lot of ""praying that it works"".Like the missing balance of science/culture points and corresponding techs. where you more or less have to spam future techs from 1950 onward. If you were lazy on techs, that is.Like diplomacy. Its basically not there. The ai cheats at every opportunity. They get bonuses like no tomorrow. Sadly they also get ""agendas"" to determine whether they like you or not. They might like cultured civs. That means not you because of their headstart you are pitiful to them. They might like civs with lots of territory. That means not you because of their headstart you have only a third of their land. If youre lucky. And due to this they basically hate you and it only gets worse from there. Did i mention they will denounce you ?I could go on and on, but that would not achieve anything here. It seems as if almost any concept in the game is only halfway there. And more or less untested. I guess the playtesters were actually playing another game and noone noticed. This game needs a lot of work to be good, because the framework is actually here. But it is really not ok to sell this mess at a pricetag that high. And that is why i advise to not get this game now - but maybe keep an eye on it.Hope this helps at least someone out there.			"

												Tried it several times and it looked promising at first. But then you find out that all the extra ""options"" are just a disguise for more linear gameplay. In order to get ahead in the game, you can boost research by doing or building certain things, or have other things researched. All this makes that there really is only 1 way to do it right, and that is to follow the set linear development outlined by the research boosts.Furthermore, halfway down the game you are going to completely freak out about all the religious crap they put into the game. It's unbelievably frustrating to time on time again see all your religious units bite the dust in ""religious combat"". thats another way of saying: Absolutely 0 tactics required, just need to have more units then the other guy. Does the other guy have more units? I guess you're gona have to start over, play another 2 days untill you get to the exact same point, and then start over again. At least your development curve is so ridiculously linear that you can practically play it with your eyes closed.Don't buy it. It's utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												TL;DR : Stick with Civilization 5.Lackluster is the best word to describe this game. It does not feel like an improvement over Civilization 5. The ablity to expand your cities beyond the usual hex is nice, but not a reason to buy the game for $60. Personally, I do not like how the new game displays undiscovered territory. It seems too bright and takes attention away from the focus of the game. I didn't get a chance to interact with the AI because I was bored within 40 minutes and realized I would be requesting a refund. I wish I would've had longer to play the game so that I could write a more detailed review, but my short experience can easily be summed up with ""meh"".			"

												This game is not a good game, after playing over a 1,000hr on Civ 5 which is one of the best games ever made, they come up with this. I have not even played 50 hours of this game and it has no indeering qualities at all. The AI is terrible, the gameplay is boring and sloppy, it just does not gel well at all. Bottom line it is NOT fun to play, its is overpriced the most expensive of all civ games and its the worst by far to boot!And i'm a massive Civilization fan and have been since Civ 2..... until now that is!Do yourelf a favour people Save yourself £60 Don't buy this gameIts not worth it........

												Cons1.) No easy way out of AI diplomacy screens single player2.) Districts are a great idea, but each district increases every other district's required production3.) Military units are easy to upgrade, but the production cost from say, spearmen to pikemen is too steep.4.) Ai's pretty dumb.  Spams diplomacy screens you don't want, too.5.) Primarily same old 'get all the production, get all the tech7.) Cannot customize civ, rename cities, etc.  8.) Same civ5 problem where you must micromanage every military unit9.) Many people find the fog of war muddly10.) Housing AND ammenities? I'd just go back to happiness. 11.) I've lost that wonderland feeling somehow.12.) Oh, the fracking thing still jumps from unit to unit when I want to take care of a battlefield situation before moving my explorer or whatever on the other side of the world.Pros1.) FINALLY, I can build a city one space off the coast and not be land locked.  That is awesome and should have always been.  Now, make canals a thing.2.) The way gov't and policies work is really, really good.3.) District and wonders placement is cool4.) The rest of the graphics are good, too.5.) Strategy view is awesome6.) Trade routes.  I like.

												Great contination of the series. Been playing Civilization since CIV IV and it's nice to see Fraxis get back on it's feet from the abomination that is called Beyond Earth. Pros:-Let me start off by noting that the A.I. in 6 is far more enjoyable than it was in CIV 5. Getting declared war on for no reason is more less frequent(it still exists, but not to the extent of Civ 5).-With the explanation of agendas/hidden agendas it's cool to gauge the opinion of the A.I.-The introduction of two types of tech trees is great and creates for a more fluid playthrough-City districts is a huge step forward for this game and it's implementation has made this installment stand on it's own two feet-Barbarian A.I. is pretty awesome. The new invader system does create for some exciting/tense momentsCons:-The A.I. is still kind of dumb in terms of the other civilizations. There will be moments where the A.I. doesn't take advantage of your weaknesses(i.e. having a small army, being invaded by barbarians, having no walls, etc.) which does create some bland moments. On the other hand the Barbarian A.I. scares the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you when you first notice their scout and notice that your warriors are 20 tiles away and the impending attack by the barbians in 3 turns will wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Maybe 2k should code the more violent civilations with the Barbarian A.I. to fix this-Culture victory is way too easy. If you spend the time making theaters, some wonders, and producing a lot of artists or muscians youll have this victory covered in no time.-Religion didn't change much from Civ 5 so...it's still kind of just there. -Barbaians still are ""barbarians"" after you've reached the 20th to 21st century. Fraxis at the very least call the future barbarians rebels or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ -The spy system is also something youll forget you have.Overall, the game is good. It's far from being a masterpiece, but it's heading in the right direction. I am excited for the expansion packs that will be coming out and hopfully Fraxis will smooth out some systems and provide additional relevant content.			"

												Very Good basis for a game, but still feels empty overall. Needs more content. Getting Civ V Complete (for as low as 7 dollars) is a much more complete experience than paying full price for this. It's not even worth it at half price.Also, bring back war themes. War themes fill you with either determination to wipe another civilization off the face of the earth, or instill you with fear depending on what side of the battle you are on. War themes being gone saddened me more than I could imagine. Example of wartheme:

Multiplayer still seems to be bugged. Disconnects and desyncs happen seldomly, but not as much as Civ V which was very unstable. It's performance is improved from Civ V, however.In a nutshell, wait until this game gets more content.			"

												As a long time Civilization fan (almost 2000 hours on Civ V alone, I've won at Immortal difficulty level - all victory types many times) I have to say that this game completely does not meet my expectations. After spending a handful of hours playing, I decided that it is not a game that I will continue playing in its current form. Some of my issues with the game include:-ZERO single-player scenario content.-Recycled content (for example, the pantheon beliefs are almost all the same as civ 5, even under-powered choices that the player base complained about)-Stripped-down Advanced Start options.-Unimproved map generation - expecting improvements to this system was highly important to me. There were pretty much no changes.-No Earth map? That's a first.-Reduced features such as no ""restart game"" menu option on turn 1 that retains your settings.-Reduced map options. (I can't understate how important restart and map features are to me as a player - the majority of my time played revolved around seeking enjoyable map experiences.)-Confusing new interface that necessitates undesired re-learning (needing to press a button instead of double clicking on a city for city-view for example. So much is moved around seemingly for no reason).-Really poor UI - the grey boxes when mousing over in-game things such as resources seem to hail from the windows 98 era.-Can't rename units? Roleplaying during Civ 5 was one of my very favorite things. Now not even an option.-While I had an open mind about the graphical style, after playing I feel that the style is unappealing and I would prefer to play civ 5 instead for its style, particularly the clouds instead of the cartography appearance.-While I love Sean Bean, I dislike the in-game quotes as they feel mocking and immersion breaking, seemingly quoting Twitter, rather than profound thinkers of mankind's past.-When starting a new game, there are few references to the civ's history and the leader appearances are a step back.-It looks ""new"" but plays and feels exactly like Civ 5. Seemingly all of the non graphical content could have been an expansion pack.-It feels like there are no inspired changes to the base game, but just technical tweaks to civ 5. This has been an unfortunate trend in the franchise's way of improving on prior Civ titles. This game is basically a graphically overhauled, feature-poor reskin, just like Beyond Earth, which was also unacceptable as a stand-alone title. I am very disappointed that I supported them with my dollar on this one.			"

 UNACCEPTABLE FOR A GAME THIS EXPENSIVE TO ALLOW SUCH SERIOUS BUGS THAT MAKE IT NOT PLAYABLEFor all it's relevant, I am new to the series and it is with regret that I write this review.I will not comment on any technical shortfall as I am not an expert of 4X AI or else, here's what I will tell you.There are hundreds of angry buyers commenting on discussions' threads about the same crash to desktop bugs after specific turns, no matter their actions, in what seems to be an internal AI bug which renders the game literally not playable at the moment.If you buy the game now, you will most likely not be able to develop further after the Modern/Atomic Era because of this systemic crash to desktop bug. It generally seems to hit at around 100-300 turns, but several have reported it may hit anytime, sooner or later.There are also other minor bugs, like the UI freezing when exiting to desktop after a relatively long game time.Let me repeat what many, many others are rightly voicing: It is unacceptable for a game this expensive to be released with such serious bugs, which render it literally not playable as of now, furthermore, the future patch date potentially addressing said issues (one could hope) is unknown.

												This new relaxing commercial breakthrough game is now featuring also game crashing bugs that occur during turn generation. When you happen to be unfortunate enough, you can't bypass it and that prevents you from playing game forward. This new special feature is very useful in long matches where possibilities to experience this truly unique phenomenon gets higher.I like this game otherwise though.They updated game in March 2017. I managed to get 10 turns further in my game until crashing started to happen again.			"

												EDIT2: Yep, this game is confirmed a waste of money. AI declare war on you without provocation, I had 5 different civs attack me at once for simply being peaceful. Naval units are the most useless things I've ever used in a civ game (Within the first 5 turns of the game, mind you). AIs over-extend far too much, often having more than 10 cities in the first hundred or so turns. If you're looking for a good civ game, go play civ 5 or 4. They're MUCH better than this abomination.EDIT: Yes I realize i only have 20 hours in this game but my review will explain why.Having played 600+ hours on Civ V and hopping over to VI a few weeks after it came out, I am underwhelmed. The AI is poorly made, There is no build queue, You weren't even able to rename your cities when it first came out. They ALREADY HAVE DLC. What a horrible way to kick off a game.I can only honestly recommend this game if you play with friends and ONLY with friends. Unless of course you're sadistic and you play against the easy-as-pie Deity AI then go right ahead and do that.But in all seriousness I simply cannot recommend this game in its current state... at least not until it's fixed up and has an actual workshop. I know I have basically been repeating the same stuff as all the other reviews so let me add something of my own.A major problem (in my opinion) with this game is the fact that multiplayer is STILL broken. It was broken in Civ V and now it is broken again. Whenever there is a turn timer and someone disconnects, the game freezes up and does not let the turns progress. HUGE oversight with both games that I feel needs to be addressed.PROS:The district system is very well-done. It adds an extra depth to the game that the others didn't. Good job on that regard, Firaxis.The trade route system. The fact that roads are built as a result of having a trade caravan is a good addition in my opinion.Loading times. YES PLEASE. The loading times have been SIGNIFICANTLY reduced in this installment of the Civ franchise. Instead of waiting 20 minutes for the game to load and another 10 to load up a map like in Civ V, it now takes a minute or two to load the game AND the map combined. Well done.All in all, go buy Civ V with all the DLC if you want to have a good time. Don't play Civ VI unless you're a masochist or something. AI is garbage, multiplayer is broken, there is no build queue, there is already DLC. This is a sad excuse for a Civ game, to say the very least.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization VI yet again proves to be a highly enjoyable game with brand new features that enrich the experience. The game also has new civilizations for you to enjoy and every civ has a new leader, this provides a fresh approach to the game and this combined with the updated graphics makes it very fun. Despite this it appears the game has not been tested well - the espionage 'system' is... well... broken! Towards the mid to late game you are likely to have a spy come and steal some gold from your treasury (which is fine it seems like something they would do) but the problem lies in the fact that for some reason, a spy stealing from you will result in you unable to earn gold... ever. No really, even if you are running a + budget you will still continue to lose money and become bankrupt. As of today (12/02/17) there is no fix for this bug yet it remains a game-breaking issue which has sadly left me unable to finish a single game. I am deeply disappointed conisdering this games extraordinary cost. I will however change my review from not recommended to recommended if this bug is fixed.5/10 - A fantastic game, spoilt by a single game-breaking issue.			"

												It is a like all Civs at launch, a work in process.  It is some what fun but the AI is not good and the board game additions are not the best.  My biggest gripe is the  DLCs are not worth the cost imo.  I mean if they are worth the price they are asking then the game at launch was worth less the nothing.  I mean $60 got you like 15+ leaders and Civs and they want $5 apiece now so if they were worth it, then the game play aqnd engine is worth crap.  Seems like a gready money grab to me for something that is not to much to make.  If they charged $2 or $3 I would get them but $5 is just twice what the DLC are worth.  Wait for a sale and go from there.  Civ 5 complete is a great game you can get at a good price for the complete package.  They did not nickel and dime us loyal players that have been here from the start, well until now.			"

												Have in mind that this game released a few days ago,and considering that,the state of this game is unbelievably good.This game is absolutely the best in the entire Civilization franchise.The new engine is smooth,and the graphics are beautiful.Do not judge a game when you didn't even play it.I can assure you that this is the most smooth and the hardest experience in civilization.Even on the settler difficulty,you end up having wars which really surprise you;the new mechanic without happines is excellent,and your civ can be more wide than tall.The wonder movies are also nice,and the lightning and the music is incredible.This is the most satisfying experience that I didn't have for a very long time.I tried playing on Prince and got absolutely rekt.Guess that I need to adapt to it a little bit more,I played Civ 5 for a long time.Pros:+Nice engine+Incredible graphics+Wonder movies+Day/Night cycle+Interesting mid-game+A lot harder civ game than it's predecesors+No happyness+Predictable leaders+Magnificient leader animations+Beautiful music,of course+...Cons:-Sean Bean , I don't like him as a narrator-Sometimes weird camera-Sometimes I can't quit the gameVerdict:10/10 A masterpiece.I very strongly recommend it.

												The District Mechanic adds some strategic element when settling cities, although its impacts are a bit obscure and need people to read either in-game encyclopaedia (which does not contain all info at times and/or has faulty entries in some details) or read/watch tutorials on-line. This is important as your cities grow and you realize you waisted Builder action on a tile that now will be removed by the district. Also very important is that once you start a district you cant cancel it and worse you cant remove it, so make sure you hit the right tile. The planing ahead should also not be exclusive to existing bonuses, looking at tiles and plan what improvements go where and thus what districts go adjacent in future, to maximise city outputs.Combat is still pretty much the same as in Civ V, which is OK I guess, with the corps/armadas mechanic that I think is not really that great tbh. Coming from EU4, I feel combat could be improved quite a bit, for example allow the creation of armies, where you can add units of various types to it.The last bit I need to mention is this rather lengthy ramble, is diplomacy. Yes they added a few ticks that are nice, but diplomacy is just as moronic as ever. There is no sense to interaction for most part and it does not help that AI actions do not reflect diplomacy information AT ALL! For example, in a game with 6 other civs, the 2 civs that were FRIENDLY! Surprise DoWed me BOTH (in different times, maybe 20-30 turns apart). What gives?Great people system is pretty good, I like this approach, but the Writers, Musicians and Artists really need to be looked at, its silly that I cant keep up with building places to store stuff these people create and that they are otherwise just useless. There should be a way to activate the person and get a % boost to cultures or a one time boost to specific wonders, like with some engineers, or even just whatever amount of culture, like scientist. In one game I had to sell great works to make use of the writers, and even that capped as they only ever buy one and only if they dont have one yet (at least thats what I gathered).			"

												I've put 30 hours into this game since release, and I've had some good fun with it......HOWEVER: the AI is utter trash. I have yet to create any sort of alliance with the AI. 9 times out of 10 I'm denounced for incredibly stupid reasons like not having a big enough army, not expanding enough, or going to war with another civilization. My trade requests are hardly ever accepted unless I give way more than I get, and the AI often demands some sort of gift. The AI also tends to breed cities like rabbits, putting them in the least strategically-sound places imaginable, sometimes going ACROSS VAST EXPANSES OF EMPTY UNCLAIMED LAND to plant them right next to mine, and subsequently complain that I'm too close to them. Add to this that they're incredibly easy to beat in a war. After beating back what forces they have (offensively or defensively), demand peace and every resource they have and they will usually comply. Wash, rinse, repeat until that Civ is gone. No strategy whatsoever. Oh, and this is on the highest difficulties, too. There are some positive aspects, however. I've become a huge fan of the districts concept, the art style, Civil Policy cards, and the fact that wars aren't quite as easy to fight as in previous games, they require a bit more thought and effort. I do wish the AI issues are addressed in an upcoming patch, it's disappointing how poorly executed they are.  "

And then If I hosted, and invited him, he could join, we could play our first turn, and then there would ALWAYS be a disconnect between turn 1 and turn 2, in which it would always say ""You are the last remaining human in the game"" to both of us....

												A.I is still garbage. It cheats by getting unfair advantages early on and does not compte on skill, making the whole game suck when you try to advance difficulty, the lower levels are too easy, the harder ones are unfair.   All the gamplay is a bit faked as your often only just playing against a dumb A.I.  They added better graphis, annoying Civ leader animations and a whole lot of polish, but it's still a dumb unfair game.			"

												Great and proud continuation of the Civilization series, and my new personal favourite. The new game introduces a variety of fun and indepth features and as a Civ fan all the more neat stuff to learn and explore. On my first playthrough, and while only barely into Modern era, I've already experienced the power of conquest, effects of intricate democracy and ideological warfare. Playing as Rome and being placed onto a continent between two city states, and alongside the Spanish empire, I knew things would get interesting real quick when barely into Ancient era the Spanish empire had put its conquest agenda to play after wiping out an unknown neighbor civ and then turning it's gaze to a city state right on my door step accross an entire continent. After seeing the Spanish horde surround my neighbor I had to step in and the battle for Jerusalem became the turning point in history. The victory was short lived however, and after but a short period of peace, the Spanish empire had become aggressively expansive again, settling a city outpost right next to Jerusalem, no doubt to launch a bigger invasion, and this time with a proper supply line. Constant influx of military equipment and soldiers, as well as constant provocations and tresspasses on the territory of my national interests, and all around my newly formed outpost, had pushed Rome to act and declare a war on Spain once again. This time however the Spanish horde was no match for the might of Roman legions. Not only I pushed Spain back, destroying and razing its forward outpost on my borders, I took the fight all the way to their capital. After Madrid seige and conquest the Spanish empire was no more but a broken people with loud barks of denounciations but no power to back them up. Rome had finally proved and established its place as a continental military power with no match, only for new civilzations to take up a different kind of warfare, war of the mind. Scythia and Brazil which surround Rome on continents on either side had turned Rome into an ideological battlefield sending hordes of missionaries and religious zealots. But as things looked bleak, and while almost being completely overwhelmed by foreign influence, a chance presented itself. Brazil thought its actions would be without consequence when they attacked my dear Toronto, a city state on their continent, however Rome officials were not swayed by Brazilian religious propaganda, and finally they had a reason for a defensive war against the aggressors as a suzerain and protector of Toronto. Rome, being a shining light of technological progress, was able to overwhelm Brazilian outdated military. With musketman and knights rampaging throughout their lands Brazil had no choice but to cede the capital and two additional cities after their conquest. Having Brazil's capital, and their only religious center, under Rome's control had eased and put a stop to Brazil's religious convesions under the banner of Islam, and their hopes at world domination through religion. This exersion of Rome's political and military might with Brazil had influenced Scythia to formally agree not to convert and spread their ideology within Roman borders. With this, Rome was able to free itself from the spread of foreign ideology and return to their own roots and traditions. What kind of adversities and challenges lay ahead and will Rome be able to persevere, it remains to be seen ...			"

 Positives  The general aesthetics of the game is fantastic and looks great.The UI of the game is easy to understand and use.Game is smooth and clearly optimised well, especially during the “late game” which often hampered previous iterations.Some of the victory conditions have been better fleshed out and now with the inclusion of the religious victory.The introduction of districts as containers for buildings is excellent and makes you forward think with city planning. Negatives  The AI is completely and utterly atrocious to the point where it fundamentally ruins the game and is the reason why I simply cannot recommend it. The AI is irrational and nonsensical to the point where the game becomes an exercise in patience.The balance of most civilisations is poor and needs reworking. AI are completely incapable of any sort of strategic thinking during war and are often very easy to take out (especially naval warfare). Natural wonders in the game are almost entirely useless.In its current state, I would say that this game is simply not worth it unless you intend to play it online against friends or other real players. To summarise; The aethetics of the game are highly polished and is immediately brought down by the terrible and deeply flawed AI, for now, best avoid this game and look at other titles.			"

												I have to say this is probably going to replace civ 5 as my favorite civ title...once a few expansion come out of course. This release was so smooth, especially when comparing to civ 5s buggy, crashy launch (i was there).  I love the new cartoony but detailed graphics and i think my favorite aspect visually is the new fog of war being an unexplored map, and once explored i love how everything looks hand drawn on the map.Yes the game lacks content, every civ is kinda barebones at launch, but you can tell the work done in the game was done well. The new tech and policy trees are reworked very well and i prefer these to civ 5s. Also the theming is amazing, having music from your particular civ and hearing it progress through the ages was awesome for me (played as greece).Ok going to end this review before i rant too long. overall i would say 9/10 and a must buy.

This is a diamond in the rough, at this point AI from CIV 5 is more advanced and better, fix it and a few bugs(doesnt seem to shut down properly after extensive sessions) and you have a winner.

												I have played tens of thousand hours on civilizations series and this new one is the most promising. However I don't recommend buying it for advanced strategy players because the game is EXTREMELY POORLY BALANCED. Victory against AI is a given even in max difficulty and playing against (good playing) friends is pure RNG due to poor balancing of city states, barabarian and great persons.I am available to the development team to extend on this feedback, I won't be playing it before I (or my mates) don't end up rage quiting every single game.

												People have some legitimate complaints about the AI but I don't think it's as bad as some people say it is.   Truthfully, they improved way too much on Civ5 for me to even think about giving this game a poor review.Districts are an excellent addition to the Civ franchise.  It forces you to think strategically about how to layout your city instead of cramming farms everywhere.  Having Wonders constructed on separate tiles and given their own cutscene makes them feel, I dunno, wonderful.   I guess that's the point, isn't it?  They sure didn't feel that way in Civ5.  Having different forms of government and the ability to change policies is definitely a welcome change.  I would always hate building tradition in Civ6 first thing knowing full well that I would want to go the Liberty route later down the road.  The flexibility of the new system allows for the player to control their civ's development much more intimately compared to Civ 5.I hate building roads.  The amount of upkeep and time it takes to make them was ridiculous in Civ5.  Traders make the roads in Civ6, which is from my viewpoint not only more convinent, but much more realistic.  It does force you to make some unadvantageous trade routes though if you want to form city connections between your own cities.  Here's one negative apart from the AI being easy:  you can't really win a diplomatic victory anymore.  Instead, religious victories are possible.  I would have preferred if they kept both in, but it's a minor change.People complain about graphics.  I disagree.  The slightly more cartoonish graphics don't bother me in the slightest.  My recommendation is buy the game.  It's not a waste of your money, and they've improved on so many annoying aspects of Civ5.  This is a much more enjoyable Civilization game that does, to be fair, require some AI rework.  If you, like me, are a casual player of Civilization, then you will enjoy this game.			"

												Its like they let the Artists design the entire game. Its very very very pretty, and a true joy to play....But the design choices are just so insane.....I cant even comprehend why they would make them. The art style by itself is a turn off for me, but I can excuse it on the grounds of being unique, but The government system works using playing cards now... it feels like im playing Yuh-Ghi-Oh not Civililization ""OH you attacked me, Now I activate my Fascism third alternative card that gives me a + 1 production to all my Militiary units""  They have completely removed happiness as a mechanic, which makes it realllly easy to just absolutely steamroll the A.I. YOu declare war on the guy next to you , you conquer him use his cities to pump out more units and repeat, boom you have your entire continent before the mideval era, which means all you have to do is refocus science in all your cities, and you have nuclear submarines by the 1300s, Even on the hardest difficulty you can do this. The difficulty levels just make the AI troops stronger not smarter. The The art style makes it very difficult to distingush ceratin terrain features. The Female advisor voice actor sounds like she swallowed a razor blade. The british male voice actor is nice but he sounds Waaaaaaay too enthusiastic, They obviously can't top having lenard Nimoy in CIv IV but they could deffinitly have someone better. The Quotes they Choose are just simply, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. theres no nicer way to put it, I constently find my self asking ""who the hell is that?"" everytime I unlock a tech level, or a civic level. Something I am personally offended by is the fact that the  developers said that the world congress wouldnt ship with the base game , becuase they wanted to see how the meta game played out. Well as fans of the game know, no world congress means no reason to explore the world, not to metion this means that they where already developing (what I can only assume to be a paid DLC) before the game even released. Also Why is Gilgamesh a Civ Leader? HE is a fictional charachter, you might as well have King Arthur as a Civ Leader. When you discover satilites and reveal the entire map, it still does that annoying parchment art style map that acts as kind of a fog of war....thats like...just no....why would you do that? I have a satilite in geosynchronus orbit over an enemy nation so My top scientists draw the map on a peice of parchment.

												I'm not liking Civ VI at this moment. I feel that every civ in this game has kind of a Psycho personality,  at Civ V if you do a good job taking decisions, you can avoid some wars, you can have actually friendly nations. In Civ VI is common to me to be hated by the whole world, by just being friendly. I trade with a nation, 3 turns later BOOM, surprise war. Even is that are many kind of war options in the game, I feel them kind of pointless, there is not diplomatic victory. At Civ V even if I like to bully some civs, I have to be careful for not te be seen as a freakin psycho and then if I'm trying to have the Cultural or the Scientific Victory, I have to be careful, in Civ VI I can simply don't care what other civs think about me, I'm hated if I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing warmonger, or if I'm a friendly guy who only trades. I feel the game kind of shallow in some things, and there are too many features that are pointless because this agressive and over envious AI. I hate every time I have to build a District, every time I have to build a Wonder, or even a Building. I love the barbarians, I don't have complaints about that, but I would like to have some alliances for only once. Stickin' to Civ V.			"

												The District Mechanic adds some strategic element when settling cities, although its impacts are a bit obscure and need people to read either in-game encyclopaedia (which does not contain all info at times and/or has faulty entries in some details) or read/watch tutorials on-line. This is important as your cities grow and you realize you waisted Builder action on a tile that now will be removed by the district. Also very important is that once you start a district you cant cancel it and worse you cant remove it, so make sure you hit the right tile. The planing ahead should also not be exclusive to existing bonuses, looking at tiles and plan what improvements go where and thus what districts go adjacent in future, to maximise city outputs.Combat is still pretty much the same as in Civ V, which is OK I guess, with the corps/armadas mechanic that I think is not really that great tbh. Coming from EU4, I feel combat could be improved quite a bit, for example allow the creation of armies, where you can add units of various types to it.The last bit I need to mention is this rather lengthy ramble, is diplomacy. Yes they added a few ticks that are nice, but diplomacy is just as moronic as ever. There is no sense to interaction for most part and it does not help that AI actions do not reflect diplomacy information AT ALL! For example, in a game with 6 other civs, the 2 civs that were FRIENDLY! Surprise DoWed me BOTH (in different times, maybe 20-30 turns apart). What gives?Great people system is pretty good, I like this approach, but the Writers, Musicians and Artists really need to be looked at, its silly that I cant keep up with building places to store stuff these people create and that they are otherwise just useless. There should be a way to activate the person and get a % boost to cultures or a one time boost to specific wonders, like with some engineers, or even just whatever amount of culture, like scientist. In one game I had to sell great works to make use of the writers, and even that capped as they only ever buy one and only if they dont have one yet (at least thats what I gathered).			"

												At the moment I wouldn't recommend the game. It is enjoyable until the fundamentaly bad AI becomes all to pervasive.Its great the way the have included parts of different DLCs into the main game, but then have written such appalling AI that they don't work properly. Main parts of the game that really don't work properly are :Religion - The AI gets so much piety that it can spawn continual religeous units when even if you build wonders and holy districts, you are struggling to recruit enough to keep your lands safe. Warmongering - Only way to not get everyone to dislike and denounce you is never go to war, or be attacked yourself. AI can declare wars against you constantly and suffer very few penalties. Even if you are in a denfensive war and take no cities you are labled a warmonger (though this decreases quickly if you take no cities) but if you take one city then dimplomacy is basically broken for the rest of the game. Even if they hate the person you took the city from, you will be denounced as a warmonger.Nation Diplomacy Interactions - Asking nations to stop spying, converting your cities, or settling near you is pointless. They might say they are stopping, but in reality they will break them all the time, constantly and without any recourse. You don't gain a casus belli, they don't take any diplomacy hit with other nations, nothing. Might as well not be in the game.War : Other nations AI is just plain stupid. You can pretty much take eveything with 5 or 6 troops as long as you balance them right. Once you have tanks and artillery, and corps and armies, you only need three, 2 artillery and an army of tanks (3 units stacked) and you can just go from city to city and take them all on anything but the last few difficulty levels. The AI hardly upgrades it units, runs away all the time. When they do actually attack they mill about round the outer edges of you city and are easily picked off by city defenses and ranged units.Units and Research - They have streamlined the units tree and not for the better. Its so short now you can get late game units to soon in the game. Research can be completed way to early. I am not a great player and have completely finished research in 1820s. I don't like the unit progression tress much either. They have only made small changes but those missing units have made a world of difference in how your units upgrade and the feel of travelling through the millennia.UI - Not great to be honest. Looks ok, functions less than well. Compared to the last versions of Civ 5 its a big step backwards. As an edge screen scroller its even worse. Mouse clicks unresponsive, hidden away functions and general poor layout. You get used to it, but doesn't make it good.Map generation : This is probably the biggest bugbear of mine. There is very little diveristy in maps through the options and when they are generated they look bland. Dont get me wrong, when a big city is built it looks great. I am talking about the landscape itself. there are far to few tile paints. You just get huge swathes of exactly the same tiles with no diversity at all. You now can't build wonders on mountain tiles either which is very disappointing and aesthetically displeasing. Mountains look good, but hills and especially rivers dont look great. Resources paints on maps also leave a lot to be desired. Some look good, some look awful, a right mixed bag.Resources - Unit upgrade/build (strategic) resources have been fundamentally changed. When they spawn, good luck finding them and anywhere close to your civ. I have seen 3 continents without coal at all. Really? Thats like Europe and Russia having no coal at all in the real world?? Good news is they will fix the majority of these ""features"" if passed games are anything to go by. Its an average release which will become more annoying the more you play. I have over 1000 hours played on Civ 5, it will take a fair bit of patching until I will get that many hours with this game.			"

The problem is, the game doesn't work, and all I have discovered about the game has been in twenty to thirty minute increments, as the game crashes to desktop without fail in less than an hour every time I try to play it.As it is, I will be demanding a refund as soon as soon as this review is posted, as after several weeks of their support staff sending me a list of pre-written sounding basic troubleshooting instructions, they have simply told me to screw off, it's not their problem.Maybe I'll get it after some DLC comes out and it drops in price and is on sale, just to see if the game actually works by then, but as it is now, it is entirely unplayable.

												Ill make this brief and helpful.  Compared to Civ 5, this is a mobile game.  It has smaller maps, less troops, less techs, less options.  The tech tree is linear and bound by what resources are near your starting point, but it always plays out the same way.  Splitting the tech tree into Purple and Blue paths does nothing but make each one more linear.  AI is just ridiculous.  They do not engage in anything after the Iron Age, and just stagnate.  Civs will STILL randomly declare war on you or hate you for no reason.  Diplomacy is completely monodimensional.  There is no negotiation or communication.  You can give them gold or not.Other Civs are monomaniacal and will base their entire interaction with you on whether or not you do one certain thing or not do that thing.  If you have a big army,  one Civ (the same one every time) will like you and another will not.  It's always the same, it's always one dimensional, and after putting over 500 hours into Civ 5, it's nothing new.The Fog of War and map are hard to discern.  The colors don't work.  The graphics are cartoony and silly, without adding anything to the game.  I can play it at 4k, which is nice, but still adds nothing.In fact, Civ 6 is nothing new.  Every system here is just a watered down version of a previous Civ title.  The beginning of the game is so similar that you could easily forget which game you were playing, 5 or 6.  I can't even bring myself to start another game given how many times I've played Civ 5, which I loved, and Civ 4, which I really liked.  This whole endeavour reeks of money grubbing salesmanship.  They take a venerated title like Civ, cut the budget as low as possible, make screenshots look cool and make a big deal out of simple features, and rely on the brand's past to sell the initial copies of a broken, incomplete game.  After the initial influx of cash, the developers patch things that should have been done before release, and start the arduous process of squeezing out DLCs to further weaken your wallet, preying on your hope that the DLC will fix the game and make it what you know it should be.In summation, all fluff no substance, yet.  DLCs seem to be pathetic.  Its not easy to make a game like this, I get it.  But with a name like Civilization and Sid Meyer, it has to be good.  This one is not.  Maybe subsequent DLCs and patches will liven it up a bit, but right now, stick with Civ 5.			"

												So far the most underwhemling CIV yet...First I thought it was the overall graphics that were disappointing me, but then I reinstalled Civ 4 and played for a few hours and was sure it wasn't the Comic style that was the issue. Its quite the opposite the game looks pretty good and uses a lot of colurful contrasts. It is more alack of overall design quality and bad gameplay that is ruining the game for me . I would've never imagined that a Civilization title would start gathering dust in my Steam library with ""only"" 114 hours played. 114 h isn't really that much for a strategy game but its especially bad for Civ. But really there isn't anything making it worth to revisit it.+wonder videos made a comeback+colourful world map+many features for only being the ""main game""+evolution of faction theme songs-no war music, just faction themes that get repeated over and over again (totally breaks immersion)-the faction leaders look too cartoony, I mean really, really riddiculous...-focus on warfare-overall AI weaknesses-in actual gameplay civilizations don't differ that much...-once again absurd AI buffs instead of real difficulty-redundant late game-postive diplomatic relationships with most factions only  if I play unsuccesfully (don't explore, build wonders, found cities etc.)? Give me a break...			"

												Civ V is strictly better.  Now that I got that out of my system let me explain.  Civ VI currently has many balance issues, but that may be fixed in the future (in the form of DLC).  There are many smaller issues that nearly ruin the game for me personally.  For example, builders should be automatable (and yes I realize they are not the same as Civ V workers, but I just want to be able to click 1 button and get the first suggestions given).  I don't mind the graphical design, except that armies seem rather small.  I miss my giant hordes of units offered in Civ V rather than the couple of visual troops per unit offered in Civ VI.  I'm the only person who you'll hear say this, but I wish the policy and espionage systems were more like that of Civ Beyond Earth.  Barbarians can completely ruin your early game with little opportunity for recovery (and people complained about BE aliens)  City State relations can be destroyed by receiving a difficult quest.  Districts and Wonders requiring tiles in an attempt to copy Endless Legend does not function well in the Civ formula as now there is no ""tradition"" strategy that is viable.  Amenities/local happiness makes penalties for genocide irrelevant.  Religious victory is too easy.  Overall, a lot of things need to be fixed, but those fixes will end up being DLC.  In other words, RIP steam wallet, terrible decisions have been made and in order to justify them I must make more terrible decisions (which I will).  Wonderful (which is not what your Civ will be if you attempt a tradition strategy Oooooohhhhhhhhhhh).			"

												Back to Civ V.If you've never played Civ before - sure Civ VI is worth a go.As the game matures it will be tweaked.I'm shelving it for a couple of years until it's 'fixed' to a level of playability comparable to Civ V.			"

												So far the most underwhemling CIV yet...First I thought it was the overall graphics that were disappointing me, but then I reinstalled Civ 4 and played for a few hours and was sure it wasn't the Comic style that was the issue. Its quite the opposite the game looks pretty good and uses a lot of colurful contrasts. It is more alack of overall design quality and bad gameplay that is ruining the game for me . I would've never imagined that a Civilization title would start gathering dust in my Steam library with ""only"" 114 hours played. 114 h isn't really that much for a strategy game but its especially bad for Civ. But really there isn't anything making it worth to revisit it.+wonder videos made a comeback+colourful world map+many features for only being the ""main game""+evolution of faction theme songs-no war music, just faction themes that get repeated over and over again (totally breaks immersion)-the faction leaders look too cartoony, I mean really, really riddiculous...-focus on warfare-overall AI weaknesses-in actual gameplay civilizations don't differ that much...-once again absurd AI buffs instead of real difficulty-redundant late game-postive diplomatic relationships with most factions only  if I play unsuccesfully (don't explore, build wonders, found cities etc.)?

												I don't like the idea that the builders die after 3 improvments, do you die after doing 3 things?  The graphics in Civ III area lot better than the graphics in Civ VI.  What are you guy's take lessons from microsoft the more you do the worse it gets, Wake up people Civ III was better than this garbage your putting out now!!!  This game was a waste of  $ 104.00.			"

Product received for free
												Rubbish game that doesn't meet expectations. It takes forever to get anything done and quickly becomes repetitive. AI factions behave like headless chickens and it is nearly impossible to please any of them, resulting in all your allies turning on you towards the midgame. To rub additional salt in the wounds, the game features some useless cinematic diplomacy screen, where these factions regularly interrupt your gameplay to yell some insults at you. You have to click this screen away not once, but twice, every time this happens. Usually within a few turns of proclaiming how much they hate you, they'll demand that you give them free goodies, again through this highly annoying diplomacy interface. No matter how much stuff you give them, they'll continue to hate you, make war with you and insult you.If this was the only bad thing it'd be somewhat acceptable, but the rest isn't much better. Buildings can take dozens of turns to construct, making it highly annoying to build up additional cities from scratch. Construction times are mainly determined by the production in the city, which is modified by the terrain of the tiles around the city. You'll need builders to transform this terrain into something more useful, but once again it takes forever to recruit a builder and to add insult to injury, the builders expire after several uses, so a lot of clunky micromangement is needed and the game pace slows to a crawl.In undiscovered tiles Barbarians may spawn, but these either do nothing useful or are a complete bane to your existence in the early game. As mentioned before, everything takes a zillion turns to do, so if you're in the middle of constructing a building and a Barbarian spawns, it can take a dozen turns before you finally get a military unit to deal with the threat, because military recruitment and building construction both use the same production points. Highly annoying and stupid.AI isn't just annoying in diplomacy, but also a complete pushover as they do not play the terrain modification game well, so they quickly fall behind in the technology race. It is also terrible managing its armies and having some long-ranged units typically defeats most AI armies without taking any losses as they're too stupid to close the gap or position their own long-ranged stuff in a place where it can actually hit anything.I almost forgot the graphics. They are atrocious and look like some mobile freemium garbage game. Ah, maybe that's there they got their ideas for their DLC policy from.3/10 for the half decent intro, musical score and the fact that it doesn't crash, no points earned for fun and good  gameplay.

												I really wanted to like this game, there are just too many things wrong with it. I'm not some jerk who just says the game is crap and moves on, I will try and make a decent review. Number one thing that needs to be fixed is the AI. Civ games have been plagued by the AI being terrible for awhile now, luckily, I think the AI here is slightly better than Beyond Earth. But still. AI in this game is crap, even though I am complete garbage at civ6, I couldn't lose because the enemy AI is just such absolute garbage. Moving on. When the first teaser images showed up, I really hated the graphics, thinking ""how can I be a communist dictator when everything looks so happy?"" I was consoled by the knowledge that there would be Steam Workshop support. While the workshop exists now, it took long enough for the devs to provide support for a feature that should have been available on release. Next issue. When I first got the game, I was so excited to start playing, and suddenly I realize that there isn't an Earth map. In fact, there are hardly any maps! Yeah, so, map choices are limited. They have added a few, including Earth, but there is nowhere near the amount the civ5 had. Also map customization is a bit lacking compared to the civ5 world customization choices. Speaking of lack of choices, picking your leader! Civ5 has a total of 43 civs to choose from. This is including the dlc. Currently, civ6 has 21 civs to choose from. 3 of them are from dlc, and there are supposed to be 4 different dlc's coming out, and I have no reason to believe that the fourth won't be another civ. So, you get half the amount of civ choices. And my final issue with the game. The dlc. There are two $5 dlc for a civ and a new scenario, and another $5 dlc that only unlocks a new scenario. Civ5 had it's share of map packs and new leaders to buy, but it also had G&K and BNW. These made the base game so much better, but civ6 won't get a better base game cause the devs don't give a crap about their fans. My general opinion on dlc is this. As long as the dlc provides something that adds on to the experience of the base game, and isn't basic enough that it should be offered free, it is perfectly fine. So, for a game like EU4 that has something like $250 worth of dlc, the major ones actually add new and interesting concepts, while alot of the others should just be offered for free. Civ6 could be such a great game if only the devs would do what their fans ask. After all, people are more willing to pay the salary of those who make good games.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game if you already have Civ 5 as it is basically the same, but worse. There are some slight differences - government slots, districts, etc - but all in all, they are lack luster and not worth the new investment. Districts are neat, until barbarians destroy your ability to produce anything quickly, the civilization upgrades are neat, but I don't think they are balanced well, and while the graphics are nice - that isn't the point. Even though I purchased the game at 20% off teh regular price, I don't think it is worth its value.			"

												This new relaxing commercial breakthrough game is now featuring also game crashing bugs that occur during turn generation. When you happen to be unfortunate enough, you can't bypass it and that prevents you from playing game forward. This new special feature is very useful in long matches where possibilities to experience this truly unique phenomenon gets higher.I like this game otherwise though.They updated game in March 2017. I managed to get 10 turns further in my game until crashing started to happen again.			"

												I have TONS of hours in Civ5, but I only played one game and just uninstalled it.I dont understand why they dont take all the things that worked from previous versions of a game and move them forward.  I really do love the art and visuals but really don't see myself playing more than one game.  They changed the wonders system so they can only be built in certain places on certain terrain and such.  I LOVE building wonders. But its not fun for me in Civ6.I really feel bad but I can't recommend this game. Maybe later if they add/change game concepts.  I wonder if people will spend the time to mod it.  Miss the mods from Civ5.Plus, if an enemy civ coverts your city to their religion, thats it. There is no hope of getting your original religion started again.  In civ5 your holy city would eventually turn back to your own religion. Pros: Good graphics, good sound and narration.  I love the animation when a wonder is built.Cons: see above and no mods yet. Take care,J.			"

												I am a complete novice when it comes to CIV.I own CIV5 but have never really got into it but I decided I would spend the money on the new one to give me a reason to really dive into it and push past the initial difficulty that put me off with the last one.First thing I have went and played is the tutorial which I have found really helpful, I will probably play it a couple of times until I know exactly what I am doing with all the systems and then I will dive into a proper game.All in all I love the graphical style (I actually prefer it to CIV5) and from what I have played has been really fun.My review is basically for people that want to try and play CIV but find it all a bit overwhelming, I can confirm that it has a steep learning curve but there is a pretty robust tutorial and if that doesnt give you enough information there are some great ones on youtube which I have been watching in spare time to learn even more.to early to score but Would recommend at this point :)			"

The 1st being the maps, there is no editor, and it loves making wonderful designs like tundra next to deserts (Tropical poles coming soon©).It plays ok, but is merely 5 with cartoon graphics.It also has one of the worst PC community and fanboys you'll ever meet, AVOID the Steam forums at all cost!3/10 - it's 5 in a new coat!

												As a long time Civilization fan (almost 2000 hours on Civ V alone, I've won at Immortal difficulty level - all victory types many times) I have to say that this game completely does not meet my expectations. After spending a handful of hours playing, I decided that it is not a game that I will continue playing in its current form. Some of my issues with the game include:-ZERO single-player scenario content.-Recycled content (for example, the pantheon beliefs are almost all the same as civ 5, even under-powered choices that the player base complained about)-Stripped-down Advanced Start options.-Unimproved map generation - expecting improvements to this system was highly important to me. There were pretty much no changes.-No Earth map? That's a first.-Reduced features such as no ""restart game"" menu option on turn 1 that retains your settings.-Reduced map options. (I can't understate how important restart and map features are to me as a player - the majority of my time played revolved around seeking enjoyable map experiences.)-Confusing new interface that necessitates undesired re-learning (needing to press a button instead of double clicking on a city for city-view for example. So much is moved around seemingly for no reason).-Really poor UI - the grey boxes when mousing over in-game things such as resources seem to hail from the windows 98 era.-Can't rename units? Roleplaying during Civ 5 was one of my very favorite things. Now not even an option.-While I had an open mind about the graphical style, after playing I feel that the style is unappealing and I would prefer to play civ 5 instead for its style, particularly the clouds instead of the cartography appearance.-While I love Sean Bean, I dislike the in-game quotes as they feel mocking and immersion breaking, seemingly quoting Twitter, rather than profound thinkers of mankind's past.-When starting a new game, there are few references to the civ's history and the leader appearances are a step back.-It looks ""new"" but plays and feels exactly like Civ 5. Seemingly all of the non graphical content could have been an expansion pack.-It feels like there are no inspired changes to the base game, but just technical tweaks to civ 5. This has been an unfortunate trend in the franchise's way of improving on prior Civ titles. This game is basically a graphically overhauled, feature-poor reskin, just like Beyond Earth, which was also unacceptable as a stand-alone title. I am very disappointed that I supported them with my dollar on this one.			"

 UNACCEPTABLE FOR A GAME THIS EXPENSIVE TO ALLOW SUCH SERIOUS BUGS THAT MAKE IT NOT PLAYABLEFor all it's relevant, I am new to the series and it is with regret that I write this review.I will not comment on any technical shortfall as I am not an expert of 4X AI or else, here's what I will tell you.There are hundreds of angry buyers commenting on discussions' threads about the same crash to desktop bugs after specific turns, no matter their actions, in what seems to be an internal AI bug which renders the game literally not playable at the moment.If you buy the game now, you will most likely not be able to develop further after the Modern/Atomic Era because of this systemic crash to desktop bug. It generally seems to hit at around 100-300 turns, but several have reported it may hit anytime, sooner or later.There are also other minor bugs, like the UI freezing when exiting to desktop after a relatively long game time.Let me repeat what many, many others are rightly voicing: It is unacceptable for a game this expensive to be released with such serious bugs, which render it literally not playable as of now, furthermore, the future patch date potentially addressing said issues (one could hope) is unknown.

												After playing Civ5 and enjoying, I find lots of good things about this game, its fun, and better looking. It seems to run better, but does have a few bugs still. The AI is busted though, you can trade with the AI and trick them into giving you all their gold with a few small steps, by turn 200 i was making 15k per turn and could buy anything even AI cities. This ruins the game and would only recommend for muiltiplayer at this point. This is a diamond in the rough, at this point AI from CIV 5 is more advanced and better, fix it and a few bugs(doesnt seem to shut down properly after extensive sessions) and you have a winner. Also multiplayer seems to desync often, not sure whats up or if its me.			"

												Tried it several times and it looked promising at first. But then you find out that all the extra ""options"" are just a disguise for more linear gameplay. In order to get ahead in the game, you can boost research by doing or building certain things, or have other things researched. All this makes that there really is only 1 way to do it right, and that is to follow the set linear development outlined by the research boosts.Furthermore, halfway down the game you are going to completely freak out about all the religious crap they put into the game. It's unbelievably frustrating to time on time again see all your religious units bite the dust in ""religious combat"". thats another way of saying: Absolutely 0 tactics required, just need to have more units then the other guy. Does the other guy have more units? I guess you're gona have to start over, play another 2 days untill you get to the exact same point, and then start over again. At least your development curve is so ridiculously linear that you can practically play it with your eyes closed.Don't buy it. It's utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												After putting some hours into the game i think i can now actually comment on it.And sadly this means that i cannot recommend this game in its current state (12-4-2016).This doesnt mean that the game has no good points to it, because there are quiet a few. The music is nice except for the menu music - that one is awesome. The graphics are a matter of taste obviously, but i found them to be nice to look at - which is important when a game takes such a long time. And of course its a civilisation game - so a lot of concepts are in the game just as expected. Oh yeah, and it is surprisingly enough fun to play in spite of its shortcomings.So why not recommend it ? Simply put - with a pricetag such as this product has its flaws are - in my eyes - unforgiveable.Exiting the game after playing for ""too long"" (time would have to be estimated) it will just not terminate and either force you to restart your computer or find a workaround to kill the game process. Bugs like that are major things that had to be known prior to release.And then we get to the ""design choices"" that are seriously impeding the fun for me.Like denouncing. You will get denounced by 70% of all civs for about 70% of the game (totally not made up numbers). For just about everything. You are a warmonger. Or have a different government. Or you have no spies in the ancient era. Or too little territory. Or to big of one. It actually doent matter - its the favourite past-time of the ai.Like the warmonger concept itself. Declare war on someone ? Warmonger. Get declared on ? Warmonger. Take a city ? Warmonger. Raze a city ? Guess for yourself. Do something like that (or have it done to you) and you are a warmonger. Forever. I think its like a certifikate of participation. Everyone gets one. No idea what it should accomplish, but as of now its just a reason for getting denounced. Not that the ai needs any reason for that.Like the religion thing. Doesnt work at all. The ai send myriads of religious units over the map in order to do some sightseeing i guess. Because theres not too much conversion happening while they stroll around your country happily blocking the way for anyone. There even was a war where one ai declared on me and then couldnt get any units through the clump of religios desaster that Pedro had seemingly exiled into my country. I think our armies fought each other via radio using harsh language until in the end Pericles payed for peace. Obviously it was the religious system at work here. Following the ai logik the best use for inquisitors is to round them up, herd them into enemy territory and then sacrifice them by attacking an obviously way superior unit - thereby eradicating any trace of the corresponding religion in the area. I can only guess the design process involved a lot of ""praying that it works"".Like the missing balance of science/culture points and corresponding techs. where you more or less have to spam future techs from 1950 onward. If you were lazy on techs, that is.Like diplomacy. Its basically not there. The ai cheats at every opportunity. They get bonuses like no tomorrow. Sadly they also get ""agendas"" to determine whether they like you or not. They might like cultured civs. That means not you because of their headstart you are pitiful to them. They might like civs with lots of territory. That means not you because of their headstart you have only a third of their land. If youre lucky. And due to this they basically hate you and it only gets worse from there. Did i mention they will denounce you ?I could go on and on, but that would not achieve anything here. It seems as if almost any concept in the game is only halfway there. And more or less untested. I guess the playtesters were actually playing another game and noone noticed. This game needs a lot of work to be good, because the framework is actually here. But it is really not ok to sell this mess at a pricetag that high. And that is why i advise to not get this game now - but maybe keep an eye on it.Hope this helps at least someone out there.			"

												After two playthroughs this game has anything but lived up to the series namesake. The AI is unforgiving and hard to negotiate with, the standard style playthrough takes an incredibly unneccesary amount of time, and the progression through social and science policies is convoluted and ultimately broken. As a huge fan of the series, as of right now, I am vastly dissapointed. Hopefully a Brave New World-esque expansion will improve the game if 4K wants to retain their fanbase.			"

												I am a Civ Fan.  I have played Civ2-6 now and each was an overall improvement, until now.  The AI is even worse than Civ 5. The way the whole warmonger thing is handled is so broken it ruins the game play. The AI is so stupid and repetitive in other areas I can't understand why it is even called an AI. It doesn't learn even the simplest of lessons. Many aspects of the game are very good.  I like the city district development, although it takes way to long to build anything, whether unit, building or district.  The builders being transient is good and the build speed is good but to little for how long it takes to build a builder. There are MANY MANY user enhancements out ther for CIV 5 and it seems that they did ZERO research on that when constructing Civ 6 to add some of those excellent feature MODS.   Game hangs every time I try to close or finish a game. Very dissappointing.  Way overpriced for what you get.  Sid,  I am unhappy.			"

												This game is a broken unfinished mess. AI civs can generate a dozen apostles every turn, this is fair and balanced - the devs playing this game I can consiantly bombarded with enemy missionaries and apostles, i have no way to keep up because the AI can produce them so cheeply, if you ask the AI not to do ANYTHING settle, spy, convert, they will either ignore you, or wait the minimum amount of time before resuming. Denouncing or declairing causus beli just makes other civs hate you. On teh bright side, it's an improvement from ""GO TO WAR WITH ME!"" ""k, give me 5 turnes""*goes to war*""YOU WARMONGER YOU ATTACKED OUR FRIEND!""from the last game, this was aso never fixed and I have no doubt that the broken mess that is the religious victory  will stay broken until an expansion, that we will have to pay for ""fixes"" it by completely redesigning the basic mechanics of it. This game is unplayable on prince or harder. The AI only understands war, do not but this if you were a fan of Civ 1 2 or 3 .			"

												At the moment I wouldn't recommend the game. It is enjoyable until the fundamentaly bad AI becomes all to pervasive.Its great the way the have included parts of different DLCs into the main game, but then have written such appalling AI that they don't work properly. Main parts of the game that really don't work properly are :Religion - The AI gets so much piety that it can spawn continual religeous units when even if you build wonders and holy districts, you are struggling to recruit enough to keep your lands safe. Warmongering - Only way to not get everyone to dislike and denounce you is never go to war, or be attacked yourself. AI can declare wars against you constantly and suffer very few penalties. Even if you are in a denfensive war and take no cities you are labled a warmonger (though this decreases quickly if you take no cities) but if you take one city then dimplomacy is basically broken for the rest of the game. Even if they hate the person you took the city from, you will be denounced as a warmonger.Nation Diplomacy Interactions - Asking nations to stop spying, converting your cities, or settling near you is pointless. They might say they are stopping, but in reality they will break them all the time, constantly and without any recourse. You don't gain a casus belli, they don't take any diplomacy hit with other nations, nothing. Might as well not be in the game.War : Other nations AI is just plain stupid. You can pretty much take eveything with 5 or 6 troops as long as you balance them right. Once you have tanks and artillery, and corps and armies, you only need three, 2 artillery and an army of tanks (3 units stacked) and you can just go from city to city and take them all on anything but the last few difficulty levels. The AI hardly upgrades it units, runs away all the time. When they do actually attack they mill about round the outer edges of you city and are easily picked off by city defenses and ranged units.Units and Research - They have streamlined the units tree and not for the better. Its so short now you can get late game units to soon in the game. Research can be completed way to early. I am not a great player and have completely finished research in 1820s. I don't like the unit progression tress much either. They have only made small changes but those missing units have made a world of difference in how your units upgrade and the feel of travelling through the millennia.UI - Not great to be honest. Looks ok, functions less than well. Compared to the last versions of Civ 5 its a big step backwards. As an edge screen scroller its even worse. Mouse clicks unresponsive, hidden away functions and general poor layout. You get used to it, but doesn't make it good.Map generation : This is probably the biggest bugbear of mine. There is very little diveristy in maps through the options and when they are generated they look bland. Dont get me wrong, when a big city is built it looks great. I am talking about the landscape itself. there are far to few tile paints. You just get huge swathes of exactly the same tiles with no diversity at all. You now can't build wonders on mountain tiles either which is very disappointing and aesthetically displeasing. Mountains look good, but hills and especially rivers dont look great. Resources paints on maps also leave a lot to be desired. Some look good, some look awful, a right mixed bag.Resources - Unit upgrade/build (strategic) resources have been fundamentally changed. When they spawn, good luck finding them and anywhere close to your civ. I have seen 3 continents without coal at all. Really? Thats like Europe and Russia having no coal at all in the real world?? Good news is they will fix the majority of these ""features"" if passed games are anything to go by. Its an average release which will become more annoying the more you play. I have over 1000 hours played on Civ 5, it will take a fair bit of patching until I will get that many hours with this game.			"

												TLDR: This is a very good continuation of the series.---I don't feel that the changes from Civilization V are too significant. IMO, Civ VI plays like a Civ V+. But there are a few annoying design decisions. The game was obviously designed without a keyboard in mind. There are hardly any keyboard shortcuts, and the few that are there in game have been changed from the traditional, useful, and obvious settings. There are also a couple of minor, but weird, graphic choices. The back of the Rocket Artillery unit looks like an USB key. Nuclear Submarines attack other submarines with missiles instead of torpedoes. And lastly, although this one may be a bug, sometimes I cannot give a luxury resource to an upset AI whereas I can trade it to them for a single gold coin.As for the rest of the game, I'm pleased with it. I do feel, however, that Civilization V was a *VAST* improvement over IV; while VI is much less of an improvement over V. "

												After playing Civ5 and enjoying, I find lots of good things about this game, its fun, and better looking. It seems to run better, but does have a few bugs still. The AI is busted though, you can trade with the AI and trick them into giving you all their gold with a few small steps, by turn 200 i was making 15k per turn and could buy anything even AI cities. This ruins the game and would only recommend for muiltiplayer at this point. This is a diamond in the rough, at this point AI from CIV 5 is more advanced and better, fix it and a few bugs(doesnt seem to shut down properly after extensive sessions) and you have a winner. Also multiplayer seems to desync often, not sure whats up or if its me.			"

Some of the concepts are interesting- split trees for tech/civics, districts, and governments but overall the game feels clunky and flat to me.The AI is horrible just spams units and attacks regardless of civ strength. Diplomacy is not well scripted- you release a conquered civ just to have them denounce you for warmongering. Many notification/options from Civ5 and not in game creating a huge quality of life issue. No sentry mode for units meaning you have to continually scan the board for incoming units/barbarians EACH turn. Not horrible when you have a small empire but the drudgery increases and your country increases. In addition- no city can attack alert. Again making you have to scan around for threats each turn.you currently cannot move or demolish districts. the UI is horrible with missing tooltips and the help screens are anything but helpful.Wait for a few patches maybe a DLC and the pick it up on sale.

												Still not as good as CivV after expansions, simple as that. Feels like a rushed product that has an unbalanced and unfun late game. Several mechanics also just real unfinished, like the inability to immediately calculate the best trade routes by sorting available route. You can't even see what routes are available to you starting from other cities, so its impossible to make good decisions. Not only that, but the quality of character models varies wildly. You've got amazing and energetic models like Victoria and Philip, but then you get Trajan and Harold who look like robots and give the impression that their animations were thrown together in 10 minutes.I'll update the review when the game is actually fun.

												Having played Civilization since CIV III, here is my opinion on the newest installment of the franchise:Disclaimer: As of now I've played 48 hours of the game, on several difficulties, maps and different civs. Only one game went on to the late game however.CIV VI is conceptually the best Civ game to date. However, it suffers from a few problems, which given time will hopefully be adressed as it was the case with CIV V. Overall I would totally recommend to get the game.Pros:- Tech: Breaking up of the old tech tree into a scientific and civic tech tree, with quests/missions, that give you a boost to the tech. This significantly improves the game by giving people an idea of what they should be doing and makes the middle game much more interesting. It can also deeply affect how you play, depending on the faction/leader bonuses you have (horseman rush with scythia for instance).- Great People: The great people system has been overhauled and is now much more enjoyable and adds more flavor to the game. Instead of giving you a simple boost of culture, science, production or gold, each great person has their very specific bonus. Once again affecting the way you play and what you're aiming for.- Religion: Religion has been changed aswell. CIV V did a good job introducing the concept, but only CIV VI achieves the depth needed. Adding Apostles with their unique abilities and relics, aswell as a religious victory - making the whole religion aspect of the game much more enjoyable than it was in it's predecessor.- City-States: The city state system has been overhauled aswell. Sending envoys will give you different bonuses. More envoys give you access to new tiers of the bonuses - which in some cases can be very substantial. With the final tier: becoming the suzerain of the city state giving you a copy of their luxury and strategic resources (aswelll as control of their army). Once again: expanding this system has added flavor to the game.- District system: This. This is the new concept, that really makes the game. Having this system in place makes colonization and city planning much more engaging. Previous installments of the franchise didn't require to put a lot of thought into where your were placing your cities. Pick a good spot on the map preferably near resources, a river or on a hill (gotta get the that defensive bonus) and build almost every building in every city. While the basis of that is still there. A further layer is added: the district system, where you have to plan your cities ahead of time. Knowing which districts profit from which terrain features and adjancency bonuses is vital to building a good city. It also gives you the option to specialize your cities early on.- Miscellaneous: Narrated by Sean Bean. Awesome soundtrack: Even evolves as you progress through the ages. Overall stable multiplayer.Cons:- AI difficulty: The AI cheats when it comes to difficulty. They're not smarter. Just generally more aggressive and get blatant production and science boosts over the player, which results in mindless unit (and city) spam. The AI is also very bad at upgrading their units/keeping them up-to-date once they unlock new tech.- AI wonkiness: Some programming still needs to be done on some of the AI behaviour. A few leaders mindlessly colonize pretty much every spot of the map resulting in their eventual downfall as their cities happiness (amenities) falls. They'll trade you a thousand gold for a luxury resource at some point just to alivieate the pressure. The Ai is also really bad at warfare and is easily beaten.- Bug: Your own leader will appear on the screen and declare war on you/himself, although a completely diferrent civ is actually declaring war on you.- Annoying: I select a unit to give it orders, the game automatically goes to the next unit and I give it the wrong orders not realizing what just happened. #NukeGhandiBeforeHeNukesYouNo Sean Beans were harmed in the making of this game.

												The latest version of Civilization is much like its predecessors - not perfect by any means, but still a great game, and a prime  example of the 4X strategy genre. And I fully expect that it will only get better as more content is released, just like the previous versions. I fully recommend it for anyone looking for a good grand strategy game.Like most sequels, this one is at once familiar and different, so I'll focus on the changes from previous versions. On the whole, I find the game more enjoyable and there are more options to pursue tha in Civ V. I like the added strategic and thematic options that have been introduced, and generally consider the new features to be improvements. The big problem right now is that the AI struggles to provide a significant challenge for experienced players, perhaps because it hasn't learned how best to navigate the variety of significant new strategic options.  Since Civ will always be primarily a single-player game, this is a significant issue, although the game remains entertaining nonetheless.  The district system is probably the biggest and most obvious change, shifting the vast majority of buildings into specialized tiles and forcing a number of new strategic decisions on the player. The choice of which districts a city builds influences how the city develops, determining which buildings it can build and what types of Great People it will contribute towards, making long term planning more important since the number of districts a city can build is limited by population. Now each city will have its own unique mix of builidngs, as opposed to mostly being a copy of all your other cities.  I've seen a number of opinions on the change, but personally, I like the added strategic layers the district system provides, from planning your own development in peace time to increasing the impact of raiding forces during war, since most buildings can be damaged and disabled by attacking or looting the district that houses them.Another major change is splitting the tech tree into two halves - a traditional tech tree with progress based on research and a separate civics tree where progress is instead based on culture. The tech tree unlocks buildings and units, while the civics tree unlocks diplomatic, trade, and governmental choices (mostly in the form of new policy options you can employ which let you boost specific abilities of your civ according to the needs of the moment), with Wonders split amongst the two. Additionally, both types of research can be sped significantly through achievements your civ reaches, such as building particular units or taking specific actions related to a tech or civic. Overall, I again feel the changes are positive, enabling an empire that struggles to keep up in one area to compensate by excelling in another. The boosts do tend to accelerate the speed of progress overall, since you can cut research time in half by meeting the boosting criteria, so usually the various eras are reached long before the time period they represented historically. But they do give the player another set of minigoals to focus their efforts on.The last major change is a dramatic increase in the importance of location to a wide variety of things. Districts gain boosts based on the terrain and development of tiles around them, making them more effective if properly placed. Each Wonder has a terrain-based unlock criteria in addition to the tech/civic based one, making it impossible to just build a single mega-city that racks up production and builds most of the world's Wonders based on its output alone. Again, this increases challenge and strategic options, since your plans are more closely tied to the details of the spaecific play-through. It also allows players to remain competitive for Wonders even if they aren't on the cutting edge of research, since opponents may not be able to start work on a project until long after they unlock the relevant tech.As in previous versions (and in most other 4X strategy games), the weak link is the AI. Harder difficulties are mostly just added starting resources and discounts on AI costs for all activities. The challenge of a new difficulty level is heavily front-loaded as a result - if you can survive an initial rush by AI civs fueled initial advantage in units, the game is only slightly harder at higher difficulties. The AI also seems less aggressive than in previous versions, and as long as you maintain a reasonable defensive force and aren't deliberately provocative, you can often go multiple eras without a war, much less a challenging one. The wars that do happen (whether or not they involve a human player) tend to be settled quickly and (in the case of AI vs. AI wars) indecisively. Once the balance tips towards one side, the other quickly offers peace on generous terms, knowing it probably can't rebuild it's army quickly enough to recover. If one side has managed to take an established city or two, this often means the AI will offer the majority of its available resources and an extra city or two, in addition to giving up its claims on the conquered territory.Improvements are needed in the AI's focus on achieving victory conditions, as well. It is often impossible to determine what type of victory an AI civ is pursuing, unless that strategy is being very successful. At higher difficulties, at least, each civ ought to be attempting at least one type of victory, ideally changing plans if another path seems easier while still remaining committed enough to not paralyze itself by constantly switching course. But in most games it does not appear that most of the civs are actually trying to win at all, instead sitting in a largely passive clump of medicority in all facets while one or two more successful civs push for the win. Often no AI is attempting one or more of the victory types (for instance, I've never seen an AI civ make an obvious attempt at a domination (military) victory). It would be much more challenging if these issues could be overcome and the AI would provide a more significant challenge in the late game.But despite these concerns, this is still an excellent game, and highly enjoyable for both new and experienced players.

												Have not eaten or slept yet. Send help.New review(7/11/2016):Been playing for a while now and I've got to say that this is a ♥♥♥♥ covered gem of a game. Some cool new concepts like district/wonders management and civic cards but it has some issues and flaws that needs fixing. You're expected to aim for domination victory 99% of the time cause everyone will see you as an enemy sooner or later so if you want to aim for the other victory conditions, you'll still need to build a big enough military to defend yourself from suprise attacks. Barbarians are more of a threat now and can escalated into a disaster if not dealt early. No more building tall, just wide cause there's no downside to setting up alot of cities like Civ V did. Movement tiles are more restrictive now and horses are a must if you plan to go offensive. Chopping down woods gives you tonnes of production which can help you rush things out and can be game breaking in multiplayer. Religion is more active now and has become a victory condition itself. Naval is useless unless you're playing some island based maps.Overall it's an okay game that needs some rebalancing and fixing. Good time sink even at the fastest speed.			"

												Runs very well even on my old and outdated computer. Lot's of new features are nice but there are a few gameplay mechanics that have been removed that will be missed. My biggest disappointment seems to be the decision to turn away from a realistic look to a more catoony one, but this isn't a huge deal when compared to the new gameplay mechanics added. It's very different to previous civ games, which is a good thing, but this means it'll take some adjusting even if you've played a lot of civ in your time.  Overall my first impression of the game is positive. Will update as I get to know the game better though.EDIT 1: After playing for a few hours I can say I'm hooked. Can't wait for mod support			"

												Civ V is one of my favorite games. After an 8 hour game I can say this game has many great new concepts that add a lot of things to the series. However, the game does have a lot of minor problems, some buttons being way too small, some bugs and some really obvious issues that shouldnt be there, I hope most of these get patched soon.The game so far is really fun and is better than civ V vanilla.

												The latest version of Civilization is much like its predecessors - not perfect by any means, but still a great game, and a prime  example of the 4X strategy genre. And I fully expect that it will only get better as more content is released, just like the previous versions. I fully recommend it for anyone looking for a good grand strategy game.Like most sequels, this one is at once familiar and different, so I'll focus on the changes from previous versions. On the whole, I find the game more enjoyable and there are more options to pursue tha in Civ V. I like the added strategic and thematic options that have been introduced, and generally consider the new features to be improvements. The big problem right now is that the AI struggles to provide a significant challenge for experienced players, perhaps because it hasn't learned how best to navigate the variety of significant new strategic options.  Since Civ will always be primarily a single-player game, this is a significant issue, although the game remains entertaining nonetheless.  The district system is probably the biggest and most obvious change, shifting the vast majority of buildings into specialized tiles and forcing a number of new strategic decisions on the player. The choice of which districts a city builds influences how the city develops, determining which buildings it can build and what types of Great People it will contribute towards, making long term planning more important since the number of districts a city can build is limited by population. Now each city will have its own unique mix of builidngs, as opposed to mostly being a copy of all your other cities.  I've seen a number of opinions on the change, but personally, I like the added strategic layers the district system provides, from planning your own development in peace time to increasing the impact of raiding forces during war, since most buildings can be damaged and disabled by attacking or looting the district that houses them.Another major change is splitting the tech tree into two halves - a traditional tech tree with progress based on research and a separate civics tree where progress is instead based on culture. The tech tree unlocks buildings and units, while the civics tree unlocks diplomatic, trade, and governmental choices (mostly in the form of new policy options you can employ which let you boost specific abilities of your civ according to the needs of the moment), with Wonders split amongst the two. Additionally, both types of research can be sped significantly through achievements your civ reaches, such as building particular units or taking specific actions related to a tech or civic. Overall, I again feel the changes are positive, enabling an empire that struggles to keep up in one area to compensate by excelling in another. The boosts do tend to accelerate the speed of progress overall, since you can cut research time in half by meeting the boosting criteria, so usually the various eras are reached long before the time period they represented historically. But they do give the player another set of minigoals to focus their efforts on.The last major change is a dramatic increase in the importance of location to a wide variety of things. Districts gain boosts based on the terrain and development of tiles around them, making them more effective if properly placed. Each Wonder has a terrain-based unlock criteria in addition to the tech/civic based one, making it impossible to just build a single mega-city that racks up production and builds most of the world's Wonders based on its output alone. Again, this increases challenge and strategic options, since your plans are more closely tied to the details of the spaecific play-through. It also allows players to remain competitive for Wonders even if they aren't on the cutting edge of research, since opponents may not be able to start work on a project until long after they unlock the relevant tech.As in previous versions (and in most other 4X strategy games), the weak link is the AI. Harder difficulties are mostly just added starting resources and discounts on AI costs for all activities. The challenge of a new difficulty level is heavily front-loaded as a result - if you can survive an initial rush by AI civs fueled initial advantage in units, the game is only slightly harder at higher difficulties. The AI also seems less aggressive than in previous versions, and as long as you maintain a reasonable defensive force and aren't deliberately provocative, you can often go multiple eras without a war, much less a challenging one. The wars that do happen (whether or not they involve a human player) tend to be settled quickly and (in the case of AI vs. AI wars) indecisively. Once the balance tips towards one side, the other quickly offers peace on generous terms, knowing it probably can't rebuild it's army quickly enough to recover. If one side has managed to take an established city or two, this often means the AI will offer the majority of its available resources and an extra city or two, in addition to giving up its claims on the conquered territory.Improvements are needed in the AI's focus on achieving victory conditions, as well. It is often impossible to determine what type of victory an AI civ is pursuing, unless that strategy is being very successful. At higher difficulties, at least, each civ ought to be attempting at least one type of victory, ideally changing plans if another path seems easier while still remaining committed enough to not paralyze itself by constantly switching course. But in most games it does not appear that most of the civs are actually trying to win at all, instead sitting in a largely passive clump of medicority in all facets while one or two more successful civs push for the win. Often no AI is attempting one or more of the victory types (for instance, I've never seen an AI civ make an obvious attempt at a domination (military) victory). It would be much more challenging if these issues could be overcome and the AI would provide a more significant challenge in the late game.But despite these concerns, this is still an excellent game, and highly enjoyable for both new and experienced players.

												Go back to Civ 5/literally any other RTS. There's nothing to see here.District system, I see where they were coming from but honestly it just gets in the way of trying to play the game imo. (Too much time and effort trying to get the city that's ""just right"" for industrial zones/commercial districts, when frankly you just want to secure your yields and try to play the game.) But that's not even half the problem, since districts could be looked at differently just based on your playstyle preferrences (like if you're a big science player, and want to max out your science yields).The combat, on the other hand? Bro - compared from civ5? Completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥; the balance is completely out of whack and makes it entirely too easy to attack. Case and point, Summeria. ""Adventures of Enkidu"" bonus: May declare war on anyone at war with their allies without warmonger penalties. When at war with a common foe, they and their allies share pillage rewards and share combat experience gains if within 5 tiles. Means that basically, the way you farm early XP is by sitting 3-5 tiles away from other civs fighting barbs, and you end up racking ~5-7xp per turn for doing nothing, and on top of that you're scott-free to stab them in the back one by one during ancient at any time, AND YOU'LL NEVER GET PENALIZED FOR IT, EVER. Epic Quests: When you capture a Barbarian Outpost, receive a Tribal Village reward in addition to the usual Gold. This is HUGE; it means you're getting tribal bonuses for farming barb camps, which you should be doing anyway, and this just carries over once you're dominant in your continent and just pushes you that much farther ahead than any other competition left.Unique unit: War-Cart. Not only the strongest ancient unit in the game, not only available to build IMMEDIATELY, but also has 4 movement on flat terrain, 3 on rough, but gets ZERO combat penalties against spears. Bro - holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is R E T A R D E DWho in the unholy hell though in the office that this unit would be remotely balanced?? It basically translates to this: you spam early War-carts, farm barbs by first sitting back and letting other civs hit a camp, then steal the camp kill for gold PLUS tribal bonuses, declare war, murder their wounded warriors, get ZERO warmonger penalties for it, and just level the whole map with early god-tier units that the other civs can't do a god-damn thing to stop. (Also for those unfamiliar with Civ6's combat mechanics vs. Civ5's mechanics - basically ancient cities without walls cannot defend themselves, cannot return fire on enemies...so, basically you only need two units at most, and that's their starting capital gone. It's like beating up a helpless baby!)So, tl;dr - Sumerians went from mediocre in 5, to now they're literally god-tier in ancient, districts are just annoying, and walls/defending cities in ancient is not actually a thing. So, spam early War-Carts, farm xp off other civs/steal barb camps because LOL Epic Quests, stab them in the back with no warmonger penalty, and flatten the whole map with War-Carts because B A L A N C E D. (Or, just go back to Civ5)""You're nothing but a glorified barbarian. Cruel and ruthless."" That may be true dear deceased AI, but it's one thing I've learned from casucally playing Civ5 on lvl7 for 2-3 years, it's that cruel and ruthless genocide of AI mans is ""exactly"" how you win at this game.xdddddddddddddddd			"

												I do not recommend the game because it's not ready yet. Even considering 2 patches, the game is really raw. AI is an idiot, no game mechanics for diplomacy, and even simple inconveniences like absence of building queue, diplomacy screen with other players do not reflect recourses status in a convenient way. It's some kind of open beta. Thou we have very interesting mechanics like amenities and war weariness, they are not transparent, unclear. More to mention – no diplomacy and politic. They do have them in Civ V and CivBE, but for some reason no diplomatic capital, no world congress in Civ VI (guess they will be introduced in the Add-on). So consider wafting for few more patches or even few Add-ons – Civ VI not ready and not worth buying yet.  Update after 3rd add-on: game still unready. Simplest things like building queue, other player resource navigation, indication of previous trade route… All that was in Civ V and for some reason missed here. And still idiotic IA do not know what to do with war units. A lot of simple inconveniences while issuing 3rd dlc?			"

												In the state that the game is now, I can't recommend it.It's really weird  - the game is so fresh and interesting at the beginning, but after couple of hours each game feels like its the same as the game before it. Also in my opinion going for a science or cultural victory isn't interesting at all, it's simply grinding your way till the win, and it's not as satisfying as ""unfriendly"" victories (religious and domination).I think that when the mods come, adding a lot more diversity, this will be a game that you can play for years. Now it's too dull and repetitive after the first great impression.Don't buy this game yet.			"

But the ganme moves slowly, and exploration, which many think is the fun and relaxing part of the game is no longer fun. The game feels cramped, unbalanced and slow, and over worked.

Yes, Civ 5 is a solid game, yes, I know Civ 6's AI needs some improvement but guess what. The original release of Civilization 5 was just aweful and look what a great game it has become with time. Civilization 6 is the most complete version of Civilization to be released and there are enough changes here to distinguish it from Civilization 5 to justify the purchase. It's not perfect right now but it'll only get better with time.			"

												A definite improvement over previous entries, Civilization VI is one of the better strategy games of its kind and is addicting on several levels. Right now there are a few weird bugs and the UI could be a little improved but overall I would recommend this to anyone who liked any of the previous titles in the series. All of the systems from previous games have been either revamped, rebalanced, or rethought completely and it shows. AI is better, explanations of what gets on the AI's good side are better, districts are a wonderful alternative to straight city upgrades so you can specialize different physical areas of your civilization, and government policies are a wonderful change from the previous systems where you now pick and choose various attributes as you see fit as part of a larger whole. I could go on for days, really; there's so much to love about this game. Buy it, try it, you won't regret it for sure.			"

												I wish I could give it a 1/2 a thumb. It is fun, and I've logged 36hrs (320 turns) as chinese. But it has quite a few flaws and missing elements that have always been part of the franchise. Such as lack of shortcut keys to toggle resource and yield displays, unable to rename cities, lack of detailed screens such as list of poosible trade routes like in V, lack of diplomacy options, leaders are kind of prosaic and lack personality/emotion (you can demand a city or gift them one and their facial expression never changes or do they say anything). I like the realistic art of V better but I dont hate the whimsical new art. With a FREE expansions/update or some expert modding this game could be worth $60. I have a friend who has never played a CIV game wanting to buy it. I told him to save his money and buy CIV V for a fraction of the price with all the expansions and dlc included. So yes, CIV 6 is a fun game and I'll probably keep playing it for a while but like a lot of other people have said it does not feel finished.			"

												Played it for 11 hours; wanted to be as objective as possible about whether or not the game was worth it.Overall, there are several design features which look like improvements over the base game, but which have flaws that become apparent about halfway through the game. The card-based government system is a novel concept, but doesn't allow for more freedom; the majority of the options presented are terrible, while the rest are so situationally effective (based on what victory type you're attempting to win with) that there really isn't any choice at all. Parallel research and culture tracks are interesting, but victory type largely tailors your research/culture research paths down a pretty straight line. Hidden civ AI agendas appear to make AIs appear unpredictable, but their behaviors are still pretty predictable, and grow entirely predictable after you discover what their hidden agenda is. Civilizations offer drastically different powers, but are wildly imbalanced, and many of them are close to useless. And so on, and so forth - the game's features offer the illusion of choice, but optimized play involves linear paths that grow tedious after approximately the medieval era.Furthermore, there are two other major drawbacks, which are:1. Some technical functions are still buggy. Path tracing will incorrectly register hovering over locations as movement to said locations, which can lead to disadvantageous positioning (or poor combat, which can be disasterous during war). Autoexplore defaults to redundant paths and is effectively unusable. Nothing game-breaking, but annyoing and warranting of the sort of micromanagement that isn't enjoyable.2. The game is enjoyable through roughly the first 100 turns, where decisions feel meaningful and victory could go any which way. After that point, a winner has largely been determined, and the rest of the game feels like ""going through the motions,"" and largely not worth playing. As a result, several features implemented with the game - from tourism to espionage and more - are almost vestigial because of how little they impact the parts of the game that matter.Overall, the game feels reasonably playable, and somewhat fun, but certainly not as breathtaking as one might expect from a virtually AAA title. The game might be worth purchasing at $20, but i certainly wouldn't pay $60 for it, much less $80. If you're a devoted fan of the franchise, wait until it goes on sale; if you aren't, this is a largely passable title  "

												Not recommending this game was a tough choice for me.  I've played and loved Civilization since the original back in my childhood, and I genrally feel each new iteration has brought new ideas to the table which improved the experience and typically resulted in stealing away hundreds of hours of my life.And then there was VI. I read all the negative reviews about poor AI - but let's be honest the Civ series has never displayed the most cunning AI opponents, not even close in fact. So I decided to get the game on a decent sale. I then played the game for a dozen hours or so, and now I've gone right back to playing Civ V, which I somehow just find a lot more fun and engrossing. Why you ask? Well it is really hard to put my finger on, but I think it is two reasons.First and foremost - the new worker system where workers ""die"" after 3 uses. At first I found it surprising that such a simple concept change can so dramatically alter the enjoyability of the game, but on deeper introspection it makes perfect sense. I now spend tons of turns and time building workers. Like the lion's share in the early game! Where in the prior games I would build a handful and then be done assuming I dont carelessly lose them, now Im literally spending about 50% of my production resources on workers. That is instead of military units, city advancements, settlers, or anything which actually feels like it helps to advance the game. It's like wanting to go sky diving but being told you need to sew your parachute together first. Its tedious, irrelevant to and subtracts from the intended experience, and most likely you are going to quit the whole endeavor before you can enjoy it.The second major flaw is the new sector based town growth mechanics. On the surface this sounds like a good idea - want a city focused on research? You need to first build a science sector which then unlocks all the research based buildings. Want a prduction powerhouse of a city? Build a manufacturing sector. Each sector requires one ""square"" of the city's territory to be solely dedicated to it, and it wipes any resource or terrain bonuses from that square and makes it unworkable. So this again makes sense at a high level - no longer can you build uber-cities that can be and do everything. Instead you need them to focus on certain things. But the rub is that I LIKE uber cities. Sorry but the idea of putting all my time and resources into a couple of cities that are able to dominate the map is my favoarite strategy. Plus building the sectors themselves also takes a long time, further adding to the ""opportunity cost"" imposed by the worker problem above.So I guess I can sum up the problem pretty well it seems:Civilization is all about the preparation for what is next - the next war, the next new city, the next Wonder - and that preparation is the strategic level which makes the game fun and engaging. Civ 6 had me spending way too much time preparing to prepare to do something, which it turns out simply is not fun or interesting. "

												Unlike the majority of all them plebs to ""reviewers"" giving out negative reviews, yes, they are plebs - they obviously have no track record with Civilization (at least their track records go no further back than to Beyond Earth or Civ V G&K).What you will get in Civ VI:The pros:Much better city handling. Districts are not only fun to play with it requires for a lot of strategy.Less Diplomatic hassles (no I'm serious none of the pointless informations you got in Civ V and Beyond Earth!).Much better Warmongering as well as Declaration of War system (like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥a lot improved!).Better Religions (even a victory conditions for such). Brings along with it new Religious Units.No overpowered units like Laser Tanks walking around(who ever thought that was a good idea in the Information Age anyway..?!)Technology providing you with new buildings, units and so forth.Civics providing you with new Government types and Cards for Goverments.Civic Cards is a mini game in it self \o/A game in which it is a lot harder to win with all conditions turned on that before.The In-between:The AI is slightly less aggressive on settings below Emperor and will ""feel"" worse than the Civ V G&K, but if you truly played Civ or previous Civs you'd know this is common for a new Civilization game if not you do now. The important thing is:Can the AI kill you? Yes, it sure as hell can.Even with Walled towns? Yuuup.The AI message spam.... Yeah, nothing new either. AI has at all times spammed you with pointless information and always made you hung up in a screen about their pointless information or trade. This is nothing new either - don't like it you can mod it.The Religious unit spam (shouldn't even be here because scrubs learn to ♥♥♥♥ing counter.)The Cons:Not properly scaled for screens using resolutions above 1200x900 (some UI notices will be overly huge)A few glitches (that is to be expected)A few Crashes (mostly if you have outside mods).Has a tendency to get hung up when you want to shut down the game.Diplomacy is lacking a bit concerning information displayed when utilizing certain actions.Trade Deals (especially Open Border and Research Agreement) do not display (except for gold trades)  "

												I've played all the Civ games, and either this one sucks, or it's been release incomplete. It feels like it's been dumbed down considerably, but seems like I'm clicking stuff even more that usual. The AI is not improved in my opinion, once you kill off a nations army, they never regroup, and you can't go to war without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the entire world, even so far as if you attack a nation that declared war on your ally, the next turn your ally will call you a warmonger. what it that? The UI still needs work, particulatly in focusing on units. If you hit next turn,  it will stop and tell you a unit needs orders, but wont jump to that unit; if you're clicking through units setting up some scenario, it will jump away to some other part of the world to tell you some other unit needs orders; if it is in the auto-jump around phase, you can't override and focus on the unit of your choice without going ahead and giving the unit you dont care about now's orders. There is no rhyme or reason to trying to build relationships with other civs. You can court them all you want but the civs you dont talk to be the more lucrative traders and less likely to go to war on you. You can't destory buildings if you dont need them, you can raze a city on demand, and once you learn a tech, you can't build any previous era units, so if you dont have aluminum you can't build jets, ok fine, not because you move passed the modern era, you can even build fighters, nice one.  I didn't really like the new UI compared to Civ5 at first, it feels 2000ish retro, but figured that was subjective, and I'd get used to it, and I did, but I still prefer the Civ 5 UI. I've spent probably 180 nours playing so far, trying to get it a worthwhile shot, but think it needs some polishing before I try to play any more.			"

												Okay people, new and old. I've played this game since day-one release clocking over 200 hours and it clearly has flaws, but what people seem to be complaining about clearly isn't anything that the devs will 'fix' because it honestly doesn't need fixing. Peoples Major Complaints (and why majority should not be taken into account);  The AI does not have a strategy towards combat.Yes, this is very true. They AI's strategic means of warfare is no improvement from previous titles. They practically suicide units onto your own. This can technically be seen as one of the 'actual' problems with AI. (Even though generals in history never suicided troops... *sarcasm*) The AI higher difficulties basically makes them cheat more.Again, this is true. They've done this in previous titles and never improved the AI to perform better and rather just supplement the higher difficulties. (Again, this is nothing new) The AI diplomacy doesn't work (in my favour).People complain about the AI not making deals that favour them or the AI favouring themselves in deals. My experience they do this based on your player score, if you're higher they kiss up to you, if you're lower they try to bully you. It makes sense since people in multiplayer will do the same. (Countries in real life never make fully one-sided trade deals unless they're pushed to extinction and even then they don't always.) AI plays hyper aggressive, especially in earlier stages.All I will say is servival of the fittest, root out the weak and dispose of them so they may thrive. This is no different in multiplayer, bigger players will always prey on the smaller players. That's life, get used to it. AI settle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly.They'll settle 3 tiles away from you because they can. Other people live in the worser of climates such as Mongolia, Saudi Arabia and other inhospitable and infertile lands, it's no different, ESPECIALLY for what is technically a colony supported by it's civilization. AI is hypocriticalSpain will often get pissy at you for having a religion but you can get equally pissy at him for having one too? Some Civ settles too close to you but previously denounced you for settling to close? Well people are hypocritical and people go back on their words and promises, this is done in history too. Ultimatley people that have an issue here often forget AI also plays to win, and they do this to deny player's land or resource in order to stagnate the player. AI Diplomacy is a Joke. Apparently different civilizations having actual agendas is a joke. It's totally not like countries today sanction other countries, they all have reasons. Many times if you get denounced it has in brackets the reason under the denouncement screen. e.g (Settled to closely, Ignored their request, etc...) UI is apparently bad...It is a significant improvement over it's predeccesor, this UI tries it's best to reveal everything it can in a neat yet workable fashion. My only request would be having a button for civilopedia in the main menu and in-game menu. War somehow accomplishes things...Look to history, majority of change and accomplishment is steeped in movement of people both violent or not. But obviously it is easier with violence because people tend to notice more. AI thinks I'm a War Monger even though I only took 9 of his cities after he declared war on me...Gee, when a city is captured in this game, (especially the capital) what would happen in real life would involve a lot of looting, destruction, murder and♥♥♥♥♥♥ So when that happens to a city, no matter who started the war. The aggressor would be held accountable even if they didn't start the war because that is common social perspective. Not to mention a city's population halves (killed by YOUR armies), gee I wonder why people thing you're a war monger.In general, think more about what issue you have with this game. If these issues stem from you not winning or having a 'personally' bad time, then it's on you, not the game. If 10,000 people find a game fun, and 1 person doesn't, It doesn't mean the game is or isn't fun. It just means that what you're saying it completely driven by Bias, not factual evidence.It's a flawed game, but it is a civilzation game and  In My Opinion  it's improved a lot upon what Civ 5 was, whilst still adding it's own twist so it isn't just 'Civ 5 2.0'. My issues with this game stem from the DLC marketing, minor glitches and the typically 'cheaty' higher difficulties. People forget multiplayer has mods again, everyone wanted that back since Civ 4...			"

The other point is everything is out of whack- I had a revolt happen when my army was away so 5 tanks apear around the city out of thin air and ransack all of the districts.

												It is far less enjoyable and intuitive than previous Civilization games. I was initially excited but there are so many layers of complexity that it feels both impossible to learn and play well. Barbarians are ridiculous- enabling them is comparable to raging barbarians in previous Civ games and disabling them leaves other civs with itchy trigger fingers attacking you with a dozen units even on low difficulties early in the game.I don't mind a challenge. But there is a really sharp learning curve very soon into the game. I also strongly dislike the map, interface, and multi tile cities. It feels like a throw back to Civ4, which isn't terrible, but is less enjoyable.I wish it were still within the time frame I could ask for a refund. 80 dollars not well spent.			"

												I cannot honestly recommend Civ VI in its current state :- AI is bipolar, declaring war on you for no reason, two turns after declaring you their BFF and whatnot, and still cannot make smart strategic decisions. You can curbstomp them even if you are behind in tech. They do not protect their setllers, and diplomacy is utterly bonkers.- Districts are an intersting mechanic, but gone horribly wrong. You cannot relocate them, and it is nearly impossible to optimize every one of them. Did I mention they often cost more than wonders when you get past renaissance era ?- Barbarians are a constant threat, even more so than AIs. They tech up too fast, and I had more trouble with one barbarian camp than with 2 neighboring civs.- One of the greatest joys of Civ games, building your own little peaceful empire, is gone. Like it or not, you WILL have to produce an endless stream of militay units, just to defend from constant raiding by barbarians in early game, and warring AIs throwing low tech units at you.- UI is a mess. Lots of things are gone from Civ V, hidden behind several buttons. Happiness and Religion spreading are nigh incomprehensible, for example.Now I know that is is a freshly released game, and I sincerely hope that through testing, balancing and patching, Firaxis can deliver us something akin to Civ IV Beyond the Sword or Civ V Brave New World.

												Well, after paying $60. for Civ 5 and then being totally disappointed that i would have to spend another $60. to make it an actual game, I was wary of Civ 6. That being said these games were an institution for so many years, and earlier incarnations of them provided me with countless hours of joy. How could they screw up again? Didn't seem likely to me...No build queues, ""traders"" who build roads, but die every time they leave a city due to the absolute waterfall of barbarians, workers who only get 3 builds before disappearing. AI that all declare war on you 4 turns into the game. This one feels like they didnt want to release another incomplete game, so they just threw everything into them that they could without really thinking it through. My absolute favorite it when you select a unit, then try to give it a move order, and, as you do that, it automatically switches you to a different unit without warning and you accidently move it into a terrible position. You can also go for a religious victory, spamming missionaries while your opponents do the same, and just fling them carelessly at one another while pretty much nothing happens. How am i supposed to keep up with constantly building workers when all the districts take 20 turns to build, forget about building wonders. Sid Meier, you've made me very sad.			"

												AI development on this series has quite obviously lagged behind to the point now it's derailed the game for me.  This isn't a new thing, Civ hasn't had an AI that could deal with the variables at play for awhile.  So the changes in the various components in each iteration feels like rearranging deck chairs on the titanic.Regret the purchase, won't happen again, this series is dead to me now.			"

												A piece of failure.For those who like big maps: huge map is so tiny, you basically run into other players every 10-15 tiles.The AI is stupid, gets dumber every version of CIV they release. They just run their worker and settlers one after another into your army and often do not fight at all while you shoot them. In my last game, an AI player has run about 8 great adminrals undprotected right into my ships over a period of about 10 turns. I don't know what the AI wanted, but it moved them all in exact one direction right into my ships. If you think this is an exception and some rare bug: nope, it is NORAML in this game.It is okay, when something is not going well, as long as the game provides you a feedback, why something happend. This game terribly fails at this point. For example the information about the AI's mood is worthless, because your best buddies which have not a single negative point against you, join declare war on you - being on another continent. Why do you provide MOOD information, if it is either incomplete or pointless? The game is full of WTF moments. There is a new barbarian system - barbarian encampments spawn scouts. When they spot your city, they try to return to their encampment to notify and then a lot of units spawn to attack your city. In the early game this includes horseman and horseman archer, even if it is turn 5 and you have only a club warrior and maybe a slinger. So it is important to intercept those scouts. This extremely limits at how you can start a game, because it is all about pumping units to protect your borders, or else you are screwed. Even when you have covered a huge area around your cities and you have killed any scout, or there were no, sometimes you get overwhelming barbarian waves out of nowhere. The game fails to give any feedback about why that happened. A sign that something weird is going on is the symbol, when a scout spots a city: it is an exclamation mark above their head. This also randomly appears on OWN units indicating that my own unit is an barbarian and has just spoted my city... I had 3 games in a row, where a scout spotted my city at round 3 and 4. With a club warrior you get at the beginning, you are up to luck whether you can intercept the scout or not. A scout has 3 and a club warrior 2 movement mounts. A warrior requires 2-4 hits to kill a scout, depending on the tile the scout is standing. So it is plain impossible to stop him from spawning barbarian waves. They kept comming with 2 horseman and 1 horseman archer AND a scout, which again spotted the city... If you love being screwed randomly with no strategy to prevent it, you will love this game.There is a system, which allows you to boost EVERY research by 50% (half research is instantly completed) when you fulfill certain conditions. For example kill a barbarian with a slinger to get archery boost. Combined with those limitations caused by the barbarians early this additionally limits the way you play the game. Why? It is softly limiting you, because you have always the same starting routine, or else you just miss out free science and get behind in research versus AI. Potentially half the research you do, you can get for free. For every tech!  Whenever I started a new game, I felt forced to either WASTE science points to play different, or play the same way. Diplomacy is barelly possible. It just consists of sometimes having luck to sell something very cheap to get at least something. Enemies you have defeated and which are weaker then you don't stop denouncing you, ignoring any threats not to convert your cities religion, spy on on you or commit sabotage. In most cases you are hated and denounced.The system how you can declare someone war without having the whole world against you is amazingly BAD. Over time you get different types of casus beli, like holy war, etc. which reduce the warmonger penalty. There are problems in this system:- Certain casus beli like reconquest of own cities are unlocked later. They should be available right ahead and cause no warmonger penalty for reconquering own cities.- Some ""aggressive"" actions, seem not to give any casus beli - like sabotage of buildings and being detected. - Casus beli do not add together. So if someone is decouncing you, converting your cities, spying on you, commit sabotage, You do not get a slighter warmonger penalty for all that together. You have to pick one casus beli and you have first to unlock it, most of them late in the game.- Very fast, almost any casus beli still cause severe warmonger penalty. Another of those WTF moments is, when a civilization with few cities which was underdeveloped 40 turns ago, suddenly is two eras ahead of best player. Or about 90 turns of research (when going the shortest way). AI skyrocketed for example to modern age suddenly when I did not even had gun powder - from being like half an era behind me.You can't have your units at borders inside your territory or the AI get rabies. They just walk as they desire and you can't tell them anything or declare war when they do so. If you have have close borders, you can't even place two units 1 tile off the actually border inside YOUR territory without the AI freaking out.When you want to fight against a common foe and you have your units in your friends territory and protect their cities, they freak out and tell you everything about your mother.The AI in this game urgently needs a straitjacket.Then there are bugs in which dialogs won't exit or the game does not shut down, combined with amazing smart feature that cause the window of this game to stay focused on top so you can not shut down it using task manager in an easy way.Civs like england have advantage when conquering or building cities on another continent (land is divided in different continents). The problem is, that I found no option for a generated map to have undiscovered and unpopulated continent and since war instantlly kills any diplomacy for the whole game conquering is not an option too. The game oftens give you some features you can not really play out due to other game mechanics. It its very poorly conceived. This is actually one of the most frustrating things, that gets worser with every civ version - beside the AI. You have not much time to play out something in an era, because it is over to fast and you are busy ""surviving"" the barbarians or trying to not loose science opurtunities. If you pick a slower game paste, you just need longer to produce everything. The time for everything is just stretched like rubber, without adding more to it. Most of possibilities which are theoretical available are hard to experience in reality due to time, game mechanic and soft limitations.Many many more issues I can't recall, but when I do, I will add them.

												Unlike the majority of all them plebs to ""reviewers"" giving out negative reviews, yes, they are plebs - they obviously have no track record with Civilization (at least their track records go no further back than to Beyond Earth or Civ V G&K).What you will get in Civ VI:The pros:Much better city handling. Districts are not only fun to play with it requires for a lot of strategy.Less Diplomatic hassles (no I'm serious none of the pointless informations you got in Civ V and Beyond Earth!).Much better Warmongering as well as Declaration of War system (like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥a lot improved!).Better Religions (even a victory conditions for such). Brings along with it new Religious Units.No overpowered units like Laser Tanks walking around(who ever thought that was a good idea in the Information Age anyway..?!)Technology providing you with new buildings, units and so forth.Civics providing you with new Government types and Cards for Goverments.Civic Cards is a mini game in it self \o/A game in which it is a lot harder to win with all conditions turned on that before.The In-between:The AI is slightly less aggressive on settings below Emperor and will ""feel"" worse than the Civ V G&K, but if you truly played Civ or previous Civs you'd know this is common for a new Civilization game if not you do now. The important thing is:Can the AI kill you? Yes, it sure as hell can.Even with Walled towns? Yuuup.The AI message spam.... Yeah, nothing new either. AI has at all times spammed you with pointless information and always made you hung up in a screen about their pointless information or trade. This is nothing new either - don't like it you can mod it.The Religious unit spam (shouldn't even be here because scrubs learn to ♥♥♥♥ing counter.)The Cons:Not properly scaled for screens using resolutions above 1200x900 (some UI notices will be overly huge)A few glitches (that is to be expected)A few Crashes (mostly if you have outside mods).Has a tendency to get hung up when you want to shut down the game.Diplomacy is lacking a bit concerning information displayed when utilizing certain actions.Trade Deals (especially Open Border and Research Agreement) do not display (except for gold trades)  "

												Loving the game, but there's a REALLY bad taste in my mouth:The Digital Deluxe pack.  This is effectively a ""season pack"" offer, except that Firaxis didn't do any of the usual things.1)  They didn't include any major DLC (just 4 small packs)2)  The discount was trivial (under 20%) in exchange for your money up front3)  They didn't price adjust it upwards over timeIn fact, if they hadn't made their 4th DLC have *2* nations in it, the Dig-Del version would have cost MORE than the DLC.  Reward your pre-buyers, Firaxis.  Don't give them a ""free pet rock with your $80 purchase"".  Because that's what you just did.			"

												Really not impressed.I'll stick with 4.The AI is like a tweaker having a breakdown armed with a .45.I enjoy a war from time to time but this is ridiculous.Permawar gets very frustrating.PC gamer and other publications should be ashamed of themselves for recommending it.Instead of 'one more turn' being a compulsion, 'one more turn' was drawn out and tedious as i really wanted to like this.Many of the new features are good I'm gonna stick with 3&4.70 ♥♥♥♥ing quid for this turd.Haha, 'one more turd'.Edit: It's becoming a trend that Civ players play earlier editions.Somehow this is still ""very positive"".I think it's unplayable.Only upside is i now appreciate Civ 5, which i never did before.Fornicate you PC Gamer, fool me once, shame on you.

												I've played all the Civ games, and either this one sucks, or it's been release incomplete. It feels like it's been dumbed down considerably, but seems like I'm clicking stuff even more that usual. The AI is not improved in my opinion, once you kill off a nations army, they never regroup, and you can't go to war without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the entire world, even so far as if you attack a nation that declared war on your ally, the next turn your ally will call you a warmonger. what it that? The UI still needs work, particulatly in focusing on units. If you hit next turn,  it will stop and tell you a unit needs orders, but wont jump to that unit; if you're clicking through units setting up some scenario, it will jump away to some other part of the world to tell you some other unit needs orders; if it is in the auto-jump around phase, you can't override and focus on the unit of your choice without going ahead and giving the unit you dont care about now's orders. There is no rhyme or reason to trying to build relationships with other civs. You can court them all you want but the civs you dont talk to be the more lucrative traders and less likely to go to war on you. You can't destory buildings if you dont need them, you can raze a city on demand, and once you learn a tech, you can't build any previous era units, so if you dont have aluminum you can't build jets, ok fine, not because you move passed the modern era, you can even build fighters, nice one.  I didn't really like the new UI compared to Civ5 at first, it feels 2000ish retro, but figured that was subjective, and I'd get used to it, and I did, but I still prefer the Civ 5 UI. I've spent probably 180 nours playing so far, trying to get it a worthwhile shot, but think it needs some polishing before I try to play any more.			"

												Having met the Mac system requirements, it was of great surprise to me (an avid Civ fan) that it was terribly slow.  So slow was the turn time it was taking over 10 mins to take turns.  That's with the video settings turned down.I've played more than 3,000 hours with Civ V and it works totally fine.  It seems that Civ VI still has its bugs or for some reason, the seamingly graphic reduction actually ""chews"" more graphic card processing power.To top it off, I played for less than an hour and been refused a refund....... all a bit stiff for $100 AUD spent really			"

												Ok, so here goes my first review ever! I love Civ series, but sadly this game underperforms in many factors!AI is just terrible at the moment, strange behaviour, silly settlers walking around, war declaration without a reason by friendly civ together with bunch of other civs. Map itself is a bit childish, but that is a matter of time while i'll get used to it, but things like missing information and forced switch to the yield icons (i dont like that, map looks  ugly afterwards)Also I don't understand why map settings can't be saved, always have to spend several annoying minutes to setup from the start my game! :@ I think this is the first thing which enraged me pretty much!Map itself seems smaller than it used to be in Civ V!Turn timer seems to stuck when fightning with barbarians is happening (seems like a bug)!Also dont like civic policy change, at the moment seems lacking some fun, many civics are quite useless (if there were some missions from somewhere appearing, could be they would play some role, but at the moment, 95% of them seem useless)!Overall I cant recomend game at this stage :( "

												It is far less enjoyable and intuitive than previous Civilization games. I was initially excited but there are so many layers of complexity that it feels both impossible to learn and play well. Barbarians are ridiculous- enabling them is comparable to raging barbarians in previous Civ games and disabling them leaves other civs with itchy trigger fingers attacking you with a dozen units even on low difficulties early in the game.I don't mind a challenge. But there is a really sharp learning curve very soon into the game. I also strongly dislike the map, interface, and multi tile cities. It feels like a throw back to Civ4, which isn't terrible, but is less enjoyable.I wish it were still within the time frame I could ask for a refund. 80 dollars not well spent.			"

												I cannot honestly recommend Civ VI in its current state :- AI is bipolar, declaring war on you for no reason, two turns after declaring you their BFF and whatnot, and still cannot make smart strategic decisions. You can curbstomp them even if you are behind in tech. They do not protect their setllers, and diplomacy is utterly bonkers.- Districts are an intersting mechanic, but gone horribly wrong. You cannot relocate them, and it is nearly impossible to optimize every one of them. Did I mention they often cost more than wonders when you get past renaissance era ?- Barbarians are a constant threat, even more so than AIs. They tech up too fast, and I had more trouble with one barbarian camp than with 2 neighboring civs.- One of the greatest joys of Civ games, building your own little peaceful empire, is gone. Like it or not, you WILL have to produce an endless stream of militay units, just to defend from constant raiding by barbarians in early game, and warring AIs throwing low tech units at you.- UI is a mess. Lots of things are gone from Civ V, hidden behind several buttons. Happiness and Religion spreading are nigh incomprehensible, for example.Now I know that is is a freshly released game, and I sincerely hope that through testing, balancing and patching, Firaxis can deliver us something akin to Civ IV Beyond the Sword or Civ V Brave New World.

												Well, after paying $60. for Civ 5 and then being totally disappointed that i would have to spend another $60. to make it an actual game, I was wary of Civ 6. That being said these games were an institution for so many years, and earlier incarnations of them provided me with countless hours of joy. How could they screw up again? Didn't seem likely to me...No build queues, ""traders"" who build roads, but die every time they leave a city due to the absolute waterfall of barbarians, workers who only get 3 builds before disappearing. AI that all declare war on you 4 turns into the game. This one feels like they didnt want to release another incomplete game, so they just threw everything into them that they could without really thinking it through. My absolute favorite it when you select a unit, then try to give it a move order, and, as you do that, it automatically switches you to a different unit without warning and you accidently move it into a terrible position. You can also go for a religious victory, spamming missionaries while your opponents do the same, and just fling them carelessly at one another while pretty much nothing happens. How am i supposed to keep up with constantly building workers when all the districts take 20 turns to build, forget about building wonders. Sid Meier, you've made me very sad.			"

If you're a new comer to the series and you're more exploratory, I would WAIT until a major sale(40-60%) so that the game has time to mature and new content put into it[It has only been 2 months since release and two content updates have been released.]This review was written on the Winter 2016 Patch of the game. I'll try to update this review as the game is updated and DLC are patched in.			"

												Diplomacy is outright broken in this game. Gandhi declared war on me (first sign it's broken) and I crushed them, taking a city and giving it back in the peace deal. The fact that I conquered another city, however, turned the entire world against me and for the rest of the game, people constantly would declare wars on me and lose, because they were insanely one-sided. The AI has no way of actually telling if they are capable of beating you and simply will declare war whenever they feel like you should be taken down, not when they think they can. This makes the game far too easy, predictable, and frustrating, as simply defending yourself essentially eliminates the diplomacy aspect of the game entirely: everyone refuses to work with you.			"

												Singleplayer is not very fun, like in any Civ game. The new systems(eureka, culture tree, districts) are polished, and up to scrap. The only one I dislike is the new resource system. Civ 5's was better. AI is completely broken. Multiplayer is still fun.It is also missing the massive army feel from Civ 5. Units feel incredibly weak and soft. Building a large army is virtually impossible. Music is also very repetative. Nice beats, but ultimately infuriating. Leaders no longer have full voices, only for greeting and being defeated.6/10Needs work on AI, combat, and music.ultimately, a step back. If they had created civ 5, but with the new features, things would have been much betterRecomended only if playing online			"

												Civ V (5) fantastic. over 4000 hours logged played exclusively in ""Strategy View"", which has a darker screen, easier on the eyes for long playtime, and precisely and concisely identified all resources, units, and boundaries in a quick glance, all of which is missing in Civ VI (6). I very much wanted to like (love) 6 of the Civilization legacy, but I cant. I even loved Civ IV more. Civ V  (5) is the all-time best. Civ VI  (6) does have intricate game play and an interesting dynamic in city development. Although, the ""cartoony feel"" of Civ VI is reminiscent of Civ Revolutions for mobile devices (iPhoneV, etc) which I have on my phone, and I don't appreciate it, nor recommend it, in a device. Civ VI feels and looks just like the mobile phone app, and despite this, I really need Civ VI to develop a viable Strategy View and get rid of the cartoony feel. I don't foresee myself playing this Civ VI until Civ VII, or later. I will continue to play the editions but not 6. In short, I am very disappointed in the new release, and I will not, and would not recommmed it to a friend.			"

												----------------------------------Award Winner / Worst game purchase of 2016----------------------------------------Worst of the franchise. instead of making you want to play just one more round, it makes you question why you have given it so many rounds already. All in all a solid 4/10 will not be pre-ordering anything from good old Sid Meier again. The King of strategy is dead…- Graphics are horrible. They look nothing like the screen shots. For me they are so offensive it alone would make the game not worth the money in my opinion.AI is just horrendousdiplomacy and espionage are completely worthless and unplayable.Barbarians are Uber Raging by default.Though the new district concept is interesting its execution is less then stunning.----------------------------------Award Winner / Worst game purchase of 2016---------------------------------------- "

Posted: December 16, 2016
												When I first read about Civilization VI my ""Buyers Beware"" senses immediately started tingling.2K and Firaxis had made some fairly... strange development decisions previous.- Sidmeier's Starships- Civ: Beyond EarthIt felt like the franchise was becoming the same as ANNO, where every game since 1404 is literally a copy&pastewith a different tileset and some very minor adjustments.Switch to late 2016, Civ VI releases and I buy it on day one.I had informed myself from previously available reviews and Twitch streams and realised that it was not Civ V redux minus the addons.So what is Civ VI then?It's a Civilization game alright, but the focus this time is more towards the boardgame nature ofturn based strategy games.More cartoony graphics, rules that are less realistic but instead bring more depth on the table,and a generally fairly different approach to the franchise's advanced game mechanics.Of course you're still building cities, constructing buildings, recruiting armies and researching nuclear weaponry (Ghandi, I'm watching you...).However the way you do all of this has become slightly different.Take research for example, now you can (And theoretically have to) fullfill certainrequirements to reduce a technologies research time by half.""Kill 2 barbarians with slingers"" -50% research time for archers""Destroy a barbarian camp"" -50% research time for ironThis holds true for both the regular research and the new politics system.The system from Civ V was completely remade and now is generally very similiar tothe way research works.Instead of research points you need culture and the politics you ""research"" usually don'tgive you something directly but instead grant you access to political cards and governmentswhich you can change around in the government tab.Additionally this research tree also has all the diplomatic options in it and usually there's also a building or two to be gained from this research.Other changes are the combat system, which is in it's core the same as before with minor additions like being able to order a civilian and military unit to move together.The combat itself also seems faster paced, especially once the barbarians start climbing the tech tree.Trade is working nicely (Although it required a patch first) and the AI finally stoppednagging me about everything via diplomacy.One of the downsides though is the lack of diplomatic depth that's largely missing due tothere not being a united nations congress this time.I assume it's going to be future dlc/addon material, however the lack of one really comes acrossas missing a major game mechanic.Diplomacy in itself is interesting in the many methods you can deploy to annoy or befriend the AI.Recent patches have also improved the AI logic in this regard though it still sometimes goes haywire.Now to end it with one final difference to Civ V.Instead of constructing buildings inside your city you're now forced to build districts which then harbouradditional buildings.Sometimes that means you're following a chain of constructable buildings, sometimes that means choosingbetween available buildings.In general I love this idea.It's awesome, military districts offer a second spawn point for units and with the first few buildings also grantsa military outpost that's capable of doing a second city attack on enemy units.Religious district can serve as healing stations for units with the right perks and oh crap I haven't even touched on the religion part of the game...Religion in Civ VI is much more in-depth than ever before, literally has it's own units to construct and fight with,but suffers from being very tedious at the endgame.I could write about all the cool and not so cool stuff for days me thinks.But I want to push this review out before christmas 2035, so....Is Civ VI worth your money?60€? No, that's expensive as cake.Find it for less than 60€ on other (legal!) online stores?Grab it, it's a great game, patches have made it even better and it's only at the start of it's life time.Sure, there's some minor stuff here and there and obvious addon bait waiting to happen, butit's still one of the best gmaes 2016 has to offer.If you like turn based strategy games then there's literally no way to avoid this one.

+Game design is great! (lots of stuff: districts, great people, etc)-Game balance is bad and need rework-Developers' update schedule if very relaxed-Publisher monetization model does not feel fairAI is very dumb. No matter what is the difficulty you will be better (tech/military wise) than any civ when reaching late game. Actually, it feels like event scripting.AI spamming with meaningless messages.UI lacks necessary info and functionsAt current state of the game, you will probably enjoy first 10-20 hours in (quick/online speed). I would recommend to wait for a complete AI rehaul and balancing, or buy with at least 50% discount.			"

Civilization VI is to ""Civilization"" game series, the same sad thing that SimCity (2013) and Societies were to ""SimCity"" series.This statement will talk to all serious gamers and fans of both franchises. It is so easy and slooooow... so weird that I have the feeling to play ""Civilization, for dummies"" version.It's not a complete failure, but you will feel seriously cheated. Because jumping from Civilization V to VI is like playing a limited beta version with cartoons design (can't stop thinking to SimCity Societies on this point). I mean... for examples... you can not rename cities, you can not remove cities states. Worker are useless. Modding is locked for now and for long. Civ's basics guys !I sincerely hope you bought the box version too. For less than 40$, you have a DVD with... the standard steam's version on it !!! (60$ on Steam ?!). Including the (limited) ""pre order"" stuff too ! And a really fun gift you will never have anywhere else ;) THIS IS A FAIR PRICE for what you buy.I needed changes after six years and 650 hrs with Civilization V. I was really pisssed off by Beyond Earth, but it was a spin-off ! This, is the main franchise itselft and it feels to be a joke for now... I think it's time to put red flags up, because this is taking a way that a big part of Civilization's true fans will not follow.Prefer Endless Lengend if you want a Civ like game and need some changes, much better than this one ! And definitely not a 60$ theft !You can give good reviews like dumb bots, but it will not make this game what it is not and will never be !
