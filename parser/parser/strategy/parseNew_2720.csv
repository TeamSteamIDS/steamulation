												By far one of my favourite games. Extremely tactical, some reflexes required, very skill based, some RPG elements and a massive multiplayer meta-campaign. It was way ahead of its time. I feel it would've shined if it was released these days. I wish more people will get it so there'd be someone to play against!			"

												This game is pretty amazing. If you can get some friends together, there's nothing finer than this. The skill ceiling is extremely high, and the variation of crafts and loadouts adds to the depth.  It's a real shame this game didn't take off. Glad I got to be there in the beginning when there was an active community. Some of my greatest gaming memories. Huge shame this didn't take off.			"

												Hyperbol is a truly awesome unique game.   It has a tutorial which you can play in offline mode or you can join players online. Support 10/10This game is still actively supported by the developer.  I got a response in a very short time on their discussion forums. Graphics 8/10Graphics are unique and interesting.  Sounds and Music 9/10Sounds and graphics are near perfect for its genre. Gameplay 9/10Gameplay is awesome.  Always something interesting and it is enough that you will be enjoying it for months to come.  Fun 9/10Have a lot of spare time because it is fun and somewhat addicting. Price:  I have over 750 hours online with this game so I have to say that the price is definintely good for the amount of fun that you will be getting out of the game.  Bugs and Execution:  Occassionally server connection time outs but the game it self has no bugs and runs flawlessly on  XP , and windows 7. (I have not tested it on windows  8 or 8.1) Overall : This game is awesome and worth the price.  Take the tutorial and practice a little in offline mode before jumping into action with real players.			"

												This is literally the saddest story in my steam library. This awesome game went from hundreds of people playing it during the open beta - every server full, every new server instantly filling - to dead in months. Why? Price. Hyperbol was $20 for most of its lifespan, and while it's still not technically dead, it's still also not $5. This game would have been a tremendous success had it come out as a F2P game (something Steam didn't support back in 2007) but instead the developers were stubborn and steadfast in killing their own game.There is literally no reason for this to be more than $5 right now. I say that as someone who waited for the pre-purchase to end in 2007 so that I could pay the full price for the game. It was worth $20 then, but now? Well, there's not a single active game to be found, unless you like playing with half-baked AI. Should this ever go on sale for less than $2, I'm buying it for 20 people on my friends list. Take that as you will.			"

Hey, there is a free demo for this game. Check it out, you have nothing to lose.Fantastic game that never got the recognition it deserves. Multiple levels of physics-based strategy, teamwork, and those incredibly satisfying moments when you land that Hyperbol skill shot. Seeing enemies explode is satisfying, to say the least. But seeing your own ship explode is frustrating in the best possible way. You don't get killed without a good reason here, you'll know what you did wrong, and you'll come back in your next life sworn to make it right (and get revenge).  The online progression system (Stardock) gives a reason to keep playing and levelling up, so you can buy those neat parts and make your ships play how you want them. That's not to say they are upgrades, it's always a perfectly level playing field. All items will grant you one stat, but take away another. It's your preference if you want a speedy little scout, a brittle glass cannon, a slow armored tank, or a balanced stock ship.Really, this game has got so much competitive and tactical value, it should be played 1000x more. Even as is, you'll have offline skirmishes with very competant bots, and a small community that refuses to die. Download that demo, there are no other games quite like this one. Which is a shame because it's hella good.			"

												I havn't played this game to it's full extent yet but even though I was only able to play skirmish mode (due to lack of players being online), I still love this game.I wish I played it back in it's heydey because the concept behind this is awesome. Multiple players on the same team are able to have different vehicles. Each vehicle has a moving/shooting/guarding sort of system. You can upgrade these systems accordingly right at the beginning or throughout the game. Careful though, when you do die you do have to upgrade your system again. Right click enables the aim, left click shoots, and space engages the weapon/defense at your will. You can move as you shoot, however moving is done in increments and there is a ""slow refill gas"" gauge indicating after moving that a certain amount of time is needed to recover and move again. Shooting is made easier by pressing the number 1 to scroll quicker through the weapons. If this game is on sale BUY IT! This is a game I'd hate to see be called a graveyard as it isn't because there is a lot here. PM me if you have this game and want to play! (Also join the group)! Rating : 7.5/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots : Engaging an opponent while upgrading capabilities  Engaging in movement. The bar on the right (yellow/orange to red) indicates how much fuel I have for a movement. It re-supplies itself There is a healthy choice of maps as well as vessels/ships to choose from "

												After over 10 hours of playing ThreadSpace Hyperbol I feel ready to slowly post a review here.First of all, TSHB is a polished game, much more so than any other game I've laid my eyes on yet (barring maybe SPAZ considering it has similarly active developers and good support).I've encountered a few bugs, but given that I seem to be very alone with those bugs it might be something about my system. I've written in the forums and the dev has replied very fast, for a game with pretty much 8 years on it's back that's really something special.What about the lack of human players? To be honest, there are a bunch of active players, so it's just about getting on at the same time as those. Just post or look on the forums, add the right persons and you're set to have some fun with human players. Not right any second you'd like to but it's really not that much of an issue. And then there is the hyper hour every saturday, during which the game is freely playable with the demo, and apparently at that time there are a lot more players.The gameplay itself is really smooth and nice. Very often I have the feeling that certain things in games work wrong or weird, or that this and that is just not really my fault. In TSHB? If I die it's either because I'm facing too many enemies at once or because I make mistakes, it's as simple as that. There are no lethal glitches or the likes and the physics system is very straightforward, reliable and understandable.The tutorials are also made with great care, they're short, fun, and teach you most though not quite everything you should know. Bonus points for having voices in the tutorials which aren't annoying one bit.I can recommend getting this game, even if it is 8 years old. I got it vastly reduced myself, and to be honest I wouldn't pay the full price because it'd be more money than I can comfortably spend right now, but the game is worth it.			"

												It would be nice if there were people to play it against. If you buy it, coerce your friends to do the same. Honestly, most of the negative reviews are about how there aren't really players at all times - it's kinda unfair against the game.BY THE WAY: If you are reading this, there is a chance that I'm still giving out free copies of this game. Check on the forums (discussion board) for the thread with the details.			"

												The community is dead, so I am writing this review based on when it was alive. This was fantastic and original game. The array of weapons had unique advantages and disadvantages. Many weapons interacted with many others, allowing you to shoot at enemies in crazy ways. I remember bouncing a hyperbol off of a repulsor with a left spin, and it deflected outwards and around a wall, hitting an enemy.It's a shame it's over.			"

												This game is surprisingly fun, combines genres in a way I haven't really seen before or since and is really an unappreciated gem.  You should at least go look for some videos of it and play the demo!Alas, the servers are usually quite empty now, but there should still be a small nugget of community left who organise games.			"

												Easily the best game of this type I have ever played.  I bought it within a month of release a long time ago and had a blast the whole time.  I saw the community start and die, but the game runs without issue 99.9% of the time.  I remember chaining projectiles with my friends and throwing hyperbols behind huge waves of defenses; sometimes the enemy team would manage to build a gate of lasers in time to stop the wave of destruction!  It is a very intense and real-time strategy game that I wish still had people playing.  The game is great as ever, it just requires human players to be fun... :(  I wish that it became viral somehow, even if just a little.			"

												I remember when this game was launched. back when the big players were JackD, Derek.B, TinyTurtle. and many others, the epic moment where at one point we all decided to unleash the max ammo count from all our ships in hyperbols at the gate. it failed but one person ended up recording this and it was put in one of their videos. I have tried time and time again to get people to pick this game back up. Still it is a very small number of players, so spread the word! this game needs to be revived!			"

												I was an early supporter of this game and paid a thick price, but its community died pretty quickly. There's no real single player content here, and the AI is pretty bad. It's sad, because it's a very original game, well made, has a great soundtrack, and the online play was perfect. Think tanks in space, on a huge air hockey table. That might get you halfway to a proper idea of what the game is about. If you could get some friends to play with you online or over LAN, you'll have fun. Otherwise, unfortunately, pass.			"

												This is how ""abilities"" should work in a game, none of this lock on insta hit spam spells or +12 damage aura garbage. Every skill has to aimed or placed in position, creating many tactical possiblities. Plenty of weapons/defenses with upgrades,  if someone just spams hyberbols at you there are plenty of ways to bounce them back into thier face. Best space tank game ever made. But you shouldn't buy it since theres no one left to play against.			"
