Posted: October 1, 2013
												An hour or so into the game, I'm given a transporter ship and a mission to ferry some civilians from one sector to another. Accompanying me is my employer's daughter, Saya (who bears an uncanny likeness to Alyx Vance). Just as I'm approaching the last jump gate separating me and my destination, Saya's voice crackles over comms: ""...I think we're being followed...I swear I saw a pirate ship."" We pass through the gate and my heart sinks. A dozen pirate ships were waiting for me. I hand the controls over to the ship's computer and hop in the aft turret to lay down some desperate cover fire. The intelligent auto-pilot system gracefully and effectively dodges the brightly colored emmisions from the enemies' gamma impulse rays as I fire wildly into space. This is a transport vessel; unequipped for a sustained firefight, and woefully ineffective against a sorty of pirate ships. We aren't going to make it. But then, I remember that I have a ship docked in this sector: an M5 class Argon Discoverer light reconnaissance fighter craft. I call up my shipboard computer and access the ship to ship command console. I order my fighter to fly out into space, then I retake manual control of the transport. This plan might just work. I close the distance between my two craft to about 400 meters, rolling and weaving all the while to avoid the enemy projectiles. Commanding the transporter to dock at the TerraCorp HQ, I eject into space. Saya's voice on comms again: ""W-what are you...where are you going? You can't just leave us here!"" I ignore it, my plan already seeming foolish enough without her to remind me. I jetpack over to the Discoverer and enter the ship. Payback time. Locking onto the nearest pirate ship, I engage the ship's thrusters and begin pursuit. My M5 has the weakest weapons and shielding available, but I don't care. I have to protect the civilians; I have to protect Saya. The majority of the pirate ships turn to face this new threat. Two still chase the transporter. I throw my ship back and forth, narrowly dodging would-be kill shots, but still sustaining heavy damage. Shields critical. Hull at 43%. This plan was suicide. I lock on to the transport to track its progress. 200 meters out from docking. A few seconds away. With renewed hope, I turn my craft around and fly towards TerraCorp HQ and the transport. I just might pull this off. Suddenly, one of the pirates tailing the transport increases its speed and positions itself between the station and the transport. I'm 2 kilometers out, just out of effective firing range. I can only watch as the pirate ship fires a volley of lasers directly into the cockpit of the transport ship. The transport erupts in flames, spirals out of control. ""No,"" I hear myself utter, ""no no no...""  The transport ship careens into the station and explodes, and with it, my passengers. My ship's computer makes an announcement: ""Attention, your Argon Express has been destroyed by a pirate Orinoco in sector Home of Light.""  Saya, my employer's daughter and my character's potential love interest, dead. The pirates break formation and scatter, their mission accomplished. My M5 is crippled, my S.E.T.A. booster, one of the alpha impulse ray emmiters, and my duplex scanner all destroyed. I haven't the time to mourn, however, as I'm already receiving a message from my other employer: the Argon Secret Service. ""Welcome to X2,"" I think to myself, as I fly my busted ship back to TerraCorp HQ. X2 improves upon Beyond the Frontier in almost every way. You can now fly any ship, leave your ship in a space suit, and trade and command stations remotely. Combat has been heavily refined, the story line improved, graphics modernized, and the universe expanded. This is the one of the few times I've ever seen a sequel outshine its predecessor, and I know that I'll enjoy every second of my journey across the X-universe.			"

												So, a quick review of X2 The Threat.X Games are a genre unique unto themselves. The game is basically a sandbox universe made up of multiple sectors or solar systems connected by jump gates.The main objects in the sectors are factories which consume and produce products; and different kinds of space ships flying about doing different tasks; such as freighters collecting or delivering products, military ships defending the sector, pirates doing their business (they don’t bother you too much), and a mysterious enemy called the Khaak (that will bother you relentlessly).You can choose the kind of role you want to play. Be a pirate hunter, stealing their ships and selling them. Become a pirate yourself if you want. Build a commercial empire with factories in multiple sectors and your own fleet of freighters – and get rich so you can buy the high-end ships and equipment and go and conquer the universe. It’s really up to you.There is a storyline you can follow if you want. It’s not great really; but you can drop in and out of it as you like.X2 is not an arcade space dog fighting game. If that is what you want you will be disappointed. The game requires a lot of time to learn and play. For those who like sandbox simulation games, with an emphasis on building an empire from scratch X2 The Threat is excellent. Although that said the subsequent iterations have improved the gameplay and graphics. So if you want to play just one X game this might not be the one to choose. The whole series is available here on Steam, so do a little research and decide which one you want to jump into.(ps I have the game on Steam but I played a retail copy)			"

												Economic simulator IN SPACE! You will HATE this game if you expect to fly around blowing stuff up like a bad Wing Commander clone and I will laugh at you for it. This game is for people who extract joy from maximzing profits as they dominate the market on space weed and use their illicit drug money to build an armada to destroy entire races because a transporter from a neighboring sector bought all the energy cells for their worthless wheat farm.Do you like spending long hours establishing your empire?Do you like big learning curves?Do you like working a second/third job?Do you want to wreck the economy?If you answered yes to those questions you will enjoy this game, otherwise just go away before you become another one of those people who just doesn't get it and hates the X series without really knowing why. Unless you hate Rebirth, that's different.			"

												X2 is very complex, and overwhelming when you start to play. The learning curve from X:btf to X2 is huge.(Xbtf wasn't exactly easy to play at the start)It'll take several hours and lots of time in the training menu before you feel confident and start to really enjoy it.This was the first X game i played when it was released, I accidently ejected from my ship, couldn't get back in it,  then put X2 down and was scared away from the series. However 13 or so years later i tried again. And the verdict is............. I LOVE IT.freelancer held a special place to me, but after learning X, freelancer seems rubbish. I would seriously recommend playing X:btf first! Also this game looks so amazing after playing the first one. The biggest bonus is all the information i wrote down on the first game (like a universe map) meant i was able to find the places X2 was trying to send me really quickly, and i knew what the factories required and where to find it instantly, which was a god send.Not having to learn all the tradable resources and factory requirements, aswell as controlling the ship was a huge weight off my shoulders.

												This plays like a graphically and games wise liked a souped up version of Elite 2. Your starting ship starts off with a few more items such as auto pilot compared to the starting ship in Beyond the Frontier which I have also played for a few hours ship. There you have to do some trade  before you have enough money to buy these upgrades such as an auto pilot, weapon and such like. This is where the immediate comparison comes to my mind with Elite 2 compared to Elite 1 which I have never played. There is a mian plot as such but I am enjoying it in a sandbox playstyle Ignoring the main quest and just doing my own thing, Controls are good to get into with practise. It all falls into place. Tutorials in this game are good and you can do them in stages to your hearts delight.This game definately has that one more turn appeal! Recomend.			"

												X2: The Threat is the continuation of the X saga and is, for it's time, the quintessential space game. That is not to say it starts off that great. Most people will quit after a few hours of gameplay and label it a mediocre experience and they'd be right to do so, X2 is not a game that impresses in the beginning, it is a game that requires tremendous investment in time and effort before you start to understand and appreciate the scope of the game.As the game starts up you're treated to some low quality cut-scene with poorly modeled people trying to cover up their lack of animation, you're then booted into the game with little instruction on how to do anything and a tutorial that is so completely useless at actually teaching you anything it might as well be a deterrent to keep new players from learning the game.You will spend your first few hours struggling with your flight controls and trying to figure out how trading works stopping every once in a while to curse at the unintuitive HUD and the lazy save game system.But then, at some point between frustration and throwing your PC out the window you will discover something. This game is awesome once you figure it out. X2 like it's predecessors doesn't want to tell you want to do, it simply wants you to do. Want to be a pirate? Go do it. Want to be a trader? Go do it. Want to be bounty hunter or a mining mogul? Go do it. Change your ship, create a fleet, manage vast networks of trade ships and mining complexes, you are free to do as you please in this vast and open universe.There is a storyline hidden somewhere out there between the stars. The game starts you off in the classic role as a prisoner getting one last chance at redemption and as you progress through the game a story will unfold, if you want it to. The storyline is entirely optional and most people will probably end up ignoring it most of the time in favor of the open-ended gameplay that is at the core of X2.The game is quite beautiful as you float between the stars and watch the myriad of anomalies, space stations and ships that make up the various star systems you visit. The character models and the cut-scenes however are of a much lower quality and will often make you dread having to speak to somebody aboard a space station.All in all X2:The Threat is a great game, if you can get past the insanely steep learning curve.

												I actually just bought the steam version since Gamespy has failed to authenticate my old copy of the game.  I hate DRM.  I probably have more hours in this game than any other, although I may have more time in another franchise, like Elder Scrolls, that's over three games with .  I have just never gotten into X3.  It is prettier, but the mechanics do not work for me.  This is the only game I have ever played that I can set it up and let it go, for days sometimes.  Things happen when I am away, I loose ships, but if I set it up well I can minimize that.  It is also useful to set this up efficiently since you don't want to have to handle a ship under attack somewhere else while you are playing a storyline mission.This game is a bit dated now.  The graphics could have been better when it was launched, but this game is more about building a space empire than it is about wiz-bang graphics.  You do have to fly and fight some, but you can avoid most fighting and just be an industrialist.  The story is rather short, which is my only real complaint.This game does take a while to learn, both the economy, and the mechanics of space flight to get the edge you need to succeed.  Many people complain about not having a mouse.  That's like saying you want a spoon to eat spaghetti!  Seriously, the mouse is just not as efficient here.  You need a keyboard to navigate the menus and a joystick to fly.  I chain my commands together so fast now I don't even have time to see what the options are anymore, I've memorized them.  Anyone with a mouse would be much slower navigating the menus.  Take a ship, ""C"" for command, ""1"" for navigation, ""2"" for dock, ""enter"" to select the current system, arrow down a certain number of times to select the destination, and hit enter to submit the command.  That is five different screens you need to select an option from for this one command.  And you may need to do this ten times in a row.  A mouse does not work with this interface well, but if you wanted to completely redesign the interface I am sure you could make a mouse just as efficient.  X3 has tried it, but it doesn't work for me.			"

												Good, 'professional' (steep learning curve, needs to invest many hours on learning/ playing) space sim. Always singleplayer franchise under a massive sandbox universe, with sure sequels to come. That is: a game you can play for maybe a lifetime :-0, since familiarizing with one of them will get you into the other franchise games, each with hundred of gameplay hours. So for the ones which are fans of the genre interested on endless singleplayer gaming where you can do pretty much anything ('trade, think, explore, combat') a sure bet for infinite space wandering (just remember once in a while you do have a real life to take care of!). To sum it up: takes some time to learn, entry cost for lifetime spacefaring. Don't get lost in space! For the ones interested on a similar albeit multiplayer experience there's the 'EVE Online' game which provides a similarly huge, endless exploitable world (subscription-based).			"

												A straight-up upgraded version of the original X games. There is a plot that is easy to follow, unlike the first game, and there is a sense of progression. After that, the main core of the game is better, in terms of graphics, ships, mechanics, and especially the interface, which was painstaking to go through in previous games. Although it is still as complex and frustrating as its predecessors, it certainly is more new player-friendly, with less confusing graphics, and some text-based descriptions. Overall, the modern version of the series where new players can enjoy the game without having to understand what the old graphics or mechanics were supposed to be.			"

												If Elite is the standard to which space games were made to 30 years ago then X2: The Threat should be the game to which space games are made to today (or 10 years ago). The X Universe has a rich and deep back story with game mechanics which make you feel like you are in a living universe. The graphics are fine and still stand the test of time today. There is plenty to do in the universe and someone can spend hours just working on thier empire. The game does have a story line but it does not get in the way of the sandbox elements to the game, you can return to the story line at any point.			"

												This game is exactly like X-BTF and X-Tension, but more complex and challenging. So you maybe better trying X-Beyond The Frontier first, in order to avoid struggling to climb up the steep learning curve, for this game. The best tip is to avoid Kha'ak M3s and M2 class ships as well as Xenon M2 ships, as those nasties can tear your ship into scrap metal in seconds.If you already mastered X-BTF and X-Tension, then you maybe best to use Money Cheat as trying to rebuild your Space Empire is time consuming. Trust me, you best off using Money Cheat - just enough for a Argon M3 equiped with as much it can carry and the best shields & lasers. But for this game it is maybe best NOT to use any Cheats or Mods that will ""***modify***"" your stats - that will mess it up. You may feel to regret having your Stats modified but it is up to you and use the Money cheats AT YOUR OWN RISK!Don't use any untested or not so promising addons or mods that may ruin your saves, as those things can corrupt your saves. As that will mean you will have to start all over again, if that is the case. And please don't shoot at ships or stations except those belonging to Pirates, Xenon and Kha'ak. Otherwise your saves will have your stats with a negative and irreversible reputation.			"

												A large, open, living space, just waiting to be explored. Although I have newer X games, I often get back to this one, because it has it's unique and remarkable atmosphere that no other X game has. It's by far one of the deepest and games I've ever played and if you also love space and strategy games, there's a high chance you'll quickly get addicted into this one. If you want to try the X series, which is the best modern space simulator nowadays, don't care so much about the story (in case you don't care starting with a bit old X1) and don't want to spend many hours of learning from the community tutorials, start right here with X2. It has a nice ingame tutorial, unlike X3 games.The trade-fight-build-think motto quite sums it up. The game itself consists of huge universe which is divided into sectors, between which you fly by gates or jump drive. At almost all sectors there are stations at which you can land and buy/sell wares on. A factory produces weapon components which a ray emitter factory need, and will buy energy or ore from you. AI-controlled freight ships fly between those stations, across the whole universe, and search for good trades. The more ammounts of some ware a station needs, the lower the price, and so it dynamically changes and creates a complex, working economy system, which the universe relies on. You attack a ship transporting energy to a station, the station won't receive what it needs in time, it won't be able to produce the required ammounts of products, and it's sales will go down. So all your actions have their consequences and the universe feels ""living"" because of this, as you see all those ships traveling around you, everywhere in the universe (you should have a decent processor for this btw).You can also make money by fighting pirates, which fly around and randomly attack other ships. If you destroy their local station, you will significantly reduce the ammount of them, in the specified area. Or if you want, become one of them and smuggle space weed on your own risk.If you choose the trade route, you can build stations and create a huge, prosperating empire. Assign freight ships to them, give them commands to work autonomously, also the same to defense ships. Then you can afford those huge capital ships which you can fly by yourself, from the bridge. The commanding console system gives you a huge power if you learn how to use it, especially if you love automatisation and to see how money quickly flow into your account!The story is in some parts a bit frustrating and hard. Newbies find it hard to even dock with a station without exploding, or to get any money. But keep in mind that this game needs a lot of time to learn, to fully enjoy it. If you're starting with only a light fighter you can usually only attack the same classes or only one-class higher from you (and not in formation) ships, if you're good enough. I recommend to start by fighting light pirates, trading wares between stations, and do many side missions. But the real fun starts when you build at least 10 factories and get yourself a nice corvette with turrets and go exploring on your own ;)			"

He spent five years in jail and when this prisoner was being transferred to another place, the boss of the people transferring him said were going to take charge of the prisoner, so they do, and they bring him down to a planet and that is where the game starts.

												First Impression Only.After trying for weeks to get comfortable with X3, I thought I would step back and try X2. Much better pace! I would highly suggest anyone trying to get the hang of X3 to do X2: The Threat first. It is not so much the story line, but the overall feel of the game. While the controls differ sleightly from game to game, as they are approached differently, what you NEED to do is still the same.With that said, the game is VERY reminisance of FREELANCER in many ways, and not X3. For starters, X3 has no player/NPC 3rd person visuals and comes across more as a serious EVE ONLINE style, where X2 seems to be more story oriented. The voice acting is great (above par for the year it came out), however, it can seem diminished by the horrid NPC artwork. - So bad in fact, I did not have difficulty staring at the close-caption in order to avoid looking at them - YUP they are that bad.But that does not take away from the game. X3 takes some of the soundtrack as well. So when completed with X2, and you decide to move to X3, it will still feel familiar, albeit more mature feeling. You 'll have a better understanding of the controls and how to move about as well.If you're like me, and want to be an X fan, try this one first. It helps a lot to go into X3			"

												This is my 1st time with a space sim and the X series and I love it. I was able to do the first 2 or 3 missions without guidance  so the general controls are not terribly complex, but might be a bit confusing for a few. The simulation tutorials are quite helpful, but the pilot license training is extremely difficult...didnt finish those. The graphics are okay. The storyline and plot so far are decent enough. Combat is fun and challenging. The economy and trading aspects are deep and complex but anyone with a basic concept of supply and demand and buy low sell high can probably make the most of it over time. There seems to be quite a lot you can do in this game and plan to use it as training for Ascent the Space Game and possibly for Eve Online in the future. 10/10 will press the 'H' key to bring up the Help menu again.

But it's still good to play until Elite:Dangerous becomes cheaper/adds more features.I could write more but I'm lazy today, but just believe me if I said the game is great, and totally worth it for the pathetic 2.50€ it costs right now.Minimum 20 hours of fun.-Edited: Btw this and X-tension are pretty much identical, but X3 and the laters are pretty different, so not sure if X3+ is worth it, but X2 and X1 (aka X-beyond/tension) are totally worth it.

												Before getting into the review, this game is good and can be entertaining to a select audience out there.  I personally am a huge fan of ship games, be it space, modern, or age of sail.  It is hard not to draw parallels with this game to others in the genre that I really enjoy like any of the Escape Velocity, Freelancer/Starlancer, or Freespace series.  In fact my first experience in the X universe was hoping to relive some of these fond memories.  If you are looking for an experience like any of those, this game is not it.  This is not a space expoloration game, but a space job simulator.  TLDR: This game is slow for all career paths and requires an immense time sink to make enough money to do anything.  Trading is deep, but broken.  Fighting is unrewarding and loses you money more often than not.  Unless you are into this niche simulation genre, this game is not worth your time.  Play a better game in another series (there are plenty out there now) or play this on SETA (fast forward) while binge watching several seasons of TV.The game has a lot going for it:  Like the other series, you can be a trader, mercenary, or pirate as you like.  There are various races each with their own ship classes you can pilot.  The trading system can be incredibly deep, to the point that you may need a notebook to remember where all the production stations are and which resources they require.  As you progress, you can own multiple ships and run a factory trading empire, or even own your own capitol ship as a carrier, destroyer, or corvette.  The game world is pretty, even for the age of the game.  Thankfully the autopilot is functional and normally a more efficient pilot than I am.Now onto the problems: The trading system is inherently  broken.  Most resources have such a small profit margin, if any at all.  If you check some of the decade old forums, most will recommend trading silicon because it is one of the few resources you can actually make money with.   Unfortunately, after fixing up the busted Mercury you get early in the game, upgrading your trading software, and dropping satellites in a few systems, the ship is so slow that by the time you get from the station supplying to the station demanding, the price will have changed and your profits gone too.  This leaves you stuck with short trade runs in the same or adjacent sectors.  I spent most of my time as a trader hauling argnu beef, silicon, or warheads, with the occasional job board request thrown in.  Now the economy does not work if the suppliers are selling the resource for higher than the customer is buying at every single station.  It also does not work when the stations you can buy yourself make so little profit that the time to return your investment is way too long.  The universe is [too] big, satellites rare, and prices unreliable; trading just is a grind.  After getting a good attack ship and trying some ship captures, enemies only bail out about 1 in 10 and unless killing pirates in a sector where you are the law, you get almost nothing for a kill.  Finally, the game graphics are fine, but dated.  The cut scenes however are painfully bad.  The Thunderbirds or Team America puppets are more natural than the creepy 3d models here.  This was an unfortunate time in gaming history where programmers could do 3d, but should not have.My experience:  Get a Discovery, cringe at the cut scene. Get a rental personnel transport, cringe at the cut scene. Get chased by pirates, try my hand at the Star Wars style aft turret but cannot target or hit ANYTHING. Cringe at another cut scene before getting a free Mercury transport.  Spend all my money to fix said Mercury, find out can only afford to trade energy cells for 5 credit profit each.  Spend hours on end repeating the following: map (./,), target (t), autopilot (u), fast forward (j), wait, make a tiny profit.  After not firing a shot, I find out two races 90%+ hate me for no reason and won't let me trade or even land and actively try to ram my unarmed transport.  After finally making enough to get the Nova L I have been eyeing (looks like the Last Starfighter) they are no longer for sale anywhere in the known universe.  I buy a Nova S, only to find out it apparently was the lemon on a used ship lot; engines broken, hull broken, no guns, no shields, no software.  After limping my busted ""new"" ship along for a while I luckily ""inherited"" a million credits from my Uncle Cheatcode to be able to afford fixing it up and stocking weapons and crappy shields.  I try my hand at ship captures of Slip transporters since the racist potato heads hate humans.  Over the course of several hours slowly wearing down transports only two ships get captured, but many Slips are killed netting me 1 missile of loot each and half a million in repair costs for my ship.  Take a few hours to limp my ship and the two captures back to the nearest dock to spend all of my remaining inheritance to repair the damage just so the ships can move at normal speed again.  Contemplate calling Uncle Cheatcode again to finish the story, but then think about watching those awful cut scenes.  Maybe someday.			"

												I've been playing this alot the last few days and its a great space sim, However like others said the learning curve is tough and several times i've been left with no idea where to go or how to complete a mission. Still its fun and well worth the price. Its a timesink, but once you figure things out you'll have a blast with this game!			"

												Ok. This game's got a really steep learning curve. Like 4 hours worth of figuring out all the buttons cuz it uses nearly every key on the board. Most of them are shortcuts however, and aren't strictly needed. Don't let that turn you off though, cuz if you can get through those first few hours, you will have one of the best space-sim strategies I've ever played. Its open world, so although you are given a main mission, you can spend hours just exploring, trading, gaining resouces, building stations, and going on side missions. The world is unique and indepth. Your ship's computer will tell you ""facts"" about nearly every single item you look at, and there are ""news broadcasts"" to be read at all the stations about whats happening in the world around you. Its amazing, and something no space-sim dork should be without!			"

												I have played this game on and off since about 2004.It came free with a new graphics card.It's.. umm.  kind of a first-person RPG / RTS set in space.You need a LOT of time to play this game, but it has a special appeal.The game starts you off in a tiny, weak fighter and throughout the entire game you have the option whether to continue the story or go off and do your own thing.  You have to work your *** off to afford new ships;  following the story doesn't give you a free lunch.. But it's worth it, because you earn your own rags-to-riches story.Eventually you can afford to start building your own factories and security forces, and you find the gameplay changes from doing gruntwork trading, to becoming the CEO of your own coorporation.Although it has a STEEP learning curve, half the game is played in the menu screens, and certain gameplay elements could use extra depth;   it still delivers an overall atmosphere and style of sandbox gameplay that I keep coming back to and haven't found anywhere else. 7 / 10			"

												The 2nd game in the series, and it is a huge improvement regarding controls and looks. I love how you can look inside and around your cockpit. The storyline is interesting to say the least, but don't expect a happy end...There are only a few downsides to playing this game, most of which have to do with the cut-scenes and main storyline progression. The biggest issue I had was in the midst of several intensive battles someone would tell you something over the comms and an animation of their faces is shown in the radar...not the ideal place during a battle and more often than not I was dead because I didn't see my killer coming because Ban Danna gave me new orders or had some uninteresting bit of information he'd like to share...Fortunately All the X games don't require you to play the main storyline...A must in the X series and a game collectors prize, well worth the cost and well worth the time invested.

I like X3 Started the story mode and then got lost in the game building factories and a fleet of ships untill forgot what Ii was to be doing next to finish the story. I still open the game from time to time and try to see if I can figure out what to do next. Thanks to the walkthroughs fond on the internet I might just be able to finish the game.			"

												This is my first ever review for a product and for good reason. I remember buying this game for $5 and having it sit around in my library for awhile without touching it. I've always heard good things about the X series and thought to give it a whirl. And when I did... phew.Overall8/10The GoodOverall, this game is about as solid of an economic simulator that you will ever find. The sheer size of the galaxy with all of the stations, sectors, and ships is truely impressive. The premise of making money is buy-low and sell-high. However, this is a little tedious at first. With only one ship that is a bit dated it can take awhile to get the ball rolling but once you do this game shines. I've only put 40 hours in (taking a break to move on to X3) and I have about 50 ships along with about 15 stations. By carefully placing factories and making a few traders you can easily exploit holes in the in-game economy (which are intentional). As far as an economic simulator this game ranks among the best.There is a great community behind the X series. If you ever have a question there is always a forum post to consult about figuring it out. Plus people have really gone crazy with modifying the game and there are a ton of add-ons that you can play around with. I haven't just because I wanted a normal playthrough my first time.The AverageCombat isn't exactly the strong point in this game. Don't expect to build up massive fleets of ships like in a RTS until very late in the game. And even then, managing a huge combat fleet can be tedious. The one downfall of the combat system is that you cannot create fleets (at least I don't know how to) and this means you have to individually order all of your ships to move from place to place and attack. Despite this, I would say the combat on 1-on-1 ship battles is quite good. Thanks to a HUD it's a little easier than you would think to blow up or capture a few pirate ships. Overall, if you are looking for a game focused on combat, try elsewhere. Or at least wait until you get a Capital Ship ;)As far as the technical side of things graphics are not bad for a game this old. The scaling is a little off and you'll wonder why a scout ship isn't the size of an ant next to a carrier trust me. The best visuals are the nebulas by far. Just fly through one and be amazed.The BadWell the main thing to understand about this game is that it really really really really takes a ton of fortitude. You will not have a massive empire after 20 hours (if someone knows how to get one please let me know?). You will not have billions and billions in the bank after 20 hours. Heck 20 hours was about the point when I started opening up a few factories. This game will be an absolute grind from start to finish simply because there isn't a whole lot of self-automation. Micro-managing a fleet of just 50 ships and like 2 dozen factories is super tedious. So just imagine after I play another 40 hours. So please. UNDERSTAND. This game isn't for the feint of heart. That being said, if you are a hardcore gamer than this game is right up your alley.The other major flaw is this is somewhat of a sandbox game. Well there are objectives and a story line but they are average in that regard. How you feel about this game is determined by what you want to accomplish. For me, I want to eventually get to a few billion credits and slowly sweep everyone off the map. So I don't mind watching my ships slowly move from place to place and for my bank account to slowly grow.The VerdictAbsolutely buy this game if you are looking for one of the best economic simulators. Do not buy if you want to blow up everything in sight (at least in the beginning) or if you lack patience.Cheers!			"

												Although old, this game is still compatible with modern machines, and still fun. In my view, this particular game is the last one in the X series that's worth buying. All of the x3 games, and x4, were missing many of the features that made this one such an immersive and enjoyable experience.Accordingly, I would suggest that a space gamer buy this game... and skip all the rest. Egosoft's time as a producer of worthwhile space sims seems to be finished, but x2 will not be forgotten.			"

												This is a great starting point for jumping into the X-Universe.  At this point the original X: Beyond the Frontier is pretty old and probably not worth playing to someone new to the franchise.The storyline for this game isn't that long, or particularly enthralling, but X's real draw is it's sandbox style outlook to economic empire-building in space.  It's a ton of fun if you're into that kind of thing, and the dogfighting can be a blast too.  The dynamic economy is fun to engage with, and it's not very difficult to carve out a niche for yourself and build towards being the galactic mogul you want to be.  It's a complex game, but not intimidatingly so, and once the learning curve is done with it's pretty rewarding.Don't expect it to be primarily an action game though, and don't expect to be wowed by the plot.  Overall I recommend it because I really enjoy these type of RTS/Sci-Fi games and this is one of the better ones that I've played			"

												A realy nice game which conquered my childhood (If you ask why I only have 66hours playtime -> I played the game on CD, but the CD broke :/). The In-Game Menus aren't that easy to handle, but after a few mins/hours of playtime, you should have figured out how to use the menus, and play the game how its supposed to be. Its a really nice space simulation game (as expected, cuz its a game of the X-Series).-I recommend to buy it IF you have got the time to play it, cuz the game consumes alot of time (unless you cheat - use the   Script Editor).Enjoy the game! (or not, depends on whether you buy it =p )			"

												I wouold like to preface this by saying that I am a picky person when it comes to PC gaming. If I can't customise it to play the way that suits me, I wont play it. That's partly why I became a PC gamer, because most games give you that freedom.This is not one of those games. You can only rebind about eight actions in this game, and in particular the throttle and joystick axis are not rebindable.So far, the awkward controls have kept me from enjoying the game.			"

												I feel cheated. Don't buy this. It doesn't run properly under Windows 10. I spent 6 hours trying to get it to run in anything other than a tiny window at low detail. Then Steam refused to give me my money back, even though they know it doesn't work.This was a good game back in its day, but it hasn't aged well, and Steam doesn't care if it runs on your computer. I wonder if the $4.99 they should have refunded me is worth the hundreds of dollars I might have spent buying games from them.			"

												Tedious with flawed design and bugs: Avoid this game and go straight to X3 (unless you are interested in the limited backstory, which is average at best)BEWARE: Joystick mappings cannot be reverted to default once changed. Some buttons may not be regocnised by the input configuration and will be lost without a registry fix. Terrible design flaw. Mappings are limited to 10 buttons and you cannot even change what functions you can map.Upgrade your drives as soon as possible, as this game is intentionally slow. The SETA drive, even when set at maximum is a poor crutch for badly designed game mechanics.The economy is very limited, slow to recover and not all goods can be sold at all stations.Having said that, the ability to remote control all of your assets, build station and other interseting features do make this series of games worth play, just don't bother with any of the older version unless you enjoy frustration.

												Overly complicated controls and menus give this game a high learning curve, and you spend a lot of time just waiting to get from point A to point B even with the time accelerators. Not really many improvements over the original X in this regard and the tutorial info is very limited. I can't say I would recommend it, but if you enjoy the X series already then I think you would like it.			"

												Dailog, and cutscene sequences are very poorly executed for starters. Right into the intro, I tried my best to not acknowledge it, but it just wasn't possible. While this is often excuseable with decent gameplay, I couldn't even get into the gameplay because the controls are difficult as hell to understand. They don't even give you a proper tutorial, they just throw you right into the game. It took me at least 15 minutes to find the right button just to pull up the instructions menu, and even then I still couldn't pilot the vehicle. While perhaps this game may have decent gameplay, the controls are VERY complicated which makes it VERY unplayable. I personally just didn't have the patience for it, so I stopped there, which is why I have such little time logged. I doubt even an actual pilot could understand the controls presented here. Do yourself a favor and save some cash, this game really isn't worth it unless you have decades to waste trying to figure out how to play.			"

												I have only played this game for a few minutes but in the time I have played I noticed a lot of problems. First off the qraphics are very bad. I think some of the worst I've seen in a realistic game. Secondly the camera work in the cutscenes looks like it was shot from a news helicopter. Thirdly, the main character has no voice. Fourth, The conversation options always lead to the same choice for you. Fifth, the ship controls are the wost I've ever seen. They are inverted for the Y axis but not X. Pressing  W makes the ship do a roll to the left and there is no option to roll right. A and D controll the speed. The list goes on and on. Lastly, the menu has very minimal mouse support.You controll the thing you want with the mouse wheel and click to select. With controls like that you would think it would have controller support but it doesn't. I have no idea why this game gets such positive reviews but it doesnt deserve them. It sucks.			"

												Where to start? I've spent maybe 20 game hours trying to figure out how to make a freaking buck. I've come through thanks to guides, and ego soft forums.Outside of common exploits, that all the guides point you to, the gameplay at the beginning seems tedious at best - you make close to nothing, and everything you can do requires hundreds of thousands of credits invested. Once you get going it starts to get fun, exciting and satisfying, though.I'm kinda new to sims, and never had much fun with trading games. Maybe I matured, or maybe everything else got old (it did, God help me, it did), but this game was really refreshing once I got past the 20hr long humiliating torment that the quest system in x2 is.Approach with caution as I recommend it being totally new to the genre (not counting EVE online I mostly pvped in). PS - I've been playing for a week, and still haven't been able to afford a combat ready ship.  "

												The X3 series games have newer graphics and absolutely stellar modding support, but suffer from the EVE Online stigma of never leaving your ship in space. I think X2 is one of the most beautiful games of its day and contains full-body cutscenes and internal docking. I even think many of the ships look better, even though the scales are horribly skewed. At this price, it's certainly worth a playthrough or two.			"

												Why should you buy this game?If you want a space based RPG that's also an empire builder you are in luck. However as it tries to do both don't expect it to be outstanding at either. The gameplay is solid, there are some clever mechanics (capturing Xenon ships is both a challenge and very rewarding)  and there is enough to keep you occupied after the main story if you want to become a production mogul. It does tend to become very time consuming and repetitive with only minor progress though when you are trying to buy a capital ship.I do recommend this game but keep in mind that it won't be for everyone!
