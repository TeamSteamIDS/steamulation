												When it comes to strategy games, this is probably one of the best you can find. For its time the graphics and gameplay are amazing. The different civilizations you can play require different kinds of skill levels. Though it can sometimes feel like the game is a bit unbalanced. (Britons fight with guns and mounted musketeers, Aztecs fight with bows and spears). By having the opportunity to mass up a huge army of spearmen as a native American against a Briton that can only have a limited amount of musketeers, you can still fight quite a fair battle. The campaigns are also really well made. The maps look absolutely beautiful and the kind of strategy you'll have to apply to each campaign can get you some more variety than just a random map game. There's definitely plenty of stuff left for you to find out when you'll start playing this game. You're going to love it if you're into strategy games (like me ^^).			"

												Really achieves a realistic feel for the weaponry, making the European gunpowder units have to reload every shot while the natives can just hammer away with bows, spears, slings and even blow darts. It evens the playing field with the powerful artillary and cavarly of the Europeans, combined with powerful ranged attacks to counter the native size advantage. That being said, it also requires you you always have peasants gathering to support your military. The editor allows you to simply go ahead without any worry and just cause massive death and destruction in any terrain you could think of. In short, this game allows you not only to play as God, it allows you to bombard the hell outta a few native warriors. It combines military fun and destruction with resource managing and the all great Empire building. You'll love this just so you can blow up that fort your neighbor spent so much time and resources putting up in the first place.			"

												On WIndows 8.1 OS you need to change the compatability mode to say XP and then it will show all the possible resolutions. Also you can slow the game down using the game's menu.  The  game is typical of the genre. It is not as polished as others like it but playable. Considering the price there should be no complaints.			"

												Even though I only have 3.5 hours on record, this game brings me back to when strategy games actually had REAL challenge! The campaigns are SUPER long which adds for an even better gameplay experience. If you ever beat the campaigns there is always the amazing random map gamemode which is basically a sandbox. Also, even the fact you can assign men to regiments with an Officer, Drummer, and even a Standard Bearer drove me insane because of how awesome it was! Would rate 10/10			"

												       American Conquest was the first game that I purchased on steam but I didn't actually start playing it until about a year after I bought it. The graphics aren't very good but I really enjoyed the game play which made up for it. One thing I didn't enjoy was how the A.I seemed to always have the upper hand and it took me awhile to find out how to effectively defeat them. Overall this game is still worth picking up and it is worth the money.			"

												This game, is SCARY. Scary good. as in, like, thousands or quite angry native americans running at you with pointy sticks good. If you're afraid of gratuitous amounts of humans and empire building, do not play this. You might get smothered by their corpses. It's almost like Hoarders... but with people and buildings.The only complaints I have against the game are, as follows: -It's a tad unstable and prone to crashing. It COULD completely disown your computer and refuse to run on certain modes and speeds.-Lack of a solid multiplayer system. The multiplayer system they HAVE is confusing and doesn't work, even with hamachi. Your best bet is using something like Gameranger.Apart from that, pretty good quality stuff for $4.99.WARNING: small chunks of charred flesh, not suitable for children under 3 years of age.P.S starving is bad. So don't do it.			"

Lead the european musketeers to victory or master the hordes of natives to swarm your foes, tons of different countries/factions to choose from with unique units and buildings. Fancy graphics for such an old game and a editor for making your own scenarios or just for playing around for fun. Pro:-Great graphics for such a dated game-Editor for playing around and having fun, setting up armies and terrain while watching the troops kill eachother-Challenging AI-Hard but well done campaign missions-Morale system that can turn hundreds of enemies into chickens with a single explosive salvoCon:-A bit lack of building types and could use more variety in artillery units for europe-A few unbalanced (both overpowered and underpowered) teams.

												American ConquestI downoaded this game from Steam.  The game apears to be incomplete and buggy.  The game appears to be missing some resolistion information and I keep getting warning messiges when I lanch it.  The game plays but only at it's (fastest speed)  Any attemt to slow the game down by ajusting game speed or curser will crash the game.  The game is impossible to play at this speed even at the easest setting.  I also checked several forums on the game both with Steam and the developer.  I don't see any responses to player concerns going back as far as April of 2014.  It is very fusterating buying a game and not having it work.  I mean if Steam is going to sell a game they at least should make sure it will work on the latest computers since that is the computer most people will try to download it and play it.  Further more I don't see any attemt by eather the publisher or Steam to correct the issues listed by myself or others.  I am just glad that it was cheap because I feel like I just waisted my money.

All buildings are manned and once the fight reaches a village, prepare to lose a ton of troops to bullets/arrows coming from every window, unless you manage to build a few cannons, spare a few hours for them to reach the other end of the map, and another few to level the enemy settlement.You won't be satisfied with your victory.

												A classic game that I used to play for hours on my childhood. Nevertheless I will try to be as objective as possible.Pro`s:- Huge variety of countries, tribes, units and building types.- Realistic economy (food is consumed constantly, coal and iron are needed for firing guns, gold is necessary for paying mercenaries, wood and stone for building and repairingwood and stone for buildings. Subsequently that means that:1. No food: Your soldiers and ppl will starve to death2. No coal and iron: European ships and units that use pistols and muskets can not fire!!!!3. No gold: certain unit types (mostly mercenaries) will rebell attack any faction4. No wood and stone: obviously you can`t build.  Cutting of the enemies supply of these materials can be a vital key to success.- several historical campaigns- 7 player skirmish or multiplayer matches (It is possible to get a population between 2000-3000 persons per faction: 14.000 units in one match!!!1)- Naval and land combat.- extensive training and tech trees per faction.- Buildings cannot be destroyed by simply hammering on it with a sword like in some other real time strategie gamesThey must be destroyed with cannons or fire-arrows- Innovative city combat: it is possible to put units in any building. they will shoot (bullets or arrows) out of these buildings. Sending units into enemy buildings will get them fighting inside to take over the building.- damaged/burning buildings will slowly lose HP.- Moral system: Units are susceptible to fear. Especially if they get attacked from the rear or the flanlk. They will start running back to the base.- Formations increase moral, power etc. - there are independent indian tribes which can be persuaded to join your side and deliver scouts and troops or trade with you.Con's:- Can be overwhelming-City warfare: Innovative but does not work as good as it should. AI and other players use the del button to explode the buildings they are about to lose. Meaning that your soldiers inside die!!! Furthermore for every building you take the Ai builds another on the other side of the city. This can create an terrible drag and prolongs the fight unnecessary. On top of that in order to take over buildings the formations get dissolved automatically, causing the soldiers to flee quicker.- As the point above (City Warfare) is the final stage of every match, which can become very annoying, it dimishes the overall game experience. - Population cap: It's cool to be able to have so many units. However the result is that it is nearly impossible to have a good overview of what is going on. Fleeing and fighting units run between each other turning the battlefield into chaos.A further problem is that it makes it possible to run over the enemy using numbers alone (except in the city), strategy is hardly needed or, considering the numbers, impossible to execute.Conclusion: American Conquest is a game that is worth experiencing for Strategy gamers that like the more traditional RTS games like AoE and EmEa. Despite the Con's it is an innovative, fun game.			"

												This is essentially a TC/mod for Cossacks, using the same engine but set in the Americas in a different time period.Unfortunately the game has not aged well - on a 4K monitor with DPI increase set, overscan issues disable the mouse pointer and prevent most of the screen being rendered.  There's no fix for this, the game is not compatible with modern systems.			"

												I had the original copy of this, and it was such a good game! but this one has been altered to a point where its not really the same game, the speed has been increased, well past its normal level, making you scroll, and your units shoot across the screen quicker than you can see. When you try to change the setting it freezes the game, so ts hardly playable at all, which is a real shame, because thsi game was absoutly amazing at its normal speed.			"

												A 10 year old game that thats not updated to run on todays OS and hardware so it runs poorly. Gameplay has multiple fighting bugs. Formations are fun to work with but glitches can ruin the fight. A formation of 100 vs 100.. if 1 enemy breaks away... sometimes your whole formation chases after him while the remaining 99 enemies shoot at you. It doesnt have stats at the end of a battle.. just a ""you win"" window and then returns to the menu. After a 2 hr non stop battle, i was wanting to know what my win/loss ratio of troops was like, but zero info given. I would give it a better chance by playing more, but the game speed is terrible.All the missing components of this game is in a better game called Age of Empires.			"

												American Conquest 7/10There are MANY complaints i could make about this game, BUT its an RTS,  and they nailed the core features of an RTS. that automaticly makes it a 5/10. I give it +1 point for cool graphics (not that ""cool"" dosent alwayes mean good) Keep in mind its an old game so graphics arent FANTASTIC....  but they have an attractive style. and i gave them another point for being historicly accurate. Most game devs STRUGGLE to maake a historicly accurate game thats fun, and accurate this game dose that well. I must warn you though, if you have never played an RTS before DO NOT try and play this. This game has almoast NO tutorial. So if you dont know how most base building RTS games work, then your screwed. it Has a difficult learning curve, but once your past that its fun. This game is very similar to ""Age of Empires"" but its cheaper and worth the price. please forgive my god aufull spelling, im acctually Dislexic.Other complaints include:*Crash when launching multyplayer (not that any one plays this online)*confusing unit organization system*almost NO WAY to make peace with the naitives*Difficult learning to play*low resolution (if you even care about that)			"

												Great game indeed, one of the best RTS available, the game let you to build anywhere you want recruit hundred of troops, for squads of 120 men each with different choices of formation and stances, graphics are beautiful and animations are detailed, very challenging indeed, sometimes it got tedious however. If you like RTS genre this game for you and must have, it is better than Cossacks games in every aspects, now it is availbe on steam for very cheap price but you will have long hours playing it especially in the skirmish mode.

												Have you ever wanted to play an RTS so intense and fast paced that you can't even control your own soldiers?  If you answered yes than this is the game for you.  Never have I seen a game so broken that after exiting the god offal music still plays.  When you try and go into the settings too lower the volume  the game crashes, when you go to increse the game speed it crashes.  The only part of this game that actually works is the uninstall button.			"

The cursor flew around at like a hundred miles per hour. thing was warped speed from space balls. so i go to the settings. who in their right mind puts default cursor speed to max.  so i tried changing it and the game crashes. i spent like 30 minutes, patiance ran out and i was cussing up a hurricane katrina part two. id rather spend $5 on an asian prostitue with herpes than this game.
