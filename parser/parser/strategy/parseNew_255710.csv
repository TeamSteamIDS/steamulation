												This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Positives* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.Negatives* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.ConclusionIf you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.			"

												In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.

												Let me give you a history lesson.  In 1989 Simcity was relased.  And it was great.In 1994 SimCity 2000 was released and it was great.In 1999 SC3k was released, and it was also, great.  (Are you seeing a theme here?)In 2003, SimCity 4 was released, and it was perfection.Now... it gets sad.2007 brought us SimCity Socities, which was a thing.And in 2013 brought us Sim City.  And Im sure you know what its miraid of problems was.Now finally, 12 years after the last great city building game comes Skylines.  By NOT trying to do all the interconnected and multiplayer garbage that sunk a decade of titles, Collossal Order has hit one out of the park.  Runs great on older machines, looks great, and has GREAT mod support.In all honesty, while writing the introduction I was trying to think of a negative element that came up.  Still dont have one.Buy this game.			"

												So I made my first city, getting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams. At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.All in all an absolutely hilarious experiance. Great game.			"

UPDATED MARCH 2016Alright, let me start this off with this. If you already love city-builders, this is for you. If you don't already like city-builders, this is a great place to start!I personally love city-building games and I can't really believe that many of the things that they acomplished (either totally  or partially) were done. The traffic AI has been greatly improved since release.Pros:- CURVY ROADS- Adustable height of the roads allowing for customized interchanges- Renewable Energy is the main power source that you will use.- Train/Subway/Bus Routs are editable and can be color coordinated.- Cities grow based upon services and leisure and educated near them.- Mods, 74,000+ mods.- Intuituve Menu Layout- Great AI- Base Game is worth the priceCons: - DLC has too little content for too high a price.Yeah that's all the cons. If I had to I would give this game a very nice 93/100. It's got a lot of polish added to it and it's worth every cent you put into it. Buy this, you won't regret it at all.			"

												Saw this game on the front page, never knew about it. As of writing this review, I've only played for six hours and I've already restarted four times because the streets weren't straight enough and I went into debt rebuilding them. PROS:No EA.No EA Origin.Did I mention no EA involved?Also no EA.-New land purchasing now gives players a choice of when and where to expand, not just confining them to a small square of limited development.-Road tools give players much more freedom to create and weave around the city, upgrading also made easy as well. (Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point)-Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building.-Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good.-Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space. (cough cough SimCity 2013)-Even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now, the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam; a feat previously impossible in SimCity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in SimCity 4.The only thing I don't like about this game so far?@Developers #The #twitter-like #announcements #and #the #constant #usage #of #hashtags (I get the point but I feel like my city is composed of preteens.)So far and still hours later, 10/10.**EDIT 5/23/2015**I've found that the developers of the game themselves are very active and receptive in their own community at r/citiesskylines and actually listen to their users.Developers also cranked out FREE and well-done DLC, like it's supposed to be.Game still kicks♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Things I can do in Cities: Skylines that I couldn't do in SimCity (5)- Play without an internet connection- Name my city something rude like PantyFlash- Edit terrain in a nice map editor- Play without logging into Origin...- Actually have simulated people whose actions make sense*** Every person has their own name and a constant house where they live ***- Manage traffic properly- Have funI have been a big SimCity fan for many years. I've collected the games and have tried my best to stay loyal to the brand because most SimCity games brought me many hours of gameplay and joy. When SimCity Societies came out, I received it for free with another game I had purchased. I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.Then SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013. And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release, I was done. Done with SimCity. A game that I have played and loved my entire life. The first PC game I owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with Microsoft =.=.So long live Cities: Skylines. Long live Collosal Order. 9/10PS: Found a link earlier this week about Maxis and EA. Apparently EA is closing Maxis down. Give it a read. http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/04/its-a-sim-ea-closes-simssimcity-developer-maxis/  What do you guys think about this? Feel free to comment.Also please keep in mind that the comments made on SimCity 5 are based on my experience with the game when it originally released and not patches and ammendments that have been made to the game since then.

Cities Skylines Review Its been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.There is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The ""Chirper"" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.The Good:========+  Solid graphics and rich detail+  Realistic simulation elements+  Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings+  Variety of buildings+  Many customization options+  Easy-to-use UI+  Extremely high replay value+  Mod-friendly with editting tools included+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements+  Pleasant audio/background musicThe Bad:======-  Lack of random events/natural disasters-  Graphics could be more life-like-  Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplayFinal Thoughts:===========Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Pros++Very accessible to new players, but has enough depth to satisfy veterans of the genre++Each citizen has a real life, simulated 24/7 to the point where you can follow everyone around to find exactly where they live and where they work. +Huge cities with 36 square kilometer area for building, expandable through mods to 100 square kilometers +Runs well on my GTX 770 and i5 3.8ghz CPU on max settings+Day 1 modding and Steam works integration+Custom ingame asset and map editorsCons--No day or night cycle, meaning no rush hours or changes in traffic patterns-Lack of depth in a few of the systems (wind and crime specifically)-Dams are buggy, can cause massive unnatural flooding if they stop working correctly. -Bigger cities can reduce performance -Building styles are repetitive, often times 3 or more of the same store or house end up being built next to each otherIf you like city builders, this is honestly the best one to come out in years. Cities: Skylines allows you to easily build huge cities without restriction that truly feel alive with the real time simulation of ALL the citizens. Rename and customize everything, even custom buildings and maps can be created in the in game editors included. And with a very fair $30 price tag, there is honestly no reason outside of a few minor bugs to not play Cities: Skylines.			"

												This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.Some of the things worth noting:- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.- This list just goes on and on...The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :PTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.Find my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem! Let me know!			"

Cities: SkylinesNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 8 The design in Skylines is certainly well thought out. A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays. It is clear they are all heavily inspired by Sim City (the good ones), which isn't a bad thing. Why fix what isn't broke?    Gameplay 9.5 This is what city-builders have been waiting for, for a long time. Ever since Sim City 4, city building games have either performed poorly, or massively under-delivered gameplay wise. Skylines has come onto the field full force, and delivers a polished, seamless world to build in, with a gigantic area to boot. Manage your water lines, power, trash, health care, leisure, and more. Of particular note are the public transit routes, refined by the former Cities in Motion games. Also of mention is the small, but wonderful ability to create districts which allow you to section out portions of your city and assign each of them unique names and policies (no high-rises, less water use, etc). Skylines took plenty of notes from the old city builder games we all loved, and refined the experience into something absolutely wonderful. They've even included a mode to allow you to play with unlimited money, and everything unlocked, so you can build without worry and create the city you've always dreamed of! The only minor frustrations that have emerged are some struggles with boats and routes for roads, but that could be my lack of patience for getting down into the nitty-gritty details of layout.   Story N/A No story here, besides the one you mutter to yourself as you cut off your city's water supply.   Multiplayer N/A No multiplayer in Cities: Skylines.   Replayability 10 This nearly comes with the territory of city building games. They always call you back to try creating a different city, or try new ideas with your layout. Or perhaps unleash havoc on the city to just...see what happens. Take all that joy, polish it, and you have Cities: Skylines, at your beck and call.   Overall 9.6/10 If you have been waiting for a worthy successor to Sim City 4, you have just found it. With free content updates down the road, Steam Workshop support, and developer's that listen to their audience, Cities: Skylines has everything good going for it, and my does it sing its song well. From the refined interface, to the focus upon you having control over your city, to the sheer size of the cities you can create; Cities: Skylines delivers on every front, and is exactly the city-builder game you hoped it would be. Though it isn't revolutionary in any of its gameplay elements, it has risen to the challenge that was so long failed, and now carries the torch of the city-building genre. Highly recommended, now get out there and build the city you've always dreamed of, and be sure to stop by the Steam Workshop for some neat mods!

												Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way.  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb. The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.Sim City, eat your heart out.			"

												My people complained because taxes were too high, so I placed the water pumping station right next to the water drain pipe so they were forced to drink their own urine and feces. Within minutes, 97% of the water was contaminated with their own poop and hospitals began to flood with sick people. I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one. While everyone else was in bed waiting to die, there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country. He pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses. That man operating the garbage truck is a true hero. Even through the apocalypse, he continued to fight for this country and show the world he is truly the greatest garbage truck driver that ever lived. Shortly after, he drowned in his own♥♥♥♥♥♥ RIP in peace Squidney Saxton, garbage man, 2015-2015.On the bright side, my traffic problem went away.			"

												For 2 weeks I debated purchasing Cities: Skylines (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, ""screw it"" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.In a nut shell, Cities: Skylines is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. Cities: Skylines goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Replayability value is here 100%+ Sound effects are great and very life-like+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, Colossal!+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though+ The ""basic"" version of Cities: Skylines offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the Deluxe Edition unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshopNeutral± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call Update 26 May, 2016: I've finally gotten around to purchasing both DLC's and I'll provide a brief breakdown. After Dark DLC: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!Snowfall DLC: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems. Verdict: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's. If budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting After Dark first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with Snowfall since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!Cons- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)---------------------------------------------------------All in all, Cities: Skylines is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.With an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo, Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive, bravo: thank you for this amazing game.Overall9.5/10If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!---------------------------------------------------------Update 11 June, 2016: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, Colossal Order - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.---------------------------------------------------------Worthy Questions & Answers1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around  7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo. Keep piling up!)---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.Prefer watching a video instead of reading? Check out my video review right here:

												Let's start with this: it is an amazing city building game. It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.MAP SIZE: 10/10The city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.AI: 7/10They all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.INTERFACE: 9/10The interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.HOW IT RUNS: 10/10It runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video:

			All credit goes to the creators of these cities :) Like, comment, and subscribe for more!		

THINGS TO DO: 9/10There is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.DIVERSITY: 9/10The only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)DIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10The only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.GRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10They are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.CLUTTER: 8/10Ugh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..PRICE: 10/10For this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.OVERALL SCORE:90% To PerfectWould I recommend this? Yes!			"

			Finally, a promising contender for SimCity's city-building crown. Is it any good? How does it compare to its predecessors? Find out in this review!		

If you’ve longed for another great city-builder like I have, or simply want to try one for the first time, I don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choice.Skylines is a proper old school city-builder. As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.As is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.And thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.Let me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.And it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy.			"

Q: What I think of this game?A: Best city builder game I played... ever... periodQ: What I don’t like about it?A: Traffic does need to be fine tuned, and I feel mods are necessary to balance the game, but it's very tedious...Q: What about user generated content?A: Workshop community has been very impressive, adding so many cool things to the game. I am at a point where I feel I am missing out on amazing mods and content, because there are so many to choose from, and I can't invest the time to try them all. But how can you really complain from having too much choice, so forget I just said that...Q: Does it worth the price?A: Price might seem a bit steep to some, but for any fan of city builder games, you'll get your money's worth in the first week... and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time. Bottom line, you will get a lot more then what you pay for, so why wait?Q: What I would love to see added to the game?A: I would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added. Milestones are great, and sandbox opens so many possibilities... yet still, I would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives.It would help me understand some parts of the game better, and bring my game to another level.Q: What are my advices when playing the game?A: The game expects you to be a pro at this; you'll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way.It's easy to ""cheat"" the game, but it will not make it more fun. - Watch tutorials to get some ideas - Use mods with caution, they can improve the game, but can also break it... - Help rating user generated content, rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work- Make suggestions, Colossal Order and Paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any timeQ: What would I like to say to Paradox and Colossal Order’s team?A: You have given me what I was waiting for! THANK YOU! But you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already... Are you proud?     I am sure you are ;) You’ve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback, and all gamers will benefit from your work. Kudos to everyone!!!Q: Where am I going?A: Sorry, I have a city to build... goodbye!			"

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.			"

												Hi guys! This is Pablo, from SimNation.Cities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.Simulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.Traffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.The economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.Building a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.Despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.If you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1.			"

												Not owned by EA.What more is there to say?10/10------------------------------------------------------------------Edit : This is truly the best city simulation games no doubt. But the most annoying problem is it's traffic I guess. Sometimes, they prefer to go 1 lane than using all the lane that are available and caused the traffic jams. And also the death waves occur when you plot a big area of residential at once. http://imgur.com/gallery/5xz1CYa  What happen is they will die simultaneously as they have the same age and the hearse cannot pickup all the dead body at once and most of the citizen will abandon your city. So you need to build your city slowly and not plotting huge area of residential at once. Other than that, it is a good game and I really enjoyed playing this. Some of the mods are fun and helpful and they are easy to configure. If you are a new Cities Skylin-er, I will recommend you these mods : https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/3c5sku/been_seeing_questions_from_new_users_on_essential/ "

												This is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years, a proper, full 3D successor to SimCity 4. It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.Pros:+ It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it+ Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it+ Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads+ The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler+ Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system+ Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city+ Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime+ Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop+ Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback+ Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod toolsCons:- It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality)- The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption)- Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)All in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.			"

												Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it's roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.And while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game.  You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.The UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the ""best"" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies.  For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.Planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series). Graphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average. While the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.PS: Kill Chirpy.			"

Cities: Skylines is a city building simulator. Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account the After Dark DLC (will update review as I acquire and play with further DLCs).Pros: The game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. These concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds, which makes sense: a 1000-citizen town doesn't need a university or a subway line, so you don't get city approval to build these until the population mendates it. Colossal Order's experience with Cities in Motion shines through the complex, but not complicated, public transport system, down to bus routes, cab depots and international airports. City budget is simple with scroll-bars for taxes and service expense, and various city-wide or district-specific policies ranging from Smoking Ban for a better city health to Legalized Marijuana for bonus tourism. Money is inflated just well enough, as either something's wrong with your city and you're losing a lot of money, or you fixed what's wrong and you're making a lot of money, preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time (unlike some other city builder I know) or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait. Statistics and graph tools are impeccable, you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu, and you get stats, capacity, street coverage and building needs right in the city view.Cons: You are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land, and while the concept makes sense in tycoon-style games, you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low, so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map. There are some weird oversights in the graphics, such as large ships that literally pass through bridges, or trees that grew under water (leaves and all). Building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy: I regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance, or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves. I mean, I'm all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid, but it should allow you to build straight when you want to. Ironically, buildings and land tiles, which you may want to customize, actually ARE locked in a grid along the road. Even with a dozen alternate routes, every single car (including emergency vehicules) use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams, a problem that only gets worst as the city grows.Verdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.The Cons may appear lengthy, but it's only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes. Cities: Skylines is the best city builder out there, bringing everything that was fun about SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition, equaling or surpassing most innovations SimCity ""5"" brought, and adding so much of its own. If you like city simulators at all, this one is a must have. I can't wait to experience the Snowfall DLC's new weather conditions and city services, as well as the upcoming Natural Disasters DLC that'll give it the only things left SimFans can still brag about.P.S.: I haven't mentioned the Mods available through the Steam Workshop, but I just have to point out Bryan Shannon, a former Maxis artist who does professional-quality building Mods for Cities: Skylines. If you have any interest in downloading Mods for this game, you should browse his collection.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

This is the City Builder of my Dreams!If you're unsure if you want this game because other City Builders put you off...Trust me, I've played them all and this one is by far the best!Things I really like:- Buying surrounding land, the starter map isn't overwhelming.- Map / Item Editors... - Customisation makes any game better.- The launch price isn't greedy...- The graphics are beautiful and the game is amazingly optimised!- Little animations such as ambulances, fire engines etc. add that character to the game.- Workshop support!.. The developers fully support Modders! :D- Right-Hand Drive option - This makes it more realistic to me...Things I don't like:- The roads are good but they can be a little awkward to place every so often.- Placing pipelines.. I rather this just be auto-added under streets- The Unlock system is good but things like Taxes or Public Transport shouldn't be Locked.- Doesn't seem to work on triple monitors... The game loads but you can't click ""Continue"" or ""New"".I'd Recommend this game to anyone who Enjoys Building games or Simulators. 10/10There's a few really minor issues but overall this is the best game of its sub-genre.Another game that makes me happy to own a Computer!

												I started with city builders way back in 1996, with SimCity 2000, beginning the construction of my ""capital of capitals"" - I was nine, I nerded out, made it a capital of an empire I created for myself, heh. For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)Then came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - ""buy more of this, it will enhance the experience"". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.Then I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, ""Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?"" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!The unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!While there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.In short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake.

												This game is comparable to Simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay. A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.Pros:- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.). - District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.- Natural resource exploitation for more income.- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)Cons:- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.I will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game. Feel free to comment on your opinions.			"

												Colossal Order, Paradox, and Steam Workshop:I want to thank you all for a fabulous game!I've played SimCity since its very first release and it was always, up until it's last disappointing release, my all time favorite computer game. Now, looking back it's as if SimCity is the game one plays in childhood (even though I was very much an adult in '89 lol), but as an adult you move up to the real thing. Which is clearly... Cities:Skylines! Its a grand city building game to be sure. And Steam Workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm. This game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning, urban renewal, city design, environmental impact, traffic patterns, and how people drive and why. And I'm loving it! Every new chapter I read inspires me to revisit what I've already built in Cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population. And the tools I need to widen this experience are there for the using tucked nicely into a brilliant computer game. I'm having so much fun! :DDo I recommend this game? :D  Unreservedly and with happy enthusiasm.			"

												Bought it on release day. Within 1 hour I uninstalled....Simcity 2013, Simcity 4 and Simcity Societies. Simcity was THE game growing up and now Skylines has brought that back in tenfold. Skylines is missing three things that I would love to see. Disasters: No not zombies or monster attacks... Disasters..a weather dynamic system such as rain, snow, tornadoes, hurricanes, monsoons, mudslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions. Also economic and human disasters would be awesome..i.e WWIII breaks out and the fights come to your city due to its important economic means and its military baseElections and Council: Have a mode or option where you to put your record and city building skills on table and run against an opponent who may take your mayor position away. Also allow the option of adding a city council that can help or hamper your city planning by blocking or giving out city resources and land.Major Company HQ's, Sporting Events/teams and world events: Let us negotiate deals with major companies to build hq's in the city which may require tearing down a popular city spot. Let us bid for the olympics  then have to build the buildings should we win the bid! Or bid for major sports teams from all the major leagues of the world then negotiating new stadiums for said team. World events such as a Worlds Fair, or Papal Visit, or other major world events. That's my three wishes. Maybe a developer will see at least one ;) "

Cities: SkylinesDeveloper: Colossal Order LTDPublisher: Paradox InteractiveIntroduction==========I've never been particularly great at city building games, though I have been sort of playing them since the old Sim City 2000. Actually in that one I spent more time loading up scenarios and dropping various disasters on the city than playing...but still. There were very few offerings in this genre apart from Sim City, but then Cities: Skylines happened, and suddenly Sim City wasn't top dog anymore. Some will argue that Cities is better in every way.Gameplay==========As city builders go, Cities: Skylines is pretty simple. New players might be a little confused in the beginning, just as I was. I was so used to the Sim City UI and flow. First you need to setup roads, then zone the areas beside them. Residential, Commercial, Industrial, etc. Hook up power, water, and sewage, then watch as buildings start to pop up and people start to move in. As your population rises, new features, monuments, and buildings become available. There are tons of options for setting up your city, such as different kinds of roads, buildings leveling up, the ability to rename literally everything, and terrain redesign. As long as the basic needs are met, your city can thrive, but obviously some configurations and setups are better than others. How efficently things run is entirely up to you and how you plan out your city. You can freely manipulate the passage of time, by pausing it or speeding it up by 3 different levels. There is a nice option to have unlimited funds if you don't feel like being constrained by anything or just want to test out different layouts on a different save. Planning is probably the most important step of setting up a city, and finances is part of that. If you aren't particularly great at finances, the unlimited money option will be your best friend. It's recommended to pause the game right away when you first get started and make sure you go through the in-game tutorial prompts.Oh, one little tiny extra detail that may make or break your purchase decision: STEAM WORKSHOP SUPPORT. MODS. Enough said!Graphics==========This game is absolutely gorgeous. Every tiny detail is amazing. Once you get your city setup, zoom in and check it out from time to time, especially when you get some skyscrapers or monuments set up, or at night during the hustle and bustle. This game will provide you with some amazing screenshots for your Steam profile showcase! Pure eye candy all around.Sound and Music==========Cities: Skylines has a very relaxing soundtrack. Perfect for long or short sessions. When zoomed in enough, you'll also hear your citizens as they go about their daily lives. Car horns honk during busy traffic times, and of course there's the bustle of the industrial zones. Nothing was left out here. It's completely possible to get pretty immersed into your city, in every aspect.Performance==========The game runs wonderfully, I didn't experience a single problem even on the highest settings. Stable framerates, no lag, no stuttering. Mouse control is highly recommended. I'm not even sure a controller works, I didn't try. Might do it next time I play and update this, just for those who enjoy controller supported games.Final Thoughts==========What a wonderful game! Whether you enjoy city builders already or are looking to get into them, Cities: Skylines is a great title to introduce you to the genre or keep veterans occupied. With a couple of DLCs available, and of course all the mods currently out, you'll have plenty to keep you busy managing your city for dozens or even hundreds of hours. A great buy for sure.Gameplay Demo==========

												When starting off Cities Skylines I thought that the game would be another typical city builder with a mere simcity interface slap on it. The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.

			My cities Skyline review, I spent over 20 hours playing and building cities.You can listen to why I loved this game but at the same time got bored with it, also steam review is up.		

 Pros + Runs really well and is decently optimized, even with a bigger city depending on your rig the game would still run really smooth (Window 7 64 bit from my end)+ The interface is straight from sim city so those with experience knows how to jump into the game with ease. Easy enough for new players to  understand and complex enough even for the hard edge veterans.+ The cities goes looks fantastic with modded material and district creation, the area changes on its look depending on what type of police you set in place. + The traffic system, water, and power system all works in this game right from the start in the game creating less stress to the player( WOW!)+ The district systems lets you color out zones and implement polices for the game giving you the option to create bans on certain things such as pets or smoking ban and creating unique distrits throughout your city+ Easy to use tax system and system to use for + Bigger map sizes for building. I had a Simcity complex where I would build in the small square a while taking up as much room as I can and being efficient as possible. It was easy enough to maintain a city and then expanding. Once expanding the city gets bigger and bigger and looks amazing.+Mod support on day one players are able to download others maps, building objects etc through steam workshop. The editor is also very easy to use and import/export material in to work with. Cons (Or things that Cities Skyline needs to add)- The game lacks depth and challenge for end game content. I find the game is easy and even on hard mode( which I play on) it was pretty easy if one knows how to balance out efficiency and building his city.  In the end you will make a ton of money and just basically start plopping amazingly huge cities without a clear goal. There isn't any concept of material needs for the game to improve the lives of the people of the city (Which sim city had) to give it that extra depth.- The snap for placing road sometimes can be a bit wonky and needs a bit more work. There isn't a city preplanning tool to help you preplan and no rewind button. Once ya place it you delete it and replace it etc.- No dynamic day/night cycle and disasters. These two are important function because seeing your city glow in the night is simply amazing and having disasters give you a sort of thrill in when it does occur. Without it the game doesn't offer much of a challenge unless you mess up your electrical/water or one of the needs of necessity in which case you create a disaster from it. - The npcs are not that entertaining to watch since they do not adhere to a day and night cycle rule. Therefore they aren't as robust and dynamic if one actually follows them for a for a few.- No multiplay ( Don't know if this will ever come true in the future)- Blurry graphic at times at highest settings, turn down shift helps a bit and a bit of film grain is added to the game.

												Cities: Skylines is a brand new city-building game in the vein of Simcity but built with modern sensibilities.What is Great about this game:- The city-building simulation is deep, complex, and incredibly satisfying to master- The agent and traffic simulation is particularly deep and compelling to manage- A variety of tools are available to manage almost any problem that arises in your city- The game looks and runs beautifully- Available areas for expansion are massive (and truly huge with easy to acquire mods)- Modding and Steam Workshop support is pervasive in the game, and the modding community is prolificWhat is Good about this game:- Good use of Steam features (cloud saves, trading cards, achievements, etc)What is Bad about this game:- Some of the mechanics of the simulation (e.g. freight train depots, RCI) are not well surfaced so it can be a challenge to know how to answer certain problemsConclusion:Cities: Skylines is the new benchmark in city building and city simulation games.  This is the game to get if you are at all interested in the genre, and everyone should at least try it once.10.0 / 10.0			"

												With After Dark released, I can finally make a legit review for Cities: Skylines.Cities is the most polished, realistic, best city building game I have ever played. Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best. Cities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!			"

												Whats good -HUGE Playable area versus Simcity 2013Workshop = Endless modability Even without buying the DLC, you still get some stuff every DLC releaseWhat's not so good -Resource hog ; you need a NASA computer to run this on all highNo disasters or random eventsTraffic is at rush hour all day everyday without modsThe last DLC (Snowfall) includes some good stuff, but the main crux is merely vanity and only useable in new games (again, without mods)If you loved SimCity 4 and are yearning for a modern remake that's not SimCity 2013, this is a good attempt to revive the series. Beware that you'll *need* a few of the mods/workshop to really make the game shine.Free badges!			"

												Do you like creation, or city building? If yes to either, give this game a long look. The  two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods. What I love:Scale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city. Living Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.  Cities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game. Workshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.Not so great:DLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price. Vanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.Difficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.TLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view  as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely.			"

												I had an ice factory catch on fire. 69/10.No, but seriously. I have played a lot of city sims in my day (Simcity, Tropico, CitiesXL, etc) and I can say this is the best I have played. While the game may be hard to wrap your head around at first (the game does a poor job introducing you, and there doesn't seem to be any real tutorial) once you start learning how to create your districts, city blocks, highway systems, services, mass transit, etc. the game really starts to take off in sheer size and scope. The maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city. It's a far cry from the tiny 'districts' from the latest Simcity. The mechanics, such as placing buildings and infrastructure, are intuitive and easy to use for the most part (the transit lines could use a bit of work), and rarely did I have to wonder ""why can't I place this here"" or ""why isn't this working?"". The amount of in-game content for your city is also quite robust, and the ability to download additional content via the workshop lets you add even more.This is a rock solid city builder that any fan of city sims or simulation games in general needs to own.9/10			"

To honor this great game I deleted my old review and spend some time writing a new one.You should know that this game is a long-term investment. You have to spend a lot of time on it fine tuning but in exchange you'll get back a lot of excitement and room for creativity. You can start playing this game with no knowledge about city builder games but you will soon notice that the larger you city gets the more challenging the road network becomes. Although you need a bit of patient or else you won't like the game as much. You will have to bulldoze and rebuild streets sometimes multiple times. Just don't see it as negative point and don't get frustrated. Similar as if you draw a picture. Since this is a city builder you will spend most of your time designing road layouts and managing traffic. No one likes too much talking so here in short the positive and negative points.Positive:great graphics. Subjective yes, but you can customize the colors (LUT). If you install the correct one it will look photo realistic instead of colorfuleasy to learn. Even if you're a total beginner you will find fun in creating huge ""Wuselfaktor"" as we say in German. ""bustling factor"" might be the translation for itextreme high replay valueawesome community with massive amount of mods on the workshop. I highly recommended to install at least the following must-have.low system requirements without modslow price for base gamehuge maps to build ondifferent map themesSome content from DLCs is free for base game ownersweather and day/night circlecreating own districts and add policiesNegative:traffic sometimes doesn't want to use up all lanes. Thankfully I don't have this problem so often. There are multiple workarounds you can find, nevertheless it's my only real critics point. I managed to avoid this mostly by using highway exits only on one side. (So there are 2 lanes in total for the main traffic and one for the off/on ramps) As of writing the review the developers rejected to ever fix it. As reason for this they state the increase of the system requirements needed. no real on/off ramps for highways (they are basically just one-lane highways)vanilla buildings without mods are a bit too repetitiveexpensive DLCs (for that little content they add. Nevertheless you support the developers and got a cheap base game. I got myself most DLCs by now on a sale)chirpy can get annoying ;)the following must-have mods should have been in the base gameMust-have mods:Move it! (Honestly my favorite one. For details please check workshop)All 25 Areas purchasable (exactly). Mod Achievement Enabler (Or else you won't get achievements if you use mods)Dynamic Resolution (If you have a decent PC, get that to have way better AA via downsampling)Ambient Occlusion (Adds nicer and more realistic shadows on objects)Traffic Report Tool (Shows traffic routes. Good for beginners as well as experts)NoPillars (So you can easier build bridges)Network Extension Project (So you have more road types to build with. Not sure why so many are missing in the base game tbh.)Network Skins (Change the tree type on your road and more)One-Way Train Tracks (What it says)Fine Road Tool (Change road height in smaller steps)Don't crash (most important: it improves loading times)District UI Tweaks: Hide Names (Hides District names. Why is this not in vanilla C:S??)Any kind of traffic manager. Right now I use Traffic Manager President Edition. (You can play without fine, just needs more patient fixing AI traffic manually.)Extra Landscaping Tools (Very good!)Right now I have 280 mods installed. The game doesn't crash on my system regularly but it can happen. As always I recommend to save often with that many mods. PS: On the workshop there are 96.363 mods atm. Skyrim has 49,910 on Nexus mods. ;)			"

												Cities: Skylines is a single-player city-building simulator game developed by Colossal Order, and published by Paradox Interactive. SUMMARY:  This game is great. Anyone who plays this, even if you're not a fan of the city-building genre, will enjoy this game. Pros: -simplistic and colourful art style-great UI-lots of tabs & information-good camera controls-music fits in with the atmosphere of the game, and is also well made-zoning is easy and simple, same goes with power and water-real-time water physics-plenty of variety when it comes to types of houses that are built-cities are simple and fun to create-Steam workshop support-comes with a map & asset editor, and again, easy to use-the ability to see pollution-big maps-the ability to expand your map limits-UI animations are clean-balanced loans-taxing system is great-being able to see the sewer water flow down the water is a nice touch-you can stalk each and every person in your city, and see where they live, where they work, etc. (This is ASTONISHING)-depth of field adds a nice touch to the graphics-graphics, audio, etc. settings and sliders and detailed enough-optimization is decent-the ""twitter"" function at the top of the screen is nice, and it is enjoyable to see the tweets from your citizens-Steam achievements-monuments are detailed-pretty much everything is detailed in this game-health care, police, schools, and fire stations are all cool-green energy-animations are great and mix well with everything else-SFX are great-multiple brushes for filling in zones or other things (Plus like 50 more pros, as I cannot name all of them of the top of my head) CONS -bulldozing abandoned buildings are a pain to do-no big events/disasters-traffic sometime merge together			"

												Dear Maxis,If you had done Sim City 5 like that, you'd still exist today.Dear Focus Home Interactive,This is actually how you do a city simulator. Then again, you basically bought Cities XL/XXL from Monte Cristo before they tanked and re-release it every year by adding an X to the title, so it's not like you ever tried anyway.			"

												The +'s+ Very Detailed Buildings, Roads, Cars, down to the physics in the water + Huge areas of land+ Multiple landscapes to pick from+ Ton of premade worlds to get started in+ Trains, Boats, Airplanes, Subway, Hearses, Trash Trucks, Fire Engine, Police Car, Ambulance and a bunch more animated vehicles!+ Every person is doing something in the city, with cool activities like a ton of different style parks, and hey actually animate them doing it!! Create a bus route and don't enough stops ? Hahaha well you will have a ton of people waiting outside because not enough stops and buses to meet the demand.+Awesome path editor with many different road types and bridges and scenery+ Steam Workshop+Easy UI+ Progressing with milestones feels rewarding+ Wind Turbines turn against wind, I thought this was really cool.Now there is a ton more +'s but my hand hurts from carpool tunnel from playing the game like 15 hours straight soHeres the -'s-Pathing on cars sometimes sucks bad-Not really many events other than random fires which don't spread =( ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )-Road pathing tool can be pretty annoying when trying to upgrade skinny streets to wide streets-No Auto Save Feature (Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively)-No Cycle of day and night ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )-Sometimes the game moves at such a fast pace that's not desirable, usually people like to speed it -up but if you have a decent city, the demand for structures will never stop or slow down! ( Can pause but a slow down option ? )-Wish there was weather other than the wind is moving this way or that wayThings I would like in the game*Riots ( Maybe a military base with units ? or swat team that could stop riots ?)*More Events*Spreading Fire ( Natively ) *( I am not sure if it exists outside of a mod ) But snow?*More things for people to do other than parks and plazas ( Baseball Park, Football Stadium, etc... I *know the workshop will have tons of this stuff, but it would be nice to have the professional touch on more buildings with animations! )  Btw the soccer park in the work shop is pretty cool!*Seasons that change on time of year*Night Mode with lighted sky scrapers and other modelsI highly recommend this game, although it's more serious sim then that which you can have fun destroying your creations ( at the time being at least ). $30 dollars is a great steal, if you are affraid of DLC, the workshop should ease that a but with over 20,000 items and growing!

												Cities Skylines is said to be a ""modern take on the classic city simulation"" and after playing around for many hours, it is on that path and it's the best we have of a new modern city building simulator, and it's the best we will probably have for a while.This is, to an extent, the city building game we've been waiting for, at least the best one we're going to get that's is satisfying, not buggy, not overly restricting, but one that's made with care, that's free from tiny shackles, with freedom and space to have creativity built in it, and one that's design nicely, combined with support for community support.


YouTube™ Video: Cities Skylines Gameplay Preview 

			Views: 176		

			We go to play around with it, and it's better than all city building games of recent years. More info at: http://KSalue.com End video song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVafDaVTVkk ~Twitter:...		

The look of the game is decently great, at least better looking that a rehashed game for the third time, but lowers than a heavily funded one. it's working, compared to other recent city builders, it has minimal bugs, runs smoothly, even hours after playing the game with a lot of structures being built. The restrictions on the game at its peek is minimal, exponentially smaller than a triple-A produced game of recent years, with the ability to remove all restrictions.The gameplay is slick and smoother, with normal decent controls and a good UI, and an even more detailed view of finer data like the space need to build a structure alongside a road, a better resource and feedback view, and other new elements introduced like noise pollution with elements and tools at hand to counter it. The game uses a nice system of the industry type zoning, with placing them in specific types of land with resources, and then applying the type of work they do with the use of the district painting tool. Certainly a new way of production that I haven't seen before, and it's kind of nice and sort of makes some sense instead of having just one building produce one specific type in mass.The transportation and traffic controls in the game is real and it packs a punch, as it was created by the same developers who made Cities In Motion 1 & 2, which was mainly focused and is specialized on the transportation systems. So if you don't have a nice road map for you city, you will probably have issues with other cervices doing their jobs and as a result having more issues to deal with, which is great.The problems with the game consist of the game not teaching you well enough on how the systems work, but you I managed to learn almost everything to make a decently big city on my second playthrough. My first time playing the game was arguably created a horrible city, but my second playthrough was a lot nicer after having all the experience and knowledge I gained from my first go at it, and at this point it's fine tuning with my third time at creating a nice city. Not a problem, more of a nit picky thing, the monuments in the game where mediocre in it's scale and design, as I wasn't overwhelmed by it's looks or scale. Plus, the game doesn't have any sort of flying services, which left me heavily focusing on my structural groundwork immensely more so I don't screw up later on and damage my city.Overall Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder that I and many others needed, from the glorious days of the past, to the disappointments of modern times concerning a nice city builder, SC brings joy and hope that we finally get to have in this genre, for the asking price and for what you get and what you will get later on with support for community support, this is a definite good purchase.Shameless link[ksalue.com] to original post			"

												To me, this game has become the new modern standard citybuilding game. It's a game that feels like it is pushing the citybuilding game genre back to it's roots. Clearly the developers learned from the mistakes of Maxis and EA with SimCity; everywhere it failed to deliver, this game has got it. With a focus on things like Steam Workshop and modding it seems a thriving community will come of this game and clearly hasn't been made to become a DLC machine.

			Cities Skylines is a city builder game, that shows SimCity how a city building game SHOULD look! This First Look shows many details of Gameplay, including even things like mods!		

Pros:> Wide audience appeal. It feels that it can be as casual or as serious as you want it to be. Not at all daunting for a first timer to use, and even includes things like hard mode for the more seasoned city builder. > The game feels very well optimised and runs very nicely. Both my laptop and desktop PC play this game very well.> Easy to use world and assets editors for deeper customisation. Asset creations such as parks, buildings, intersections, props and even trees. All uploadable and retrievable through Steam Workshop.> It has a very detailed simulation of city life. Features things like dynamic water that makes dams usable, or gives you the ability to poison the city water supply with poorly placed pumping stations and drain pipes. You can follow people, cars, buses etc and you can see these people are living out daily lives. The city does feel alive.> Huge expandable worlds to build in. No more cities the size of a village like on SimCity. You can actually build massive sized cities!> You also have freely controllable taxes, funding and policies not only at a city level but also at a district level that can change the feel and dynamic of the cities and the people that live in them. You have a twitter-esque system that gives reports on how people are feeling based on tweets they make about the city.> There's lots to do with the roads. Many different shapes and sizes, one-way systems, highways, dirt roads, pavements etc, and they can all be raised, curved or done freeform.Cons:> No day or night cycle! It seems so many situations on the roadways (rush hours etc) can't be experienced, which makes the traffic feel a bit basic a lot of the time.> Whilst there is a lot to do with the roads, it's not always as accurate as I would like. It makes building more complex road systems a bit of a pain, and won't let you connect up roads and paths in a way you may want. I hope it gets an update soon to let us customise our roads even better.> I notice a lot of the same buildings appearing next to each other, like having a street with just the same burger bar a few times on it. More building variation and randomisation would be nice, but I imagine this could be solved with user-created content.> Some of the figures feel a bit off. The population figures always feel a bit low compared to what you may expect from the current state of your city.Overall it's a lovely feeling game and comparatively to other city builders to come out in recent years, this is definitely the pick of the bunch. It's well priced on launch compared to competitors, especially SimCity.			"

												Cities: Skylines is the city builder I've been waiting for since 2004. It is intuitive, has actual working citizen travel, flowing water, (mostly) realistic travel... and looks beautiful.It is also designed to be mod friendly and mods are already expanding the game within the first weeks of release.And no forced online or tiny city sizes. Even without mods, you can built a huge metropolis in this game.Downsides: traffic isn't perfect, so you can end up with unrealistic traffic patterns. The devs are working on this though.Music is forgettable. Nothing like the excellent SimCity series :/And it is extremely addictive. This game will cause you to be tired at work because you stayed up until 3am on a working day...TDLR: Best City Builder in over a decade. Buy it today.			"

												Cities: Skylines is the unofficial SimCity sequel we deserve! From the very beginning, the game feels much closer to SimCity 4 than the most recent iteration of SimCity. The game embraces Steam Workshop, and the amount of custom content already is outstanding. I have enjoyed every second thus far with the game and I wanted to share my thoughts on it for those of you on the fence.PROS-Steam Workshop Integration-Massive Cities-Enjoyable Challenge-Cities Feel Alive-Hours and Hours of Content-Great Price for Launch-Allows for Cities of All Shapes and SizesCONS-Traffic Needs Some Balancing-Lots of Repeated Buildings (Custom Content Helps)-Trash and Death Can Get Out of Hand Due to TrafficAll in all, I recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who considers themselves fans of the simulation genre. The game is addictive and provides hours of fun. I am 15 hours in and I only have 50,000 people in my city with so much more land available to grow. The $30 is fair, but there is no excuse not to pick this game up at a sale price! "

												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!I come from a long, proud line of urban planners. My father is an urban planner, as was his father, and his father before him (his father's father's father copulated with goats and is seldom brought up in polite conversation). But the fast cars/money/women/goats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me. Much to my family's chagrin I pursued writing, and they were (and continue to be!) devastated. Before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play Cities: Skylines. “This is in your blood son,” he smiled, weary from a hard day of urban planning. “Please. For me. For the family.”So I started to build my first city across from a scenic river... and, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It just clicked. I stretched roads in a grid and began zoning – visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district, noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic; past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district, busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights; further still they would find themselves in our residential district, with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore. But to build a city you have to do more than just plan. You have to create.I built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out. Satisfied I unpaused the game and watched. Slowly, skeletal structures emerged from the earth, supports were raised and lowered, and buildings became occupied. Little storefronts popped up, factories rose up, and dream homes were built. Cars flooded my little two lane streets, full of wide-eyed country bumpkins presumably. And things were good, for a time. I sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro, traffic ebb and flow, and more buildings appear from empty lots.Perhaps my father had a point.Oh, an achievement unlocked!Bad Mayor. Have 15% Happiness.♥♥♥♥.I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention – wait, what do you mean “sewage is bubbling up?”And so my city, 420BlazeIt360NoScope, drowned in a sea of human waste. Langston Hughes, a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat, for the record. It was also crusty.Cities: Skylines is the sleekest, smartest, and most potentialicious city builder available currently – and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated, dedicated modding support. You'll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp. To get your city off the ground you'll do what I mentioned previously - sans massive sewage backup. You'll zone districts, set up the water and electricity, and watch your little hamlet bustle. As your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities. You'll have to build accessible clinics, police stations, schools, and fire stations. You'll have to keep pollution (sound, ground, and water) in check. Districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted, like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region, or banning smoking in a residential area. Prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand, buildings are abandoned, taxes are too high, etc. In addition Chirper, the game's Twitter feed thingy, will tweet pertinent (if sometimes repetitive and annoying) information.With every addition and upgrade you'll have to expand further and further, balancing the budget, happiness, and health of your city along the way. Eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles, upgrading, rebuilding, rezoning, public transit, shipping... the scope of it is a little overwhelming (old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis' in no time. For the uninitiated I'd recommend watching the frequent Twitch streams and Youtube LPs)! Mastering C:S requires a great deal of foresight. Sure, you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants, but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread. Build the more expensive green energy alternatives and you'll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them. Traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads, and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire (and fire crime, “arson” sounds much to pedestrian). When you have a breather, however, it's one of the most relaxing, satisfying games I've ever played. Watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing... people walk their dogs, firetrucks blare by, garbage trucks make their rounds. It feels alive.Despite some technical glitches (trains jumping tracks, cars driving into burning buildings, little oversights with no bearing that SHOULD be patched early into release), I don't really have any complaints. Yes, seasons and a night cycle would have been nice, more aesthetic “flavors” for buildings and locations would keep things fresh, and more “disasters” to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with (natural, human, seasonal, or just plain silly). While the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours, there are already mods, new assets, and maps to spice things up. Just like a real city, a REAL community, this game's replayability will be dependent upon community involvement. And I predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come.There's something really special about C:S and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's like waking up on DESIGNATED APPLICABLE HOLIDAY morning to a big present, and you unwrap it and it's one of those farm playsets, or when you're zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug, or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum. And then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes.			"

												Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder, it puts in so many unnessesary details that just make the game feel so alive.Pros:+Beautiful.+Camera controls are nice.+Crazy amounts of tiny details that go from every person having a name, house and job to street light flickering before they change.+A nice selection of maps to choose from.+Has that nice classic city builder feel to it.+Looks very modern.+Day 1 mod support.+Easy to use level editor+ building creator thing.+Lots of options for obtaining resourses.+Developers seem to be active and nice.+Sounds are nice.+Rewards you for milestones+Has actual water physics (which are not needed in a city game but are just another nice feature).Cons:-People are not happy with leisure even if there are parks everywhere-Some people won't be educated even though there is a school next to them.-Some of the random ""tweets"" get repetitive.-Dosen't have a tutorial for people who have never played a city builder before.-Because there is no tutorial I have no way or pre-planning anything that's about to come my way and I end up not being able to build things I need.-Citizens leave not because they are unhappy but because you didn't build something specific which the game wanted you to build which is a bit dumb.-Vehicles sometimes dissapear.-Bus, Metro, Trains and the rest of those are really frustrating to build and are really hard to learn how to even make without looking up a tutorial.-Sometimes the game won't let you build a road/build ext. because there is something in the way, but there isn't.Overall I rate this game a 9/10 has a fair amount of issues but still very fun and is a great game.

												I used to play and enjoy SimCity but I was sometimes disappointed especially with the traffic simulation. Then a friend recommended me to try Cities: Skylines. At first I thought it seemed a bit confusing compared to SimCity but after a while it became easy to play and I started enjoying it. I am impressed with the traffic simulation. It is very realistic and there are far more options when building roads. Of course SimCity has advantages in other ways but I am pleasantly surprised by Cities: Skylines and I can definitely recommend it!P.S. You end up being addicted to the game :D			"

(More road types, ability to place props, etc)Canals are slightly buggy when trying to build bridges over Tsunamis are a little op - barriers/greenery do little to stop waves :(Overall, I still give the game a solid 11/10 XDTake my money!!!! *Flings money at paradox*			"

												For me, a teenager who does no chores and has no source of income besides holidays and birthdays, $30 is a lot of money. It took me some convincing before I would buy a game worth that much. After I've watched/read various reviews of the game, which were all positive, I finally decided that I'd buy the game, and I'm happy with the decision. As of posting this review I only have about 2 hours played, but I can tell already that I'm going to love this game and probably play many more hours. There are so many features in this game, from big things like creating individual districts that have their own policies, to small things like renaming the residents of your city.The only visible flaw of this game to me, is the game's font. It's so small on my screen that it is almost unreadable. This problem is being experienced by many other players of the game aswell. As of now, that is my only problem with the game and I hope that it'll be fixed soon.I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes the City Builder genre. This game is the game that Sim City 2013 should have been.			"

												TL;DR: sandbox game for creative players. If your creativity is channeled through problem-solving, then this game will leave you wanting.I have tried so hard to like the game.Hands-down, technically the best city-builder since Sim City 4. The problem is: I don't have the urge to come back to it. 5 hours in, lack of interest settles in, I just give up and start over. Rince and repeat. I can't find the fun though I'm looking hard.Therefore it's aimed at creative players, who just play on unlimited resources and invest time in designing a beautiful city.Lack of challenge makes you fail to see the point of anything after a couple hours. ""Ok, I can improve traffic, but what's the point, people still come to my city and budget is fine anyway"". ""Criminality? Okay, whatever. Budget's fine"".""Cool, I can fine tune the budget with all the sliders!... I can make tax-free zones for specific industries!... but I don't care and won't ever use it because there's absolutely no point"".If you're the kind of person who just wants to design stuff, then you'll have a blast. If you channel your creativity through problem-solving, then boredom will settle in quickly.If you're anything like me, then you will find that there's no point in moving away from the ""grid"" city-design. Every block is a square, crossroads are crosses, because that's the more efficient choice. So if you're a problem solver, all your cities will look the same.That may sound stupid to Americans, but here in old Europe, cities have grown organically over the course of millenias: cars are barely allowed in medieval city centers, which have tons of pedestrians-only walkways; low-rent flats are usually in the cities' outskirts; then, further away, the big business center with highrises, accessible by road or public transportation, built in a very windy spot or on an old marsh, because that's the only spot where our ancestors didn't build anything...I dream of the day a city-builder will have us build a city through the ages. Imagine the challenges! Your 1200 AD city needs wall for defense, but cannons will soon render this useless and you'll be left with crumbling walls dividing your city between center and outskirts. Industrial revolution comes around and now you need housing for workers, railroads for supply: means you have to burn down some of those outskirts houses and decide what to do with their poor inhabitants... Enters XXth cenury, in order allow cars into the city you need larger avenues, so then again you need more space! Residents won't be happy... Then, fast-forward 2010, there is so much traffic that you need to reshape everything around cycling and public transportation...You could choose to start in the New World around 1600 AD, where challenges are entirely different...If you built your city originally on a marsh, or trapped between mountains, or in windy plains, then you would have different challenges and opportunities, renewed every new era.Now, THAT would keep me playing till 4am. Cities: Skylines? Sadly, no.			"

												I find it difficult to 'review' Sim games because the tend to be more like toys than actual games.Alongside that, I've never really been that good at them. I have some tenure with three different SimCity games and it usually amounts to moneyflow being non-existent, and I just get frustrated and nuke the town with UFO's, Tornadoes, and Volcanoes. It was great fun for when I was younger, but now at my age I demand something more satisfying.Cities: Skylines delivers. With a modicum of patience, starting relatively small, I am actually capable of creating a city that functions.Granted I have a few issues, usually with traffic and land value. (My games I can’t usually afford to throw decent parks on every corner to make everyone happy). Regardless, my values tend to be over 70% in most cases and I call that a victory for my usual tenure in City-Sim games.That's not to say how much FUN I'm having with the game. There's just something so satisfying about seeing all those plots of zoning evolve into buildings, and in turn watching those buildings evolve on their own as they get better educated, higher land values, and more customers. I want to see them succeed because I want to see what they look like next!The workshop helps in this endeavor. One of my earlier complaints was that, after a few hours, building after building looked a bit same-y. The workshop introduces entire collections of buildings and downloading a few helps with variety and it's lovely to see.Using mods locks the ability to earn achievements. Practical, due to the infinite money mod available in the base game. However it's annoying in practice since I am treating this game like a sandbox and a toy, so I activate a few mods and then just let the fun fly.Thankfully the fun factor outweighs my need for achievements.Ultimately, it's one of the first Sim games I've been able to succeed at. It's taking me away from some of my other duties on MMO's and the like, and considering playing one MMO is like having a part time job in its own right, this is quite the accomplishment for a quaint 30$ game.

												I've been a big fan of city simulation game since simcity 4 came out, and after dissapointing of recent city simulation games, Cities:Skyline become something that we fans are waiting for, a new benchmark and worthy successor of sim city 4.Cities skyline has massive map, great complexity and details for a city simulation game especially on traffic, i dont even know traffic management can be so frustating yet so challenging However, despite its addictive gameplay cities skyline still have something to improve, it lacks of disasters, day-night cycle and varieties of buildings.it seems so repetitive on building models.Fortunately, community of cities skyline so lively, i spent so many hours just browsing mods in steam workshop, choosing building models, gameplay mods and many more.Finally. Cities:Skyline has so much fun to offer.I think Cities:Skyline is the best city simulation game right now and im impressed when i knew that only 9 people worked on this game, yet it deliver such an astonishing experience, 9/10.

												This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Highs:* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.Lows:* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.Verdict:If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.			"

												Oh boy, this ♥♥♥♥ing game.Cities: Skylines is Sim City. No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don't even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.I don't have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I'm certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they're not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to ""paint"" different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it's difficult to describe. Watching little buildings pop up, filling with residents populating the area is incredible to behold. You can even name every single object in the game, whether it be a building, a citizen, or even some random cougar roaming in the countryside. I took it upon myself to name every High School I built after any American presidents i can think of.I never thought this would happen, but as of 3/16/15 Cities: Skylines is my GOTY of 2015. It's been quite some time when a video game can suck away my time as well as this one. There's always more land to develop, more resources to export, more ways to attempt to fix your horribly congested traffic ♥♥♥♥ups. While the game doesn't do a perfect simulation, as the AI drivers refuse to take up multiple lanes in some instances, the amount of detail is incredible. Everyone wants to go somewhere, and all the cars are traveling with a purpose. It is important to make sure all the needs of your city are met, whether it be water, waste, dead people, sick people, schooling, fires, it really becomes overwhelming really quick. In fact, most of your first attempts at this game will create perpetual hellholes of civilization, tall gloomy buildings stuffed with stinking dead bodies and backed up sewage. However, in my opinion this does only galvanizes you to make your city better, by redirecting traffic and building public transports to lessen the load on commuter roads. Who knew city planning could be so fun?Cities: Skylines isn't perfect, as evidenced by the traffic stingy AI and sometimes confusing circumstances where pressing criteria around the city aren't clear. There aren't any disasters that can hurt your city (other than accidental flooding from a Hydroelectric Dam). However, as seen by the ridiculous amount of mods that have hit the steam workshop a mere few days after release, this may be remedied. You can even create your own landscape using the map editors, and I dread to see what messing around with that will do my free time in the future.If you have any interest in city simulations at all, you need to get this game now. Probably the best one to come out in a long, long time.			"

Best city building game out thereI can‘t really tell for how long i have waited for game like this. I always wanted to build a big city, manage it and what is most important feel that the city is alive. And this game delivers.As in every game you start with nothing. You start building roads and zoning and people starting to move in. They require electricity, water and other services. After you provide people with everything they need the buildings start to level up and grow.  Step by step your little city becomes more beautiful with every year. After a while your city is full of skyscrapers and is busy 24/7. With the „After dark“ update you got the night/day cycles and it looks amazing. You just look at your city every night, it‘s so beautiful. Also you as a mayor can manage your city. Apply various policies to districts, like ban smoking, encourage biking or ban heavy traffic just to name a few. You can set the taxes for your residents and business and set the budgets of city services like garbage collection, electricity, water, public transport and a few dozen more.People in this game are not just pixels moving in random directions. Every person has a name, home and a job. He goes from his home to a job to a commercial district and back home. Every resident is simulated individually. Similar to Tropico series, but Cities skylines has much more to simulate.Of course like every game this one is no exception and has some flaws.The traffic is the most annoying. You will spend a lot of time managing the traffic, building and rebuilding roads. The previous game these developers have done is called Cities in motion and we can see it influenced Cities skylines, because required attention to traffic is a little too much. AI cars are stupid and don‘t know how to use lanes thus causing congestions. Of course every city has congestion problems and stupid drivers exists in real life too. So maybe it‘s not that bad, but anyway it could be better. Some mods can improve the traffic, but they don‘t change much. The game lacks in management aspect. Yes you can manage your city but it lacks depth. It is too simple. I would like to have poor districts with bad education levels, where crime rate is high and police officers get shot often and you could apply some stricter policies over there or just leave them be in anarchy.Graphics in Cities skylines can be very beautiful, especially at night. Sometimes colors are off a bit, but all in all the game looks amazing. But this comes with a price. I get 25-30fps with GTX970 wich is not acceptable, but because it‘s not an action game i can live with that. I could lower some settings but i want my city look good, it‘s not an action game so it‘s playable at 30fps.Developers support modding very much, the game has steam workshop full of mods. I doubt anyone is playing this game without mods. You can download cars, planes, trains, buildings etc. to beautify and diversify your city. Also there‘s color corrections, some gameplay improvement mods and many more.If you like city building and management games this is a must have. And considering the price it‘s worth it even without a sale, you‘ll get hours of playtime from it. Do not expect much on economic side, but all the city building is done almost perfectly.Pros:Lets you build big citiesLooks gorgeosBuilding themes lets you build a different looking city every timeMod supportCons:Lacks depth in managingDumb AI causing traffic problemsPerformance  "

												Cities: Skylines is the best city-builder in recent times. There's no bullcrap always online, you can expand your borders quite far - and they all merge into one map so you don't have a loadingscreen while switching between them. There is also support for a modding community to add to the game.Building a stunning metropolis spanning a huge area is both easy - perhaps a bit too easy, but I expect patches and mods will add some more challenge - and a lot of fun!It's simply everything SimCity should have been, and more.Gameplay:

												If you're reading this, I'm glad you take the time to read reviews before you buy a game. But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).So stop reading this review and buy the game.For those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.1.) One-way-roads and roundabouts2.) Water physics: water pumps, sewage drains, treatment plants, and dams influence water levels3.) Parked cars. Doesn't seem like this should be a new feature in city-builders, but it is. Cars park on the side of the road and in parking spots.4.) Districts and policies: paint districts on certain parts of your city to keep track of things better and issue local policies.5.) Mods galore. The workshop is filled with various mods and the game has an asset and map editor built in.Hopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.UPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:For the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free).

												I had actually started to believe that we were never going to see another great city simulator and then Paradox sprung this on us. Cities: Skylines went back to the simulators that were fun, pulled the best parts of them, and upgraded them to today's standards. It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.Probably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation. But there's a mod that changes that, giving citizens variable length lives.But that's the only real problem with this game. There can be some other gripes made about performance of 100k+ cities and traffic management nightmares, but I've never met a modern simulator that doesn't have those issues. Simply put, if you want a city simulator that's worth the money, you can't go wrong with Cities: Skylines.			"

												I've always liked city builders and this is a god sent after the latest disapointment in certain other series.Graphically it's easy on the eyes but nothing mind blowing. Warm colors.Game is easy to start and if you don't mess up completely in the beginning getting your city up and running shouldn't be an issue. Has hard mode where things are more expensive and you can also start with unlimited money if you just want to build.Big area where you can spread out your fledgling little town and thanks to mod support you can have even more space where to build. You can also make your own assets or download ready ones from Workshop and plenty of different mods are available too. From traffic management to automatically bulldozing abandoned and burned buildings.Dealing with the traffic can be a pain in the posterior sometimes in this game and you should be prepared to deal with it. Enough jams and nothing works. Fire engines get stuck in traffic and fires start burning your place down.There is no disaster system in game currently if that's something you miss and need from Sim City titles.Game runs okay, with larger cities it might start slowing down a bit. Every citizen is simulated where they are coming and going and it takes it toll when you have large enough population.If you're planning on unlocking all the buildable area with mods and your computer isn't quite up to date it's something to keep in mind.There are occasional bugs here and there like ships roaming the country side if you do certain things and traffic not using all the available lanes on a road.Doesn't have always online requirement but you can't build multiple cities and have them work together either.

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder game of your dreams. You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities.  If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life. So the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.The game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is  once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while. 7.5 /10 "

But a lot of it is patched in for free, so I'm not sure exactly what they expect me to pay for?  A snow map?  For $15?I dunno guys.

In cities: Skylines, you get to basically manage your own city. To sum it up, Cities: Skylines is the best city manager simulation I know. Here are some pros and cons of the game.PROS:-Beautiful Graphics-Good concept-Has amazing workshop Mods-Thrill of being able to tax other people (my favorite!)-Easy to learn about-Provides a challenge (in some ways) -Great for players looking for something to do-The new Natural Disasters are amazing-The new DLC Natural disasters lets you bust criminals from a helicopterThese are just some of the pros this game providesCONSEvery game has a downside to it. Here are a few you might want to think about before buying-Some of the in-game challenges such as death care and traffic can be hard to solve, but can be resolved with experience and (LOTS) of patience-Id say a good computer is needed to play this game without lag. This game is playable with lag, but will slightly impact your enjoyment of the game.Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great game. I've been playing this for a while now, and I believe I will continue to do. I look forward to the next update and recommend for players to buy this game.			"

												This is pretty much much improved/fixed version of the latest SimCity, with some pros and cons of its own:Pros:- Maps are much bigger. Each starting city part is already bigger than tiny SimCity maps and you can buy adjacent lands to make it x9 times bigger still.- Smarter traffic controls. Though there are some issues with cars disappearing or turning in the middle of the road or going through each other - at least routing works. You don't have to wait hours for an ambulance or fire truck to reach its point, garbage gets collected, resources get sold.- Paint and fill tools for zoning (finally!).- Road connections can be edited. You are not restricted to just one entry point.- Pipes and power lines are back.- Can move buildings to another spot for a fee.- Fluid mechanics when placing an electric dam.- Overall better UI, city info panels and responsiveness (no fudged data like in SimCity - the number of workers and residents adds up).Cons:- Plopping/building snapping. Unfortunately they added the same damn thing as in SimCity and restricted placing buildings only near roads. This results in a lot of wasted space between road connections and in small spaces. It cannot be switched off either.- No tutorial whatsoever and the hint system doesn't cover everything. Took me a while to realize that my elderly population doesn't work and i have to constantly build new houses like in Banished.- No landscaping tools.- Not enough parks. Most of them are huge so there is really no way to make beautiful city centres unless you are building in squares.- Weather and time of day do not change.- Zoning and placing roads is often a chore since they rarely snap at proper angles... again unless you build in squares.- Annoying sounds and twitteresque replacement of the ""news ticker"" from SimCity.- Biased approach to power plants - they are basically forcing you to be eco friendly since wind turbines are cheaper and more efficient than everything else. This is very unrealistic and unfair in my opinion.- Can't view overlays and build at the same time. Huge oversight since you need to know where to zone industrial for ore and farm placement.- All of the public transportation lines look the same, got same colour (all of the bus lines are the same colour and all of the metro lines too) and are generally hard to create and distinguish.- Lack of building upgrades. This probably was the only good idea from SimCity that should've been copied here.Overall there are quite a few annoyances and issues at the moment but all of them are compensated by the fact that this game is actually fun and doesn't feel like a couped up  tiny sandbox like SimCity.Its definitely better than CitiesXL as well, since it performs and runs smoother, uses more than 1 core, does not appear to have memory leaks and feels generally better made. The only issue i've encountered so far is some sound stuttering.So i can recommend this if you like city building games and were disappointed by every other game in the last few years.			"

												It has a lot to love and some not so much to love.It is one of the best City Sims in years and it can be a blast to play and has lots of mods and no online needed.It also does not look to shabby given the size of the maps.I must admit though due to some issues at times it can just be boring and frustraiting to play and deal with as a full on SIM.The maps are decent size and if you have the pc a mod can make it even bigger.The mods are plenty and quiet a few of them are nice.Depite the poor choice for AI and driving it can still be managed without getting the dreaded wave of death by simply not expanding at a rapid pace and they will not die in waves.I do think they should have invested the resources into other things because frankly the biggest eye sore of the game is the fact that they all pile into one lane.They plan out there trip ahead of time and lack the smarts to change it on the fly.I would have prefered to have simulated traffic on roads that just showed generic traffic as highways are useless since they all tend to use one lane the whole trip.Though all of that i can forgive as no game can be perfect and have all the right things but one thing that should have been in since day one is seperate funding for each service instead you change it for everyone and also forces you to put down way more services then needed.Then forces you to spend twice as much as needed becuase of the lack of sliders to each service building.SimCity 4 had this and that was on single core and how many years ago?So that would have to be my biggest irk of the game the rest i can over look as its managable but i waste way to much money on this issue and still have issues with coverage.Do not get me wrong as pure building sim it is a lot of fun and can be great but as anything more it fails badly at it.The challange is weak, A.I is horrible.The DLC is over priced unless 50% off just not worth it.As i said before if they would have put more into other things then the worthless A.I. driving this game imo could have went from good to fantastic as a simulation.As it stands now trash services is well excuse my pun but it is trash.How you mange death is terrible because of how terrible the driving A.I. isThe management end of the game is not so great due to lack of much depth and the biggest issue other then the driving A.I. screws up trash and other services.The way money is handled and control of each service is terrible because you can not decide which building gets what funding and coverage it is all shared across all services on the whole map.SimCity 4 did way better on the simulation end then this game most likely ever will out of the box.As a city builder this game shines as a simulation its damn near a flatline.ProsNo online needed.Tons of mod support.Huge maps.Bicycle and Bus lanes,Trams with DLCConsPaying for Disasters that even Maxis included for freeTrams need over priced DLCTerrible services on all fronts due to terrible A.I traffic.Busted micromanagementServices budget changes across whole map instead of each buildingNo real challange and day and night seem to have little impact on the economy in fact school seems to run 24/7.In the end it still one the better city sims and i would say buy it if you love building stuff but sadly a pass if you like simulation of running a city SC4 does this a lot better.If only CO would have just took some cues from SC4 and how they did simulation of being a mayor this would be a must buy for all simulation fans regardless if you like to build or manage.

85/100 This new city sim has taken all of the good things from previous sims and builded upon it to create a solid and polished experience with new added features such as a nice water simulation including fluid physics. The sim is a bit on the easy side and for my taste it could have had more micromanagement to keep you busy and challenged, but what is there in the game is all very well done and it offers very enjoyable gameplay. On top of that the performance (unlike other sims) stays excellent even if you have a massive running city.			"

												Easy to learn, easy to master. If you though Sim City was disapointing, and wished it was better, this would be the game they would make. It has so much replay value, and thanks to user created content. It can extent the life of this game for ever. There will most likely be DLC's to come out with it.9/10eNjoy =^-^=			"

												Cities: Skylines feels like a proper successor to the classic SimCity games.  If you grew up on classics like SimCity, SimCity 2000, and SimCity 4, you'll probably feel at home here.  For those not familiar, in this genre you build a city by zoning out commecial, residential, and industrial areas as well as the necessary infrastructure (roads, water, power) and an increasing number of other public goods such as police protection, fire protection, education, etc.  You set tax rates which impact the economy, and try to stay in the black and allow your city to continue to grow.  It's an addictive experience of constant expansion, with another thing you want to build or problem you want to fix always on the horizon and keeping the real-time game version of ""one more turn"" on your lips.  As with most of these games, one of the things you'll spend the most time on besides simply laying out more roads and then laying down zones and support buildings is traffic management, and at this Skylines shines.  The road construction system offers you a wide variety of to configure your roads with different sizes, one-way-vs-two-way, overpasses, etc, and the traffic flow responds to what you build in sensible and complicated ways.  It's a compelling component of the game that can consume hours of your life.  Additional options such as foot paths, bus routes, trains, and subways can also lighten the car traffic in your city.  Skylines also features an intersting ""neighborhood"" system where you can subdivide your city into different sections and set different city ordinances or economic focuses for each one.  While I don't feel that the mechanics of this have as much impact as I might like, just being able to district your city into distinct neighborhoods with their own names helps bring your city into focus and give it more character and specificity.(the Nightlife expansion also adds to this system, but most of my playtime was done before that came out so I'm not reviewing the expansion content, here)  Things I don't lke about the game?  Primarily, it feels too easy.  Even from the start I virtually never drifted into the red, although I would occasionally stall out and need to make some tweaks to keep growing.  This seems like it'd be something that is mod-able, but better difficulty options for veterans of the genre who want a challenge would be nice.  Additionally, as your city develops it seems that older industrial neighborhoods will occassionally suffer mass unemployment for no apparent reason.  The economic specializations you can assign to neighborhoods, in particular, suffer from this doubly and feel like a very short road to a dead end.  The industrial collapse itself is a good thing- an interesting challenge to tackle in a game that generally lets you just keep expanding with ease- but the feedback as to why it happens is poor.  For example, faced with the situation I'd frequently click on the buildings and see that they had no workers.  Thinking that I'd simply educated my populace out of wanting those jobs, I'd try building a school-free slum neighborhood nearby to see if that brought the businesses back, but the businesses remained without workers for no apparent reason.  Also, the in-game twitter-alike is inane and way too chatty, but this is a minor quibble.  Other than these complaints, I could list a score of minor to moderate UI annoyances- the inevitable consequence of playing a bunch of a game- but the only one that really sits heavily in my mind is the dread I'd feel whenever I made significant changes to my subway system.  It's not always clear what happens to existing routes when you make changes and getting a big-picture view of what all of your current routes look like in aggregate can be difficult; a cleaner and color-coded subway route map view would be nice.  All in all, I'd heartily recommend Cities: Skylines as an enjoyable sandbox that can easily consume dozens of hours of your life.			"

												Beautiful Game Cities skylines,it is the best city builder game now i think.I think ıf you look how many hours ı have  played this game you will understand this game is awesome. On Cities:Skylines you choose a map to build your city then you create your own city.You can build the city in your dreams.You can build a canals city,mountain city,European City,Mediterrenian City,Tropical City,Asian City,American City,Soviet City...And ı think the game is better with mods.for example with mods you can just allow construction of baroque buildings or classic American houses,Soviet houses... but you need to download that district styles.You can download thousands of mods but if you download too much mods you need to wait more at downloading screen.for example ı have near 900 mods and ı wait near 5 minutes at first then ı wait near 10-15 minutes when ı'm loading my city.And you can download lots of famous landmarks,buildings...you can download lots of useful buildings,props,shops,bars,train and metro stations,cars,city halls,statues,Mosques,Churcs,Synagouges,parks,roads,tree,hotels... My advices for new update,DLC or next Cities game:-It would be great if peoples will be satsified when there is lots of trees at their neigborhood.-It would be great if peoples need a place to pray to the God.like Mosques,Churcs,Synagougs.(You can download that buildings but they're like landmark.)-Bicycle roads would be great.

												An ice-cube factory was the first building to catch on fire.This game more than meets all the hopes you may have for a new, modernised city builder.The core game is simply fantastic and if you have even the slightest interest, buy it.Steamworks integration is already showing 7500+ cusomised assets such as buildings after only a week of release. I expect the longevity of this title to be infinite thanks to this. The potential is insurmountable.			"

												This won't be a long review. I will say this. If you like city building games and responsive studios, this is the game for you. There are freebees still being added to the game to this day. Little things that you would normally have to purchase in a DLC are given to us. Support from the studio is amazing. The gameplay is amazing. The ability to mod is amazing. The workshop content is amazing. If I had one complaint, it would lane management for traffic. This has been worked on though and is already better than it was just a couple months ago. With that being said, traffic stops being as much of an issue once you understand the mass transit options within the game.Buy the game. It is worth every penny.			"

												Incredibly fun, easy to learn and definitely one of those games you might be playing for years to come. Cities: Skylines is that one city-sim you were waiting for.The modding community is very active and offers a range of improvements, additions and changes to make your cities even better!Some of the pro's and con's:+ Looks very nice, both in high-up view and zoomed all the way down to the pedestrians.+ Public transport works pretty good and will adapt to your radical changes to roads.+ Decent depth without getting too precise; no nagging citizens unless they really need something.+ Gigantic maps to make your dream cities- Garbage can get a little annoying; get some mods to fix this.- Roads will become congested. Perfect planning will be inevitable or your city will come to a breaking halt.- Certain aspects like organically flowing roads will take a toll on your available lots; you have lots of room though so spread out!All in all it's the best city-sim I've played. Definitely worth the money!			"

												Absoultely wonderful game!  I have played over 850 hours.  This is what SimCity 5 should have been.  This game was obviously made by people who love city building and played previous city simulatons.  Everything works right.  Slow initial city loading time but from there all is smooth.   Many ways to play.  Lay out a design for a big city or small town are the fine as they are, or soon grown and eventually join.   Lots to learn to be more efficient.  Can be played casual or challenging. As with real cities traffic congestion and polution soon become a growing problem.  Lots of in game items that are solutions...  But it is very satifying to figure out your own unique designs and solutions.   A big active community of support is another good feature of this game.   I had all my friends by this game they all liked it or loved it as I do.   I highly recommend it.			"

												In my opinion, this picks up the torch from Simcity 4. It is an actual city building game (which doesn't require an internet connection btw) that has pretty much everything I liked about the older games in it, but it also adds in a few fresh mechanics that keep things interesting. The traffic patterning, the modeling of pollution, and the electrical grid I find to be vast improvements over older games mechanically, and I love the water effects as well(I spent a good 5 minutes watching a dam fill up. It was mesmerizing) The only thing that I can gripe about if I get really nitpicky is that you have to plan transit routes and I would like more transport options. However, those could be easily rectified with a mod similar to NAM for simcity 4, and this game is designed to be easily moddable. Other than that, it's a very stable game which isn't terribly resource intensive for your PC. 10/10 would inadvertantly flood the highway leading into town with a dam again.			"

												City Skylines is a 4/5.It's to what most sim games should strive.I'd play it for days,watch my citizens play,if only I could keep them alive.The systems are efficent and clear,Though there may be nothing new here.Zoning and crime,I do it all the time,and it's not hard at first, either.But it gets more complex as the game progresses.And with it comes many stresses.Traffic, dead bodies, and trash,fires can happen in a flash,and then your citizen die by the masses.The infrastructure is often a bother.It's hard to manage the clutter.Need more power, my man?Go build a dam!But, oops, your city's underwater!But that's just how it goes,it'd be boring without all of those!Who wants a town building sim,without some margin,of error, or disaster imposed?So like I said at the beginning,this game is really worth getting.It can be hard at times,managing waste and the crime,but I love it for all its forthcomings.

												This game is what i always wanted in a city builder. From the times of the original Simcity i have been wanting to walk around in my creation. Simcopter made an attempt butit was to far ahead of its time and failed. And now comes allong Cities:Skyline. This game has so much detail you can follow a single person around. He will go to work,chill at a park, play on his tablet in his back yard or on his balconey. And then you zoom out to a City on the scale of mexico city or new york. its enough to get lost for hours at a time. In adition to the amazing vanillla features, the game has full mod support so you can add first person mod,new houses even add tiny props the size of a flower pot. The game itself is extremely robust. i have been downloading random mods giving no thought on compatibility so i can see how the game handles mods. i only started to get problems when i reached page 40 on my mod list. And that stability under mods is the best i have seen in any game. Take Arma 3 for instance. here is a game that was build with modding in mind and that game starts to get game breaking issues once the number of mods break the 20 mod number. This leaves the game open to create your perfect city.dont have a house you want. make it.Put that all together and you have without a doubt in my mind the best city builder game the world has ever seen.

												When writing this I have about 13h of playtime and the ""endgame"" is yet to be experienced, but so far I lack the words to describe the amount of joy this has given me. I always been a big fan och city builders and was a little worried that this one would not live up to my expectations, like some other games in the genre....But boy this one delivers more then I could ever hope for, it's only been out for a few days and it feels extremely well polished and the amount of effort put into the small details is amazing. Probably a quarter of the time I spent in my cities have been just enjoying how it looks and following the citizens around doing what they do. The agent system the citizens are based around works quite good and basically everything can be renamed, from people to buildings.It is also possible to zone different regions in the city and give them individual focuses and different policies wich is an amazing feature that does alot for the immersion, and I would imagine could be awesome for those that likes to recreate irl cities.The tools the game has available for creating roads is really solid to, personally I love to create spaghetti junctions and overly complicated networks that barely work and then try to fix them up. The traffic simulator is working and it feels like it responds to changes in the network quite well. Public transport for the game I have mixed feelings about, you have to manually create lines for busses, trains etc using a similar but less complicated system from Cities in Motion. This has the potential to be something really good but at the same a tedious task, and it makes me wish there were more tools to track groups of citizens travelling paths.I haven't played around with mods and custom assets yet but the built in features seems to be really good and the steam workshop integration allows easy access to other peoples creations, some amazing mods for this is bound to happen.I could write alot more about this but I don't have time... I want to get back to play it again!			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Colossal Order Ltd. Publishers: Paradox Interactive Initial release: March 2015Genre: Simulation, City Builder #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationCities: Skylines is a city builder and economy simulator in the vain of the oh so fallen from grace SimCity. Skylines is essentially a sandbox for you to plan out, build certain amenities and hopefully people will want to move in and make your city thrive. Initially when you first jump into the game it starts with many of the options grayed out and it sort of gates you in this manner as you get used to the basics of building roads and zoning out areas as well as providing electricity, water and sewage treatment facilities. Then, as things unlock such as healthcare facilities and schools, you'll be able to get a better grasp of each system. You'll have access to crime, fire safety reports. As well as noise and actual pollution overlays. Should you desire to “go green” the use of wind turbines are also available as well as a corresponding wind chart for peak efficiency. The game makes use of a relatively humorous but sometimes annoying fake twitter for your citizens to @mention you and tell what you're doing wrong and in rare cases what you are doing right. At least in my experience. You can inact policies like water preservation or power conservation and even things like mandatory smoke alarms in homes. Typically, at the cost of increased upkeep while decreasing use of resources or in this specific case the likelihood of fire even though that's not technically what fire alarms do. This is how the game “gameifies” that sentiment. Anecdotal experience warningThere are weather effects and a day/night cycle. Which led to a moment I don't often have in gaming that was slightly existential. For setup, I was early on in my learning the game and had not really understood how to get things going faster when the first night struck. Without power, without people living in my city, it was entirely pitch black; And I had this rather obvious realization the more I think about it but at the time was borderline transcendental though I'm not fond of the connotations of that word; I was sat there “We really are just floating on a rock out in space”. As though this was not already obvious to everyone. This just seemed like a very odd and probably the least likely of places or style of game for someone to have that thought process. Let alone in a game at all. Anyways, back on pointThe game also features mod and steam workshop support which leads to nearly endless types of buildings and other various ideas that modders can come up with. There is also economy and budget screens to adjust taxes on different districts or different zones. As well as increase or decrease funding of maintenance on city utilities and services. If I had anything bad to say about the game is that it is not always overtly clear how to do something. It requires a lot of tooling around and experimenting.  In a very specific example setting up bus routes is rather ill contrived, at times down right purposely misleading in its functionality. Though a tutorial on proper usage can easily be sought out if need be outside the game. It also features what I'd consider a fairly unique aesthetic. It does indeed have a film grain slider. Which when combined with the depth of field and lighting gives this almost physical model like appeal.  Like it's a table in your basement with your model trains running along it. Zooming in, if you just look down a street it almost feels alive. I want to invoke the powers of Mr. Rodgers here but I fear the reference may be lost among the traffic. THE GISTSuperb city builder that scratches the niche of well done and in-depth simulation that many games seem to miss.Follow my curation for more "

												EDIT: Released new ""Disasters"" DLCs on 11/30/16. I still recommend the game but there currently are a bunch of game-breaking bugs. So hold off purchasing the game for maybe a week or two.EDIT 2: 1/2/17 - Most of the recent game-breaking bugs have been squashed, I re-recommend C:S. Happy 2017!As of 7/12/16 and with 103 hours of playtime, I think I can make a solid review about this game. Long story short, I bought this because the new Sim City was trash, but I was not ready for this game to exceed my expectations.Now for a short review: (SKIP TOWARDS ""I'M TOO LAZY"" IF YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO READ THE FULL REVIEW) Cities: Skylines is a phenomenal city building game, perhaps even better than any of the Sim City games. It is a sandbox game that has an unlimited replay value and will devour hours of your days.  Its laid-back graphic style, realistic audio effects, and relaxing music provide a calm and entertaining game time.  The game unrestrically allows you to build at your own pace while providing a fun challenging experience.While the game is a little tough on beginners (it has very few basic tutorials) it still seems easy to get a hang of. With time, and the Steam community guides, you will become a master of this game and having done so without much frustration, a simple learning curve.Between all of the user created mods, bountiful amount of vanilla game content, and developers amazing DLC, you will undoubtedly enjoy every game session and you will never find the game repetitive.I, without any hesitation, fully recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone interested in purchasing this. Even if you are new to the city building genre, you will appreciate every cent you paid for this game because of what it has to offer.I'M TOO LAZYPros:- Limitless replayability- Abundant game content (including free mods and game DLC)- Steam workshop support- Challenging but funCons:- Larger cities can reduce framerates, even on beefy computers- Difficult for new players (lacks necessary tutorials)- OST unintersting (unlike Sim City 4) and the DLC radio music isn't very goodI'm sure I will have missed some things (both good and bad) worth mentioning so feel free to comment on this review or ask questions in the discussions. The Cities: Skylines community is welcoming and we all help each other.Also, if this review influenced you to buy the game, please comment. I would like to see how many people I helped.Sincerely,BOT Harvey			"

A City Builder / Management Strategy Game

+ Extremely addicting gameplay.  Honestly, this is the type of game you can play all day without getting bored as build a vibrant city. + Easy to learn with very intuitive menues, and features that slowly unlock as your city builds. There really isn't need for any tutorials, you will learn as you play.+ Visually the game looks gorgeous, and it is a delight to go into camera-mode and just watch as your city thrives. You can even see your people as they go about their daily tasks. What is most surprising is the variety of buildings / houses / stores that are built, and they all look great.+ Day / Night Cycle and Weather to add a further sense of emersion.+ Challenging, you have a budget which you have to constantly keep an eye on. Every so often you will have growing pains, where you may suddenly run out of power or water, or perhaps a building will catch on fire, or perhaps the crime rate goes up or you run out of garbage trucks, or maybe a giant traffic jam. You have to be ready to deal with all these issues and more while trying to manage a steady tax rate and keep people from getting unhappy and moving out.+ You can buy addional plots of land and build multiple HUGE thriving cities+ Steam Workshop with a bunch of new buildings and scenerios- The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of pre-build scenerios or ""challenge levels / missions"". The main goal seems to be to just grow as large you possibly can, and then start over.- The road system could be improved a bit. It's a bit difficult to make neat and uniform roads with proper exits. On top of this, building various road types and highways is VERY expensive making it difficult to improve areas with dense congested traffic.Side Note: If you were wondering, Yes this game is far greater than Sim City			"

												This is a great game.And this is a review in progress.---- 5 hours mark ----My main reasons for recommendation are:1. It's built upon existing knowledge from SimCity series: developer (Colossal Order) takes account of both success and failure of SimCity.2. One can see what future improvement to this game entails: good modding support gives developer better insight into what players want.3. A new era for city-building game. Cities Skylines isn't perfect (eg. rough UI, lack of goals, confusing public transport, rudimentary map editor, missing your favorite type of roads, etc etc), but it shows us what's achievable, with SimCity series back on hiatus, Cities Skylines is the new standard.The future for Cities Skylines is bright, will add more comments as I play.

												This is pretty much all I wanted in a city sim since I put down Sim City 4.I'm a bit of a dinosaur in that I still prefer the isometric pixel art of yore, and Cities: Skylines has a more ""clean/cartoon"" art style than I'd like. But apart from that, it pretty much gets everything right. The UI is easy, functional, and still manages to be deep. Systems seem both complex and accessible.I've enjoyed it for hours out of the box, I'm looking forward to player mods, and the future expansions and add-ons. I think this one's a long-term keeper!

												The good: - Ridiculously large amount of workshop content, adding more things to build, ways to customize and other things- Great building mechanics- Simple to use yet very useful UI- Enormous world size - several times that of any other games- Huge amount of things to customize and ways to customize them- Regular updates and plenty of support- Great amount of ways to affect the city without building, eg. managing economy (it's essential and mildly complex but easy to work with when you get used to it)- Good graphics (or, better than most games of the same type)Negatives:- If you build a big city, you're going to have difficulty with FPS as the traffic and people will butcher your PC (however powerful!) That said, as long as you don't zoom too far into the rodas, you can maintain a steady FPS with most mid-range PC's.Absolutely recommend this game as the best City Builder ever made.			"

												This game is what I wanted. This game is what I needed. This game is what SimCity should have been, it is a perfect sequel to SimCity; it's what all of us weirdos that love citybuilders have been begging for. This game is like cocaine, it is a drug to me now...I can't stop playing this game.This game takes city builders, then somehow manages to add a whole layer of depth beyond what I thought was possible. The extra policies, districts, industrial zone types, and various other features come together so perfectly, I honestly am in constant shock how everything ebbs and flows so well in an orchestra of harmony. This game is completely bug free (so far), has the production value of a AAA studio, beautiful music, pretty graphics, mod support, extremely well optimized, and water physics (for awesome some reason).I have not played a game I thoroughly enjoyed in probably 2 years; until this game came along. I am so happy I finally have a game I can enjoy once again. Thank you Paradox, thank you.Seriously, if you love citybuilders or strategy games, GET THIS. "

												So I say to myself, why write a review, when I can fake quotes from other people?""Game is credit to team!"" ~ TF2 Heavy""This is our land!"" ~ CS:GO T""I did not have relations with that dev"" ~ Clinton... yeah, maybe not.By now you've probably seen other reviews saying that Cities: Skylines beats the pants of the comparitive SimCity and the Cities XL / XXL. So I won't rehash that.What I like about Cities: Skylines It's relaxed There are a huge number of community content additions to the game Roads, zoning, sevices etc are all easy to apply (there is a learning curve) Since I've owned the game, there have still been official updates & content additions June 2016 saw a small free DLC pack Expansion of territory is simple Apart from the stock unlimited money mod, you can get a first person one too, allowing you to wander about You can rename anything. Everything has default names, but you can rename people, dogs, areas, housing etcWhat I don't like about Cities: SkylinesI have tried to think of counter points to the above, something negative, but I can't really name any. There are a few missteps I made in my first few games - such as planning / designing areas in a tightly aranged format, preventing easy upgrades to roads. But that's part of the learning curve I mentioned above. There's really been nothing bad about the game at all. There has been one oddity / amusing gaff: a road twisting when elevated, cornering too tightly, and positioned too close to last point - but that's the only thing.One thing I would like to suggest to the devs, is to make the single-instance trees to have more of an effect (an effect?) on noise pollution.Gameplay Note: You may be tempted to build all up on your high way access. Don't. You will rue the day you did that. Think space. You don't need to cram things in.			"

Second, the community is very strong. Wish there was something in the game? There is probably a mod to cover you. Third, just 5 more minutes. OK, five more.

(building, road with traffic light, car, and manny more)-we can build a big city (with help from mod)-the gameplay is really simple, and without bug (i never have a problem with bug until now without additional mod)-we can adds mods, or texture and etc, from workshop for your city. (so manny we can choose it and its make more fun)dislike :-the gameplay is simple, because that we really need a mods to make more fun-some a mod, is not conformable with other mod (its not worked)-no night time in the game (its so sad to know this, i wish the development to update night time)until now, its so fun to play this game. i recommended to you buy, its really worth, just 17$			"

												I absolutely LOVE this game.  I'm an old SimCity player who killed hundreds of hours back in the day playing SC before it was ruined by EA.  Cities: Skylines is the game I've been waiting for for a decade!  It's been a joy learning to play it, developing my city building strategies, and building MY city.The icing on the cake for me, is when I'm waiting for my budget to generate enough money to implement my next improvement or build, I can pick out a citizen, and follow them around.  Doing this gives me insight into how I can make my city a better place for that citizen to live in...whether it's improving the transit system, putting in some commercial zones closer to their house, etc.  Being able to see real citizens going about their day to day tasks from cradle to grave is amazing.I bought this game based on the early positive reviews I read, and I have nothing but praise to add to them.  I won't be surprised if this ends up as GOTY...no doubt it will be a nominee.  I haven't been this excited about a simulation in a LONG time!			"

Steam workshop is brimming with interesting additions to your city. You, yourself, can alter the appearance of any building to your tastes. You can truly build anything to match your imagination.My only gripe is the fact my save files and ultimately my mega city errored and I lost that.

												Traffic Simulator 2015. OCD Simulator 2015. Ambulance Simulator 2015. Trash Piling Up Simulator 2015. Loan Simulator 2015. Still a better love story than SimCity.No, but really. This game IS GREAT, I however suck at it which should in no means deter anyone from buying it. My roads suck, I can't make an circular roundabout ramp to save my life, I named one of my districts ""Trash Town"" because all they ever do is complain about how their trash is piling up even though I BUILT 5 ♥♥♥♥IN INCINERATORS NEXT TO THEM.  But, I still have a ton of fun ♥♥♥♥ing up my city. I never will second guess my decision to not become a city planner. Whether you are an OCD architect king or your town turns into a traffic filled, trash overflowing mess like my town, it's guaranteed that this game will keep you endless entertained and inspired to make your town not suck as much♥♥♥♥♥little by little for endless amounts of time.I am soooo thankful for day 1 workshop in this game, people have already generated game changings mods, worlds, buildings, and most of all pre made intersections (thank you cities skylines baby jesus)Everyone keeps asking ""IS IT BETTER THAN SIMS CITY?!"" and YES. IT IS. I played the newest version of SimCity a day before release to kind of compare it to before I played this one.. The controls are so much more difficult to learn and understand, it feels clunkier and messier and in general like you have less to do and less control of the game. I am so impressed with the simplicity, beauty, and user friendly format that cities skylines has to offer.It has already showed to be immensely popular to both play and watch others build masterpieces or piles of dirt on twitch. Something about this game is just so freakin' good.For a $30 price tag, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has any interest in building or simulation games. You will love this game!! 10/10 :)			"

												When I was a child, I had a dog growing up. She was a golden retriever named Sparkey and she was the best damn dog a kid could ever have. Was she perfect? No. She would seek out and consume cat poop and begged at the table when we tried to have dinner, but I didn't care. She was an awesome dog and I spent hours playing with her. Near the end of her life, her liver shut down. She started to♥♥♥♥♥♥and puke in the house, and even started to snap at me; she was in a lot of pain. In the end the vet suggested we put her down. It was a sad day. I had lost a best friend that I had for years, but it was for the best. Later we got a new dog. A Yellow Lab/German Shepard mix named Milo. Milo was not Sparky, but he is still an awesome dog. Playful, good with kids, cutely vocal and a big lump who's good for hugging. He isn't perfect either, he sheds like crazy, but that doesn't make him a bad dog. Why did I ramble on about dogs? The Sim City Franchise is Sparkey, with 5imCity 2013 being her post liver-failure. A game series I remember fondly as the stuff of my childhood, willfully editing out what happened at the very end. Cities: Skylines is Milo. A new dog, a different dog, but an awesome dog. If you are a fan of city building games at all, you are going to want to pick this game up right now. It is only $30 AT LAUNCH. That is not a sale price, that is the full undiscounted price and it is worth double that (which, by the way, is what 5imCity 2013 cost at launch). It is stable and fun out of the box and with adamant mod support and a dev team that is actively listening to the community feedback, it will get even better.  "

												This is what i would call the ""cream-of-the-crop"" city simulation building game. Coming from the SimCity series, i must say i was truly impressed by the openess of this game. The mods. The supports. The game itself. My tears has been wiped dry. For SGD55 it has given me countless hours in trying to replicate a seamless city. 378 hours and still counting. Truly amazing. With that said, the king ""SimCity"" has ben dethroned. This is the new king! The new benchmark in city simulation. The new yardstick!!! Ps - I've read some negative reviews about this game. No doubt there are some bugs and issues that need sorted out by the devs. No game is perfect. Give it time and it will be the best city builder game by far. Another major complain was that this game focus is more towards modding. As a city builder game you want variety of buildings, roadways, vehicle and etc. And that is where the modding community shines. It adds flavour to the game. I'm sure you will get bored of the plain 'ol vanilla building made by the devs sooner or later. And when i scrolled through the bad reviews something caught my attention. I'd say 80% of them have raked up on average of 30 hours on the game. That's just not fair. Each to their own then.			"

												Only one word:  AWESOME I own the game for 1.5 years now and I'm still not tired of it. There are  TONS and TONS  of mods and assets you can download on the workshop.  If the game is on sale:   and you love simcity and haven't bought this game,  buy it. It is worth  every  penny! :)  If the game isn't on sale:   and you love simcity and haven't bought this game, buy it. It is worth  every  penny! :)   or wait for a sale :D  I'do only think there needs to be a transportation DLC which needs to include: cargo planes with big terminals etc., ferries, more in depth transportation options, more vehicles, more roads, etc.then it will be even more awesme! :-)  EDIT:  mass transit is coming!

												Well this game is a strange one. To sum it up: If you only want to design a nice looking city you'll probably like this game. But if you want to build a city and to deal with challenging problems in this city you'll probably be bored very soon, because the game mechanics are too simple and not challenging at all. In my point of view this is mainly caused by the following issues: Traffic: Probably the only challenging problem within your city. It's ok or even a little bit too low within downtown but much too high in industrial districts. Furthermore traffic jams are often caused by the stupid AI. You'll spend much time optimizing it by building additional roads, railroads, bus lines and so on. But then again - there are almost no penalities for having a bad traffic system. Only if the traffic becomes too bad growables won't get enough resources, which again causes your citizens to abandon them. Pollution: It has only a range of one or two blocks around your industrial areas. You only may not build residentals in this area. If you do so you'll never have any problems with pollution in your city. Energy: You can build several different powerplants. Which ones you'll choose is almost completely irrelevant and just a matter of MW per $. For example: There aren't any calms, so it isn't risky powering your city with only wind energy. Coal energy generates much pollution, but then again pollution only has a range of one or two blocks. . . . . . City-Services (Crime/ Fire/ Health/ Education/ Deathcare/ Leisure/ Garbage): Just build one of these buildings here and there and your growables will be all happy. There's almost no need for a clever placement of those buildings. Growables: Achieving the highest levels for all of your growables is easy, because the level mainly depends on the amount of city services, which are in the neighborhood of this building.  Tourism: It is still completely broken. You cannot focus on tourism, because there are never enough tourists visiting your city. Resource chain and industrial production: They are also very simple. Basic resources (oil, food, ore) are transformed into general goods which are transported to your commercials and then bought by your citizens. You cannot specialize into anything, like car industry or hightech industry, here.Zoning: You almost don't need any strategy for placing your zones well or choosing a good ratio. Just avoid building too much industrials because of the traffic jams and your city probably will be fine. There's almost no variety like ways of specialization here. So appending new blocks to your city becomes pretty boring after a while. Income: You will never know how well your city works, since this game automatically tries to adjust the tax income of your growables, so that your total net income is somewhere between 10 000 $ or 20 000 $. This adjustment only fails if your expenses are much too high. Disasters: Not really available in this game. There are just fires. They don't even spread and only destroy a single building if the fire fighters don't arrive fast enough.I could still continue with this list for a while. But at least in my view the above mentioned flaws within the game mechanics are the most important ones. So I'll stop here. There are also some minor issues with the graphics (scales of growables are wrong) and with the GUI (placing roads and bus lines often becomes tedious). But I could easily forgive those issues if the basic game mechanics were better.			"

My Opinion of Cities: SkylinesCities: Skylines is simply an amazing city building game. I remember playing Sims City 4 Deluxe Edition and thinking of how good it was, this game may have surpassed it's greatness. This game released a little over two years after the disaster that was Sims City 5. Picture everything wrong with that game, then think of the exact opposite and you have Cities: Skylines.    Pros- Very good graphics.- The little details (building signs, people biking, store fronts, etc).- Few repetitive buildings in close proximity, looks more realistic. - The traffic system (yes, it has some positives but I'll address the negatives in the cons below).- Day/Night cycle, it almost seems to change the whole look of your city. - Well optimized. - Frequent updates and patches. - Water physics. Cons- Traffic will stay in one lane even if it is a 6 lane highway. What is the point of having different road types if your citizens use one lane? It is not a deal breaker for this game, but it does pull you out of the fantastic city environment Paradox Interactive worked so hard to make. - Maybe 2-3 crashes within my small time played. It's not really an issue but I thought I would list it.  My Verdict: 7/10 (If the issues with the traffic are fixed it is easily a 8/10)			"

												Cities: Skylines.... Where do I start. I have played this game for what does it say, 18 hours or something like that? I dont even know anymore. The reason I do not know anymore is because when you start playing Skylines hours in real life seem to just disappear. You can start for the first time at 8 pm and not even realize it is now well past midnight.You start your city with nothing but an in an out road. Maybe a Train track. You build, you develop neighborhoods, commercial areas, and industrial areas just like in all the SimCity games. Eventually you get enough people to buy an expansion slot which allows you to make your city bigger, and bigger and bigger until eventually you have this huge map that seems like there is no end to it. The only grip I would say I have about this game is that there is a max amount of expansion slots you can buy for your city. Which I guess is alright, but it would be nice if you could just keep going and going. Then again I dont know how well that would work or even if you could keep up with maintaining the whole city from Burned Down buildings or abandonded buildings, or making sure there are enough Cemetarys in your city to go an pick up all the dead bodies each day. Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yeah.			"

Posted: March 10, 2015
												[Disclosure: This was reviewed due to a review copy provided by Paradox]After 2013’s debacle that was Sim City it was time some new devs stepped to the table. Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!Cities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.When you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn’t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.Along with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.That being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it’ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it’ll be something some people will complain about.One other complaint, and maybe it is something I’m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don’t like the way zones sit for  “squares” off the road for each road you make. I’m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn’t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.Now this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn’t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.The sound isn’t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.Overall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine.  This is a must in my opinion for anyone that was looking for the next good city builder especially those that like to play in offline mode.Review with screenshots: http://fg-2.com/2015/03/10/review-cities-skylines/ "

												The best city builder that we can play currently. It is relatively easy but it has all the features we need to be satisfied. It has modding support and you can create different maps and assets in the editor. Its one of those games where you start playing and then turn around and realize you have no idea how much time has passed.Definitely recommend it to everyone who wants to be a mayor.My gameplay and tutorial videos for the game can be seen below:

												The city builder we need and deserve after all these years and especially after the crime that was the last Sim City. It's a bit rough around a few courners, but basically a fully functional game with a lot of fun. Collossal Order stated that they're going to support the game like Paradox does with Crusader Kings II. I am looking forward to play this game and seeing the developers and modders build on the solid foundations. Sim City is dead, long live Skylines!			"

												Yeah it's a bit late for a review - but I'm glad I'm writing one now as had I written it at release it would have been full of praise as a must buy game...Thing is, almost a year later this game still has a ton of irritating bugs that you absolutely must install mods for. I could deal with that - except the mods are poorly supported and very frequently break with patches leaving you with useless save games.I could even deal with that - if the patches that  the developer was putting out were fixing major issues. Thing is..they haven't. CO seems to have forgotten about the many annoyances of this game and been happy to let the modding community sort them out.Unfortunately it seems that many of the issues that this game suffers from just have not been adequately addressed by mods. Traffic is a complete nightmare with the AI behaving oddly and as such designing a high density city is incredibly tedious as you will spend 99% of your time fighting with traffic.Ok - fine, we can say that the traffic is the core challenge of skylines as really beyond that the game is trivially simple - but even that turns into hours of frustration as the tools you have for building roads are amazingly clunky. Some of the most popular mods are ways of disabling pillars, road intersection angle limitations and slope limitations for roads - but even those mods are tedious to use as you have a very clunky interface for building roads and no built in teraforming tools. The mods that do exist are clunky to use or result in incredibly ugly and unrealistic looking roads.These are all issues that have been listed from day one - so where are we a year later? Same place of course! CO has released a pair of unimpressive DLCs which are mostly cosmetic and at times annoying. After Dark does not add much except tunnels that is of any use and the night mode is just another layer of frustration as building at night is difficult - unless you get that mod that lights up your mouse cursor. Snowfall adds trams which are basically expensive buses with no other advantages that I can see - there is effectively no real reason to use them besides aesthetics as metro and buses get the job done better and easier.  Heated pipes offer little change in the game.So here we are - a year later and the game still feels like it needs ~30 essential mods to enjoy and even that enjoyment is basically fighting with the road building system for 2 hours to build a single good looking and working highway off-ramp.I really want to love this game but every single time I play it I feel more drained and frustrated by it than my day job.

												I was always interested in city building games, even if only on the level of mapping the streets and zoning.After the infamous flop of SimCity 2013, Cities Skylines just appeared out of the blue to take over most of the internet, as one of the most comprehensive and high quality modern city simulators around.Thanks to the After Dark update, the game looks positively gorgeous. Sure, the models and textures are quite poor up close, but the game wasn't designed to be viewed from a pedestrian's perspective, despite the (admittedly awesome) first person mods. But simply looking towards the horizon, above your city, it's magical.The music is cheerful - repetitive a bit, but cheerful and fits the bustling city atmosphere. Chirper starts off as a nice way to learn from your citizens how your city's faring, then becomes grating with the same tweets being given off about cats rescued by fire detectors, or how nice a place the city is. The rest of the sounds nail the busy metropolis theme.Gameplay is stellar, and very, very strategic. You lay down roads of various widths, then zone out areas for either residential, commercial or industrial buildings. Put down a coal plant, or several wind turbines, and deliver power to the masses. Set up the water pumping station and the sewage dumps - but be careful not to leave sewage upstream of the pumping station. Lay down services, such as medical clinics, fire stations, police stations, landfills and so on, and make sure they get as much coverage as possible. Create leisure zones, parks and other attractions, reduce noise and pollution, and allow for decent public services, to improve land value and level up buildings. Expand as your city does.The degree of simulation is such that you can follow individual ""cims"" walking out of their house, to their car, driving through junctions (and maybe getting caught in the infamous jams), reach their workplace or education facility, spend some time there, then return home. Every single citizen has a little schedule to follow. The water, which you can channel through a dam to power your city, is fully simulated, and badly placed dams and waterfront protection can cause flooding, which is not exactly good for your city. Traffic is the player's biggest threat - if you don't plan way, way ahead what you're doing, you are going to grind your city to a halt.The modding community is fantastic, providing addons ranging from highway interchanges and junction types, to new buildings, to enhanced AI logic, simulation, traffic actions and so on.It is a huge rush wildly flailing in panic at the sight of multiple problems occuring across the city, almost entirely due to poor traffic flow, and so is the relief that comes after successfully dealing with said situation.I really like this game. You ought to play it.			"

												First of all, I had very high expectations, and that's never a good thing. Secondly, I played SimCity 4: Rush Hour until today.Now I don't have to, because I have Cities: Skylines, which is truly a successor of it.PROs:- Road-engineering is really next-gen!- The graphics/physics are not just good, but feature cool/cute details too (for example, when a truck ramps on a highway, it bounces a bit)- I love the water/wind simulation (besides it is just a very small part of the game)- People-based simulation is fascinating, and even over 40.000 population the game runs perfectly- The different map layers look good, and are useful - The game is almost bug-free on day one! (Hello EA, I am waving at you)- Map size is small at the beginning, but can be expanded later, at the end is somewhat the same size as the 4x4 in SimCity 4, which is huge (EA? Are you still here?)- Mod and custom asset support!CONs:- It is hard and easy at the same time. Let me explain: to make a perfect traffic in a big city is almost impossible, if you don't want to destroy everything and make your city a big highway intersection (which I am not a fan of). On the other hand, keeping everything in terrible traffic have no consequences at all! I think this is bad, because the game doesn't reward you if you make a good traffic. I have just watched a stream when a guy used only dirty roads in his city over 40.000 pop, and the city worked perfectly. In SimCity 4, when you do this, people moves out of their homes, because the commute time is so high, and so the offices/commercial/industry will fall too. I really hope they will fix this.- The public transportation has some issues too. According to my experiences, only buses can be operated profitable. Also, train traffic is ridiculous: even a metropolis should have less train-traffic, and most of them operate nearly empty (10/240 passengers or so).- I am not a big fan of working cities with only skyscapers. In SimCity 4, when you zone high density residential, but people feel they don't want to live in a mega-block, they will build some low-dense housing instead. Like in a normal city. Here, you zone high-everything, and they just build a Manhattan in the middle of nothing. But overall this is a great game, and I highly recommend it! Also, I am quite sure they will fix all the bugs and consider changing some of the cons I mentioned. Happy gaming!			"

												Even though this is a negative review, it comes with a caveat. I want challenge and simulation out of a strategy or management game, and Cities: Skylines does not provide that. If you like just building a nice city then you'll love Cities: SkylinesSort of like Planet Coaster, Cities is basically just a map painter. You can't literally do whatever you want but you would be hard-pressed to come up against any challenge beyond screwing up traffic configurations. You'll never run out of money and never run up against a fail state that you either didn't bring upon yourself on purpose or that you didn't see coming a mile away.I'm really disappointed in this title. Lots of people love it so I'm assuming that I made a mistake in not reading into the game enough before purchasing it. However, I just want to warn anyone who is looking for a good challenge to stay away.			"

												Just buy it (on sale if you're not sure)... So much talent and passion behind this game.  The technical complexity of the simulation is amazing, the pricing is perfectly on point.  Checkout the workshop and have your mind blown.The DLC in my opinion is a way for the developers to reward themselves further of the blood, sweat, and tears they pour into this game.  People often forget that when a DLC comes out, the base game receives free huge content updates and back-end fixes, extended mod support, etc.   The DLC often go on sale as well just like the base game.  You may have paid $60 for SimCity 5 for a water-downed simulation/pretty game.. So far I've spent ~$30 total with all DLCs and this game has added more enjoyment than all city sims before it combined..  I've been playing since Simcity Classic and SimCity 2000!  ♥♥♥♥ I'm getting old.			"

I really hate that, and it really bugs me, but the game is worth it:0  Well I do hate 1 more thing about this....

And although mods seem to be very supported and loved by the community, I can say that this game is not only fun but also very addictive and entertaining, even without any mod. I happily built my first two cities and looking forward for the third and fourth. Maybe I'll take a look into the mods afterwards as well, but really - you can play this game without those.Definately recommended game, this is what Sim City should have been.			"

Cities: Skylines is the ultimate city builder! New roads, buildings, utilities and transportation systems. Check your traffic congestion and pollution. Build oil wells and mining facilities. Amazing graphics. A game that is finally better than SimCity 4. :DThe DLC isn't a must buy, but you will be missing out on the night cycle and the changing of seasons :P.

After 10 hoursThis has been a very pleasant city simulator so far in big part due to the user-friendly user interface and mechanics. The city is a joy to build, prod and tweak and you only need a few keys and your mouse buttons. While many good lessons have been learned from mobile gaming (simple menu structures, addictive feedback FX, hint stream, etc.), the game offers a good amount of depth, freedom and player challenge. The city will grow automatically but not run itself and will certainly need a strategist and grand architect. The player's role is as it should be: balancing, optimising and developing the city, not monitoring every last building and citizen, yet you still can if you want to! Speaking of, the citizens behave in a consistent and logical manner (if not an entirely rational one, but that is arguably good simulation!), making the city feel alive and controllable.tl;dr - Fun to play, full mechanics, satisfies tweakers, AI is good.The Steam Workshop support brings a massive boost to the content just weeks after release: if you struggle with building intersections like I do, there are dozens, even hundreds of ready-made and user-tested Workshop ones available! No more eternal gridlock! There are also buildings, decorations and all sorts of stuff if the basic selection gets too repetitive. The default selection is nicely finished and has a good level of detail.tl;dr - Steam Workshop provides ideas, help and variety.The only negatives so far are the pretty limited soundtrack, not enough variety in Chirper messages, no road ruler (grid), and the Steam Workshop items are missing their thumbnails. These are minor inconveniences so far and two can be circumvented; play your own music and keep a manageable number of content installed so you know what is what. The roads do snap straight, but sometimes it is not clear when they do, and different angles are hard to produce accurately.All in all a great experience so far, and I haven't seen half the content yet!PS. Compared to SimCity? Better flow, nicer UI mechanics, less obtuse, better mod and community support - and no EA/Origin! There is a Paradox account you can register, but it is not mandatory. I don't know how the performance will be once my city reaches beyond two map squares, but so far there have been no slowdowns or glitches.After 24 hoursStill going strong; the game has switched focus from pure growth to efficiency and large-scale management. I still get to build simple and fun new places (these maps feel pretty huge), but the core of the city is now an optimiser's dream. Education, roadworks and public transit are a real balancing act.I still can't get enough even after failing two cities miserably - they just feel like learning experiences. My main city is a place I constantly want to go back to and build and improve.The engine shows no signs of slowing down or glitching even with four (or was it five) map squares built, and game load times are fantastic. No real bugs or glitches in sight, everything Just Works. Except Tweeter; that thing is really starting to annoy me, because it has no relevance or variety anymore.Still very much Recommended.			"

 Over 300 hours enough said ALL PROBLEMS I LIST ARE FIXED BY MODS  Nighttime is nice. But the speciality of areas to section into your city seem lacking. However my biggest issue is no shock here. Taxis. I thought the taxis would work like buses jut spawning the needed amount for the area or route. Nope Taxis are a limited number. Making them nothing but flash for your roads and never making the expense money back. It seems that with more they add to the game the more the games traffic isses become more bothersome. Yes I can fix it with mods. However, I say I shouldnt have to. Because this game was made by the same dev that made City in motion. So clearly they have an understanding of what a city needs to run. However, they seem to have cut that out in this as in transport that has diffrent type of mass transport and effectivness in this game. The game seems to be designed for a road/highway based city. And any other methods bedamed. Which I personally find very not upset just wishing it was better. Tunnels add a new useful way to manage roads/highways. However the tunnels are not labeled so over time underground ends up looking like the L.A. freeways system but underground.Further there is not enough detailed information. Industry will complain about not having enough resources. However there is no way to just add the import costs to the city expenses. Which is very confusing because there are city view overlays that show trucks driving to industry with imports. It seems that over time the industries are not able to order more imports. This problem also effects office/commercial these sectors also lose the ability to get the goods needed to function. Moreover, If you connect industry to office/comm industry for a time sends the needed goods to the formerly mentioned sectors. Alas the mentioned issues mean that after a time the problems kick in so massive amounts of these sectors are abandoned. So you will have to delete large sections of those sectors. Moving on to transport it works by placing lines in the path you want it to go and press the  line to place the stop. That is how the game explains it to you however that it is very messy to place many lines on bus and trains/subway. Traffic is another big problem. And can not be fixed without placing messy lines of highway making your city look like the L.A. freeway system. Oh and the cars on the highway drive like♥♥♥♥♥♥cutting each other off and slowing down the other cars in the lanes. No matter how many subways or buses or trains I place in hotspots. People still use their cars. After playing the game for another 100+ hours my traffic controling skills are better so after about 90,000 people in my city THEN the trafic goes to poop. However this game is not marketed as a grand city builder just a basic one. So it shouldnt have taken me and extra 100 hours to get a handle on the traffic and mass transport. Moding is highly easy for this game I still find myself using very little ""big"" mods other than road intersections and what not because heavy mods make my game crash.   ALL PROBLEMS i LISTED ARE FIXED BY MODS, STILL BETTER THAN SIMCITY5 !!! "

												Setup a ""Recreational Use"" drug policy on my residential district. Best. Game. Ever.In all seriousness though, this game is a great city builder. Better than Sim City 2013 and much better than the last two Cities XL games. There is mod support right away, you can expand your city to be much much larger, the gameplay is fun, it handles well, runs well and its a blast to play. Sure the art design could be better (seems like a cheap sc 2013 style art design), sure I miss the night and day cycle from SC and there are some bugs with drivers ai and some other stuff but overall those pale compared to all the things this game does right. Want to create a big gigantic city? You have come to the right game!Get your hands on this wonderfully crafted game and you won't be dissapointed. There is alot of options for customization, I can see hundreds of hours being spent on this game down the road, well done devs! Two big thumbs up from me, as this is the most fun I have had building stuff in a videogame since Simcity 4 and the last Anno game. This is a wonderful base game as is and for the future, I can see mods and expansion packs adding more and more down the road to.			"

												This is the city builder people wanted back in 2013. Not to be confused with the Cities XL series, this game is done by the same people who did Cities In Motion. I finally have a good city builder to play other than SimCity 4.- In depth traffic simulation/planning. You can build your own interchanges/intersections/pretty much anything from scratch, and the AI will realistically follow it.- Mod support (Steam Workshop enabled too). The developers even endorse modding. Does EA even know what modding is anymore?- NO DRM! Yes yes, I know, SimCity doesnt need to always be online anymore. But this game has no DRM other than the cd key you get on Steam.- HUGE maps. You start with a small plot of land, but are able to purchase neighboring plots as your city grows. This means you can have a sprawling metropolis with multiple town centers/airports/highway systems.- The ability to divide your city in to separate districs, each able to have their own policies/taxes.If you are on the fence about this game, definitely go for it. For only $30 at release, it is an excellent price for a game that will keep you entertained for a long, long time. "

												Less than 2 weeks I have owned Skylines, already 50+ hours of fun building, already I've hit that nirvana of losing time as I tinker with some piece of my city. There are not the proper words to express how much this game blows the most recent iteration of SimCity out of the water. I know I'll easy log 500+ hours on this game over the next year - and for $30! I would've felt it well-purchased at $50.The road building tools actually function, the pathfinding isn't stupid, the city size is larger than I've needed so far, and the tools to micro-manage exist without requiring use.Value, fun, and only the beginning.

												My first week I was very into Cities:Skylines. But then I quickly realized this game is not a city sim or even city builder/designer game. No, its pure traffic sim. You will lose yourself for hours trying to fix the idiotic AI that is Cities:Skylines traffic. Drivers will only drive in the center lane near an exit ramp. This creates chaos. They will come to a dead stop with two other clear lanes but no one will drive in the other lanes. I'm convinced this is not by design, but a bug due to poor AI. Why have six lanes or a three lane highway if the sims are not going to utilize the lanes during heavy traffic. Also, a town of 50,000 is not going to have enough population or demand to clog up a 3 lane one way highway(total of six lanes), let alone the 2 connecting highways on my map, and then a third highway I built.To add to this chaos, garbage collectors, cops, firemen, hearst drivers, etc, do not stay in their own area. They will abandon their area and go clog your highways while your citizens near the service home suffer. There is no AI to make them only stay in their area. Even if you have every area covered they will still go across your map.The only challenge to this game is making an entire city with no traffic stops - nothing else is a challenge. Even with well executed roundabouts you're still going to have extreme highway challenges that all orginate from 1) too much traffic being spawned despite a low population, 2) poor AI because sims do not utilize highways correctly. At first, I found it fun to try and beat the traffic, until I realize I've spent hours on it, and have noticed the sims erratic, pointless driving. Its just poor AI. I'm sure there are other traffic sims that have proper AI, not that I even wanted a traffic sim, I was hoping for a city builder/designer. So, unless you want a frustrating traffic sim game, with a bity of city builder thrown in I would say only get this if its on sale. And do not bother with the overpriced DLC. If they fix the traffic AI, then it'd be a fun little game.Also, another unrealistic aspect is you can follow a car, and in good traffic it will take this car days to reach its destination. In bad traffic it will take weeks... C'mon. Regardless, just a poor traffic sim game.			"

												Much as I prefer to let each game stand on its own, certain games demand comparisons. In the case of Cities: Skylines, developer Colossal Order has overtly modeled its game after SimCity – not just the fundamental concept and methods of building and maintaining a simulated city from the ground up, but much of the look and feel as well. And on almost every count, Skylines compares very favorably to the former standard-bearer of the city-building genre. It is, in fact, the best of its kind to come along in a full decade – a powerful, flexible, beautiful, and all-around impressive simulation that lets you build sprawling, single-player metropolises to your heart’s content. Building has to be its own reward, though, because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative.Playing as part mayor, part god-king with the power to arbitrarily bulldoze your simulated citizens’ dreams and create schools with a click, building a city from scratch is mostly conventional: lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools, designate zones for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, provide utility services, reap the tax boon, then repeat the cycle with new stuff that’s been unlocked by your growing population hitting new milestones. Skylines finds a mostly happy medium between the complexity of SimCity 4 and the relative simplicity of SimCity 2013 by automatically attaching zoneable areas to roads as they’re laid, but still holding onto obligatory busywork like laying water pipes. Those basics are all tried and true - you couldn’t have a city-builder without them - so it’s mandatory that they be done well. Cities: Skylines does that.The first way this sim knocks it out of the park is in its scale. Each game begins as deceptively small, constricting you to a four-square-kilometer area (the same size as a SimCity map, entirely by coincidence I’m sure), but quickly allows you to buy access to an adjacent plot of land of equivalent size. Then it does this seven more times, for a total possible area of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there’s plenty of room. And while you can’t directly edit terrain while you play, there’s an included map editor where you can create any land mass you choose before you jump in - or download one from the prominently integrated Steam Workshop mod support.With such large cities, it’s fantastic that Skylines allows you to define and regulate areas individually. Simply paint a chunk of your city with the District tool, and you can not only name it so you can spot it easily on the map, but give it unique policies that regulate everything from mandating smoke detectors to reduce fire hazards (at a cost) to legalizing recreational drug use for lower crime rates, or banning highrise buildings to create defined downtown and suburban areas. In industrial zones, you can specialize the businesses to exploit a map’s natural resources in the area to mine ore, drill for oil, farm on fertile land, or harvest trees for forestry. You can even create tax incentives for a specific type of zone within each district.Let’s zoom in for a moment: we can see individual humans walking through the streets, going to work or school, engaging in leisure activities, or returning home by the thousands. They drive cars, take trains, and even walk dogs. (You can individually name them, but I suggest naming them Waldo, because there are so many that if you find that specific one again you I say you basically win the game.) This is where you realize the time scale becomes absurd. On the slowest speed a day lasts 10 seconds – three and a half on the fastest – which means the journey to work could last a week. But the lack of a day and night cycle means time doesn’t seem too unnatural, but rather an abstraction to serve the speed at which things are built and tax money flows in.Making a major city’s traffic flow smoothly is a puzzle I haven’t come close to fully cracking yet, but I do feel good when I easily create overpasses and freeway onramps to experiment with routes that direct the flow and ease the gridlock... at least partially. By default, most advanced road types are locked out at the start, which makes planning a city around trains or subways nearly impossible (unless you plan on supervillain-level demolition later on), but there’s a sandbox mode that’ll allow you to build whatever you want, whenever you can afford it. (There’s also an unlimited money mode.)Mass transit is a tricky beast. It’s not enough to lay down bus stops and train stations; you have to plot out routes individually, or no one will go anywhere. It’s easy to get lost in that, especially as routes start overlapping and it’s frustrating to get your bus stop placed on the correct side of each narrow road. But there are a lot of options, and the endorphin rush from making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all worth it.Up close, buildings are colorful and detailed, right down to small animations like rooftop fans spinning. A slider in the options menu gives us control over the amount of depth-of-field blur applied to distant buildings when zoomed in, which mimics SimCity’s attractive diorama effect. Skylines doesn’t match the graphical quality of SimCity, though, and given the great numbers we see them in they don’t quite have the variety needed to prevent most neighborhoods from looking pretty much the same.What Skylines isn’t good at is telling you what you’ve done wrong, and what problem you need to solve right now. For instance, when I hit 50,000 citizens, the gauge at the bottom of the screen that indicates what new zone type my city wanted in order to expand bottomed out. It didn’t want anything at all. Hundreds of buildings were abandoned, without explanation. How can I address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I don’t know what they are, and the in-game advisors provide no insight? I built new residential, commercial, and industrial zones and waited; eventually, without my taking any deliberate action or receiving any explanation, the zones filled and growth resumed upward of 100,000. I don’t understand why.In that light, it’s fortunate that it’s fairly difficult to send your city into a death spiral without actively trying to, or making worse financial decisions than Greece. It has to be as deliberate as placing a sewage drain pipe directly upstream from your water pump – basically piping raw sewage into your citizens’ tap water – or borrowing more money than you can ever hope to repay. Even crime is disappointingly easy to keep in check with a single police station serving a town of 40,000.It’s limited to man-made crisis-management because there are no earthquakes, tornadoes, destructive floods, nuclear meltdowns, zombie outbreaks, UFO or monster attacks, or anything fun like that. The only thing close to a disaster is a fire, and those don’t spread from one building to another, even if left completely unchecked. I don’t mean to fault Skylines for not cloning every single feature of SimCity, but I do consider disaster management to be a major part of running a big city, and without it Skylines lacks a certain sense of excitement that’s been a staple of the city-building genre since the beginning.More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the simple joy of building. It’s a really impressive and often beautiful simulation, where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land. Getting in and creating something is easy, though mastering it will require extensive research on community wikis to understand why growth is stunted even when you address your citizens’ apparent concerns. Don’t expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder.			"

												What can I say?1500+ hours so far, first 300 or so inside the Asset Editor, pretty much the rest writing mods. I probably played about 50 to 100 hours of the actualy game..This is a city-builder fan's dream come true. Enourmous modding possibilities straight out of the box. An immersive simulation. Large map area to build on. Freedom in the creation of roads and other networks, districts, policies, in short:Everything I've been waiting for over a decade. The few flaws this game has will probably be have been modded out of it in due time, or fixed by the developers themselves.If all this isn't worth 30 bucks, then I don't know what is.An absolute must-have.Update: If you grab this during sale, you can get the game + all dlc for the price of just the base game with no sale. Definitely worth your money as you'll get endless hours of fun and creativity out of it.			"

In my opinion this is the best city-building game by now and it totally worth bying. The game is so easy in mastering, that you don't even need any kind of hints or tutorials when you start playing it (even if you didn't play city-builders before). You just pushing ""new game"" and play, interface is so handy it's like you already know where and which tool is placed. Cites: Skylines is extremely absorbing so make sure that you can allow yourself to spend huge amount time on things like videogames. Trust me, you won't even notice how your precious hours will be gone without a trace. However, the game is not perfect, there are pretty much of flaws left by developers (poor traffic AI for example). The good thing that almost all of them can be easily cured with help of mods from Steam Workshop. So if you install mods from following list, the game will be definitely a piece of cake for you :з Recommended mods Automatic BulldozeAutoSave - ConfigurableAll 25 Areas purchasableMod Achievement EnablerPrecision EngineeringTraffic Manager + Improved AIP.S.After Dark is nice, but not really essential. The game is pretty complete already. "

												Excellent city building game. Very addictive, reasonably priced and has mod support. Can't wait to see what kind of stuff people come up with.There isn't much in terms of a tutorials, but the user interface is pretty easy to get to grips with.  It's the sort of game where you learn from your mistakes. I must have started about 5 or so cities before I figured out how to even get the ball rolling, but once you do, it's incredibly compelling.I am on my first city at the moment, and although it is proving profitable, the way I laid out the roads is pretty random and has been causing traffic problems.Also, I started drawing in a totally random bus route, adding stops all over the place and now it is telling me that I haven't completed the loop for my insane bus route and I can't figure out how to complete it for the life of me...or erase it. hahaIt seems pretty bug free, and it is very well optimised. Been playing it on my GT650m laptop and it is running great at 1080p on high settings. It's a very entertaining time sink. You can easily lose hours just evolving and maintaining your city.			"

   Overview    Cities: Skylines is another contender in the city simulation/building management genre. It plants its roots among games such as Sim City and Cities XL to name a select few. What Cities: Skylines does is take those games, turn them upside down and offer a fresh new perspective on a dated genre. To say the game surpasses previous games of this type would be an understatement. The game pulls ahead of the race and never looks back. The developers wanted something new and exciting and Cities: Skylines has it in spades.The overall gameplay is much the same: you start out on a pre-defined landmass with a stack of cash and only your imagination standing in your way. It's your job to name your city, form your plan of attack and make your city thrive (or fail if that's your thing). Much like previous installments in the genre, you'll have your selection of various densities of residential and commercial business, as well as industrial zoning. Cities: Skylines adds to that, offering you the ability to specialize areas for specific purposes with city ordinances - farming and forestry, higher taxes, lower taxes, pollution control, heavy traffic bans, legalization of marijuana...you get the idea. Rather than just zone an area and let it grow, the game offers a deeper look in balancing out wants and needs of your city.Aside from zoning and city ordinances, Cities: Skylines delves into other noteworthy favorites: Emergency services, schools, recreational and public transportation (roads, buses, trains, airports...etc). While most items don't have much involvement aside from adjusting budgets, you are given the ability to create a multitude of transition lines and customize the stops, name them and change the vehicle colors. It helps keep everything neat and orderly.Where the game really shines is within its ability to create mods and custom assets that can be implemented into the game by the community via the Steam Workshop. This takes the vanilla game to a whole new level, introducing new buildings, cars, parks, landscapes to build on, monuments or something entirely brand new. Without the workshop, the game is still pleasant and quite enjoyable, but there is a lot missing in terms of diversity. The workshop gives you that diversity, practically slapping you in the face with it. It takes Cities: Skylines from a great game, to an outstanding game.Now, like all games, there is always room for improvement. While I feel the game is great and I've thoughly enjoyed my time playing it, I feel it falls short in some of the deeper city management aspects. Taxes, for example, don't often need adjusting outside a very fine line unless you want to go bankrupt or have your citizens moving en mass. Once you get your city off the ground, it's very difficult to ""lose"", if you will. You'll be making money hand over fist unless you crank up the difficulty, which then makes budgeting more of a necessity, especially in the beginning of the game, but less so later on as long as you don't do anything drastic that puts you in the red. Since there are no natural disasters as of this review, and fires are localized to just the building on fire (mods do change it so they spread), widespread epidemics aren't a threat, making the need to prepare all but nonexistent.I feel the game is wonderful for what it offers, but feels too easy at times. However, I don't feel any of those negatives negate the enjoyment the game offers.   Pros    Modding Community - The modding community brings out this game's full potential. Building Space - The maps are huge, opening up a lot more options and the ability to have widespread districts and cities.The visuals - The game is colorful and detailed enough to give your city a diverse, pretty landscape.Renaming - You can remain everything - from businesses, homes, vehicles and even livestock.What It's Not - The game is not Sim City 5.   Cons    Management Systems - The game lacks any in depth management aside from taxes, budgets and ordinances.Difficulty - The game can feel too easy once you get the feel of the mechanics. Increasing the difficulty helps to mitigate some of that, but in the long run it can still feel that way.Natural Disasters - As of this review, there still are none. I hope this changes in the future.Resources - The game can be a little resource heavy and if you're like me and like assets (currently have 400+ new ones), the game can take some time between load screens, even on higher end computers. Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great city builder. It's something I had been waiting for since I played Sim City 4 into the ground back in 2004. If you're into the genre and looking for the right one, Cities: Skylines is, in my opinion, one of the best games out there at this moment. I highly recommend it.			"

												Cities Skylines is not so much of a game as it's a sandbox in which you can build a city.Granted, there is a lot you can build, and the city is very soon very beautiful. The problem is: there's no challenge. Sure, there are the usual problems with traffic, but any of those problems are made by the player, not that the game tosses a wrench into the machinery. You don't even have the usual problems with pollution or disgruntled people, because as long as there is a pretty even mix between industry, residential and commercial zones with a park or two placed, no one will ever be unhappy - I even got a prize for the most beautiful city, and I didn't even aim for that - I just plonked down a couple of parks. The graphics is fantastic, the music fine and the sounds... kind of annoying, especially the sirens that you will hear a lot. There are no bugs that I can think of, so technically speaking, this is an awesome game, but only if you don't want to be challenged, just building a city. And for me, that doesn't cut it.			"

												If you want a city builder that you can chill to, this is it. Complicated mechanics packed neatly in a easy-to-use interface. You can play this at your own pace without stress while bobbing your head with the incredible ost. Spent above 50 hours playing a bootleg version before I bought this on sale but this is definitely worth its full price. You are free to d**k around without long term consequences and the workshop contents are top notch. Pros- *Relaxation simulator*Amazing soundtrack*Gorgeous graphics *Workshop contents are 10/10*Simple mechanics that puts more emphasis on planning than active management*Extreme level of control over your city's economyCons-*You can lose track of time "

TLDR: If you enjoy city builders this is THE GAME to get, it's literally better than the legendary SimCity 4.Cities Skylines offers tons of different choices such as all kinds of road sizes, buildings and services. If you decide to replay the game i recommend downloading some mods as there are tons of great mods for Cities Skylines for even more customization!The only problem i have with Cities Skylines is that it is very easy to gain money and money is really NEVER a concern, a harder difficulty would be a nice addition.As for performance - the game runs a lot smoother than older games from the series, but it's certainly not buttery smooth always, it is a very CPU bound game, an I7 is recommended for the best experience.Final verdict - 9/10			"

												TLDR:The games as a whole feels unfinished, lacks proper tools and objects. Without mods its quite boring, and you fell like you don't have much to see here after 2 hours. Devs are lazy and greedy, releasing DLCs that costs a lot of money but don't change much, and they are basically relying on modders work. Every new DLC makes mods ""out of date"", and no longer usable.This is ridiculous - making life harder for people who actually make your product worth using.Don't get me wrong though - this is a very good game, but unmodified CS is far from perfect.Full story:Pros:+ great graphics;+ quite well optimised;+ unlimited replayability;+ making basic roads is fairly comfortable;+- water physics (acts weird sometimes, but overall works fine).Cons:- without mods allowing prop placement (such as More Beautification) your cities feel lifeless, and spaces between homes / businesses are empty, making them look ugly;- if you want your roads to look realistic, its nearly impossible to build them without such tools as Move it!, Precision Engineering and Road Anarchy;- without mod like IPT, controlling public transport is very basic, and thus not fun at all;- limited graphics configuration options;I keep saying mods, mods, mods... but just think about it - some VERY BASIC things in the game has to be improved by modders, just to operate ""smoothly"". For example, why don't we have an option in game menu to:1. Disable Chirper;2. To disable clouds / fog (especially important for lower end PCs);3. Building demoliton mechanic feels like its designed for tablet / smartphone game. Why do I have to demolish every burned or bankrupt building? They could just implement tickbox ""automatic demoliton"" in base game, if you like to move around your vast city and click like maniac, its your call;4. Placing props while playing, like in ingame object editor;5. Disable ugly pollution texture;I may sound rude, but in my personal opinion, modders make better job at keeping this game fun to play than devs. The game itself seems to be just a frame, designed to be improved by community with no effort of the company that made it.

 Before you read everything: If you want a good looking, easy city building sandbox, don't mind my rating and just go ahead and buy the game.It is definitely not a totally bugged or bad game or total rip-off :)And for some time I had definitely fun with it and still might in the future.Otherwise continue reading:FYI:I played loads of hours Sim City, mostly SimCity 4 + rush hour, which I really liked.Also I did not like the newest Sim City, for its small building zones, not-really-simulation and - most important - for EA, a company I learned to hate => In case of SC, for their false online only claims because of ""CPU heavy simulation only achievable in the cloud and not possible for home PCs"" blah blah. Yeah, you saw that very intensive simulation in spreading work force and trash trucks, haha. (besides it was obviously possible to play off line from the beginning) UPDATE [24/05/15] Some minor stuff has been fixed. And although I did not play with the newest patch released some days ago yet, most issues which annoy me are - according to patch notes - still there.When rating the game, I do so without mods. And without, the game gets pretty fast boring (for me) if you want more than just a ""build the prettiest city sandbox"". In my opinion mods are great for enhancing replayability or making smyller adjustments - but they should not become a necessity.And even though I had to think a long time about it, I still find my negative rating fitting. This game is sort of a hate-love-relationship. When I started playing it I really love the game:- graphics is not overwhelming but looking good, giving a nice city building flair- sound is soothing and does not get onto one's nerves- relatively good balanced progress- not feeling too fast or slow and I only seldom sped up the time- building/maintenance costs are fine- tax management simple but still ok- love how water/energy systems works (not too simple, not too much micro-management)- street system is doing good- district system nice, especially with the different resources for industry- actual water physics simulation! Building a hydro dam(n) needs real planning (and some testing, save your game ;) )Then I found some flaws; the in-game message chirper is kind of annoying (and badly placed btw), it's ridiculous to not being able to scroll with holding right mouse button, some view management is sorta weird and transportation volumes are not realistic.This is where the mods come in: for all those and more minor issues I found good working fixes in the workshop and from what I saw, some of the issues were fixed in the past, so in time you might even be able to go without them.But - here it comes - in the long run, the game does not fit my needs.In general it's too easy. After some harder times (in terms of cash problems) in the beginning, it gets pretty easy as soon as you get to use the high density zones. In my second city,  with a tax rate of 12% for everything after setting it to 14 for a short time, then going down to 12   I had a plus of 10k+/week. Even though I kept building here and there and making everything looking nice, I was not able to spend my money faster as I got it.Up until then it is real fun. But from this point, it is making the game a bit too sandbox-like with the focus on ""how to make it look nice"" and without the hassle for careful planning how and where to expand the city.Besides this, there are some really down-bringing issues in the game, that get more un-nerving in the long run.These are mostly unrealistic behavior or balance issues:- Electricity production is a joke. From the beginning, wind-energy is in term of $/W not only cheaper than any coal or gas plant, but also non-polluting. As soon as you get the solar power plant, you don't have to worry about energy at all, as it is even cheaper. Also neither wind nor sun energy has differing output, like dynamic wind speed or clouds. So there is no reason at all to not build wind/solar plants- The resource system does not have a real depth: Yes, you can set specific districts for agriculture, ore, oil or forest industry. But besides more/less tas and pollution (and different buildings, obviously), there is no really meaning in that. Yes, you can use the oil for your oil energy plant, but why? Wind is still cheaper. And there is no big difference in export or anything, too.- While the water pollution system is nice, the land pollution is very very friendly. Have a coal power plant? Well, pollution only spreads about one-two blocks - after that you can build residences again.- AI for garbage and death care needs improvements. Death care: In larger cities (30k+), there are continually areas where dead people wait for transport to the crematory or grave yard - even if you have enough of them and they are not using all of their vehicles yet. Garbage: Trucks are working (yes, SC in your face :D ) but the system to send the garbage from a full dump to a incineration plant is not good. Even the old SC4 was working better in that case.- UI/views. I still cannot click a street and see who is going where, like SC4 rush hour -> this might improve the generally nice transportation system a lot! Overall:- The game lacks in terms of content: some areas (medicine) are great - others (power, industry resources, politics, tourism, ..) have too few buildings/possibilities.- Simulation is not realistic enough/goes not deep enough. Too easy power simulation, too easy fire/crime/medicine/education system, no real impact of industry/resource choices, etc.As said before:If you want to just build a nice city, go ahead. I had a great time so far with the game. Had to install a few mods for that, but with them it is fun for some time.If you expect a nice city builder simulation, maybe it's better to wait for a DLC/the next part. Seeing that the game seems to be quite successful in terms of sold copies, I guess there is a good chance for one or the other :)			"

												I feel very rude and it frustrates me to write this, but I do not recommend Cities: Skylines unless it is at a good sale price. I love simulation games, but this one grew stale and was not for me.The first several hours were really enjoyable and I even went as far as to get the After Dark DLC at a sale price since I anticipated I'd be addicted. But only a few hours later did I realize I wasn't enjoying the game anymore. There are no ""scenarios"" to play, adding actual goals to the game, unless you get the Natural Disasters DLC (and there are apparently very few). You're just left to endlessly build a city with intricate micromanagement. If that sounds like your type of game, buy it! If that's all you want, this game will be perfect.My major complaints that led to me stop enjoying the game began with the lack of customization. For the first while, before your city's population adds up and you unlock more features, there's not much to add personalization to your city to make it feel like your own. Different types of roads and other customizations are blocked off arbitrarily in the early portion of building a city, and you'll only get access to these by boosting your population by a stated amount. It makes sense! It really does, but it made the first hour or two of starting a new city absolutely boring. I feel the game would have benefitted from loosening these restrictions.... and to follow that up, you may say ""there are mods, though!"" Yes, there are, and I was very excited to try them. However, the community proves that there are troubles with every update. Mods become incompatible, unsupported by the developers, and as a new player, lots of research will go into finding out how to use these mods and have them appear in your game, like custom buildings or styles. Many times, just trying to make sure custom content appeared in the in-game ""Content Manager"" would crash the game just after a few items. I thought it was just because I originally ran the game on an external hard drive, but I eventually tried it on my internal SSD, and the mods just seemed to hamper the game.If you have a lot of patience to learn the sciene behind the custom content of the game, and don't mind the aimless city-building with not much else to look forward to but ""more, more and more"". This is a sandbox game for you, no question. I understand why some people like it, but after the amount of time I played, I just feel exhausted and need a long break. The pleasure of growing my city sort of numbed itself.			"

												I like this game, but I don't LOVE this game.  Why?  The traffic A.I. is miserable.  Emergency Vehicles follow the flow of traffic.  They do not run red lights.  And all traffic in general takes the closest, not fastest route.  The Dev's have said it would take too much work.  Really?I will not be buying the DLC for this until traffic is fixed.  I probably won't play until then either.  This could be never though.  The dev's would rather sell DLC than fix bugs or try for a better base game experience.I really wanted to love this game...			"

												Overall, the game is pretty solid. The simulation, the tools and the gameplay is all just so fluid. Everything runs extremely well and cities feel legitimate and alive.The game does have some flaws here and there, yet it's still a very simple and straight to the point city builder with no bull♥♥♥♥♥♥attached. (DLC, DRM) It does takes quite a bit aspects from SimCity 2013 though (honestly a scary amount) but thankfully leaves all of the bad ones out. With regards to how it compares to SimCity 4 though, I'd say SC4 is still superior but just barely. Cities: Skylines offers a more simpler and easier yet less balanced economic system than SC4 did, which isn't necessarily a good thing. SC4 also had better information screens, the ability to modify landscape in-game, and doesn't have this questionable building unlocking progression. Also, I need to mention the lack of 'God' controls and commands such as disasters that SimCity 4 did have.But thankfully, the game has just been released and the dev team will continue to make updates for months maybe years to come and the modding community for this game is already phenomenal.Graphics: 8.5/10Audio: 8.5/10Gameplay/Replay-ability: 9.25/10Interface: 8.75Traffic/Simulation: 9.25/10Mod Support: 9.5/10Overall, I give this game a 9/10.

												If you in need of a real city builder - this games has it all! It looks nice, can handle lower end PCs and is capable of scaling right up to your UBER rig ;) The gameplay is rock solid, diverse, highly mod friendly (The workshop is fully of♥♥♥♥♥kicking custom assets and welcome additions like the resolution upscaler) and still manages not to overwhelm newcomers. Forget games with XXL in their title cuz Cities: Skyline really delivers! Period. No, srysly ... there is no other city builder besides Skylines. This is the SimCity we all wanted a couple years ago, for just a fraction of its price. And by the way, their small DLC offers are completely fair - add meaningful content and are completely optional. Like the trams they added in Snowfall - its cool, nice to have - but totally not required for even the largest city. So far I had a ton of fun  ;)			"

												The beauty of Cities: Skylines is its accessibility.  (Video Review Below)From playing to modding. Everything can be played with, tweaked, altered or changed. Noobies or veterans alike will find something to enjoy in this City building, strategy game. While the tutorial does an okay job of explaining things. It does have a little bit of a learning curve. With a focus on proper placement. Once you get the basics of the game down though, the world opens up to you. Every aspect to city management is there for you to tinker with. Transportation, sanitation, taxes, policies, districts and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Developer Colossal Order and Publisher Paradox Interactive lets there experience shine in this extremely well done game. With insane amounts of mod support, steamy goodness and virtually no bugs. This is the city building game people have been waiting for.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

This is by far the best Simulator regarding relativityAs soon as you launch the Cities.exe your GPU starts to render supermassive frames that influence time and space on a gravitational level. The effect you will experience is called Time Dilation. Some are reporting that they lost more than 10 hours at once, after using the Simulation for just a very short time. Leading scientists are trying to calculate the exact amount of time you are going to loose by executing this Simulation - The public is still waiting for the results.Stay Tuned			"

												Did you play SimCity and you were disappointed by how fast the gameplay seemed to stall out? Did you not play city sims before, and you are looking for a good place to start? Either way this game is a brilliant choice for you. The content offering it provides is abselutely insane. Compared to the already mentioned SimCity, I would say you get 5x the game for 1/3 the price. After 450 hours of gameplay, I have never ""finished"" any city to the point where I could not expand any further. To top it all off, basically any annoying gameplay issue you encounter can be solved in 5 minutes of browsing the workshop. I will now get picky and point out the biggest weaknesses I have found during my hundreds of hours of playtime, but keep in mind that I would never play the game that much if I did not love it in it's current state.  The DLC is not worth it. The DLC almost costs half of the game itself, and adds very little to the gameplay. After Dark mostly makes it very annoying to build half of the time, because it is, you know... dark at night. Apart from that the gameplay around the day/night cycle is not that appealing, to me at least. Snowfall would be worth if there was a season cycle, but you either have permanent snow, or no snow at all. Some mods are almost mandatory. I don't consider this a big issue, but I know nothing about the performance implications of mods on low end machines. The game is totally playable without mods, I actually had every steam achievement available before DLC, so I have enjoyed quite some hours with no mods. It is just that when you first start modding, it's really hard to go back(this is why I don't have any of the DLC achievements, lol). Some costs seem very unbalanced. In the ""standard game"" I often found myself splitting my budget 50/50. Between garbage plus death services, and everything else... Why is as expensive to burn your garbage as it is to upkeep all your hospitals, fire stations, and police stations combined? These things are really easy to mod on your own though, so again, it's not a game breaking issue. If you think you might enjoy the game a quarter as much as I do, it's probably your best buy you ever made.			"

												Everthing about this city builder functions perfectly as you'd expect and more. For instance, one thing speaks to how much thought has and may continue to be put into this game: the ability to close off a body of water with a dam, build pumps in it, and drain it. A short while after draining the body of water, grass soon grows on what was once dirt and you can plop down more city. You can even put sewage pumps along that area beforehand, remove the water pumps before turning them on, and flood your new stretch of city with poop water. If you really hate your citizens, you can place new water pumps in the ruins of your new-ish poop-flooded part of the city and your citizens all throughout your city will become poisoined and die.Sure most of that has little to do with the whole city building thing most of the time but it tells me everything I need to know about their dedication to detail and sandbox mechanics.

												This game is awesome. This game is like the latest Simcity, except Paradox thoroughly looked through it and turned bad things into good things. Such as; your city isn't limited as it is in Simcity. In Cities: Skylines your town can be f*cking enormous. Another thing about this game that Paradox did better than Maxis and EA is that you don't need 11,000 watertowers. You can just increase the budget on the water and sewage department. If it still isn't enough, you should maybe buy one or two more waterpumps. Still, this game is awesome. Definitely Game of the Year for me. This is basically everything Simcity  isn't .			"

												I've been waiting to play this game ever since it was announced last year, and because I decided to skip EA's latest SImCity game, I've had tons of hype for this game. Needless to say, this game has very much exceeded my expectations, and I've haven't had so much fun since playing SimCity 4 (with Cheat Engine because I suck at it and I'm impatient) and SimCity 3000.Basically, this game is what SimCity (2013) should have been: larger maps, mod support, single player mode at launch, and most of all, not having the need to play with an always-on internet connection.Would I recommend that you buy this game? Well, it would probably be likely that I'll be playing just this game for the next few months or so, so it's a big fat yes.			"

												The best darn city builder, dare I say... ever? Yes indeed! I pre-ordered this game and it had to be one of the best if not the best pre-order I have ever made. From 11amCST to 2am on release day I played this game like crazy! And the best part I am not even close to finishing with my first city, there is so much content and things to do its crazy that is even a city builder! You like building, you will love this game, shoot if you love managing or sim games you will love this one. This game does everything other games of the genere haven't, a million times better than Sim City of 2013. The traffic  simulation is top notch, there are so many choices for roads, like the ability to build your own highways! There is a load of unique buildings, many transportation options, and so much more. Anything you want in a city builder this game has it! However, it is also a challenge, you wont have incredible city very quickly. A lot of issues can hit you hard while your population expands, my only complaint is that you need many, many, many, service buildings to cover a very large city, To much in my mind, I hope they tweak that because it can really drain your income. Again, though this game is fun, creative, innovative, challenging, and above all a great city builder. You will not regret picking this one up, atm it is the 2015 Game of the Year!			"

Recommended: While there's a few rough edges in the design, I can safely say Cities: Skylines is probably my favourite modern city-builder since SimCity 4, and that's been a long while indeed.  It looks great, runs well, and does a great job in offering a variety of transit and building options.  The lacking aspects beyond some more services (such as libraries or museums from SC2K for example), are mostly in the fine details, as creating transit lines can get quite finicky, and having to manually demolish abandoned building becomes a chore with a large city.  Nonetheless a new paragon in it's genre; Skylines is the new benchmark, the one to beat when it comes to city-building.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												Spent hours in this game! There is so much you can do.Pro and con: I feel the game is mostly about traffic and managing which I like, some may not.Con: fps drops significantly at high populations. But what bothers me more is these weird long pauses that all vehicles (trains, cars, taxis, trams, metros) take after they initiate an action. I guess simulations of >100k vehicles really slows the game down even though fps is at 30.			"

												I thought I really liked this game when it was released. I poured countless hours into it and created huge sprawling cities, one after the other. But when I started to dig deeper into the gameplay and strategic elements of this game such as managing the cities economy and taxes, I've come to find that the game falls flat in many aspects. The overall look and feel of the cities you create come to feel quite lifeless with nothing much in the design giving much excitement. Landmarks are very limited unless you go through the modding community, end game structures are completely broken, such as practically leveling up every building to maximum across the whole city with one building, plus unrealistic in their function. The maps themselves are very uninteresting, and flat. I would have hoped that the expanstions would have brought more to the game but the night expansion was a complete waste of money and gave me maybe a couple hours of interest. And an expansion to add permanent snow? No thanks. I also can't understand the idea that poorer people are happy to pay more taxes and wealthy people are capped at paying someting like 11-12% and even if you improve their area, it's not ever possible to raise the taxes without them abandoning. The district system seems interesting at first but despite it looking to deep, I've never really found any interesting ways of implementing them other than 'oh industrial area so I guess I'll add the fire alarms ordinance here' etc... its all very obvious and repetitive. I really want to like this game, and I like Paradox games in general, but I just can't agree with the amound of praise this game is getting. Even the zoning design is terrible as patches of grass appear everywhere making the city look incomplete. Having lived in a city my whole life I know what a city should look like and Paradox are not quite hitting the mark I'm afraid. Also the farms are terrible too, since when are farms zoned in small blocks? They just don't look realistic at all. The one thing this game does well and that is the traffic system. Controlling the flow of traffic on this game is quite beautifully done and that is what the game is, it's basically one big traffic sandbox. I do hope to find a new found interest in this game some day, but unfortunately I think that its lifespan may well have turned out to be even worst than SimCity :s			"

Graphics, gameplay, idea, building meachanism etc. are great.But there is one gamebraker:Traffic.Want to spend hours building a nice city?Better prepare for hundred of hours testing how to build a proper traffic-town.Simple mechanics for traffic as used in real life are missing.Also the AI is very very limited on the road.Means: Building a 6-lane-road with 3 turn-lanes-right and still ALL cars will only use ONE Turn-Lane which causes huge traffic problems while a lot of lanes are empty...

												Amazingly good city simulation game. Recommended to anyone with even a light interest in the Genre. For the advanced players of City Sim games it offers many options for late game that can make or break your city. Plus it has a new Add-on featuring an active day night cycle. Will prove to be a good add-on I am sure.			"

												Is the best city game ever. Hard to learn but amazing to play. A heavy influence from sim city but a very fun game. Citys can be massive and hold a 1 billion people. LOve this game absoulutly. The map locations are  even better. Traffic is a fun puzzle. Dont go into this game thinking ohh its going to be easy and build a huge city from scratch. I wish i could destroy my city like in sim city.  BUt this game is all together fun.			"

												9.5/10-------The last city building game I have played is the SimCity 4: Rush Hours, which I like terribly. However, finally made a decision to get something new for the nicer graphics, somehow different gameplay, modding opportunities and fun. I don't have to say that Cities: Skylines have it all, and moreover it is a pleasure to play this game. There are some graphics and mechanics glitches, but I believe they'll be all fixed (e.g. despite the fact that I dezoned some land, the factories kept building there...). Even the modding tool is so easy to use and accessible that I actually started playing by creating my own park :) This game is highly recommended for all the city builders fans, and will definitely get even better!!!----What I miss in the game:- day/night cycle- seasons- if not seasons, at least winter theme! :)			"

												Cities: Skylines, is perhaps the ultimate city building game, a must have for Steam, and should absolutely be the first city builder someone plays. First off, let me dispell some worries you may have, I know I had some. This game has MASSIVE maps, you unlock them piece by piece as your city grows, HOWEVER, you will only be able to have a total of 9 tiles, so plan out your city according to that. (9 Tiles is still huge, dont get the wrong idea)Skylines is also a VERY easy game to get into. My chief concern about this game was that it would be more learning HOW TO play, instead of actually playing, and wheres the fun in that? Fortunately, Skylines is easy to understand and master. *The biggest reason why you should buy Skylines is mod support. These range from buildings, cars, and all sorts of things. What makes this feature even better is that some buildings created in workshop have requirements that need to be met before they can be constructed (These requirements are chosen by the person who made it in workshop), which can potentially add more to the game. TL;DR: If youre looking for the pinnacle of city builder games, and/or a city builder thats easy and simple to understand, you should buy it.			"

												Another city building game, but it's not quite like the others.  More on that later, first my list of pros and cons;PROS:- Water has current, which you have to plan for so as not to polute your own shores.- Water can controlled, both current and levels using hydro dams.- Citizens have specifically assigned residences (and jobs), making traffic more realistic.- The various interface overlays makes determining the placing of utility structures very easy.- You can practically do anything you want to when it comes to roads/highways/ramps.- Graphics are superb and performance is amazing, regardless of zoom level.- You get the feeling of SimCity, without the bad taste it left behind.- Completely customizable routes for buses, subways, and trains.- High number of road types for you to select, everything from gravel to highways.CONS:- Constant ""tweets"" got pretty annoying after a while.- Tweets about problems that shouldn't exist (ex. dead person, with a crematorium next door).- Building with full fire coverage would burn down and prompt you to check fire coverage.- Not enough options to deal with garbage and collection ranges seemed unrealistic.- A lot of specialty buildings had ""noise"" zones that seemed unreasonably large.- No real options to deal with industry polution, other than to keep it away from everything else.- Not enough random building names, I'd often find 6-8 buildings in a row with the same name.- Small number of maps included (although more are available).- No way (that I've found) to have a subway come to the surface.- No streetcars- Ships (cruise/cargo) movement seemed extremely unrealistic, as if it was an afterthought.- Music is EXTREMELY repetative, I had to turn it off after a while.- Road ""snapping"" can be annoying when working on highway offramps, even when it's supposedly turned off.Now that I've given you that basic list, let's get down to brass tax.  Everyone is correct when they say that this game is everything that SimCity should have been.  That said, it is lacking in a few basics that SimCity actually had.  The biggest thing in my list of pet peves for this game would have to be garbage collection.  In my 80,000 population city (real life) there is one garbage dump and the entire city's garbage has been going there since the city was built.  In this game, by the time my population was 10,000 I had 4 garbage dumps spread out across the landscape.  By the time I hit 80,000 there was an entire district devoted to garbage dumps (10 of them) with 6 insinerators trying (unsuccessfully) to keep them from being full.  I even had the recycling policy in place, and still my garbage dumps were overflowing.  Oh, that's another thing, no recycling centers?Anyway, when you put this game beside SimCity there really isn't any question that Cities: Skylines is the superior game overall.  It does have it's issues, but it's by far the best all around city building game that's been produced.  Don't go into this game expecting your every city building dream to come true, just enjoy it for what it is.EDIT:Since the addition of the Workshop to Cities:Skylines most of the problems I mentioned are easily solved by downloading 3rd party workshop items, like a recycling center.  This game is now my #1 city building game.			"

												I would love nothing more than to give Cities: Skylines a glowing review as I've played it for several hours beyond what steam shows, but frankly, I'm disappointed in their recent DLC practices. It's eerily similar to Payday 2, where they had a great game and then milked it to no end for every last penny. Snowfall? Natural Disasters? After Dark? These should either be a part of the vanilla game or a singular expansion, not individual ~$15 DLC items. As for the Stadium and Content Creator DLCs, those are just ridiculous, it's like the Sims with endless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC that's expensive and shouldn't be standalone. Really disappointed in them going down this route.			"

												Games are only as good as the companies who make them. And this one is no exception. Cities: Skylines is the KING of city building games. Awesome graphics and gameplay, HUGE plot of land to grow your city on and best of all: a modding community that reigns supreme. Simcity 2013 was the equivalent of Michael Bay's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Meaning we waited years and years for a new release and all we got was an atrocious reboot. Colossal Order has answered our prayers and given us this masterpiece. Not to mention that unlike Simcity 2013, theres no requirement to sign in to a server to play.2 thumbs WAY way up for Colossal Order.			"

												It really is the Sim city 5 we should have gotten and so much more value for money too!!,Not many Bugs as far as i can tell, although the death feature is quite challenging expecially in a high density area. Make sure to plop down lots of cemetarys and such or your building will be abandoned if dead people are left un collected.Noise pollution.. it's actually so deadly Dont cut corners and build cheap roads.. it will cause a plague, everyone will die!!! you will lose.. if only i wasnt so cheap. :(It does need more disaster options.. but its so sadictively fun to drown your city with dams.. the water physics are superb""11/10 would drown 80,000 people again!

												This is the true city-simulator successor for this generation. The modding capabilities, districting, road laying mechanics and the large city sizes are some of the big plusses in my book. The down sides include the building and park placement mechanics and also the lack of ability to make farms with huge fields. Cities: Skylines is a new standard for future games of this genre despite some of its bugs and I hope to see what the developers and modders alike can do to make this game experience the best with today's gaming technologies.Totally worth paying full price.

												Pros- Solid, simple yet creative and freeroam city building game.- Beautiful environment.- New features such as Zone Unlocking, District and Asset Editor add more depth to the game.- Better than that ""another City-building game"" in the major ways. Cons- Most buildings are pretty identical.- Road and zone planning can be frustuated.- Just a single city, no regional areas. Nor multiplayers (probably a good thing).Final VerdictFinally, the next-gen, 3D, fully-moddable, functional city simulation game! If you like city-building games, this game is for you. Although the game is relatively small but the revival community will sure keep it going. Great work, Colossal Order.9/10!			"

												I spent a couple hours building a thriving community with a large residential estate and one boulevard of shops.Eventually I decided to make the place look nice, so I added a river - but I didn't bother putting protective walls up.The river banks filled up and overflowed straight onto the housing estate and down onto the shops until it carried on down to the sea again.The flood lasted for weeks and I couldn't do anything because you cant build on water, so I just watched and admired the beautiful chaos unfold.10/10 would flood again.

It's nothing new.

Thus, put the title alone, this game beats its 'singularity'-ish predecessors.Enuff Said, 11/10!			"

												This is a fantastic city building game, but if you are looking for the ability to drive around your city as shown in Sim City 3 and up, not quite it. I'm also going to give you a warning that this game may eat away at your hours. Reading over the reviews, I've seen this game a multitude of times compared to Sim City. The biggest comparison I see is that, this game has been labelled ""easier"". In some sense it's true, but when you realize how big your city can be and the unique styles you can give to your roads, it can get complicated. The game is about building up a city, but eventually turns into managing one instead of it managing itself. The gameplay is relatively simple. Everything is laid out for you, and as your city grows, so does your ability to build upgraded or newer buildings. Taxes can be adjusted, budgets can be adjusted (for parks, buses, water works, electricity etc...), and loans can be taken out. Even if you are not extremely familiar how economics work in a municipality, the game does it's best to advise you of everything going on. Placing police stations, fire stations, hospitals, or even schools becomes very easy as the game does an extremely good job in showing which areas are covered. What can drive a few people nuts is putting water pumps near sewage dumps. At first, you may smile as you see water is being delivered to your residents and that the sewage water is far away (especially in the first level with the lake). You'll then notice a lot of water being polluted and eventually making it's way up to your water pumps. It is imperative that my readers know to build down stream or to use water towers where sewage may be an issue! They also make it easy to see what crime rates are (check the top left of your screen), what your citizens happiness is, pollution, electricity and water availability, natural resources and a few others. The biggest feature in the game to me it seems, is the ability to really architect the roads. In Sim City, you are able to put zones wherever you please. In Skylines, you have only the choice to build near roads. Zoning is made easy and can be done with a fill brush tool or individual squares can be assigned. A huge feature in Skylines is districts. Districts are designed by you and are designated by you as well. Want a forest industry? Want a mining industry? Want a farming industry by residential areas? This can be done through districts. Definitely a notable feature in the game. Bus stops and other sort of transport is available. They try to give you as much control as possible within the game. Bus stops are designated by you and are placed where you'd like them to be. At first it is difficult to control where the bus goes when placing the stops, but choosing the RIGHT side of the road is important for it to work properly! Visuals and sounds are appropriate. The music is neither condemning or over the top, but the repitid Sounds follow your screen, and you will hear buildings burn if they are on fire. At first glance, I thought traffic was extremely horrible in my city. I zoomed in closer and saw they actually park their cars in front of their house. Good to see the attention to detail put in. I bought this game on sale and am quite content with the product. I would like to have a feature where I can drive through my city or even go on a rampage with a truck. Maybe it's asking too much from a city builder, but having complete control like this is what differentiates the best from the rest.RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall  BScreenShots :  SCREENSHOT 1  SCREENSHOT 2  Pretty much completed Not the ideal screenshot of showing off a bridge  I thought the bus stops in my city were crowded Even emergency vehicles do not pass a funeral procession "

												Ever since simcity-4, city simulation has become more off a hobby for me than just occasional game play. Over the years I have created many custom buildings (mainly Paris and medieval themes) and mods (amongst other the Jupiter (weather) and the Aurora mods) for simcity-4. Simcity 2013 was a major disappointment on all accounts.I have been fortunate to have been invited to test Cities Skylines' modding tools during the beta phase for the past couple of months. And during that time I have also been able to play the game. Cities Skylines exceeds my expectations. The potential that can be unlocked by the community and by DLCs provided by CO is unbelievable. I am absolutely overwhelmed by how great this game is. Additionally, I have gained the utmost respect for CO. It is unbelievable what a small team of creative people can do. Aside from developing a fantastic game, CO actually listens to the community to the best of their abilities. Bound by an NDA, it has been challenging for me not being able to respond to all the comments, questions, critisicm, (sometimes unjust) speculation on the forums. And I kept thinking if only you could get to play the game for half an hour and - like me - become captivated by studying the little CIMS in their daily routine, or laying out the most amazing road interchanges. Finally a game I can enjoy again without having to shoot someone. Off course some I do share some of the criticism that also has been shared on the forums. I could even create a list of a dozen or more features that I would like to see changed or improved. But all that is driven by my enthusiasm for this game, and there is a time a place for everything. So for now I am just giving this game a 10/10.			"

												City building, one of the great monuments of mankind. Isn't the blatent repurposing of the earth's bounty for our mundane consumption and shelter the epitomy what it means to be human? Yes it is. And when you play Cities: Skylines you will come to appreciate the craftsmanship and skill involved in such an undertaking. It took me seven resets before I finally got a city running properly; and even then did I throw all my progress and work out the window just because it wasn't perfect enough. City building is strategy game in the truest form. It requires long term planning and foresight. Overlooking any aspect at the start can come back to haunt you later on. Like in my first city, everything was running smoothly until everyone fell ill from polluted drinking water. The tides from the coast weren't very good at disposing the sewage. So instead of fixing it, I decided to throw all that away and found a new city alongside a flowing river instead. With the water problem covered for now a new plague rose up. Power. I had to learn a few tricks from a pretty good youtuber to get the basics down; he showed you could start a city with a single wind tubine and save much more money for facilities. However, turbines are fickle and the wind is their enabler. As a result, it became a structural struggle to provide power for my budding metropolis. Once again, I threw the stuff away and started a new city, besides a river, on a hillside. At this point it should be clear that this game has a significant learning curve. You really need to invest and try stuff to get the hang of it. However, it does turn out to be rewarding, as your city vivibly evolves under your direction. It is welcoming to see a game so strong in visual feedback. A bustling city is more amusing to behold than a dying one, so it is an extra motivator to keep exploring and trying for new stuff. Now I'm in my 5th game and power and water are no longer a problem. The real challenge presents itself when you're expanding. Expanding is hard. You basically have to create a new city from scratch, and you effectively double your resource consumption in the process. Once again, your early choices make all the differences. Depending on how you positioned your first district in regards to the highway can make all the difference for the new stream of inhabitants and commuters. You'll have to consider traffic flows from a very early point to make them work in the long run. And that is how I began my 6th city. So after much trial and error, I am now running my 8th city and it is running like clockwork. I even have a booming oil and ore industry, as well as a modern office district and many options for easy living. At this point it helps to explore the extremely well crafted advisor windows. These intergrated menu screens can give you a direct glimpse into the affairs of your metropole. Fire safety, crimerate, congestion, pollution; it's all expertly depicted with easy to understand colour graphs and real time feedback from the system about current problems. The interface is such a marvel, I think more games could benefit from it. As your city grows, your scope zooms out and you move away from street corner politics and small scale renovations. Your footprint grows and so does your city. City: Skylines is possibly the best city building game ever made. Thanks to its direct feedback from the real time game, excellent interface and amazing graphics, it is a game worth building a city in, and then to wish you could one day live in it.Granted that you don't mess up at the start because no one wants to live in highway congestion. Punishing at the start. It certainly rewards the intrepid frontier's men/women.			"

												Surprisingly tight City Sim, coming from the studio that made a name with their Cities in Motion series. Paradox seems to have read the book about how not to make a City Sim and have learned the lessons EA so willingly showed off with their lousy Sim City release. Good job, Paradox!			"

												This is one of the best city building games i have ever seen cause it gives you plenty of vanilla material and sometimes gets you thinking outside the box and get creative. It has workshop support so if you run out of fun in the vanilla game there is the addons on the workshop whit sections like: Mods, Buildings, Transport, Fire, Health and police Department and many more. Also Paradox and Collosal Orders [The Creators Of This Game] make DLCs and Huge! updates to the game every now and then. After Dark DLCThis DLC includes the Day and Night cycle, Better airport, Taxies and Tourisim! Now thats a bunch we also have the Snow Fall DLCSnow Fall DLCIt includes Trams, Heating, Snow Plows And obviosly Snowy Maps. Thats so far with the DLCs. I dont really want to talk about the updates because it would take too long so I leave it up to you to find out whats new and whats gona come out next. "

												This game if of high quality. Smooth, pretty, intuitive. BUT: There is one downside with this game, and it's big enough that I would not recomend it:The game is so easy it becomes meaningless and boring. There is absolutely no chance you wil go bankrupt, and making everyone in your city happy is trivial. Then what's the point?EDIT: I realize that the game might be a challenge to people that either have no experience with city simulators, or know absolutely nothing about traffic engineering or city planning. If you do, however, the game becomes trivial, and more about making the ""perfect"" city than about making a functioning city.			"

 Nice City Builder with ♥♥♥♥ing traffic jam problem after reach 80K population above  It has a good graphic for city builder game  Steam Community Workshop isn't bad either, many interesting items there first time I play this game I think ""wow it's little bit hard to solve traffic jam problem, and why my city population won't increase after 32K???"" but now maybe Cities: Skyline helps me a lot to know what other people think if I do a mistake, because the NPC wont stop complaining before I solve the problem.  If you love city builder game, I recommend this game If you never play city builder, Try this game. Not too hard for starter but after reach 2400 population, you will need strategy If you like a game that requires patience, I recommend this gameI bought this game one week before the discount, and I was a little annoyed with that Overall Ratings:  11/10   "

												One of the best city building games of all time in my opinion. I've gotten more time out of this than Simcity as a whole (in the same span of time) and I still love it. Great workshop compatibility, graphics, and mechanics. Some things could definitely be improved but I feel like the workshop is already on all of that. WAY better than any other equivalent. Also, I can't believe this game is made in Unity! Doesn't run that well on larger cities but is still runs better than any other city builder. It actually simulates everthing, the roads are way better, huge maps, resources, much better traffic AI than other games (not to say that you can just draw grids everywhere and not expect traffic, you still have to use a 6-4-2 method). Roads tools are great and fun and aesthatically appealing.			"

												I will start off with saying that I can't recommend this game. Which is a shame.It just isn't a finished product in my opinion. You will get something that resembles a release ready product if you choose to use the Workshop and download assets and mods. This will however prove to be an unwise decision as when a new DLC+patch comes, you can most likely say goodbye to your city. You will at least have a very hard time getting it to run like it did the day before said content was released. Many are praising the game for its water dynamics, I won't. Actually I think the water is really bad. Build a dam? The water will have none of that and start flowing upstreams just to get away from it. I would had been excited over the water if you could add streams when creating maps in the editor. Like drawing a stream with a special tool to tell the water which direction to go and intensity.Let's talk about powerplants.There are seven of them to choose from, two of which are windpower and two which you most likely will never use. Those two would be the dam and the solar power plant. The dam is useless because of how water functions in the game, no it is not me that is incompetent. I have done a lot of testing in the editor to try and get it right for a dam, and honestly it is such a pain to get it to work that you are better off just plopping down windpower or any of the rest. Even the solarplant would be better. Nice clean energy to power your city, right? No. Nighttime was added to the game, and for some reason in the universe this game plays out in, they have not invented any method to store generated extra power. So when the darkness falls, there will be no tv watching or showering for your cims, as the plant produces 0 energy for the duration of the night.Did you read somewhere that they where introducing weather in the newest DLC+patch? Did you also hear them saying that the weather was cosmetic? Well...it isn't. Apparently the ""cosmetic"" fog will block out the sun and lower the effeciency of your solar plant. ""Cosmetic"" rain will make the temperatures drop so your cims use more power to heat their homes. Doesn't really sound that cosmetic, does it?All that is fine, this is what happens in real life with weather, but the cluelessness of the publisher stating obvious wrong facts in interviews is not. So with the nighttime and fog, you might just want to skip that solar power plant.The AI in the game is horrible. I am sure you have heard about it on forums and such. The cars will force themselves into one or two lanes instead of using the full potential of the roads. Emergency vehicles will patiently keep behind the other drivers and so on.Another thing that is quite annoying is the complete lack of developer presence on the game's forums here on Steam. In my opinion, if you choose to release a game on Steam you should also be bothered with the big community it will gather there. I think that the sole reason for Cities: Skylines ""success"" is that people where desperate after something else after being let down by Simcity: 2013.If you decide to buy this game you will get some fun out of it at the beginning, but you will with no doubt get more and more annoyed later on when finding more and more stuff in the game that simply does not work, or works in a very odd way.Defender of the devs need not comment about this and that, if this is the best game in the world for you and everything works like a charm then go and make a positive review and enjoy your game.

If you Build It, They Will ComeHop in the Review-Well Delorean because we're going back in time, way back to the glory days of  1989.Not because this is the year that Back to the Future II was released,  not because I want to warn my younger self that Indiana Jones isn't really going on his last crusade and not because Kevin Costner is about to discover his ""Field of Dreams""We're going back to 1989 because this is the year that the City Building game was born.Platform WarsWhilst Amiga and Atari ST owners argued over who's computer was better<cough> Amiga <cough>both sides could agreed that the PC with its blocky graphics and awful sound would never be a true gaming platform.Paradise CityThere was also agreement about another equally important gaming matter, that this new game ""SimCity"", no matter which format you played it on, rocked!You could build your own city, your own roads, railroads, infrastructure. It was mind-blowing.In fact it was a concept that rocked so hard that the Los Angeles based Guns N Roses (the ""One Direction"" of the late 80's*)released a song to celebrate its greatness called Paradise City.*(*These facts may be erroneous and are awaiting citation.)Up All NightSo now we've witnessed the city building ""big bang"" we need to get out of here before the Libyans find us.It's time to go back, not to the future, well to the future of the past, but not the future of the present!  (I love time travel!)It's 2011, One Direction have just released their first album (One Direction rose to popularity to fill the gap in the time line left by Guns N Roses who may or may not have gone missing during the alien attack on Los Angeles in 2010 as depicted in the documentary ""Battle Los Angeles"" **)(** Almost certainly true but citation is pending.)Bus Replacement ServiceAnother important event of this time period was the release of ""Cities in Motion"".An excellent little  transport simulation game by Colossal Order which had you placing bus stops and metro stations across little city maps then sitting back and watching the ensuing commuter nightmare as your ineffective planning came to light.My own gaming limitations aside, this was a gem of a game and left me wishing that I could manage the city development around the transportation network I was building.The Ice Queen Cometh...It's back up to 88mph again, a flash of light later and we're in 2013.The Monstrous  Sea Creatures emerging from the ""Pacific Rim"" have failed to take out ""One Direction"" and in a desperate attempt to free our airwaves from the ironically titled ""Best Song Ever"" Disney released a counter attack by way of Princess Elsa begging these Guns N Roses replacements to ""Let It Go"" ****** This information may be slightly inaccurate as I fell asleep during Pacific Rim and went outside to ""build a snowman"" shortly after Frozen started.It Grows if you Play with it.The other big news of 2013 was the release of Cities in Motion 2. The BIGGER is BETTER sequel to the previous transportation sim. It was prettier, the maps were much larger and your transportation decisions would impact city growth.Whilst still only a transport sim and not a city builder this was another great game in the franchise.1,2,3,4.....errr...1The other, other big news of 2013 was the release of SimCity.Yes I know we started our time travelling journey witnessing the birth of SimCity back in 1989, but it seems that,  despite spawning 3 sequels over the interceding years, a meeting was held by shady men of power where they discussed what they could possibly call the next game in the SimCity Franchise.They'd already had SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 (I assume they'd dropped the three zeros because they thought their audience incapable of counting up in 1000 increments any further.....)  so they came up with SimCity 5.I speculate that It was at this point one of them decided that the One Direction haggled minds of the current generation could not be expected to count all the way to 5.... so they decided to drop the number off the game title all together and SimCity was reborn!Sham CityAnd what a rebirth it was, not since Elsa had taken off her gloves and started freezing everything she touched like a frigid version of Gold Finger had such outrage been  seen.You had to be online all the time to play the game,  their servers were overloaded so you often couldn't play at all! (both of these issues were fixed later)  but most importantly, the maps were tiny, tiny things with very little room for the one thing this game was supposed to be about, City Building.On The Road AgainIt's time to charge the flux capacitor one last time, we're going home!It's 2015, Not content with their domination of the airwaves, One Direction are on tour.A public warning has been issued labelled  ""On the Road Again""The announcement includes the groups  whereabouts and an anticipated timeline to allow the general public to avoid several high risk locations, which are often large venues where people would normally gather, despicable.Anyway,  the Bigger news of 2015 is that the city builder is back!City Building Games are like Buses.You wait for years for one to come along and then two arrive at the same time.Firstly we've had the release of Cities XXL, a competent  city builder in its own right, but much like many of One Directions songs, it's almost an  exact copy of what came before it.This hasn't gone down well with people already exposed to that particular franchise, if you've heard one song, you've heard them all, right?And now we have Cities Skylines, but is this the salvation of the city building genre we've all been hoping for ?A Little MisunderstandingWhen I first fired up Cities Skylines I was immediately filled with disappointment.It was pretty, it seemed to have all the features I could want in a city builder, but the map size was tiny, SimCity 5000 tiny.The same white dotted line marked out the edges of the postage stamp sized buildable area as I'd butted against in SimCity so many times before.... but I was wrong!Game ChangerYou can't imagine my relief when I realised I could purchase new plots of land to expand my fledgling  metropolis.The map is in fact huge, you can buy and unlock land to expand out not only in ""One Direction"" but in which ever direction you choose!I swear I've never felt such relief when playing a game before.It was like finding out that Guns N Roses hadn't really been taken down by aliens, It wasn't only an amazing discovery, it was a game changer!Cities In MotionAs you would expect from a developer who's previous titles have been transportation management sims, the transportation mechanics in Skylines are excellent.You can place bus stops, set up bus routes, implement a tube system, play with trains and even boats. The public transport system is so fully realised and well implemented I really can't fault it.Cities In Motion TooRoads aren't neglected either.There's plenty of choice between different road sizes, one way systems, Yes, you can set streets up so cars can only go in ""One Direction"" (Best Pun Ever*) , roundabouts etc. All there waiting to help solve your traffic problems by way of substituting them with the problems of noise pollution instead.(*Best Pun Ever, may have been the  hidden bonus track released by the unexplainably popular boy band - reports are unconfirmed but it does seem to relate to the noise pollution issue). <snip>( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

												First time review but felt compelled to about this game. If you are a fan of the whole tycoon, city building genre then Cities SKylines is for you.The support of the product through the workshop is like a treasure trove filled with replica buildings, unique designs and detailed assets which allow you to craft almost anything you can imagine within your city.The mods can be a little bit frustrating and dangerous to your save games but handled correctly (I'd highly recommend reading about the mods you are thinking about using in the workshop before downloading any) they add even more oppotunities to develop the gameplay, fixing minor frustrations and adding more simplitic and unique controls.If you are new to the genre then this is an excellent game to start from. Great value, it was only £22 when it first came out, and an even better workshop, this gane will suck you in for hours.			"

												Remember simcity 2013? Yea this is basicly that but not a huge disapointment. I have been playing simcity for many years, and I am sure that I am not the only one that was very unpelased with simcity 2013. Was it horrible? Nah, but it was not as good as it should be. Cities Skylines is the modern city builder I have been looking for. No city restrictions and no online DRM BS. The game allows you to build insansly large cities, and the modding community is already pushing out some really cool stuff, especialy with the asset and map editor being a thing.  It does not have the same kind of quarkyness that simcity has, and wont have the same kind of random events, but it is satisfying to watch the city grow.My only real problem with the game is that it does not tailor it's self way to new players. If you are new to the city building genre then be prepared to fail a lot, as this game will punish you for the smallest of mistakes. If you are like me and been wanting a great modern version of simcity then this is for you, along with the modding community I would definetly say that this game is well worth 30 bucks.			"

It runs really well, looks good and looks to have great modding potential in future. Little details like the water backing up behind a dam, swaying electricity wires etc make this game look fantastic. It's everything that SimCity should've been and more.The towns look small when you first start, but be rest assured you can grow a city up to 6x6km in a Prison Architect style land purchasing method. This is pretty much rivalling Cities XL in terms of raw city size.Overall, 10/10			"

												Brought the game, awesome.Created my first city, wow this game looks good.Managed the city's need of water with water tanks, check check and check.Got a population of +8000.Suddenly my citizens got sick, not good.Bodies piled up in and out of cementaries, oh noes.Saw that my water tanks were on pollutred land, well that explains some things.Tried to relocate said water tanks, got no money to do it.More people dying in their own poo, nasty.Went bankrupt because medical attention burned my reserves, with no use.Made -12k $ per month.Nearly 90% of my population died, only 1k over and still dying.Deleted city to start all over.maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan it's good to be mayor!Now for the real review:Cities: Skylines is an awesome. It got all benefits a city builder needs and even more (modding and creating your own props and buildings).I am a gamer who mainly loves MMO's, FPS and 3rdPS. But damn son this game made me nearly lose my job because I forgot the time while playing. If you want to destroy your life (and that of your own city's citizens) buy this game.Pros:+ Highly detailed city, buildings, props, citizens- god everything looks amazing.+ Close-up camera. Stalk your favourite citizen through the whole city.+ Many types of services such as water and sewerage management, medical and fire management and lots more.+ Unique buildings you can unlock and build by fulfill different in-game challenges.+ No moneygrabbing, DLC greedy, ""you need to be always online and connected to Origin""-EA+ Challenging gameplay. If you make a mistake (like I did; read above) your city goes down hill very fast.+ Nice sound effects if you go up-close.+ Taxes!!!! Whooooooho!+ Workshop support and an editor for own creations.Cons:- Nothing. The game is awesome!- Wait- Hmmm- *rubs chin and tries to think*- *scratches head while thinking, multitasking op*- Ah got it- Game needs a day and night cycle with lights and suchTL; DR: Game got no EA so buy it.

												""Suffice it to say that I believe this game is worth the asking price of $29.99.  It’s very easy to spend hours/days/months on a single map and fine-tune it to your liking, which is a tremendous value.  The fact that it supports a map editor and Steam Workshop is all the more reason why the price tag is more than generous.  Some may see “Cities: Skylines” as a “SimCity” clone, but honestly, who cares?  If we put aside the fact that the former does things the latter doesn’t do, there aren’t enough stable and fun city-management games out on the market, so why complain?  I, for one, am finally grateful for a current-gen city-builder that not only actually does the job correctly, but goes above and beyond my expectations.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/cities-skylines/---

												This game is worth its money threefold. Remember SimCity 2013?Yeah you probably do because it was chockfull of bugs and annoyances, however you still enoyed it didn't you?I had the same. Some of those annoyances weren't small however. The maximum land size was one of them. A measly 2x2 KM block of land was ALL you could get in SimCity 2013. Now you might ask why do I bring up SimCity? Because, obviously, this game is a lot like SimCity (who would have guessed!) except it doesn't have its flaws. This game is, in my eyes, by far the best city builder since Simcity 4. One of the biggest issues with Simcity 2013 was the plot size. Well guess what, this game can be 8 times larger at the very least and 24 times larger with a simple mod! That's also part of the exquisite beauty of this game; mods. This game fully suppors modding if you didn't figure it out already. There's already several thousands mods on the Workshop, and that number is expanding by the hour! Another big issue in this game was traffic, even though traffic behaves mostly the same, from what I've seen/played/heard/read the traffic is much more manageable in here, simply because you can expand your cities, easily upgrade your roads and build intricate intersections, overpasses and so forth. Something new this game has is called 'Districts'. Districts carry a load of potential, as they can specialise your chosen area to a certain type of Industry, limit your density of Residential, Industry or Commercial Zones and put certain Policies per District. It is quite a bit slower than Simcity 2013 though, don't expect to hit 400.000 citizens within 5 or 6 hours, your city builds up slowly. One of the main complaints I've seen is that cities seem much more populated than the civ number, this is because the civ number shown is the actual number of simulated agents. The actual people you might see is probably quite a bit higher. I have no idea whether or not this review makes a lot of sense to you, but if it does, be sure to check this great and time-consuming game out because DAMN is it awesome.			"

												I'll keep this short:Every good thing you've heard about this game is true. It's good.But...I had a bunch of huge intricate cities, then the after dark update killed them (no they weren't modded). I made another huge beautiful city, and the snowfall update killed it (still no mods).I've had enough.			"

												This Game, What can I say, well its much much better in soo many ways compared to SimCity, and what makes it better is the fact mods are supported from the start, and the UI is easy to get used too, there is some minor issues I have come across and my game crashed twice, but it isnt my rig, cos I have a geforce 750 TI windforce GPU.It is smooth and doesnt lag, the visuals are not as good as SimCity, but that doesnt bother me because what can be done in this game just makes the graphics side not matter to me as much.I will need more playtime to have a more realistic opinion on the game, but so far soo good, I recommend that people should buy this game, it is worth the money, The developers deserve it too. :)I will be doing a series of Videos for this game too, check them out on my youtube channel :) First Video Link:

												You don't need a ton of time in this game to truly understand how good this game is. Long story short - if you're a fan of SimCity 1 and SimCity 4 and were dissapointed with SimCity 2013 - this is what you've waited for. You can say that this game is community called Sim City 5, because this is more of Sim City that Sim City 2013. It playes well, it runs well, maps are huge and expandable, it's sometimes hard, but as soon as you get used to it- you're good to go. Yet it lacks some non critical stuff, like terraforming in Mayor mode and day and night cycle. I really desire to see those implemented in future updates if that is even possible. Everything else is a mix of SimCity 1 and 4 with tons of cool additions, like districts, resource system, sound pollution, few new services, it's a great mix i must admit. Developers also care about modmakers, they supplied us with object editor, map editor and implemented steam workshop, this will give a huge lifespan to this game. It's also not that expensive, so if you really want to get the best city building simulator for this year - this is your choice.			"

												Was one of my favourite games until it was ruined by the Snowfall DLC and free update which broke most of the core game mechanics, and the developers taking the decision to degrade the graphics (LOD distance and such) for no apparent reason resulting in a very blurry game (assuming it was to improve performance).If only rollbacks were possible. It was a good game on Day 1 but it has went downhill since with prominent issues not being fixed, pointless/cosmetic DLC being introduced, and the community being mostly ignored by the developers. Paradox Interactive staff have been brilliant with offering support/help for the game, it's just a shame they are acting as the middleman between the end user and the developers.Until the core game mechanics are fixed, I will not be recommending this to future buyers.EDIT: As of now it seems that the Developers have almost completely abandoned this game and ran off with their money. I'll never buy another game from Colossal Order.			"

												The game all MP's, councils and their contractors should do part of their mandatory training on. You ask why? Well here goes:Road capacity in Truro (Cornwall) is really bad.Cities Skylines solution: Use the road upgrade tool to widen road or make road one way. Traffic flow improves, tax revenue improves and happieness increases.Local council solution: Remove a lane and make it a bus lane! Traffic gridlock, buses cant get to bus lane due to traffic, happieness decreases, business revenue decreases, then council scraps bus lane at a cost of £60k. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-34883680If only they had played this game maybe they could have got it right.............

												I've never felt the need to review a game before, as I tend to play casually and don't really have much to add, but given the enjoyment I'm getting from this game I felt I needed to review.The game, for me, is simply what the SimCity series should have evolved into - it's intuitive, whilst still requiring brain power to plan your city (everything from where the buses stop, tax rates and budget, right down to putting trees next to roads to reduce noise pollution) - the biggest selling point however is the available real estate to build on, which I feel has been sorely lacking in recent city building games.  You start with a fairly decent sized square of land and can expand this out into a sprawling metropolis - giving you the satisfaction of seeing your efforts bloom into a real ""city"" rather than just an increasily busy, small square.Others have covered far more in-depth than I have - but from my point of view, as a casual player who likes to dip and out of the game, slowly building up a city that I can see previous efforts and decisions continue to impact, the game is an absolute winner.Highly recommend it!

												Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders.			"

												City Skylines is what Sim City 4 should have been. Paradox has done a great job on this guy and continues to support it with DLC and new features. If you like city builders this game will ruin evey other one for you by setting the new gold standard, What few beefs I have with the game are easily remedied by mods which the creators fully endorse and a slew of mod authors with materials, for example not being able to unlock every tile on the map, not sure why they restricted that, performace maybe, but there is a mod for that. With the exceptioon of multi player (not a feature I look for in city builders) I can't think of a single feature missing at this point assuming you have all the DLC.Graphically it is pretty good, not going to win awards but still one of the if not the best looking city builder I have played. Able to controll traffic routs above and below ground if you wish. I honestly cannot think of too many bad things to say about this game, If I was to bring up one point of contention I do think the crime is unrealistically low, but it hasn't annoyed me to the point of finding a mod to fix it. I am not a huge City builder player (looking at my hours played on this compared to RPGs) but I do like this one alot and come back to it when I need a mellow game to play.			"

												This is one of the games that you don't regret after you paid. The Dev Crew was small and they did not expect this accomplishment. Now they are growing! and if there is any plan to make the Cities:Skylines 2, I bet it will be much better than this.Now let's take a closer look to the features, pros & cons;PROSGame allows you to create your own maps, map themes, assets, mods and color corrections(LUTs). -Workshop Support-Dynamic water system by water source spawn points for rivers. -So you'll be able to build dams, water pumps and purification facilities.Free updates are satisfying. -I do not reccommend you to buy DLCs for few features-Road Tools are good enough. -such as 'straight', 'curve', 'Free-form', 'upgrade/degrade'-Natural Resources -coil ore, fossil oil, fertile land-Dynamic Wind -affected by height and sea-Day/night cycleIn-game landscaping options and decorations.Auto import-export according to the needs.Functional harbors & train stations for each, tourism and industry.CONSYou can fix lots of the problems that listed below with assets and mods from workshop but each one of em will reduce your game's performance cuz they re not vanilla featuresDevs did not reseach and observe good enough about roads, city planning, buildings, textures and colors.(ie: minimum bridge height is 12mts -Without crossing the lamps of the road under the bridge- etc)Road types are not enough. - Road junction angles are too big (min:45 degrees) - Road transitions are too sharp/short between large and small roads. - No merged road ramps. - Bumpy bridges upon water.Building zoning sizes are the same for low and high density unlikely Cities XL (max: 4x4 units = 32mtsx32mts)Building textures and models are not so realistic -some of em a little bit futuristic-Building types are not enough.Surface polycount of the landscape is not enough to detail it.Too saturated and low quality textures.Hope it helps.

												Finnaly, for us city building nerds that are still waiting for Sim City 5 (don't even mention the garbage EA produced a couple of years ago), the wait is over! It is what Sim City 5 should have been. With a modest price tag of only 27.99 euros, it is just awesome. Sure, there are still things to improve, but given the quality of the first release, it looks promising.			"

												I've played a lot of city builders in my time but I can honestly say that City Skylines is the city builder game that I have waited years for. It's such a smooth game to play. It runs like a throughly tested, well polished game. The vibrant colors and excellent soundtrack in the game instantly puts me in the mood to build my dream city. The game tools provides one with an abundance of creativity. So much so that I felt overwhelmed with all that I am able to do. I'm only limited by my imagination not the game mechanics which is awesome! Some of my favorite aspects of the game is the simulated people, yes folks each little pixlated person is an indivisual in City Skylines! I love the water dynamics and how they can create a challenge which adds to gameplay and not take away from it. I love all of the transportation options with more types promised in the future. I love the soundtrack and if I had only one regret, it was not getting in on that pre-order offer to get it.  But what I love most, is the potential of this game through the modding community. This game is built with modding in mind. Can you imaging the many props and gameplay mods that will flow from the talented modders for this game? I can hardly wait, and guess what? The modders are already making assets and gamemods for Cities as you read this. I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you are interested in City Builders and you've been burned by other games, look no further. Cities will most likely satisfy everything you've ever wanted in a city builder game. I whole heartily reccommend City Skylines.  :)			"

												Technically it is an impressive city simulation, you will have fun building stuff and watching your city grow.  But after the initial wow factor, I am finding it rather shallow in terms of challenge.  There are a lot of tax tweaking options but i've never had to touch them, I have a very healthy income whatever I do.  Where are the problems faced by mayors?  People are asking for help on how to get the crime rate above 50% achievement - this shouldn't be something people need help with, it should be easy to make happen just through bad city management.  I wish my doctors would go on strike, or that a riot would happen, or that schools demanded a bigger budget.  Even the wind reducing a bit during certain seasons would give me a challenge because my city is powered 100% by clean wind power.  Skylines just makes running a city seem too easy.I hope this initial release is kind of a ""here it is, be creative and build things"" and that future expansions will add some extra layers that start to challenge us.

												I've never played a city simulation game before, but this one is apparently considered one of the best, and I had fun playing it. You can be anally involved in the tiniest details of traffic organization, or spend the entire game in god-view 1000ft above the city. At first you will mess up and make rookie mistakes in city planning, but helpful tutorials and obnoxious pop-up messages will have you learning quickly. There is a downside to being successful though. For the end game buildings (Monuments), you must build a variety of Unique Buildings, half of them only being awarded to you for being bad at the game. For example; high unemployment, massive trash buildup,  high crime, poor health, and many abandoned buildings. You must deliberately ruin your city to get these last buildings, which sucks. The rest of the buildings however, are simply unlocked from population checkpoints. When you're not worrying about handicapping your city, you'll be scratching your head on how to solve the various problems that crop up, two examples being trash and pollution. See, citizens need trash services, but these buildings only cover a very small area, and create pollution. Thus, you have trash burning facilities inside the neighborhood- which cause people to get sick from the pollution. No matter how many Health services you have near the area, people still get sick and die, and there's nothing to fix it other than by creating gaps where nobody lives. Now mind you, mods can fix these inconsistences, but the devs punish you for using any mods by locking you out from earning achievements entirely. In conclusion, Cities:Skylines is a competent and fun city sim. It has some problems, many of which can be fixed by mods, but in doing so you are not allowed to earn achievements. The progression in end-game is flawed, but the rest of the game is steady and engaging.Also, apparently the Deluxe Edition doesn't come with ANY of the DLC.			"

The fun and the interest in the game are guaranteed, but it can make you a bit upset when everything is ok with your city and in 5 minutes, the traffic, the lack of electricity or sewage can make you lose everything. Also the DLC's are very nice and valuable for the game but a bit too overpriced in my opinion.			"

Also, it has much more features which makes it realistic. The modding community is great and active. One downside is that there is no multiplayer in this game.

												I have been waiting to play a more modern version of Sim City 4 for a long time and this game truly delivers, with the more modern and easy to read interfaces and overlays so you can very quickly spot areas that are lacking in services and tons of new features make Cities: Skylines an awesome city building experience.With a huge area to work with you are free to make a single vast sprawling metropolis or small interconnected towns, the ease of use and the space actually allowed me to use the curve and free form road tools as I didnt feel the need to pack everything in to a boring grid structure so my cities look a lot more interesting as well. Visually its a very colourful game with a really cool aesthetic that makes it a pleasure to look at from every angle, there are tons of little details in the city as well.There is even an almost puzzle solving element to the game, figuring out traffic. It is incredibly satisfying when you find the solution to your traffic problem and then just watching everything smoothly and quickly get around your city. I was amazed when I followed a Cim who walked to a train station, travelled to the next city over, got a connecting train, then a bus all to get to his work on the complete opposite side of the huge map. It is incredibly fun and satisfying just watching your city unfold in its daily business.While there are a few minor flaws and issues that could be fixed or improved, like the ability to hide or show only certain transport routes to make editing them easier, the fun and enjoyable gameplay completly blows any issues away. Future free updates are already promised and with modding support I think I will be playing Skylines for a long time to come.It's easy to quickly lose a lot of time and get completly absorbed in this game, absolutly fantastic, highly recommended.

Like the fact they get only want to use one lane out of six on wide streets is a real letdown.  But the rest of the game is good enough you can overlook that.  I really hope the devs patch that in the near future.  I give it 8/10 (would be higher if they fix traffic)			"

												Finally, a city simulator that has everything we want and nothing we don't.

The districting tool is fantastic and adds a new element that really makes your city yours.

No stupid patches every time I log in or online always requirements here.  I cannot wait to see what the community is going to create for this game.  The only negative I see is that sometimes there are mismatches between building names and what they look like (e.g. a laminate floor factory is named ""Burger World"" etc.).  The interfaces are intuitive and slick, and the city progression will keep any gamer interested in pursuing city growth to higher and higher limits for days if not weeks.  Nice work here all around.

												I haven't been able to sit down and play a city sim in a long time.  All the ones that I actually like are pretty dated, and the older UIs usually prevent me from having any fun.  Cities Skylines is different.  Most the strategy comes from road building where traffic is your major enemy.  This makes prudent planning vitally important and means you can kind of skip over the micro-managing (if you wish, but there are plenty of options too).  I've spent hours in a sandbox-city with infinite money just designing highway interchanges and had fun doing it!The game is beautiful, and with the workshop integration the possibilities are endless.  I'd recommend this to any city builder fan.			"

												I find myself challenged to write an objective review because I am absolutely in the clouds with this game. So, although I am somewhat biased, I can wholeheartedly recommend Cities: Skylines to any avid simulation gamer. The UI is quite intuitive and because of all the available mods and options, you have precize control on how you want to play the game in regards of economics, traffic managing and map design. If you are looking for a particular feature, the workshop is your best friend with thousands of mods and assets.A word of caution about minimal system recommendations, the better your rig, the more you will be able to get the most out of this game when it comes to actual gameplay and not just pretty looks or resolution. I have a 32 RAM, GTX 980ti accompanied with a 4770K CPU. At the moment I have 533 mods and assets installed and it takes about 7 minutes to load a new map. A saved game might be slightly longer but I haven't clocked that.I set all the graphics to max and after the first few hours I was forced to lower the settings slightly because the game began to bog down. A few more hours in and I have to experiment again with my settings because the larger the city, the more heavily your hardware will be challenged. Which is only logic, but I found that with one small street of extra industries or housing added can make the game from running smoothly to the commenly known tack-tack-tack motion the cars will be displayed while driving.It's easy to a add high amount of mods and assets, but it does ask for some insight on the player's side. Because sooner or later you will run into mods that aren't up to date or conflict with other mods. So if you're not too experienced or just can't be bothered, use these sparsely.Recommended because:- Precize control on indepth game mechanics and economics- Stunning graphics- Huge amounts of mods and assets available- Highly detailed and immersive- Quite addicting. Feels like time in real life flies by as fast as in the gamePoints of critic:- Gameplay experience depend quite heavy on up to date hardware- Mods and assets will sooner or later cause conflicts- Quite addicting. Feels like time in real life flies by as fast as in the game- Railway and harbour feels very basic and more of an afterthought			"

Cities: Skylines is one of the best city builders out there.  In my opinion it's not the best but it's still very good.  Sim builders are subjective so this game may be very good for a player or boring depending on how you like to play builders.  The reason it doesn't appeal to me is because this game concentrates more on management than simply plotting down buildings.  There are some buildings and items you can plot down like DLC content, parks, emergency buildings, schools, water and power management, etc.  But skyscrapers, houses and other common buildings you can't pick from a menu and place it.  Most of the building area is managed by zoning off areas (residential, commercial, office, industry).  In other words, depending on how well you run your city will determine how many buildings and homes your city residents build.  If you don't have enough educated people or zoned neighborhoods then businesses will not build up.  If you don't have enough jobs people will move out.  If either one is neglected too long then buildings shut down and you have to demolish them to make your city appealing.  I will say that the road customization and mechanics of the game is pretty good.  Some of the DLCs look very impressive but I've not bought them.  The Natural Disasters DLC looks like it'd spice up the games some.In a nutshell: If you like city management and like the city to build itself then you'll love this game. If you like to pick buildings and other structures from a menu to place at your heart's desire and not worry so much about the management stuff I recommend Sim City from EA.Pros:Great city builderRoads cusomizations are on pointManagement - for those who like a challengeGood graphicsWorkshop itemsUnlimited money option - for those who just want to buildDLC contentSteam cloud save - if you get a new PC you'll be thankful for this!Cons:More of a management game, not enough picking structures from a list and freely placing them.Music could be better.Sometimes the game goes after you about one problem and it seems nothing fixes it.  For example, I felt like I had to keep building schools because my citizens were uneducated. After about a dozen schools I was done...just over it. And my city was still very small.  My first game had a similar problem, public health. Had to keep building more and more clinics.  This could be a problem without unlimited money turned on.			"

												For over ten years fans of city building games have been met with disapointed after disapointment for anything that tried to capture the greatness that was Sim City 4 (where by knonw as SC4). Sure you have Tropico and like games but they just are not the same, you are building an island nation, instead of zoning you are plopping everything down, much like Sim City Societies which flopped for that very reason (See the paragraph below). For ten years these fans have wonder though the wastelands waiting for a true sucessor to SC4, first came Sim City Societies but it was much like SIm Town, a game where you just placed everything down much to the distaste of anyone who wanted to zone the land and watch as the sims took up shop and resident in to the city. You also had the Cities X(X)L sersies (by NO WAY related to this game, the devs of this game made Cities in Motion). WHose frequent bugs, non working code, and failed promases time after time left a bitter taste in these fans mouths. The dev of Cities X(X)L have a habbit of just releasing the same game year after year full of the same bugs. Then you have SIm City 2013 (aka Sim City 5) This failure of a game was due to many reasons, the inability of EA knowing what made Sim City a sucessful and much loved sersies. Instead of sharing our creations with the world we had to now play againts the world (when it worked!) and always be online which was a ""tenchinal limitation"" (until it wasn't) The failure of the glassbox engine to actually simulate things outside of poop was also an issue (Those who are going to say it simulated more then that I know, I am making a point). So today brings us Cities: Skylines a phenox in the burt ashes of hopes and dreams. Even if the phenox is a circular blue bird who chirps out what sim..I mean cims are thinking it is still a job well done by CO. Although basic in many levels as opposed to SC4 it is a much needed refresh form this small studio, I expect many great things to come in updates, patches and DLC.			"

												Start by imagining EA / Maxis' catastrophic 2013 edition of SimCity. Replace the entire broken simulation engine with something that actually works and scales well. Make the map bigger and massively expandable. Throw in a whole bucket of small ""why didn't anyone think of THAT before?"" features that aren't quite transformative but deliver enough of an impact to get you grinning ear to ear.Oh, and divide the launch price by two. Voila! You have Cities: Skylines.While this is not quite a genre-defining, groundbreaking upgrade over the 12-year-old SimCity 4 (it still lacks region play and inter-city trading), it manages to build on most of that legendary title's major milestones while also replicating almost entirely the presentational charms of its botched sequel. The game has its fair share of mild annoyances, most of which involve the way its massive piles of data are presented to the player, but it speaks volumes that one of its greatest issues is how difficult it is to praise it without comparing it to SimCity.Maxis is dead. Long live Colossal Order. A tiny studio from Finland (with a hilarious CEO) has accomplished a feat that previously eluded more illustrious development teams for more than a decade. Cities: Skylines is a must-buy for genre newcomers and SimCity veterans alike, and it will likely go down as an instant classic and the new high water mark for urban planning sims.			"

												Do you remember being excited by the SimCity remake? That feeling of ""wow this is going to be great, a modern take on city building""? Do you remember the sheer disappointment that was experienced when you discovered that you not only had to queue for hours after purchasing the day, it was online only? EA at the time said it was because their Agenting System Glassbox was doing intricate calculations and that most PCs couldn't handle it. Of course, that turned out to be rubbish. Anyway, do you remember being locked down to your 2x2km area and wishing you didn't have to exit to the region and start a new city? With Cities: Skylines, Collosal draws upon those promises and excels. Building from their Transportation simulator, this game is the modern city builderthat you wanted. That isn't to say that it is perfect. There are stil some odd UI design choices and other input designs, but it does all those things that it was claimed SimCity couldn't do.  Today, I followed a citizen in a car. He was uneducated, and going home to his house in his district. He also had a dog. Then he went to work a convenience store. After work, he went back to the same address in the same car with the same dog. There is no slowdown in my experience, but I haven't built a huge city either. From what I can tell the game does provide a challenge and it also has that cool ""tilt-shift"" camera perspective that was used in SimCity. The game is gorgeous. Not only that but there is a terrain editor and an asset editor built in. For the money, you get a lot of value. Also there is still room for DLC! Special things no doubt which would only add to the game. Oh, did I mention that the game features left and right hand driving? I think there is also a multiplayer mode. With the asset editor you can build your own road configurations. So instead of just dragging out streets, You can just place predefined Streets. Want to build your own intersection? You can. Want to build your own park? You can do that as well! There is also SteamWorkshop from the start. You can download whatever you want. Built a cool map of London or Johannesburg? You can do that. Because while yes you are intiially restricted to 2x2km of building space, You can purchase more lots of land up to an official 6x6km map size. This is 3 times the size of SimCity Maps! The game contains so much more value than SimCities or Cities XL/XXL. You might think it would be very expensive, but the price is more than reasonable. In fact the devs could easily have charged twice, and I still would have gotten it.I am terrible at city builders, but needed to have an itch scratched. This game does juat that! Pick this game up today!			"

												TLDR THIS GAME EATS SO MUCH TIME BUT ITS WORTH IT Cities Skylines was recommended to me by a friend who saw me play sim city. He told me this game is much better and had way more content in it. So i checked it out and never looked back.The game in itself is so warm, the soundtrack is so calm and relaxing, this game is definitly a game you would like to play just to mellow out. Gameplay wise; it is a sandbox in which you are able to realize your greatest City desires, seriously the creative of the community is so unreal. Once you're done with the base game, you can move onto the DLCs, whilst i don't own them personally, i have played them and found them to be super enjoyable. However they are not neccessary because you still get alot for your money's worth.Beware this game consumes alot of time, its so enjoyable and 1 hour feels like 10 minutes.			"

												It lacks the depth and realism of the old SimCity series. This game is very easy, build any common-sense city and you will be rolling in tax income with no budgetary, social, or infrastructure problems whatsoever. The buildings and vehicles are cartoony and look like candy. Certain mechanics are poorly thought-out, such as the optional day-night cycle disabling solar power plants and the ridiculous six-lane roads causing more problems than they solve. The DLC packs add one or two useful features, usually transportation-related, but are padded with otherwise useless content. Public saunas, really? This is not stuff real city governments are concerned with.Still, it's an impressive engine with some surprisingly intricate modeling, such as the waterworks and traffic simulation. But if you were expecting the next-generation SimCity 4 with countless hours of challenges, urban intrigue, and entertainment, prepare to be disappointed. It's a mildly interesting antfarm that happens to be the only city-building game on the market right now.			"

												Cities: Skylines, is easily one of the best modern takes on the city builder genre in a long time and just crushes Simcity 5 in terms of the agent system and simulation model. It is lacking in terms of finer controls and mid to late game changes, but the modding support has been great and the game is only going to get bigger with future content and DLC.If you're looking for something incredibility difficult to build and maintain like in Banished, Skylines isn't it. It's more about sandbox play and letting the player do what they want, but again all that could change with DLC and continued support. This would also be a great entry into city building or something to show kids the basic steps of city management and planning.			"

Cities: Skylines is one of the best city builders out there.  In my opinion it's not the best but it's still very good.  Sim builders are subjective so this game may be very good for a player or boring depending on how you like to play builders.  The reason it doesn't appeal to me is because this game concentrates more on management than simply plotting down buildings.  There are some buildings and items you can plot down like DLC content, parks, emergency buildings, schools, water and power management, etc.  But skyscrapers, houses and other common buildings you can't pick from a menu and place it.  Most of the building area is managed by zoning off areas (residential, commercial, office, industry).  In other words, depending on how well you run your city will determine how many buildings and homes your city residents build.  If you don't have enough educated people or zoned neighborhoods then businesses will not build up.  If you don't have enough jobs people will move out.  If either one is neglected too long then buildings shut down and you have to demolish them to make your city appealing.  I will say that the road customization and mechanics of the game is pretty good.  Some of the DLCs look very impressive but I've not bought them.  The Natural Disasters DLC looks like it'd spice up the games some.In a nutshell: If you like city management and like the city to build itself then you'll love this game. If you like to pick buildings and other structures from a menu to place at your heart's desire and not worry so much about the management stuff I recommend Sim City from EA.Pros:Great city builderRoads cusomizations are on pointManagement - for those who like a challengeGood graphicsWorkshop itemsUnlimited money option - for those who just want to buildDLC contentSteam cloud save - if you get a new PC you'll be thankful for this!Cons:More of a management game, not enough picking structures from a list and freely placing them.Music could be better.Sometimes the game goes after you about one problem and it seems nothing fixes it.  For example, I felt like I had to keep building schools because my citizens were uneducated. After about a dozen schools I was done...just over it. And my city was still very small.  My first game had a similar problem, public health. Had to keep building more and more clinics.  This could be a problem without unlimited money turned on.			"

												I don't know what to think about this game... It's good... but not entirely... It came out soon after sim city failure so i guess you know why it got so popular. I've played it for a while and i'm disappointed. There's no target of this game. You can get highest tier of city in no time, money is very easy to get and it becomes boring after a while. But the game itself is good. It's very friendly for mods(which are cool) you can make a nice city but i'm really missing a target in this game. someone could say that you don't need a target in game like that... well... true but if you played a very old game called City Life(there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remake of it on steam) you know that trying to get everyone happy, employed and get every group of people is very fun. That game was making you strugle to get that 1% of snobs and so on. in Tropico 4 you also have targets and it makes it a fun game(would be pretty boring without it). so you get me by now. its just a pointless city builder. it's not even economical game(like a lot of city builders). So building cities. it's pretty good. you have to provide water, electronics(not by making a building but with pipes and wires), you have to take rid of trash, road traffics, you've got airports, buses, metro(or tubes ya british ♥♥♥♥♥♥s), pretty much everything. So in overall - pointless but very good city builder                                6.5/10(just for being pointless)			"

												I was an avid fan of the SimCity franchise all the way back to SimCity on SNES when Will Wright was the developer. I had my pet peeves with SimCity 4 and was very much so looking forward to SimCity 6 (2013) which ended up being an EXTREME disappointment and should have been called SimTown instead. I was finding myself completing a City in less than 2 hours, and got so frustrated with the game that I took to their Facebook page and left a rather lengthy post that hundreds of others seemed to share the same feelings in regards to the lack of attention put into the game.Then comes Cities: Skylines. My girlfriend actually purchased a copy for me as a gift and I had my eye on it for awhile, just never made the purchase because I didn't have time to play (full-time developer).I can honestly say this is everything that SimCity SHOULD have been, or at least what EA Games promised us it would be.-> [ Steam Workshop ]The steam workshop is the HUGE seller for me. Almost any building, tool and mod is available to integrate into the game. I have well over 200 addons packed into my game, and almost an endless supply of buildings I can place, which ensures my city doesn't look the same everywhere. This is probably my FAVORITE thing about the game, is the huge support for this game through the workshop.-> [ Detailed Building Tools ]Everything from the terrain tools, the different types of roads you can place, and the ability to toggle the grid system on/off makes it possible to pretty much create anything you want. No two cities should look alike if you truly utilize the tools you are given.-> [ Sandbox Mode ]When I play these simulators, I don't like going through and playing the scenarios and having to watch my money. This game gives me the ability to have an unlimited source of money, and just build away. -> [ Game Engine ]Everything is beautiful in regards to the games appearance and performance. FPS is extremely smooth, and the entire city looks amazing (especially at night with the lights on). I haven't ran into any bugs, and I can pretty much crank the graphics up to ultra for everything, and the level of detail is very very real.-> [ Traffic ]It is relatively easy to control traffic in this game. You just have to map out where your dense traffic is going to be, and adjust accordingly with the right roads, and the other methods of transportation are great as well! (Bus, airport, tram, etc).I did find one minor annoyance. It appears that Sims get sick quite frequently, especially in a highly populated city. Theirs almost never a moment where I don't hear an ambulance screaming past me where I'm building.  In fact one time, I was just browsing the city, and one of my main busy roads had 17 ambulances one after another, going to different calls... that's a little excessive.... I don't even see them that much in Los Angeles...Overall, it's a great game, and definitely worth the price. I think the DLCs are a little over-priced for what they provide, but that's certainly not a reason to not by the game.It looks like EA Games is no longer the king of City Simulators.Regards,RichardYouTube: IAMRichardT			"

Cities: Skylines is currently the best city building simulator. It sure isn't difficult but extremely fun. The game has so much content to offer so just let your imagination do the rest and build your own dream city. Besides, if you want to add even more variety you're always free to download mods and assets from the steam workshop. Things like unique buildings, props, vehicles and other additions will enhance your gaming experience by a huge amount. In my opinion, I'd say that the game isn't perfect but you can make it near-perfect by using different mods to fill the gaps. For example, the traffic management is so tricky and poor that sometimes you feel like playing traffic simulator but with the help of mods you can solve this problem much easier.The maps are enormous and can be increased in size even more via mods. It may take dozens or more hours to finish the city, especially, if you're making it look pretty and pay attention to small details and not just the population. Speaking of details, the game looks polished in high-up view and even while you're zoomed in all the way (or using first person camera mod).I've been nagging about mods the whole review, meaning, that the incorporation of workshop was the best approach to make this game by far the best city building simulator that you can currently get. But beware, having a lot of mods result in huge FPS drop!10/10 "

												Much as I like to give every distraction remain focused a chance to affirm, certain diversions request examinations. By ideals of Cities: Skylines, planner Colossal Order has obviously demonstrated its excitement after SimCity – not only the key thought and procedures for building and keeping up a duplicated city starting from the soonest arrange, yet a phenomenal part of the look and feel as well. In like manner, on fundamentally every check, Skylines considers insistently to the past driving figure of the city-building kind. It is, truly, the best of its kind to arrive in an entire decade – a remarkable, adaptable, staggering, and all-around marvelous reenactment that permits you to gather sprawling, single-player urban regions to your heart's substance. Building must be its own reward, regardless, in light of the way that the nonappearance of eccentric occasions or catastrophes leaves the control of running these towns feeling drained and wise. Having influence pioneer, part god-ruler with the ability to subjectively bulldoze your reenacted local people's fantasies and make schools with a tick, building a city with no arranging is for the most part standard: set down roads with the simple to-utilize contraptions, dispense zones for private, business, or mechanical structures, give utility associations, secure the cost help, then rehash the cycle with new stuff that has been opened by your making individuals hitting new points of view. Horizons finds an all things considered chipper medium between the multifaceted plan of SimCity 4 and the relative straightforwardness of SimCity 2013 by method for in this way adding zoneable zones to paths as they're laid, yet meanwhile getting a handle on mandatory busywork like laying water channels. Those stray pieces are all attempted and genuine - you couldn't have a city-design without them - so it's required that they be done well. Urban districts: Skylines does that. The crucial way this sim pounds it out of the excitement center is in its scale. Every preoccupation starts as misleadingly little, contracting you to a four-square-kilometer zone (a misty size from a SimCity design, by fortunes I'm certain), yet rapidly permits you to purchase access to a near to plot of place where there is vague size. By then it does this seven more times, for an aggregate conceivable space of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there's an extensive measure of room. Recalling that you can't especially modify space while you play, there's an included guide supervisor where you can make any land mass you pick before you skip in - or download one from the unmistakably combined Steam Workshop mod support. With such wide urban zones, it's extraordinary that Skylines licenses you to depict and organize runs exclusively. Basically paint a lump of your city with the District instrument, and you can not just name it so you can spot it effectively on the guide, however give it novel procedures that control everything from advising smoke locators to lessening fire dangers (at a cost) to supporting recreational prescription use for lower wrongdoing rates, or banning highrise structures to make depicted downtown and common zones. In mechanical zones, you can sharpen the relationship to misuse a guide's normal assets in the region to mine metal, enter for oil, create on rich land, or collect trees for officer advantage. You can even make constrain motivations for a particular kind of zone inside every zone. We ought to zoom in for a minute: we can see specific people strolling around the paths, going to work or school, sharing in beguilement works out, or returning home by the thousands. They drive autos, take arranges, and even walk pooches. (You can openly name them, yet I propose naming them Waldo, in light of the way that there are various to the point that in the event that you watch that particular one again you I say you essentially win.) This is the place you appreciate the time scale persuades the chance to be ludicrous. On the slowest speed a day endures 10 seconds – three and a half on the speediest – which deduces the excursion to work could most recent a week. Regardless, the nonattendance of a day and night cycle proposes time doesn't appear, in every way, to be an excessive amount of unnatural, however rather a reflection, making it hard to serve the speed at which things are made and charge exchange streams out. Mass travel is a sketchy savage. It's missing to set down transport stops and get prepared stations; you need to plot out courses freely, or nobody will go wherever. It's unquestionably not hard to lose all capacity to peruse a compass in that, particularly as courses begin covering and it's dumbfounding to get your vehicle stop set on the privilege half of each obliged street. Nevertheless, there are a considerable measure of choices, and the endorphin surge from making a red advancement information overlay turn green makes everything upheld, despite all the burden. Close, structures are awe inspiring and point by point, direct down to little improvements like housetop fans turning. A slider in the choices menu gives us control over the measure of essentialness of-field obscure connected with inaccessible structures when zoomed in, which mirrors SimCity's drawing in diorama influence. Horizons doesn't sort out the graphical method for SimCity, nevertheless, and given the goliath numbers we see them in they don't correctly have the assortment foreseen that would keep most neighborhoods from emitting an impression of being vague. More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the crucial satisfaction in building. It's a truly magnificent and as regularly as would be prudent staggering reenactment, where a bewildering number of virtual individuals continue ahead over a huge swath of land. Getting in and making something is direct, however acing it will require wide research on social event wikis to comprehend why progression is vexed regardless of when you address your subjects' prominent concerns. Try not to expect strengthening conditions or sporadic occasions, yet do plan to be awed by the scale and different moving parts of this city-build.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												Dear Paradox/Colossal Order,Today marks the 6th time in two years you have arbitrarily ruined all my savegames without warning, and I'm never buying another one of your games. Every update you do this, every update forum threads complaining about it are everywhere, every update you make excuses and do damage control to cover up the fact that you do not care about us, your customers. You're perfectly happy to continue milking this game dry with irrelevent patches and pay DLC that many of us do not even want to touch in any way whatsoever. I've rebuilt my mod set 5 times now simply because you wanted to update the game without warning and give me no option not to update... and I'm never dealing with this nonsense again. Never. The fact that Paradox hasn't stepped in and forced you to use the Betas tab (like they and any other sane developer supporting mods does) tells me they deserve just as much blame as you. This situation has never been acceptable and it's an insult that it still goes on today.I regret buying Cities Skylines a bunch of times for friends, and even supporting you this far. If I could get a refund for all the wasted time and frustration I've had simply trying to enjoy the game I paid for, I would in an instant. I always wanted to love Cities Skylines, but you refused to let me. For that, I hate you.Signed,an ex-fan			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. I bought it unsure and I regret absolutely nothing. There are a few things that annoy me that I wish were better (Building appearance variety is noticably low, leading to many repeating buildings in just a few blocks of your city)Take all the best things from Sim City over the years, then add a bunch of even more awesome things. If you like city sims you'll love this. Buy it. Now.Seriously, what are you doing? Go!			"

												I'll be honest, I have never enjoyed city management. So I'm not the guy to tell you about all these management systems, but I hate strickly the management part, I love just building cities willy nilly! I just hate managing things its just not my thing, but I really like designing stuff.  Honestly, I want to just build cool cities, and the base game includes unlimited money and unlock all milestones mods.  I can totally see how in-depth this game could be, and I'll probably get slammed for ""ruining"" the experience.  They were installed when I launched the game, and I've been having a blast ever since!			"

												Out there you can find better and more exhaustive reviews than what I could possibly ever write so I'll keep it short and simple: if you love management and/or city building games, you owe to yourself to get Cities: Skylines, the best game of the genre since SimCity 2000 and SimCity 4. My own highlights:* Complete design freedom: if you can think about it, you can make it in the game. The game doesn't offer what you want to do? There's probably a mod for it in the Steam Workshop; if there isn't, you can easily make one and share it with all other players!* The best traffic simulation I've ever seen in a city management game.* Gorgeous graphics.* Cross-platform: Windows, Mac and Linux compatible.Why are you still here? Go get it!My vote: 10 / 10Note: I have edited this review to up the vote from 9.5 to 10 out of 10. This is the first perfect score that I give in a Steam review, and I think for a good reason: the game has no flaws whatsoever -- if we exclude slowness with AMD video cards under Linux, an issue that is being tackled by Colossal Order -- and it's just extremely addictive; I didn't have this kind of fun with a city builder in ages.

												I would recommend this game as a big improvement on SimCity. It's sold at a reasonable price, it has huge scope, & the modding community is awesome adding an enormous amount of content for free.I do have a few gripes however...Traffic becomes a real pain as your city grows. It becomes a major frustration trying to solve your cities traffic woes. Adding other means of travel has little effect as roads to & from your airports, harbours, & train stations often just moves the issue from 1 place to another. Trains themselves become a real headache as there's only 2 entrance & exit tracks on the map. The problem is that your cargo & commuter trains share the same track. You can split them once they enter your city, but they enter & leave your city on the same track. This causes them to back up which has a knock-on effect on the cargo & people aboard. Things are fine at low density, but as soon as you add high-rise high desity the traffic just really starts to go pair shaped.Another issue I found was the death rate. I don't know whether ibola is hitting my city, but whole blocks die off in a matter of in-game seconds. I live in a town, & in the 12 years I've lived there only 1 person has ever died. I keep pollution right down & clincs & hospitals abundant. It must be a balancing issue.All in all it can be a fun game, but as the city grows the game begins to irritate me. Now I just play it every so often & usually start from scratch. I would recommend at a discounted price...			"

Very occasional split-second lag when city gets extremely large, but still well within playable limits.Very Highly recommend.			"

												It's perhaps easy to see how Cities: Skylines has done so well, considering the failure SimCity 2013 was.I've played SimCity 2013 and Cities XL (not their latest iteration), but so far I consider Skylines to be a far better City Builder.SimCity got a hard rap for the online-only requirement, followed by a week of connectivity issues post-launch. The shame of this was that it detracted from an actually rather good simulator mixing challenges with creativity.Skylines has no multiplayer element, so likewise there are no weird online-only requirements. There are a bunch of available regions to start off in, each with differing amounts of available land and resources. When you start your game, you'll be presented with a highway connection and a basic guide to get you started, similar to other city builders. The game unlocks more tools as your population increases, making sure that you don't overbuild when your city is young. For the most part, all of these features are identical to other city builders.Where Skylines differs are the range of public transport available, and how they work. You can set up individual train lines, metro lines, and bus lines. This isn't a surprise, given that the game comes from the same team that developed Cities in Motion.One of the most interesting features I've experienced in the game so far is their water flow modelling. You start off having to place water pumps and sewage outflows into your nearest water source. However for rivers this means that you need to build your pump upstream of your sewage to avoid poisoning your population.Where it gets even more interesting is when you build hydroelectric dams. These dams will have a variable rate of power production based on the strength of the river it's blocking. Building a dam also has an interesting side effect; it causes the water level upstream of the dam to rise, which makes it really easy to flood your city if you're not careful. It's not something I've experienced in a game before. Oh, the game also lets you decide what side of the road your people drive on, which is a first as far as I know.This leads me on to some of my frustrations with this game. There's currently no option for terraforming an active city (as far as I can tell), which means that making flood-preventing earthworks is currently impossible. Likewise, thngs like road tunnels are completely missing from the game as well, although the developers have said these will be planned as part of a free update. It'd also be nice to have some better info overlays around road usage, as by far the biggest challenge in this game, like many other city sims, is dealing with traffic flow around the city. As an aside, it would be nice for one of these games someday to allow us to try out different junction types.However, by far the stand-out boon for this game is it's excellent Workshop support, which has already seen thousands of submissions in the short time the game has been avaiable, including contributions from the occasional former Maxis employee. I spent yesterday being captivated by a selection of highway interchanges by some dude in Germany (I think),  that's no joke. I could easily spend more time in the Workshop than the game itself, there's so much to see.The game was made by Colossal Order, but it's under the stewardship of Paradox Games. Given the game's success so far, it seems like this game will more than likely recieve plenty of support for years to come, with expansions and DLC being provided in a CK2 style, along with free updates and the like.SummaryPros:+ Familiar city builder style, mixed with some novel public transport and water features+ No crazy online-only requirements+ Excellent Workshop support+ Its current success ensures it'll be well supported for some time+ Cheaper than Cities XXL now, cheaper than SimCity when SC was releasedCons:- No obvious ability to terraform, making flood defences impossible- No ability to create tunnels limits road options or the ability to create tunnels under water bodies- Not as many features or items as other city builders, which might reduce effective play time.Verdict:Honestly, at this price I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city builders. It may not have quite the same number of features as other games, but the mod support means there's more than enough stuff you can add to the game until the first round of content updates start coming to keep you going.

The game still has some flaws such as no day/night cycle as of the time of this quick review, but the pros still outweight the cons found in this game.  If you enjoyed Simcity 4 or any city builder/simulator, get it. I was surprised this game is worth $30 USD. It's so well worth that price tag.			"

												This game is a worthy successor to Sim City 4(Sim City 2013 was a flop, imo) that offers depth and quality worthy for any city builder enthuasist.  The game offers a diverse and massive modding community, which is a key to enhancing any city building game, and not to mention it's easily accessible with Steam Workshop.  This game also earns a plus on a near flawless release(when compared to its competition), and I have confidence that it become more than what Sim City 4 had became, in less amount of time(Sim City 4 does have a decade+ of development).  My only complaint, and it's merely opinion oriented, is I wish this game used a darker saturation for the color of its buildings and vehicles.  I personally wish they would have used a similar color scheme as Cities in Motion 2(for realism).  However, with the mod community, you are able to change this.  With that said, this is a must add for anyones library, you will not be disappointed if you enjoy city building.			"

												This is a great game! It is great fun to build a city and it is quite relaxing. The modding comunity is great because there are many great mods such as the first person camera mod. The only problem I have had is that not all mods come up in the cotent manager but I was able to resolve it by going into the files of the game. It is slightly annoying but it is still definatley worth it. Also, I shouldn't be able to run this game but I can still run it fine whilst the graphics still looks great. I have a 2.5 ghz processor and intel HD 4600 graphics with 112mb graphics. I can't garantee it will run if you have similar performance specs but it did for me! Anyway I would definatley recomend this to anyone who likes building or managing anything.If you aren't sure if you'd like to get this game I would recomend getting the Simcity 5 demo on origin and try that out. If you like that in the slightest you should like this game even more since cities skylines in my opinion is better that Simcity 5!I thinks it's better than simcity 5 because, this has bigger plots, more of the people are actually simulated in game plus I like the modding comunity for Cities: Skylines!

												Finally, a good city builder after all these years! Cities: Skylines seems to handle very well everything the other recent city builders couldn't.  For starters - it works. I'll admit the game did crash once for me, but it seems to have been an isolated incident. After playing 26 hours, this one crash is the only negative I can come up with. The game seems to squeeze all the juice out of my system in terms of CPU and GPU usage (Intel i7 Quad Core 2.67Ghz, 16GB RAM, Geforce GTX465), but in return it gives me a smooth and enjoyable playing experience! Unlike the competition, you can build large cities, but there are no slowdowns, no stuttering and no need to restart the game every 30 minutes. As of now, to my knowledge, Cities: Skylines is the only good city building game available. The other two I'm aware of (Simcity, Cities XXL) don't even come close, as they have too many problems.

												It's more of a road network building simulator than a city simulator. All of the zones you zone and all of the buildings you build are there to drive traffic in & out of your city. 90% of your planning and building and organizing goes towards the road network, to the point of micromanaging and obsessing. 90% of the problems you will face when laying out your city will be road related. Building the city just involves dragging zones with a paint tool and plonking down service buildings like hospitals and schools. All the cities end up looking and feeling very, very similar. The cities are very easy to build and grow. The only real challenge you ever face is designing a road network that flows and is not chaotic. This is fine. This can be fun. This can be interesting, and challenging. But this does not qualify as a city simulator.			"

It's like that feeling I got when I played the SimCity 5 demo but the good feelings just keep rolling. I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to data and they don't skimp.

												Even with the difficulty and complexity, everything about Cities: Skylines seems designed to welcome and relax you. Though player input is frequent and mistakes can be punishing, you're always learning, and working to build a better city for all. With the inclusion of the Steam Workshop, this feels as though it were a true successor to the giant that SimCity 4 was. Simply put, this is the best city-builder on the market today, and quite possibly one of the best of all time.Read the full review at: http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/cities-skylines/ "

												Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder game. Its a simple concept but such an amazing game! The graphics are very good and the game itself is amazing, it's such a well executed game! It costs a lot but in some sales it goes down to arond£9.00, you can get it cheaper online though. Its very good as it doesn't force you to do anything, on your first city it gives you tips but in general they just leave you alone to play! Its quite realistic and has lots of ideas which you can relate to in the place you live. The new snowfall expansion is sounding very promising, released on 18 february! The after dark expansion is great, it doesn't add much for the price but adds a new element by adding the prison and taxi service. btw the after dark expansion doesn't add the day and night cycle, its already on the game. (it advertises this on its page!) I especially like trying to control the traffic as it is difficult to keep it flowing; if your traffic flows your city flows! Overall i really like this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes city builder games!I'd rate this game 89/100			"

												This ♥♥♥♥ing game is a game of pure integrity.I did not believe the hype at first and pirated this game. Regret six hours later because the game is too good. Bought it, expected to build a whole new city.Instead the pirated copy save files are compatible with the legit copy. My city left intact.Sudden eternal gratitude.			"

My simplified game review after my first major capitol city.  I want to keep it simple because of the lack of hours however, here I go for the new players =D Pros: 101.  Very nice balance you have to integrate in your cities' design between the  residential (low/high density) vs commercial (low/high density) vs industrial.2.  Day and Night cycle affects the functions of cities which is new for me. Ex The sound pollution at night in a leisure district affects low density residents.  There are many more examples.3.  This game doesn't spell anything out for you besides using the basic functions of zoning, road connecting, traffic etc.  You have to experiment for yourself to see how policies, roads, crime, or new building work together.  If you are a cookie cutter gamer, you might not like this pro.4.  The economy is how you control your city. Its the lifeline.  IF you have no money all you can do is raze structures, rezone, tax higher, redistrict.  No more city buildings to aid your zones.5.  Land values increase your taxes, if you design your city well to meet individual needs, equity goes up.  6.  Graphics are fantastic. It makes it easy to get lost in your creation. 7.  Rename businesses, districts, citizens, buildings.8.  Workshop content keeps the game fresh once you break that last few achievements.9.  You can create your own maps to build your own cities in if you dont care for default variants.10.  Set paths for buses and metros to combat the terrors of the common enemy in cities: rush hour.  Cons: 4 1.  The Zoned buildings will be repetitive.2.  Puting in water pipes can feel like busy work.3.  No natural disaster to spice up the game once you are satisified with your creation(possibly a future mod or expansion I hope). 4.  Traffic lights = Inefficient. No other way of putting it.  Combination of timing with lights and the AI pathing the vehicles.Conclusion:  If you are into building cities, Get this game.  Its relaxing, interesting, and stunning.  Be creative and be the next Robert Moses (New York), Hippodamus of Miletus (Ancient Greece), or Georges-Eugène Haussmann (Paris) of the modern world.			"

												I used to play the early versions of simcity, I think about 20 years ago. I really got hooked on them. With Cities: Skylines I didn`t get the same effect. I think it`s a bit boring once you play for a while.  Maybe I should try other games like this and consider if it`s a gametype what I just don`t like anymore or is it just this game what I don`t like. I would rate it 6/10.			"

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit. Until the developers randomly decided to increase the minimum requirements for it. Went up to 3.0GHz randomly out of nowhere. Can't run the game anymore. This should NOT happen with release titles. Games in EA usually have a warning up saying ""Minimum requirements might change"" because of how hard it can ♥♥♥♥ people over. Paradox didn't care.			"

												Really love this game. It's what Sim City 2013 should have been. Plenty of teething problems that need patching though. Poor multi-lane traffic behaviour for one. Vehicles tend not to pass eachother and clump up when merging regardless of the number of lanes. Highway ramps are waay too good. They are one direction, single lane but vehicles go full highway speed on them, regardless of what you're joining to, making them a panacea for traffic troubles. Jam at a junction? throw down some ramps! kinda fun though.Sweet water physics in this game but don't bother building a hydro dam. The resevoir becomes static and you get no energy out after a while, at which point you may as well mercilessly delete it and wipe out your newly zoned industrial district because what the hell you made a save point just before. Also the flood plains don't become any more fertile, and space is plentiful in this game, so what's the point? Huge tankers can (as is a rule in city-sims) turn on a dime at 180 degrees a second in shallow waters, but harbors still need to be placed in direct line of sight to sea... what? Why can't they navigate a simple estuary? Helmsman is wasted potential.I had a major problem with garbage. You can't simply remove dumps without emptying them first. When you empty, say to an incinerator, ALL the dumps trucks are used to empty it, and still takes forever, making the city suffer... if you don't notice thats whats happening. Also dead people (if they die in residences) are not dealt with by ambulences. You need hearses to come pick them up. Not only that, but like dumps, cemetaries become full, so with a click of a button the church is digging up the bodies, throwing them back in the hearse and driving them to the crematorium. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.Districts and policies are a great feature. Combined with the sheer map sizes, they make it feel like a real city. You can have a high density downtown with a rent thats too damn high, an industrial district with reduced safety laws, more accidents and huge profits, some farms, a woodland reserve, a Beverly Hills with ridiculous taxes and high land value, all while forgetting about Jim who lives next to the dump and is dying from air, water and noise polution (yes, noise does hospitalise people in this game. ♥♥♥♥ing genius.)Despite all the extra challenges, its still very easy to make a huge income. Partially because a lot of the expensive services pay toward themselves, you have loads of space to work with (See achievement ""SIMulated City: Have an area the size of nine map tiles"" - shots fired) but mainly because freight harbors are OP as ♥♥♥♥. Shame there isn't too much of an end-game as Sim City, as that had Godzilla, zombie outbreaks and Great Works... Definitely missing out on these features. I mean come on, you need cemetaries to hold the dead... it logically follows that when it maxes capacity there should be zombie incidents. Someone make this happen with mods, please?TL;DR: Solves the problems of Sim City, creates a couple of its own. Buy this if you like reading awfully hash-tagged tweets from your citizens. #familyvalues #economicboom #iamso♥♥♥♥ingbasic #education #gogreen #noticememayor-senpai.			"

There are too many good things to say about this game, so I will focus on the -very few- negatives that I've encountered.  I think it it is too forgiving on traffic issues, it could use more building variety, and I think it could use an ""in-game"" terraforming option.I have high hopes for this game being the best city sim ever, especially with day one modding support, and future patches and DLC.

												*Those with Performance Issues*You need to check which graphics card your computer is using when playing Cities: Skylines.  Beforehand, I could only run the game at absolute lowest settings, windowed mode, and a lowered resolution and it was still low fps, which really bummed me out.  I have my computer set to use my Nvidia graphics card (760M) on everything, but for some reason this game was set to use the intel one instead.  All you need to do is set the .exe file to use your high performance card instead. Now I can run the game at max settings flawlessly.  Excellent Game so far!			"

When you empty, say to an incinerator, ALL the dumps trucks are used to empty it, and still takes forever, making the city suffer... if you don't notice thats whats happening. Also dead people (if they die in residences) are not dealt with by ambulences. You need hearses to come pick them up. Not only that, but like dumps, cemetaries become full, so with a click of a button the church is digging up the bodies, throwing them back in the hearse and driving them to the crematorium. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant.Districts and policies are a great feature. Combined with the sheer map sizes, they make it feel like a real city. You can have a high density downtown with a rent thats too damn high, an industrial district with reduced safety laws, more accidents and huge profits, some farms, a woodland reserve, a Beverly Hills with ridiculous taxes and high land value, all while forgetting about Jim who lives next to the dump and is dying from air, water and noise polution (yes, noise does hospitalise people in this game. ♥♥♥♥ing genius.)Despite all the extra challenges, its still very easy to make a huge income. Partially because a lot of the expensive services pay toward themselves, you have loads of space to work with (See achievement ""SIMulated City: Have an area the size of nine map tiles"" - shots fired) but mainly because freight harbors are OP as ♥♥♥♥. Shame there isn't too much of an end-game as Sim City, as that had Godzilla, zombie outbreaks and Great Works... Definitely missing out on these features. I mean come on, you need cemetaries to hold the dead... it logically follows that when it maxes capacity there should be zombie incidents. Someone make this happen with mods, please?TL;DR: Solves the problems of Sim City, creates a couple of its own. Buy this if you like reading awfully hash-tagged tweets from your citizens. #familyvalues #economicboom #iamso♥♥♥♥ingbasic #education #gogreen #noticememayor-senpai.			"

												A fantastic citybuilder, my favourite since SimCity 4.Since the most likely points of comparison here are SimCity 2015 and Cities XL, I'll break it down into quick points:Compared to SimCity 2015:-Game's fully offline. The only online aspect is the integration with Steam Workshop.-Deep modding. Game include's both a map editor and an asset editor. Workshop is already bursting at the seams with stuff.-Giantic room for constructing cities. You start with a single 2x2 km square, and you can eventually purchase 8 more squares. There's already mods allowing to purchase all 25 squares a map has (that's 100 sq km).-Cims (Skylines' version of Sims) are fully simulated and actually make sense.-Traffic simulation is incredibly deep (though there's still some issues with cars accumulating in a single lane sometimes).-No building upgrade.-Specialization is not as deep as in SimCity, but the District system allows you to essentially create individual cities within the same map, with their own laws, taxes, and industrial focuses.-Several info overlays are almost copied from SimCity, even in their presentation.-Skylines is less colourful than SimCity, but also a bit more realistic.-Music isn't bad in Skylines, but SimCity's better.Compared to Cities XL-Map are just a little bit smaller (Cities XL has 110 sq km, Skylines has 100 sq km with mods, 36 sq km without).-Zoning is much, more comfortable, particularly with curved roads.-No lag (although large cities can be taxing depending on your computer). Brisk road building even for huge tracks.-Graphics are somewhat similar.-Interface is far more user-friendly.-Traffic simulation is orders of magnitude more interesting.-Road variety is more or less the same (just in terms of types. Skylines' free-form roadbuilding allows for pretty much unlimited road-building methods).-So far, I've encountered not a single memory leak or similarly wrecking bug.Overall, the game is great. It is true it is in some aspects less deep than SimCity 4 and it does have some usability nuances (such as zoning not always looking exactly the way you want, though this is the price we pay for free-form orientation, I suppose), but it does so much stuff so great that you quickly let that pass. Traffic itself is so well done that it becomes a game unto itself (which is no wonder, considering the game was developed by the same people behind Cities in Motion).Modding support is also excellent. Though the base game comes with a somewhat limited variety of buildings, ten minutes in the Workshop will land you with several dozen new structures that will seamless integrate into your cities, and new stuff is being made faster than we can check it.Some of the missing stuff, such as tunnels, is already being considered as free DLCs in the near future.10/10 game. This is both the citibuilder we wanted and the citibuilder we deserved.			"

												I can't recommend this game highly enough! I have waited a decade for a game this amazing and here we are: Cities Skylines provides me with my -ENTIRE- Laundry List of City Building Wishes! Even though the game doesn't come with a First Person mode, my only gripe about the game, someone has already given us a MOD providing it.I lack complaints for Cities Skylines. I lack frustrations with it. I find that I am beyond pleased and discover that this game fully satisfies what I desired in city building all along! 3 Cheers for Colossal Order! Welcome to the table! Here's the lunch Electronic Arts has left Uneaten. Dig in! I'm delighted to have you here!tldr: I am in love with this game.			"

												Just a short review here: Cities Skylines is a really nice game. It clearly takes its inspiration from both classic Sim City and the recent Sim City 2013, however, it ends up being something really quite special. The simulation is really robust. I've yet to find any major problems and/or bugs. My cities have had issues but they've all been the result of my poor planning, and with a little thought and re-working I have managed to fix them and learn from my mistakes in a way that is very satisfying. The depth of simulation vs. abstraction is also great. Some things, such as wind-drection and night/day cycles are missing but they don't have any noticable impact on the gameplay once you are involved.I think that the lack of need for a tutorial speaks volumes too. The game just makes sense. You can bring your real-life knowledge of how towns and cities are set up here along with a healthy dose of common sense and you will succeed. The result is the feeling that you really are creating and overseeing a living community rather than simply gaming a system which is fantastic.Over all, I really recommend this game to anyone that has even a passing interest in city building games. Its by far the best option on the market now, and its going to take something pretty special to beat it any time soon. "

												If you're a fan of cities simulator, you've just found the perfect game for you, buddy. Congratulations.This game managed to overcome Sim City 2000 and Sim City 4 combined, two of my favourite city manager simulators ever. In Cities: Skylines you'll start building your city from just an intersection coming out of a highway in the middle of nowhere, manage your budget, expand, make some decisions (not enough cash, do I build a fire station or a hospital?), expand even more, watch as your small poor village in the middle of nowhere becomes a gigantic metropolis that people from all around the world come to visit.All in all, Cities: Skylines managed to be everything SimCity's reboot failed to be. The only con I have with this game is that it somehow lacks introduction, there are small tips here and there, but the complicated parts you have to discover pretty much by yourself (or search for tutorials on Youtube, lol).Now excuse me while I lose some more hours of sleep expanding my city. ):			"

												It really was a fun game, but it quickely devolved in to a shallow, unchallenging experience.Once you learn the tricks on how to organize your city it becomes pretty easy. The basic core is you have to manage the demands of your city while building new infrustructure. Sounds fun, except it really comes down to 3 demands: Housing, Industry, and Commercial. If the demand for housing goes up? Build a road and zone it for houses. How about Industry and Commercial? Do the same thing.Sure, there are other things like resource management where you actually have to have the power, water/sewage, and other civil services. But a few hours in to my game I guess I found a sweet spot between growth and taxes because my cash flow exploded in to the millions before I even realized it happened. I could put hospitals and police on every street corner.My city had become somewhat of a paradise, and it felt too easy.			"

 Cities:Skylines by Colossal Order A beutiful and addicting game that I probably will spend hours on end playing. If you like games like Civ 5 or Democracy 3, you will probably love this as well! So here are the pro's and cons: Good: - No EA (meaning no microtransactions. Oops, looks like you have to pay £0,99 to read on!)- Graphics- Simulation- Gameplay- Map editor- European maps- The ablility to rename EVERY single car and house, and it stays that way. You can also rename dogs, so I did. I called it dogmeat (Fallout-fans, please, contain your örgasms. I had to write örgasm for Steam to not censor it. And it sounds pretty damn funny.)-And now, contrary to popular beliefs; the Chirper (it isn't that bad if you click the ""don't open the messages automatically. It can actually help you a lot. Also, it's kinda cute).- The feeling that it's alive- Almost everything else The Meh - Hot-dog trucks - Building variation isn't too great.- Not that many monuments... The Bad - Map editor water tool. Uncontrollable and just spreads everywere. Also no undo button for this (10/10 would have to make a new map 3 times).- The #use of #haschtags in #all the #tweets. @developers, please #reduce the amount of #haschtags thank #you #yoloswag.- No special districts for office zones (marketing, software, entrepreneurship etc.)- No actual Hadron colliders.- You not having it in your Steam libraryMy score  10/10 My necessary silly review quote: I renamed a guys car to ""The Hippie Van"" and watched his house burn down, probably because I doused his kitchen in gasoline. I then threw the remains in the landfill. Then I played Cities Skylines and it was fun.  (EDIT) This game has made me realise why the world looks like it does today. I neglected worries about polution, noise and health, focused only on making the city as big as possible. When I realised I became legitimately scared. No other game has made me get such a enlightenment, it truly terrifies me. GG world.			"

												Been looking forward to this games release for a while and after having the chance to play it for a while, i am -generaly- satisfied. I am happy to reccomend this game, as it goes back to the roots of proper city building we know from the early days of sim city and beyond. However! There are a few issues, which i am willing to pinn to the fact it's fresh out, though a few of those really should have been adressed prior to release.- No autosave! > Really? Game like this? With no autosave? I've already lost hours of gameplay because of game crashes.- Emergency services being ignored by other traffic reguardless of road type. > What do they have them sirens for then, if they stop at traffic lights anyway? Enough said.- No terrain mod tools available in game. > I would have expected these to be in, other then the map mod tool, they should be available while playing, payed for, certainly, but you should be able to buy some dirt and shove it along the shoreline to make a proper dam, or flatten that big mountain in the middle of your city.- Inability to modify the base maps. > if we can't have tools in game, why can't we open the default maps in the terrain modifier?- Water. > Don't get me wrong, love the water physics, though it does seem a little sluggish in places and crazy in others, bit hard to predict at times.These are the few issues i've noticed thus far in my 10 hours of gameplay, more might come up, but overall i am happy, just really, really missing the autosave and really really baffled by the emergency services.Rock on Paradox!

												No demand to be online, no crashing on day one, an unbelievable amount of fun as well as useful mods on day one. What is not to like?The bad - No auto save (but a mod seem to be out that fixes that). Lack of direction to some extent and info details that might have made the game more fun. After a point money becomes no issue and instead of being limited by money I am limited by growth, but might just be me.The good - It is an actual city building sim that is actually good. I am having a blast seeing my city grow, seeing me expand my borders as I can afford new land. Fun with new buildings being unlocked. You can name just about anything and any one and follow em/it around. This is a great great city game.Consider me ready to throw money at any deserving expansion, sequal or DLC to support more of this goodness!			"

 Yes it is the game you have waited for! I’ve watched Streamers for around twenty hours before picking this game up and after sinking a few hours into Cities: Skylines I can say this is a wonderful realisation of how a city builder can be done.The attention to detail is fantastic from its easy and slick UI to the ability to stalk and name anyone you choose. They have made the game wonderfully accessible and deceptively deep if you love the micromanagement side. I won’t list what this game does right and what others fail to do as others already have, all I will say is this game is well worth your time. Side note It amazes me how a small team of six (I believe fourteen now) can make this wonderful gem of a game that will no doubt become the next pillar for city builders meanwhile at EA and Maxis they mess up so badly. Regardless of the pedigree, cash and talent they had backing it. Fantastic job Colossal Order and more power to you.			"

												There’s a lot of tools and a lot to learn. Across the bottom of the screen is a toolbar that contains all the stuff you need to create your city. Initially there is only a limited selection for you to play with. As your population grows more tools become available and the pacing is just perfect.Features like global policies that can reduce power consumption or increase fire safety are introduced at a rate that never feels like a bombardment. The same goes for buildings and services. Rather than a sit down and read endless pop-ups style tutorial features are gradually introduced so that only small explanations are needed at each stage. It really lets you get hooked even during those often tedious early learning stages. Another reason Skylines is so fun straight from the start is that each and every tool you use is so effortless.There’s a zone system used that is very similar to everyone’s favourite Sim City game. But again the tools are there for you to make your life easy. Streets come ready equipped with grids attached that you can either paint one square at a time, use a paint brush tool or even a fill tool to create entire blocks easily. Then waiting just a little time everything comes to life as buildings are erected and citizens go about their daily lives.All this simplicity isn’t to imply that Skylines isn’t complex. Underneath the user friendly interface there are a set of menus and tables that reveal some of the numbers that lie beneath. Finances, happiness, healthcare, education, crime and transport are all detailed enough to make Skylines worthy of any city building fan.The only thing that some may not like is the slightly sandbox style, especially later in the game. Once the learning curve and introduction of tools is done with there are very little objectives to give you direction. THE GOOD- Cities offer room for expansion- Beautifully detailed miniature village style looks- introduction and learning curve- Great tool designedTHE BAD- Lack of objectivesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												This GAME IS AWESOME!!!!! WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!! WORTH THE TIME SPENT IN GAME!Pros: this game has so many pros that its hard to start  id say the pricing is about right for a new game could it be cheaper? yes but its fair (talking about deluxe and regular) i preorderd the game (deluxe) and i am very happy that i did so the preorder bonus is nice and the deluxe is nice to having the national monuments etc.... (of course now that the game has launched (per say) you wont get the preorder bonus but dont worry it was a fair bonus cool for those that did preorder but not to lame for the people who didnt get it)the extra stuff from dlx (i have yet to experience but i hope will be good!! extra stuff-----> Originally posted by desc: Original Soundtrack: This Original Soundtrack includes 14 unique tracks mixed from the ambient music of the game, allowing you to enjoy the wonderful music whenever you want. Digital Art book: See the concepts behind the buildings! The book features almost a 32 hand drawn concepts of the game various buildings and the story behind each.some of the other final great things about this game is that  WORK SHOPalot of games have workshop for/on steam now but i didnt expect this game to AND IT DOES!the workshop for this game consists of mods (remove the tweety bird sound  or things like that) maps (with a height map editor people are able to make maps very cool! I:e  U.S cittys Europe etc) asset mods (at least i think thats the name well any ways these mods change/add new buildings like a large                elementary school. probably the last good thing about this game is that according to a twitch streamer there is/will be free dlc like tunnels Cons: there are VERY FEW PROBLEMS WITH THIS GAME beleive it or notthe one major issue for me is the GOD DAMN TRAFFIC when your city gets to about 5,000 population ish traffic becomes a really big problem and instead of expanding or adding things to your city you spend time fixing your roads so if there were to be another name for this game it would be traffic simulator 2015 but the game is better to deserve such a demeaning tittle!!!C_O_N_C_L_U_S_I_O_Nthis game is worth the moneyworth the timeand highly reccomended.

												I definitely recommend this game.  I’m a long time Simcity fan going back to the middle school's computer lab playing Sim City 2000 in the year 1999 on a bright and beautiful iMac.  I even remember the teacher showing kids how to play the game.  What better way to teach kids the value of well funded schools?This game exists mostly because under the ownership of EA the Simcity series has really faltered.  Major technical issues and limitations and lost opportunities and hurt the series.This game is easy, much easier than any Simcity game I’ve played.  Some of it is easier because things just work better, like the water pipe systems.  The economics are just a lot easier.  I actually think this is more realistic.  I live in California, and here government funding isn’t really an issue, the issue is that throwing money at problems doesn't really help a lot.  Traffic isn’t an issue of money, it's an issue of what to do.  Same goes for crime, education, and especially water, or even pollution.  City skylines emulates this, money isn’t a big problem, but planning and management is the heart of the challenge.  ProsGreat aesthetics.  Night time is absolutely beautiful. The city looks great.So many options as far as roads, zoning, utilities, really fun variety.I like the easy economics which let you just focus on city building.Steam workshop and lots of mods.The size of the maps is amazing.  As your city grows you will unlock more and more land, faster than you could fill it.  It really puts Simcity franchise to shame.ConsIt's going to push your system a little bit, but luckily frame rate isn't super important in this genre.The mass transit bus/train stop system with routes feels a little clunky and odd to me.

												Absolutely phenomenal. The best City Builder I've played since Sim City 4. Has clearly learned from other city builder games with so many tools to fine tune construction in your city. My main complaint is the numbers/statistics are insane! 600 people dying a day out of a population of 56000?! So many bodies that 10 graveyards and 12 crematoriums can't keep up?! Jesus, just burn them in the streets man!

												So you like the cityBuilder simulations.Well this is a true City sim ;)  This is what ""us city sim players"" have been missing since we left off from simcity 3000.Finally a real contender with an amazing setup.Highly recomended.  This is how a city builder should be done..  Awesome. but hay, don't take my word for it, I'm the ""new"" fanboy here :dSome people have been complaining about performance,I'm running this on max settings at 1080p and havent had ANY fps issues.This runs very smooth for me, on a 5 year old computer.

												This game is basically just a modern, more realistic Sim City. Ironically, it is also several billion times better than the most recent edition of Sim City that is out there. There's no DRM, no EA, no Origin network, no bugs, no connectivity issues, and no DLC whoring (as of yet at least). Very fun, but also very challenging.			"

												This game started off awsome, complete  with the whole new car smell - so to speak. I was sooo happy that it felt like simcity 4 but with a fully 3d integrated world and a fully rotational camera. Then as I continued to play I became overwhelmingly unimpressed with how ""unfinished"" the game was.The game has very limited ""Parks & Rec."" places to plop down and make people feel happy about where they live. You also cant ""Free place"" parks and a lot of buildings either as they are required to snap to a road... So if you find yourself in the alto familiar (atleast for me) situation where as your city grows some areas just dont fully integrate and create pockets of unbildable area, and so you decide you want to make a park or ""Pretty"" area in that awkward area - well you cant. You have to have a road running in there as you cant just make it a spruced up area... even if you dont care that it people cant useit because you just want the area to look better to you... you still cant do it without a road. The game also has limited utilities and services available and instead relies on the modding community to make up the difference in how little is actually available for what you pay for the game... If you can pick this game up for under $10 bucks its worth a buy to tinker with - Anything above that and you will likely be disapointed in this game due to how little you are getting for what you pay for. You will then have to turn to the modding commnity to get key portions of the game patched over with much needed features that should have been included.			"

												I've just started, but since this just came out I want to help the guys and girls still on the fence.   It reminds me Sim City 4, but with modern improvements! It is easy to play, and the game explains the core concepts as you go.  This is the city builder that we have been waiting for. Click Add to cart, now.  Before I describe the game, I have had absolutely no choppiness and I have the game maxed out.  If you have a quality PC you should have no issues running this game.You have 9 different maps to choose from.  There is no random map option, but there is an editor included that you can create your own maps or download maps from other players. So, you will always have new maps to play on.The game has a few interesting subsystems that work together.  The more educated your citizens are, the less trash they will produce.  Poorer the neighborhood will lead to more crime.  You have to keep your pollution levels down or you could risk tainting the drinking water of your citizens.There are multiple road options to allow you to truly customize the shape and direction of your town.Do you want to build a eco friendly paradise or do you want to build the biggest city that you can? The game gives you the tools for you to decide. Also, with the editors available there should be plenty of options coming from other players.For the old timers who remember Sim City on the SNES (I know it was PC first, but back then a SNES was a few hundred dollars and PC's were $2,000 easy) for everytime you reach a population milestone you level up your ability to add items to your city.

A prime example of the benefits of PC gamingCities: Skylines is what happens when you develop a game without consoles in mind. ✓ Fun and addictingHear me out: I've always avoided city building games like the plague because I thought they weren't my cup of tea. The free weekend came along and I thought ""why not?""... look at my hours now.✓ 100% moddableSpecific buildings of all types, colors and flavors, intersections, maps, different lighting settings, gameplay-altering mods... just about anything can be found in the workshop. Be warned though: using mods disables achievements.✓ Fair learning curveYou might think a game like this is too complicated, but the truth is... it's not. Cities: Skylines is as complicated as you make it. Sure, if you're a beginner (like me), your first cities will fail, but that's exactly what makes this game so replayable: you learn by failing, and it's fun as hell.✓ Endless possibilities and replayabilityRural town? Metropolis? European capital? Futuristic city? A replica of your town? The only limit is your imagination[gfycat.com]✗ No season passAs of now, they've released two expansions: After Dark and Snowfall. They'll release more, and that's good, but there's no way to buy a game+expansions pack, which means that no one knows the pricetag for the ultimate experience, and you might end up spending hundreds of euros in the game if they keep releasing expansions. You might think ""how is that a problem? If they release more content, I'll happily pay"". Well, look at Train Simulator. Would you pay 4,000€ for the full experience? I'm not saying Paradox will take the same route, but they could, and you should be wary.VerdictCities: Skylines has quickly turned into one of my favorite games. I've always liked scale models[www.archivisionmodels.com]. This game is like having your own, but alive. I thoroughly recommend it.			"

It doesn't take that long to unlock everything.edit: I just read about the winter DLC coming soon.			"

												Was a bit disapointed when they left Cim & Cim 2 pretty quick in a dark corner. But somehow ik get the feeling that they needed to give there full potiental into a full City builder instead of some transport management game.BUT >> They did make it right in a lot of ways ... on the first look you see a mix of cities XL and SimCity 2013 but when you start exploring and playing the game you get a total different feel !!This is actually the game that we would accept from EA in the form of SimCity if it was made like this game was made. But EA and SimCity Failed then and Cities XL and XXL are complete Feelingless games and runs even crap on a Monster of a PC.ssThis game has almost everything just right, Not to heavy on the Grafics but still looks Great, Good code writing and you can make BIG♥♥♥♥♥Cities and even than it still runs Great! Since a long time i realy get a good city building feeling and the indus districts and they different layouts and products are really good and working ideas. Traffic system is pretty advanced, Water is very smart and lovely to see it moves especialy when playing with Dams. With the Mod support and asset tools ingame from day 1 makes it even better !!! Guys and Girls ... If you cried the day that you played SimCity 2013 and lost your hope of any good City Builder game.. Cities: Skylines just Renewed that hope and fullfilled a great part for me. I am going to have a lot of fun with this game :-)Pros:> No EA, No Online DRM ( Steam only \o/ )> Delivered a non Broke game on day 1> Big♥♥♥♥♥Cities (even bigger with Mod)> Good City Builder Feeling> Mods on day 1Cons:> Day/Night cycle			"

												I LOVE this game. It's everything Simcity looked like it should have been. The entire city you manage is persistant and constantly evolving, meaning- people live, work, and commute to the same places in the same vehicle every day (you can click on cars and see who owns them!). and even eventually have familes and die. The game can be as simple, or as complex as you want, with the ability to create districts which allow you to set individual laws and regulations, turning industrial zones into farming areas with low taxes, residential into luxury apartments with high taxes, or specialized industy areas to gather resources like oil, coal, and wood (yes, forestry is a thing in this). Not to mention, EVERYTHING is renamable; Districts, people, and buildings.And buildings. You can't forget about the fact that you can MAKE and SHARE buildings, parks, and even maps with powerful, but easy to use in game asset editors. Its easy to go to the workshop, grab some maps, buildings, or lots you like and add them to your game!Placement of buildings is also important. A lot of buildings will create polution- but not just the regular type you would expect like smog and soil polution- many buildings will also create noise polution, and make people living near them very upset.It's like they took all the best features from the -old- simcity games (water pipes and power lines YAY!), re-engineered them, put their own twist on some things, and made a beautiful game out of it. Incredibly happy with this purchase, especially considering the wonderfully reasonable price. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS!? BUY IT. :D			"

												A great city-builder, this game takes all the best city-building game mechanics and puts them together in a well-balanced package.  The UI is a little obtuse in some areas, and not all of the important information is clearly conveyed, but you can get used to it.  Traffic is a big part of the game, and the quality of your road layouts will make or break your city.  Fortunately, the AI is very adept at pathfinding through your streets, and problem locations can easily identified by the traffic jams.  The economy is very easy and forgiving, so you can mostly just focus the fun part of designing and not have to worry much about micromanaging your economy.  Everything SimCity (2015) did wrong, this game did right.			"

												The citybuilder that fans have been clamoring for since Simcity 2013 proved to be such a disaster. Simple as that. No always-online requirement, no tiny city plots with vast tracts of empty land in between, no desync between cities and no 'this sim wakes up in this house, but goes to whatever empty house is closest to work when his day is done'. This game, it's developer and its publisher takes gamers and their wishes seriously. You want a game that's challenging, fun to play, beautiful to look at and has amazing replay value? Get Cities: Skylines. Period.Maxis is dead. All hail Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive!			"

												This is a strange game. It effectivelly is just a moddable Sim City. It does not try to be anything else then Sim City. The game it's self you'll most likely find very easy if your a big Sim City player (other then dealing with traffic which is the core of large city developement) .I played it to the point where there was nothing new to build and the game became a balance of just building more. It's okay. It fills the niche that Sim City dropped the ball on, but nothing more. If your looking for a Sim City type game to get abosrbed in, sure this is a game for you, but that's it.			"

												Finally, a perfect blend of two classic genres: urban planning and traffic management. Especially traffic management. Although the game is meant to be a successor to Simcity 4 and an epic ""take that"" at Simcity 5, it's more of an expansion pack for Cities in Motion 2 since you'll be spending most of your time building costly road layouts and alleviating impossibly-complex traffic grimlocks originating from said road layouts. Thankfully this time you have a proper user-friendly GUI and grid/non-grid transition system to assist you when placing and aligning splines according to your OCD level. Be sure to always focus on transit-oriented development rather than classic suburban sprawl as this game is almost completely Northwest Euro-centric in nature.Compared to SC4 though, many vital elements are either oversimplified or nonexistent; whilst new concepts such as sewage disposal are shoved up your♥♥♥♥♥without regard to any learning curve, and normally mundane tasks become so overpowered such that it's an instant game-over if your rubbish trucks are too slow. (No, seriously.) Starting a new town, however, is considerably less tedious as there are in-built milestones to restrict asset requirements to your population growth level. But ultimately, this game is set in the present day, when your cims expect everything from power to water and even Internet services from the moment you zone your first residential area and have nearly zero tolerance or grace period for any unfortunate events; so treat all your peepur like stereotypical teenage white girls at all times or it's express bankruptcy for you. Whether take this as a challenge or setback, your mileage may vary. Interesting new features like fluid mechanics and restricted aviation pathways also help to determine your final city layout, reducing the monotony of the mid-game era.Personally, I feel that Colossal Order have definitely learnt from most of their mistakes committed in CIM2; whether or not Paradox published games' infamous DLC-spam policy also applies to this release is yet to be confirmed. Many of the other ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews seem to be rants from starved city-building fanboys and SC5 haters who long-awaited a player-friendly magnum opus of the genre, praising CSL for the messianic role it plays in the wake of SC5's epic failure with little thought about the potential shortcomings of this hastily-released masterpiece. Even though flaws in the Unity Engine's ability to cope with the game design remain evident, it's clear why this game broke 1,000,000 purchases in about the time it took for Gangnam Style views to hit 100 times that number. And yes, you can mod that in-game too, for free.			"

Oh yeah, since this game was released... ).I honestly have a hard time with money because I don't build enough RCI early on, and spend most of my money dicking around with roads, HOWEVER there is a MAP EDITOR and an ASSET EDITOR and STEAM WORKSHOP SUPPORT right from the get go for me to do this in! Yep, you heard me, steam fricking workshop! This means that you can do basically whatever you want!Goodnight :)Oh yeah and by the way, BUY THE DAMN GAME!			"

Every single thing has been clearly tought out to make the best citybuilder game ever and I think they succeeded. Can it be improved? Sure. It can be made better. There are things that I dont like but compared to competition... If you want to build a city. This is the game you want.			"

												Was a bit disapointed when they left Cim & Cim 2 pretty quick in a dark corner. But somehow ik get the feeling that they needed to give there full potiental into a full City builder instead of some transport management game.BUT >> They did make it right in a lot of ways ... on the first look you see a mix of cities XL and SimCity 2013 but when you start exploring and playing the game you get a total different feel !!This is actually the game that we would accept from EA in the form of SimCity if it was made like this game was made. But EA and SimCity Failed then and Cities XL and XXL are complete Feelingless games and runs even crap on a Monster of a PC.ssThis game has almost everything just right, Not to heavy on the Grafics but still looks Great, Good code writing and you can make BIG♥♥♥♥♥Cities and even than it still runs Great! Since a long time i realy get a good city building feeling and the indus districts and they different layouts and products are really good and working ideas. Traffic system is pretty advanced, Water is very smart and lovely to see it moves especialy when playing with Dams. With the Mod support and asset tools ingame from day 1 makes it even better !!! Guys and Girls ... If you cried the day that you played SimCity 2013 and lost your hope of any good City Builder game.. Cities: Skylines just Renewed that hope and fullfilled a great part for me. I am going to have a lot of fun with this game :-)Pros:> No EA, No Online DRM ( Steam only \o/ )> Delivered a non Broke game on day 1> Big♥♥♥♥♥Cities (even bigger with Mod)> Good City Builder Feeling> Mods on day 1Cons:> Day/Night cycle			"

												Everything you wanted the new Sim City to be, you know, like a proper city building simulation. If you liked Cities XXL but wished it wasn't so flaky and unstable, this is for you. It takes the best bits from recent City builder sims and pieces them together to make a really enjoyable experience, if you've played this type of game before you'll feel right at home almost immediately. But even if you haven't, you'll pick up the basics in no time. It's not perfect, no, but the devs have many plans for the future and support seems very good, unlike the Cities XL games.			"

												Cities: Skylines is simply said a better Version of SimsCity. It's connected to the Steam Workshop, that means the creativity  is endless, you can install many many user generated content, so much that your game will explode. It's still worked on but i miss the updates. There's only one thing that I find very annoying: The Day-Night Cycle. The roads are every time full as hell and the Day is over before the cars have even reached the City from the highway. If that is fixed in a later version i would be completetely happy with Cities:Skylines.			"

												I must say, I am really enjoying the game. However, there are a few things I would like to mention.I have encountered a bug where dead people are not being picked up and taken to a grave or crematorium, just left where they are, even if said facilities are nearby.It would be nice if you could make it so you can fit small paths between houses so you don't have to destroy them. Plus, if a path or road being placed would change the housing setups, it should say. Normally it does but sometimes it will distort the road causing some houses to be destroyed.It would also be good if parks could be custom build, such as drawing them into holes within groups of housing, and gaining access to these parks with the better paths mentioned earlier.Last of all, but also probably of least importance, who expects you to provide your own cities power; there should be a way to plug into the national grid.Despite these, I have really enjoyed playing, and I plan to continue doing so. Well done on the great game!			"

												95 hours of gameplay and I have only one city that is thriving. I almost reached to 100k people yet there is alot more to do. The achievement system, in my opinion, is great. For example, after increasing your population by, lets say 5000 people, new buildings unlock. These buildings help you build even a bigger city. To be honest though, it's slow and boring in the beginning. You can buy new square lands and increase the size of your city as your population is increasing. The economy isn't as hard as it is in SimCity so you can easily gain money. My only complaint is that you cannot buy all of these lands but fortunately there is a mod that can allow you to do that. Also, there aren't natural disasters but now they will soon add it as you can see from the DLC list! Can't wait for it!Enjoy and have fun building your own city!*Hint*: Use underground highway tunnels and roundabouts and connect them to another roundabout on the ground level so your traffic wont be so jammed. Also, dont make intersections so close to each other so there wont be frequent jams.  "

												TL;DR: spending hours trying to work around bugs, get frustrated, not worth time time beyond getting a simple clogged city. Fixing it is very frustrating, or even impossible, due to bugs, and requires tearing it down and retrying- spending budget and time. Bad results and frustration are the reward for understanding this game's ""logic"".  There are however, other (non road) solutions for traffic problemsAlthough the game is fun at first, quickly, you realize you _NEED_ one way roads (because there is a bug where cars _always_ stop even if by every rule and logic THEY DO have priority.) and thus overpasses to get these connected. Having just come from a session of FAILING to construct workable overpasses about 20 times in a row, I am done with this game.Every time I get a road constructed the way I like it, it tends to be constructed wrong direction. This means I have to change the direction, but- with my overpasses- I  get a mesage I have no room. So I tear it down, try again, repeat X20.When it finally works, it looks like a piece of crap.Since there is no 'mixed' review I have no idea to vote it up or down. I'm conflicted.			"

												I have been patiently waiting for this game for months. Now, finally it's out. I am beyond satisfied! Admittedly the bar was low after the fiasco that is Cities:XXL (Focus Home Interactive), and the highly publicized issues SimCity (2013) had. That being said, this game vaulted over this bar like a human stepping over ants who are playing limbo. Clearly analogies aren't my strength, but this isn't the point! The point is, you should buy this game for several reasons. * It's fun as hell. I mean, that's number one by far.* It is inexpensive compared to AAA titles by big douchey companies. If you're on the fence, bite the bullet. Especially if you like city building games like SimCity or CitiesXL. This blows them out of the water.* The developers (Colossal Order) made this game out of a passion for the genre. This really shows in the detail of the game.* It's moddable/customizable. Amazingly so. Within two hours of the game there were over 200 entries on the workshop. That is how open they were about this game to modders before it was released.  I don't want to rant too much because I am clearly a happy player. I never really write reviews for games, but I felt the need to do so for this one. Get it and enjoy, you won't regret it!			"

												Very enjoyable game, 4.5/5 or 9/10.+Nice enough graphics give enough realism.+Zoning works well with fill, square or circle.+Hundreds if not thousands of models so even the tiniest zones can be filled.The negatives are mostly nitpicks, but it must be brought to the attention of you, the reader.-Motorways/Highways. So if you have traffic backing up onto a motorway, why do people who do not want to come off there stay in the 1st lane? I'm sorry, but you are an idiot if you sit in lane 1 in a queue waiting to come off at a later point.-General traffic flow. As a Brit, I set it so traffic travels on the left, but it applies to both. If you're on the outside trying to turn to the outside, and they are on the inside trying to turn to the inside, YOU CAN BOTH GO AT THE SAME TIME!-Six lane roads. Similarly to above, traffic in lanes 2 and 3 stop if someone wants to join lane 1. Just use One Way 2 Lane roads, they work much more effectively. Also, if you have a road joining to head northbound, it does not interrupt southbound.-Roundabouts. Everything about them. As above, people in lane 2 wait for someone coming into lane 1. Traffic annoyance.-Proximity. Again, these are nitpicks, but they need to be sorted. If you have your 9 2x2km chunks all in a line and have services (for example, ambulance) at both ends, why do the ambulance drivers from one end even consider crossing through the busiest city in this instance of game to help someone with a cold at the other side? I have caught ambulance drivers crossing over 3 chunks of land to get to a midly ill patient when the patient lives NEXT DOOR TO A HOSPITAL! We need proximity priority!As I said, these are nitpicks. However, when you want to create a well-planned city and the only thing dragging it down is the fact that people can't go from left to left and right to right on the same junction at the same time, causing the entire motorway to clog up all the way out of your city boundries, it's rather annoying.I would still recomend the game though, because it's just plain damn fun. Let's not forget the game is still in early access and even if this guide is putting you off buying, get it none the less so the devs can fix the bugs earlier!			"

Where you got all of the bad stuff from SC5, Skylines has improved it to where it works.I am not writing this to badmouth SC5, I spent hundreds of hours playing it and enjoyed it for the most part except for the major concerns players had:No single highway in/out of your city causing major traffic bottlenecks.  The game allows you to expand your city to larger areas (Major concern of SC5 players).  The game includes Metro stations unlike SC5.  As far as public transportation you can not only place them but plan their routes like Cities in Motion.When you build roadways it will grid out exactly the depth of your city buildings construction of what you zone next to the road.  The highways are reconstructable to your liking.  The road tool to create curved roads was a little bit confusing on how to make the desired curved effect at first, but after a little while of experimenting it is not difficult and a much stronger mechanic then SC5.The thing I like the most is you are unable to construct High Density areas right at start.  You must start with Low Density and earn by population growth the higher density/metropolis buildings expected to see in a major city vs. a small town, i.e. small towns don't have nuclear power plants.  Civs will sort of trickle into your city little by little instead of having a massive population boom which undercuts your public services.All in all it is exactly what everyone was hoping for from SC5.For all the DLC complainers, I also own SC5 Cities of Tomorrow and found that enjoyable with all its problems, although I won't buy any more SC5 DLC's, if Skylines releases any DLC's I will be purchasing them as the developers obviously have learned from the catastrophic release of SC5 online play is not required.

Every single thing has been clearly tought out to make the best citybuilder game ever and I think they succeeded. Can it be improved? Sure. It can be made better. There are things that I dont like but compared to competition... If you want to build a city. This is the game you want.			"

												Usually I am not a fan of normal city building games. But this is no normal city building game! Cities Skylines offers players a large area to craft and create their very own sprawling metropolis, or prosperous back country farm town. The game looks beautiful, and it is so interesting to watch the people and traffic go about their business down on the ground. The gameplay is fantastic and there are some interesting things that this game brings to the table that other games do not. I highly recommend this game to anyone, it is a must play for all. I cannot wait to get back and see what more Cities Skylines has to offer!			"

												I keep calling this game SimCity inadvertently.  No, not in reference to the misfire from 2013.  Instead this game brings me back to the kind of fun I had playing the SimCity games of the past.Five days in after buying the game and I'm st ill building my first city.  After spending 18 hours (eep) I've expanded its borders as far as it will go, I've built a couple of the big unlockables, and I see no reason to stop with this city for now.There are issues with the game but it's phenominally good fun, intuitive, pretty good looking (even if not as polished as SimCity '13) and most important of all: there are no gamebreaking issues.  This is the best citybuilder in over a decade, and it continues the genre in fine tradition.Back to the issues...It could use more anti aliasing and the tilt-shift effect isn't as good as SimCity '13s.  These are minor quibbles.Road traffic doesn't seem to effectively use all lanes but once you learn some tricks to laying out your roads you can mitigate some of the traffic issues.  In this regard it's still better than SimCity '13.Rail traffic seems to be the wonkiest thing I've encountered.  Trains keep getting jammed up and stopping without any clear indication of where they're trying to go.  I may have made mistakes in laying out the tracks and stations so I'm still trying to figure out if this is something I've caused but something just feels off.Dealing with dead bodies and trash takes some getting used to, traffic can hold up their removal (and police, ambulances and firetrucks).  Abandoned buildings are also a bit of a nuisance because you are encouraged to bulldoze them, but they also seem to take care of themselves if there's demand for growth (they'll get torn down and rebuilt automatically).  That said leaving them up if there's not demand reduces the happiness/land value of the immediate area so bulldozing is a good idea unless they turn around quickly.TLDR: This game is $30, awesome fun, works great, active and extensive modding community.  BUY IT!			"

												I must say, I am really enjoying the game. However, there are a few things I would like to mention.I have encountered a bug where dead people are not being picked up and taken to a grave or crematorium, just left where they are, even if said facilities are nearby.It would be nice if you could make it so you can fit small paths between houses so you don't have to destroy them. Plus, if a path or road being placed would change the housing setups, it should say. Normally it does but sometimes it will distort the road causing some houses to be destroyed.It would also be good if parks could be custom build, such as drawing them into holes within groups of housing, and gaining access to these parks with the better paths mentioned earlier.Last of all, but also probably of least importance, who expects you to provide your own cities power; there should be a way to plug into the national grid.Despite these, I have really enjoyed playing, and I plan to continue doing so. Well done on the great game!			"

Perfect Example of City Building Simulator- The experience of building your city from essentially the ground up is a addicting and rewarding experience, however it can also be a brutal one depending on what problems crop up when you are building your city.- The animations are very good, especially when the buildings are being built. There is immediate satisfaction when buildings start to be built in the zones that you assign.- The ability to assign any area you want as a district and make it follow the unique policies that you set can be fun.- This game also brings a challenge as you ave to figure out how to make the traffic flow without any major traffic jams.It is definitely worth getting and especially if you got SimCity and was disappointed in the result of that game.

												Fantastic game!Anyone who's played SimCity before will have an idea what to expect here. Start out with a small town town, slowly build it up, generate funds and expand your city. The game is immersive straight off the bat, with a gental learning curve. It's the sort of game that will suck you right in, with hours going by without you noticing it. You'll spend your day thinking about modifications you're going to make when you get home. It's really that good.The game works by permitting development through the zoning of land. Different zones will permit different kinds of development. It's all held together by a road network (and later on a subway/train/plane network) that you'll constantly have to plan for and tweak. Services such as sewerage, water, electricity as well as services such as garbage, police, firefighters, ambulances, morgues, parks and education are all accounted for. It's a game of balance, a bit of that here a bit of that there. As the City grows, the game rewards you with more zones, services, buildings, etc, slowly dripping you the goodies as you progress rather than overwhelming you at the start.The game is super accessible, and whilst punishing earlier on, is rather easy once the ball gets rolling. My girlfriend had a go and succsesfully set up a city on her own.Whilst the game is super amazing, like every game it has it's minor problems. There is a lack of an endgame. Once you hit a certain point, it feels almost like a last section of the game is missing. Super high residential, mega-matropolis expansion pack please, with plenty more features! Furthermore, whilst I view the easy difficulty as a positive, many will feel the lack of challenge once the money starts to roll in. Roads play an important part of the game, but feel very volatile and hit/miss when placing them in complicated patterns. I feel like these things will likely be addressed over time as the game matures and mods set in. The workshop is already looking plentiful despite a recent release.Must-buy game, definately will be top 3 games of the year, especially with all this AAA+ trash that gets released these days.			"

												In 2014 EA and Maxis tried to jump on the train again continue the huge success of SimCity 4 with their new game SimCity(2014) but didnt manage to please the community due to small maps, huge server issues on release date, online pressure and overpriced DLC's.This year things are going to change the city building genre entirely - Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order are publishing Cities: Skylines and get immediately hit scores on sales!The game offers a huge map, which was the most important point that a modern city building game should deliver with even more extended space through several mods from the Steam Workshop. Also the game itself looks nice and offers a good usability for players. The  interface looks nice and most things in the game are already balanced.But now to the greatest part about this game: It's going to get further developed with more content updates and even a chance on multiplayer mode which would mean that SimCity is going to be completely useless. With an growing community and even an subreddit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines ) this game is a great start for game industrie into the new year 2015.			"

												Very relaxing game. Easy, satisfying and very pretty. I never sought beauty inside a city until now. Workshop items help you make anything from Victorian London to Coruscant. Very powerful features - first person view - individual doods simulation and generally a well made game. I'm struggling to find a conn here but here goes. The traffic. It takes waay too much time to sort out properly. It's not even challenging it's just not in the tempo of the game. For every 20 minutes you spend building a part of your city, you then must spend 40 min to sort all the little traffic indicator thingies to be green (green is good). It's just something that we could do without but then the game would truly be very easy.			"

												this review is gonna be in 2 parts ( the game itself and comparing it to other City builders games)PART 1:  the game itself.Cities Skyline is a City builder game,  it runs smoothly  on  most machines but not on older ones or laptops , it requires allot of power to run. the game only have 1 mode which is build your own city.  u manage the needs of the citizens from electricity education and other services.  until you build a city big enough to expand and manage the traffics ...etcthe Price tag is acceptable for what the game offers. if u are new to these type of games its a good entire point. the end game is lack luster though but if u reached that level u alreay have inversted 40-60 hours inOverall its worth while. so I recommend it as it's the best city builder game available on steam.--------------PART 2 : Comparison to other city builder games. 1- SimCity5 (2013)the game UI is very similar which is nice, cause u don't need to relearn stuff from scratch . the game graphics in cities skyline is kinda better. but almost similar to Simcity.cities skylines have very Huge building area compared to simCity Which has some major Pros  and cons at the same time.what simcity was aiming at when they did give u small areas is to give the players more challenge on how to manage their city as u cannot build everything in one city thus increasing the replayablily  of the game. where in cities skylines u only need to build 1 city and manage it. there are no neighboring cities to interact with.also in SimCity5 have online multiplayer mode. as u can play with your friends making the best use of your cities co-op to build a huge workplace the benefit the entire region.unlike cities skylines the end game is lackluster. I only spend playing  40 hours and already built everything in the city reached the final stage and have no problems with my city. only build cemeteries all over the place.only real issue with simcity5 is their launch disaster .[so the final verdict is that simCity5 is far more superior version than cities skylines]2- cities XL at first i thought this is another installment of that franchise . but i was wrong.  if we look at these 2 games Cities XL is way more complicated than this game. overly complected and their UI is messy  unlike cities Skyline where it runs more smoothly than that game. Cities XL do not offer expansions of the cities but gives you Huge area to play with. u can still interact with other cities using Token system.  but beyond that nothing els.from my experience with both games I prefer Cities: Skylines over Cities XL series.

												The game is a decent mix of the best features of Simcity 4, Simcity 5 and Cities XL. For such a complex product just after release the amount of bugs is very low, and they are actually minor bugs. Simcity 5 features better graphics, but you'll be compensated for that by a good perfomance and an overall highly addictive game. The interface is good (with some minor flaws), and the economy is a bit too easy too handle. It's 9/10 and by far the best city building game there is. Worth every cent.			"

												I am so impressed this is a game that was done RIGHT.  The game is priced affordably, includes all the components that make a city builder work and none that dont (broken social networking).  It came out day one with steam mod support and embraces the community and its feedback.  This is the greatest city builder in years and perhaps in the last decade and was priced to make this a no brainer.  Don't hesitate and buy this game now!  10/10			"

												Cities Skylines is a modern city builder with many possibilities. For large scale projects you can build a busy bustling city with airport, freight train stations and metro stops galore, or for something more intimate you can create a quaint country village or a farming community.With so many options and possibilities you may think that the game would be overwhelming, but with features unlocking as you go along, you are introduced to what you need to know in good time.Little fun additions like 'Chirpy' is a great way for your residents to give feedback to you, the Mayor of the city.  More and more mods appear every day making this a versatile, fun and intricate simulator.  Highly recommend this game.			"

												I can't tell you how many times out of my almost 200 hours I've restarted cities as new mods came out and traveling around IRL gives me ideas on how to lay out a damn road. And now that After Dark came out...125/10 I'm making a new city again :DOn a serious note:I love the gameplay of C:S. The controls are smooth, the modding community is awesome (and I mean, it's up there with the Skyrim modding community for me, and that's really freakin high), it's the best City Builder that I've played, and I highly doubt anything can top it. Then CO/Paradox adds more to the game, and it just keeps getting better and better.Long Live City: Skylines!			"

												My record for this game speaks for itself.  I got excited for it the minute my gaming buddies started talking about it.  The only downside I see to this game is the fact I can't find any patches for it.  Otherwise, everything is top notch all the way!! Graphics are beautiful and it has an easy learning curve.  I feel that Paradox backed the right horse in forming a partnership with Colossal Order to make this miracle of a game!!!! I have only pity for the gamers who have yet to introduce themselves to  this wonder of a game. C'mon, guys, let's get on the bandwagon and  cheer Cities: Skylines to the heavens for we might not see a game of its ilk in our lifetime again!!!For those who have yet to pick it up, I strongly suggest that you pick it up NOW and don't wait for a sale.

												Everything a city builder should be. Is it perfect? No. A city builder simulation will never be perfect. However, this is close to perfection. Knowing we will get flooded with new content, patches, mods and whatnot, this is Christmas for gamers addicted to city builders and simulation games. It was easy to learn, fun to plan, not as easy as it looks, you always want more, it's a toxic sleep killer. Finally we have a real successor to 2003's SimCity4 with a lot of similarities. As if SC4 was now Cities Skylines (the policies, the districts, the neighbor plots, etc). Oh and I'm able to play on my 2 year old laptop, without a hickup, it played well instantly. This is a winner and the game will be even better down the road. Don't even hesitate to buy this game.			"

Not an unique style, basically it is like sim city, BUT, while sim city had huge mistakes, this game improved the gameplay and did not include this mistakes.

Also both add-ons are really good and worth the money, nice little expansions, that kind of missed, even though there is a great and very good modding community.			"

YouTube™ Video: Cities Skylines: Quick Look (City building Simulation, gameplay, and review) 

			Views: 687		

			Cities Skylines: Quick Look (City building Simulation, gameplay, and review) Is Cities: Skylines the Sim City we've all been waiting for? ""Quick Look"" is our short impression series of various games.		

Cities Skyline gives the player everything you would expect from a proper modern city builder game. It has expansive maps, detailed cities and population, intricate micro management, yet it's accessible and easy to pick up.Graphically the game is a looker. With detailed models, atmospheric filtering effects, and all the little things happening when you zoom in, the game look and feels alive. The audio design is immersive with the hustle and bustle of the crowds and traffic pulling the player in. Though the music seems over dramatic and on default settings it's strangely loud, but it does the job at keeping the player company.Mechanically the game can get deep when you learn all the details, yet the basics to get going is pretty easy. With that said, the game still requires a degree of self research as all the finer details in it's mechanics aren't always fully explained. Overall Cities: Skylines is a very enjoyable city builder, and at it's core, every thing I wanted from a modern Sim City.Pros:- Easy to learn- Lots of fine detail to micromanage- Great looking, very immersive- Supports mods- Huge map to build onCons:- Finer detail mechanics aren't always explained well- Some quality of life issues could use smoothing outCities: Skyline hours played at recording: 22Completion Status on Cities Skyline: N/AThis copy of Cities: Skyline was purchased on Steam			"

												WOW! I've been playing for 90 minutes before work and lost track of time. This game is pure gold, and they absolutely delivered on the premise of being the game SimCity should have been! So far I've run into zero bugs. Getting off the ground is a bit confusing but once you're going, it's hard to stop. Only issue I have to complain about is you can't zoom all the way to ground level, and there was a crash to desktop when I quit to desktop.Can't wait to get off work to play it more...			"

												Can't...Stop...Playinggggg!!!!Arrragh!I have to be honest that I pirated it before I purchased it. The reason is simple: I was skeptical whether a team consists of roughly 10 people would be able to deliver a game matches its price. You know, think about EA's SimTown...And that infamous Cities XXXXXXXL...Not trying to make excuse anyway. Just don't want to be let down.And after log into the game and start playing, it's like time slitting away from my palm. Normally in SimTown as long as you cover the city limit with buildings there will not be much point keep playing on it and in Cities XXXXXXL long before that it's going to lag to unplayable. So generally I will not be absorbed in it and will eventually lose interest and get a life. However in Cities: Skylines I have already obtained ""Metropolitan"" title and the city just looks astounding. There are much, much more buildings in my metro than you can ever build in SimTown or Cities XXL, nevertheless the game is still smooth like hell. I mean it. I'm using a Core i5 and GForce 750M laptop and the fan is blazing, but any camera pan/ rotate will be in order immediately. The mechanics is similar to simtown. Nothing can be blamed since simtown has already got a pretty good system, yet of course the bloody ""seperate township“ has to be excluded. Notable differences include the induction of ""Noise"" and power grid, etc etc. The power grid system is a bit unrealistic since as long as your suburb is extended to the point you would like electricity to flow into you don't need to pull high-voltage wire to connect it to the power plant. Clearly it can not be achieved otherwise we'll not see utility poles around in our daily life.  (Sorry to be pedantic but I'm doing electrical engineering :( You can open an economy panel and tune tax rate/ policies however this bit is oversimplified IMHO. For instance there is not much noticeable effect if you change the tax rate for houses except your income. The graphic is not bad. You can complain it to be rough and undetailed, but I would rather want smoothness over a bit of detail, since with the game itself lag like s*** nobody will ever interested in zooming in to examine the minutiae of the city. Tweeting system is freshening but annoying in late game. Developer might want to expand the dictionary.This game is even equipped with a tool to form the terrain your city will be situated on. Even with a tool to enable importing of geographical data to automatically generate height offset! You know, I am currently using double screens, with google map on one screen and the game on the other, trying to create a city of Melbourne. And after terraforming, I am going to copy the city of Melbourne, street by street, building by building, onto it. What if you can't find the exact building in the game, you may ask.Create it then. This game has building creation tool. Pretty much like it in Spore. See, the replayability is vast. How amazing will it be, if you duplicate your hometown onto it, and do a bit of experiment on it maybe? Blast your home away from it? Merge this road with another to see the impact on traffic? Do whatever you like. It's your city.20/10TL;DR : BUY IT.			"

												Cities Skyline is a great game if you like to build modern cities. The road system is incredibly well done. I like how they chose to link zones directly to roads. Everything feels neat and clean. It has in-game tools for creating your own maps and game assets. You can create, for instance, a custom power plant with your own model or build it out of pre-existing models and determine it's stats such as cost and power output. Best of all your creations can easily be posted to the steam workshop and the game is incredibly mod-friendly. I like almost everything about the game; in fact my only major complaint is that the game is too easy. It's virtually impossible to ""lose"" at cities skylines. Even if you play like a complete idiot, going bankrupt is very rare unless you want it to happen. You can just have insanely high tax rates and let people move in, get totally reamed, leave angrily only to come back later. You could be the worst mayor who ever lived and make millions with ease. With the exception of losing a valuable structure to a fire or something, there's virtually no consenquences to anything you do. Some might say it's not about winning or losing, aiming instead for effeciency, but there's a fine line between ""min-maxing"" (making your city as effective as you can) and having no challenge whatsoever. Sim City 3000, for instance, was much harder to get into the green; requiring you carefully plan your city or to plague it with casinos and toxic waste dumps (which were unique buildings you can only build when given the opprotunity to do so) in order to get ahead. Whenever you had enough money to build something big, it really mattered. You had to decide if you wanted a new hospital or some reinforcement to your educational system - and if you would have enough income to support your new object. Expanding your city size and adding more zones was also a very careful decision players made in Sim3K, because if you could not adequately support a new burst of population it could mean trouble. There were legitimate consequences to your actions - cranking up tax rates won't just make people leave, they will riot and start fires. Even with Skyline's ""hard"" mode which is tucked away as an optional mod you can turn on (right next to infinite money) the game feels way too simple at times.Ultimately if you just wanna mess around and build stuff, Skylines is obviously a massive upgrade to the original sim games - but it's kind of terrible as an actual game that imposes challenges and problems you have to overcome. With modding, though, I'm sure the community could find a way to make the game more difficult. The game has a good soundtrack (pretty sure I hear some references to older SimCity music in there, too), cozy aesthetics and enough variety to keep most players entertained for at least 20 to 30 hours. Definitely a good purchase for both people who like city builders and those who are new to the genre.Rating: B+PS: Death to chirper.			"

												Best sim city type game since Sim City 4 Rushhour,  without question.  Obviously that does not say much when you compare what has come out since SC4 but still it is a great game.  Roads that are curvable, the ability to make your own buildings (think BAT tool in SC4 but a ton easier to figure out and use), custom bus lines, custom train lines, custom subway lines, taxis, ferry service, expandable roads, click and follow cars/pedistrians ...It is not perfect mind you, the ability to bulldoze and flatten land does not exist (well it does on slopes with low % grades, but you want to flatten a mountain, that is not happening as no option to do it).Also, once you reach 8 expansions of your city limits that is it.  No option to buy land past that (at least that I have found).  That said 8 extensions is a lot but would be nice to build more.  Right now I have a city at 110K population though it has been there for a while.  Thing is there is a huge online community that has gives tons of FREE downloadable content which makes the game interesting.  Currently I am on 92 plus hours and still loving it.  Just downloaded the expansion AFTER DARK (that costs money in case you were wondering) but it gives more eye-candy and transport options.I currently give it an 8.5/10 which says a lot as it is rare I  ever give a game 8 or higher.

												Cities: Skylines experience in one word? Extraordinary.Cities: Skylines not only offers breath taking visuals, it also features captivating game play by implementing the most moddable options we've seen in a city sim to date. Without a doubt the asset editor is probably one of the most brilliant ideas included with this game. Ever play a city sim where some buildings are not to your liking, require too much space or you just don’t like the general set out of them? Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen’s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I’ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don’t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting. Cities: Skylines has completely revolutionised the whole genre of city sims. Keep in mind this is just the start of something great, I cannot wait to see what else can come of this genre after such a phenomenal milestone. 11/10 "

												You're into macro management more than micro management ?You're fed up of small maps ? (*winks at SimCity fail*)You just want to relax while watching your city grow on the plots you simply designed ?Then this game is for you ! A combination of the good parts of one city sim with another along with new features not yet made in any of those sim.The bad point ?- Localization suffers some typos/mistakes here and there, but it's still alright.- Tunnels can't be made ... A mod to fix that ? *winks at modders* - No building customization (giving it a continent style over another) ... Again, modders are there for that !The good point ?- Even after 4 hours, I still didn't fill the map and yet I could expand it more.- Easy to understand.- Traffic sim is quite alright, even though vehicles sometimes don't use all the road lanes for some reasons.- Limitation ? What's that ? You're limitless ! Even doing a highway across your city is possible if you wanted to. (Although I don't see the point of doing it ...)			"

												I can quite put my finger on why I do not recommend this game to be honest. I was so happy for this game that I preordered it and I downloaded it and played it as soon as it became available. After a bit of time setting up towns, parks, commercial buildings and industrial areas I started to get that feeling of repitition. I built my town and everything is running great, I build my wonder building and I have alot of folk coming into my town. All my buildings are upgraded and all of this I did within 3 hours of play time. I feel as if the developers mostly focused on the road and traffic aspect of the game. It doesn't really matter what you build or where you build it, as long as there is not traffic you're fine.The 1 and only reason I dont recommend this game is because it gets repetitive after a short time span. The game itself is beautiful, the fact that I can zoom in and see such great detail is the only reason why I still play every once in a while.5/10 GAME "

Posted: April 5, 2015
												TL;DR The game is a nice leveling sandbox hampered by unintuitive gameplay, unusual traffic decisions, limited building styles, and confusing UI decisions. The less micro you like in a game, the more you will like this one. If you don't like being on rails while you play and want to have fine tunning controls, this game is probably not for you.Edit: As of the most recent update, while many things have been improved, the core complaints below has not been addressed. I do hope they address at least some of this, but for now everything below is still accurate. I have also clarified the maximum zoning size.Unfortunately, I have to move this review to not recommending for now. Once the rose colored glasses come off, there are some major issues that need fixing before I recommend this game to anyone but the most forgiving of individuals. The game is pretty good and can be a lot of fun...but those who haven't bought it yet will probably be heavily annoyed by the many frustrations this game also provides. Issue #1 Traffic. People will tell you there is nothing wrong with traffic, but there really is, and I can explain that problem in a sentence. Cars are always moving. Car leaves origin, travels towards destination, returns to origin, and heads to destination again. Because of this loop always running, there is no way to fix the traffic problem. People, businesses, factories work on cycles in real life. What's more, they are not constantly productive. Some forms of agriculture produce goods daily, some weekly, some monthly, and some are a once a year thing. Major comercial sectors time their shipments to arrive at night when there is limited traffic and thus deliveries are more efficient. With no day/night cycle and thus no low traffic/heavy traffic cycles the game punishes otherwise efficient designs by having only one mode of traffic, heavy. This is what creates all of the other traffic problems observed. Sure you can build around these problems, and there are many people who gain great pleasure from dealing with such. If that is you, then this game is probably for you. Otherwise, there really needs to be cyclic traffic flows in this game. Low traffic weekends in industrial areas, high traffic commercial. Residential needs to be low traffic most of the day.Issue #2 Limitations. There is a lot missing from this game. Asthetics, public building options, utilities, even auto constructed building have very limited and generic asthetics. Because of this, you will quickly find that one city looks just like any other quickly leaving the game feeling very cookie cutter. Having multiple building styles that alternate every 10 years or so would go a long way to fixing this and creating a feeling of a progressing city. Mods can only help in a limited way here. This is a fix that really needs to come from the devs. Issue #3 Zoning. There is only one way this game zones, that is automatically as you lay your roads. You can color in the blocks representing what can be built, but no matter what, you can not define the shape of the area you want constructed in. This forces you away from more organic designs as the game attempts to create numerous obnoxious shapes when a simple rectangle would have done much better. Such choices are not in your hand, and there are no creative work arounds as zoning is immediatly deleted when you remove a road, and anything built on it. Even if you are just trying to fix something and all buildings would still be with road access where they need it. Fix, let the player zone an area as industrial, commercial, or industrial then let them build the roads afterwards. The game can then highlight areas wasted due to lack of road access. This would allow for more organic, fun designs. As the game currently exist, and as a reply to ""NGB"" the image below represents how it currently works.

			This image goes along with my review for Cities: Skylines. This was in response to an individual telling me I had missed certain UI elements. The inset explains everything else that requires explanation.		


Issue #4 Building Footprint Sizes. Thanks to the way the game is created, you will never have large flowing fields of green on the outskirts of your city. Every single building has a maximum size of 4X4. Yes there are limited buildings that are larger you can construct manually, but you will never see large areas develop on their own. This is a direct result of how zoning is handled. Fix for this, fix zoning, then let the building bases have larger sizes.Issue #5 The Fan Base. This is going to be the number 1 reason I am not going to recomend this game to most people. Currently, the fans are to put it mildly, hostile to any criticisms of the game. Collosal Order has made no mistake and can do no wrong, so any issues you see are your fault and that's all there is. This isn't a problem in itself, it's a problem because there are so many like this that people with real issues can't talk about them because these fans derail threads and stop any form of productive discussion on the proplems. This is a good game that needs work, it is not a priceless work of art that needs to be preserved in its release state. There absolutely are design decisions in this title that need to be reconsidered. When you have so many that attack those that would suggest this game needs more work you can't have the discussions that need to happen. What's more, it's hard to get help when the fans are so abusive. There are many aspects of this game that just are not intuitive, and there is a significant portion of this fan base that will leave you not even wanting to use the forums. This is the real shame of the success of this game. This game was almost too successful for its own good.Edit: A screenshot from the comments on this review which shows an example of the response criticism of this game recieves. Notice that no points are refutted or discussed, just a blanket everyone else thinks this game is wonderful. I think he may have also been trying to criticize me...but the jab seems to have gone over or under my head.

			oldeguy provides yet another example of why any discussion that doesn't praise the game is difficult to have.		


There are an abundance of places where you can read the virtues of this game. This is the devil advocate review that only focuses on the bad or at a minimum the questionably implemented features that detract from the experience. The bird is not an issue to make you not buy the game, however, you will be punished for modding it out by turning off achievments. While there is a mod to re-enable achievments, what will probably start nagging you is how you have to keep downloading mods to fix questionable design decisions. An ingame option to turn off all nag screens and the bird is not too much to ask. These are the basic things that serve to move this from a must have to a marginal recomendation depending on whether you can ignore the issues and are willing to work around the ones that can't be ignored. For me the answer is no, which is why I have stopped playing for now.I am aware that the devs have planned a number of improvements to the game, if any of those improvements affect the issues I have highlighted, I will gladdly return to fix this review and its recomendation status. While I have highlighted the fans as the #1 issue for me not recommending the game, it doesn't really factor in. I hope people that applies to read it and reply proving me right, even better, maybe they read it and realize they could be a little more civil to their fellow humans. Who knows? If any 2 of the above issues become resolved I will move this review to a solid recommend. If this game goes on sale for $15.00 dollars, then that is also a solid recommend from me even with the issues.			"

												It's a gorgeous game that's for sure, but it quickly gets ""samey"" and enevitably you end up playing traffic simulator 2016 trying to get the road network to work.  There is also very little actual management you can do.  You designate a zone and the game builds everything for you.  Sure you can adjust taxes and make bus/train/plane stations (again, traffic simulator) but it always feels like you're doing nothing for the city.  However, the aesthetic appeal and community mods do add some replayability.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend getting this game unless it's on sale.			"

												Awesome City Builder with a decent interface and good optimization. This game brought me back to the city building genre. The only issue I have so far, which is one that lacks in all city builder games, is the lack of dedicated bicycle and bus lanes, which would be nice to prioritize the public transportation and deal with traffic congestion. But theres still hope someone mod this in.			"

												Eight hours in and I've been really enjoying it so far. It's very much inspired by the recent Sim City title (the UI is pretty much pulled directly from Sim City) but it makes some very important improvements. The cities are MUCH larger once your city grows and you can expand to additional squares. The game does a better job following individual citizens around the city. Also, the Steam Workshop support is great. There have already been a lot of neat mods and additional assets created and the game has only been out a few days. Also, the price point is better than Sim City's at launch, so that always helps too. If you were disappointed by EA/Maxis' title, check out this one instead. If you haven't played a city simulator game in a long time, this is the one I'd recommend picking up.			"

Initial ImpressionsWell, I can honestly say that I was looking forward to it. Many comparisons made to Simcity, stemming from a place of fondness of course. While the ""Sim"" brand will always have a place on my gaming rig (I miss you so much Sim Tower![en.wikipedia.org]), Cities: Skylines delivers on many levels.Current ConsiderationsOkay, lets be succinct: I'm wringing every last bit of playability of the vanilla version for this game before I move on. It's just that good!Future FixationsCities: Skylines has an asset editor to create your own mods in-game or you can import your own models. The modding community just blossomed within hours of the game release. Without a doubt, I will be using these creative mods in the future and quite possibly creating a few myself.			"

												Its been more than a decade but, 8 hours into the game, I think Simcity 4 finally has a worthy successor, Cities Skylines.This game offers;- A decent artstyle, the first decent replacement of the 2d Simcity style.- Much greater infrastructure detail, customisation & ease of use over SC4- The traffic model appears more realistic and your actions have logical impacts on it - Good modding support and tools- Whilst the scale, in terms of population, is much lower than SC4 it appears more realistic and accurate- I would estimate the maximum city size is 2x the size of the larger city tile in SC4The only negative thing I can say about the game is that it is very difficult to fail, however its something I'm willing to overlook. The unlocking of buildings/services/functions as your city progresses does not feel limiting but serves a vital role in ensuring less experienced/casual players find the game easier to play.90/100Only improvements I can think of would be;Adding a Region, allowing cities to interactAdding multiplayer region or easy way to exchange city tiles.I hope paradox will consider these improvements for the sequel, they are certainly on a distinguished road.

												Have you always wanted to build and control everything in you own city? This may be the game for you...First of all the experience of playing the game is fantastic, with a massive steam workshop anything about the game you would like changed can be done with the mountain of mods, including vehicles, buildings, user interfaces, and menus. Whether you are European or American both are catered for when playing, with multiple biomes that have there own unique buildings that spawn in them ( European buildings in the European biome map). Overall I love this game so far, would love to have something negative to say about it... Maybe the traffic could be easier to manage?... GET THIS GAME FOLKS			"

												Quite possibly the best $30 you can spend on gaming this year. I have played Simcity since 1 but avoided 5, instead going back to 4 over and over. This has finally scratched the itch and improved on so many things I wish were more flexible / possible in SC4. They sacrified graphics and sound for what matters most in games like this: gameplay. Cities are still beautiful and sound can be turned off, but the amount of flexibility and interaction between the systems is outstanding.Paradox has set a new standard for City builders. Maxis would be proud.			"

												Hey look.... a city building game where I can build actual cities, instead of small towns, and I can even expand them!At first I was a little hesitant about buying the game, after being so dissapointed with the recent Simcity, but I bought the game none the less, and I am glad I did. Cities: Skylines have thus far been a very enjoyable experience. I have put just about 14 hours into the game, at the time of this review and I don't really have anything bad to say about the game.Gameplay:+ The difficulty feels just about right, and it seems to increase along with the size of your city.+ The game WILL punish you, if you make the wrong decisions, and let them be for too long.+ I enjoy having to balance my ever changing budget+ Even after 14 hours of gameplay, I still feel I have alot to discover about the game.- Having to delete abandoned buildings one by one, can be very tedious, boring and frustrating.- Upgrading and changing road types could work better.- Elevating roads, making bridges and then connectiong them to other roads can be a bit tricky.The game:+ The game runs smooth on my high-end rig+ The graphics are great considering the small download size+ The game seems to run Fullscreen (Windowed Mode) by default.

The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.			"

 A real feat...	This is the game Simcity was trying to be. If you know and have played Simcity, then you know what I mean. It was a brilliant effort, that was somehow hindered, perhaps by EA's greed. This is the best parts of Simcity, but so much more. Everything is done... well, just about perfectly - and by a team that, compared to Maxis's workforce, is tiny. I'd do a list of pros and cons about now, but the list of pros for this game might be too long. Instead...The most brilliant things this have over Simcity: - MASSIVE cities. This one can't be avoided. You start in a square roughly the size of Simcity's. You can then buy another EIGHT. So, yeah, it's 9 times the size of Simcity. You can have even more (25!) with the help of a mod, which brings me on to my next point... - Mods. And Steam Workshop integration. I don't think I've played a game where adding mods was so easy and fluid, and grabbing assets from the workshop is brilliant - particularly for intersections. And on that matter, adding your own is so simple too. - Fantastic simulation. I don't really know how Simcity managed to get this wrong, when Cities gets it so right. Simcity's glassbox engine was cool to look at, I admit, but... In Simcity, people woke up in the morning, went to work at the nearest job they could find, then went to the nearest home they could find afterwards and repeated the same every morning. In Cities, every person has a name, a car, a house, a job... It's fantastic. Additionally, water simulation is pretty neat too. It's the only game where you can actually drain a river by pumping all the water out, or flood a city by building a dam. A few minor niggles that don't bother me at all, really: - I kinda miss the specialisation thing from Simcity. If, like me, you liked that, you'll probably miss it a bit too. - The graphics, while excellent, aren't quite as perfect as in Simcity. Something's a little off, so I think it just needs a few more settings in the options menu. However, you can pretty much have whater you like using mods too, so... not really much of an issue. - Traffic AI. Now, Simcity had the same problem at launch really. It's just not smart enough. The main problem is things like hearses, picking up jobs on the opposite side of the city, while there's a dead person waiting for transport right next to the crematorium. But, there's also problems with lanes. The AI just don't use them efficiently (even naturally) enough. Fix this. Please. - My train network gets jammed up. Not because of my rail design, but because of the rail design beyond the map, which seems a bit unfair.So, if you like city builders, I can't reccomend this game more. This is the new definitive city building game, and I think it'll remain that way for quite a while.9.999/10 (fix traffic for the 10/10)			"

												About six thousand years ago when the dinosaurs ruled the Earth, I discovered this game called ""SimCity"", and it was good. So insanely good that I played almost every incarnation of the game for the next 20 years, except for the really horrible ""social"" versions, which were terribly dumbed down.Then after the great flood washed away the dinosaurs, and took with it the last of EA's great developers and designers, we few surviving life-long SimCity addicts were left playing SimCity 4: Rush Hour for long year after year, hoping for the light to shine down from the heavens and impart on us the great knowledge, wisdom and truth of a brilliant new version of SimCity. That's when EA shoveled on us the massing stinking pile of dinosaur dung that was the ""new"" SimCity (aka SimCity 5), and lo, it was dark, ominous, horrible, and shockingly tiny. And DRM-restricted. And generally awful to the point where we all agreed SimCity was forever dead, killed by a greed-driven troll in the dark mountain keep of Electronicus Artus.And then Cities: Skylines appeared. And there was much joy and celebration! And lo, it was not only good, it was GREAT, and instantly assumed the torch of being the true spiritual successor of SimCity 4. If there had been a real SimCity 5 in the spirit of its predecessors, then Cities: Skylines is that game.True, Skylines doesn't have all of the options that SC4:RH did, but clearly the developers are on the right path and doing the right things. Tunnels are now in, and I honestly feel that these folks ""get it"". I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a true spiritual successor to SimCity 4: Rush Hour. Stick with these guys, it feels like they're on the right path and could grow this game into something truly amazing in time.			"

												This is a FANTASTIC game. I have EASILY spent well over 200 hours on it (just now got to buy it). I only have a few gripes.1. Price of DLC. I just find anything over 5 bucks (given what you get) a little insane.2. Random bugs. On my old city, I had random issues with a disconnected road thing popping up in completely random places.3. OPTIMIZATION. This game runs better on a Q6600 and GTX 480 (both at stock speeds) comapared to a Pentium G3258 (4.7GHz) and Radeon HD 7950.			"

												Vanilla GameIs the best city builder since Sim City 4, if from a City Builder you like something like the classic Sim City and not like Tropico, Anno etc... So the focus is transport and you can build the city as you want because the game is almost to easy. Is easy to get money but your city will suffer from a chain of problems that you can address by adding resurces, reshaping roads and smoothing trafic. Anyway no metter how many problem the city does have is almost inpossible that your citizen become unahppy; and because criminality is linked to happyness police is not really necessaty. I suggest to give a try to the vanilla game before installing any mod/mapModsThe mod can already totally reshape the game experience: you can download tons of additional buildings both ploppable or growable, you can change the point of view to street level, alter the colur scheme and resolution, alter the interface (tranforming Chirpy in a scroll text just like the one on SC4), alter games rules to increase or decrease the challenge.Maps are also great: usign the site terrain.party you can download a map from your favourite location in the world, and since the map in the game is preaty big you can recreate a small city and its sourrounding. The water simulation express its true potential when you try to add a river in your custom map.TL:DRA great Game, maybe non perfect and not particularry challenging, but surely a great platform with a lot of potential for modding or expansion			"

												This is a good game. I would say that many of the comparisons to the latest Sim City aren't all that helpful because they seem to view this game as far superior to that game when there are lots of tradeoffs that both games have made.Data visualization in this game is somewhat poor in comparison to Sim City 2013. Cities: Skylines also doesn't have different wealth classes, a highly ambiguous Land Value system along with a slightly difficult to follow specialization system, and the user interface is... borderline Cities XL bad. It's also not entirely bug free with massive traffic clogging occurring at entrances to the city (much like issues that plagued Sim City 2013). Traffic agents in this game aren't all that smart and there are tons of quirks that make it frustrating to play at times: buildings becoming abandoned because a dead person wasn't picked up, really? It would help if all of the hearses didn't crowd around one building--like the fire engines crowd around a single burning building (again, an issue that occurred in Sim City 2013). The notification system is also completely useless and just serves as an obnoxious distraction from gameplay.The bad aside, I like this game. I'm not forced to stop playing after a few hours because of some bug or because my city is already bursting out of its boundaries. The system of buying more land plots to expand your city is ingenious and somehting that I'm surprised no one thought of before. I love the public transit system and all the little nuanced features it has though it can be a little daunting to set up at first. There are lots of little features that really help make this game s city builder worth playing.Overall, I feel like this game is almost like a Microsoft product: trying to be all things while never succeeding at doing a single thing perfectly well. It could use more polish (they're already releasing patches), but is definitely a recommended title for any avid city builder.  I've found that most reviewers are just happy that they have a city builder that isn't Sim City 2013, but I'd say that there are many things that that game did very well that Cities: Skylines doesn't and vice versa. If I were to rate Cities: Skylines, I would give it a 7.5/10 -- Good, but not great with its share of flaws.			"

The City Building Game No One Asked For - But The City Building Game We Deservedtl;dr - If you like city building games, you should buy this - without question. If you've played the classics then you'll be right at home and if you're new to the genre, this is a great starting point. There's a couple of teeny tiny issues that are mostly opinion-based but nothing that breaks the game. 9.5/10First and foremost, it's not without its flaws - but the flaws are quickly lost in the charm and incredible achievement that the developers attained with this game.The immediate sense of creative freedom you get with Skylines is apparent the moment you start on your first lot. Yes, the appearance of the dreaded 'city boundaries' might remind some of the restrictions of other city building games, but once you start laying road and placing zones, you realize the scale fits perfectly, usually having you spend a good few hours in your first square alone. Then you discover you can buy more plots.The gameplay is very reminiscent of other city builders - no point trying to fix what isn't broken. Although I'd say that Skylines easily fixes some attempted mechanics that other city builders attempted in the past. The agent system - where you can follow every individual person and vehicle (even animal, if you want) - might still not be perfect, things still very 'processed' whereas in real life things a little more chaotic, it still works well enough. A common complaint is traffic, but that's not the agents' fault, but more likely the fault of the road layout.Speaking of which, this is probably the biggest challenge of the game. Managing traffic will likely take more of your time than zoning and controlling land value. Thankfully the game offers you a massive set of tools to best manage your roads, the only limit is your imagination~. The game will also intelligently place roads as best it can, meaning you'll usually always be able to make a junction even if the angle is a little tight.One of the few little caveats that I certainly run in to is pipe placement. Power lines and pipes need to be placed manually - the former never too much an issue since buildings link power between themselves in a small radius, connecting to each other so long as they're close enough. Water and sewage pipes, however, need to be placed manually every time you expand your city. Maybe I'm just lazy, but it's always easy to forget when power takes care of itself. Perhaps the modding community may have a solution - as this game is highly moddable. The in-game asset creator allows people to import models and customize buildings to help diversify the rather small set of preset buildings - as well as powerful scripting mods to add entirely new features (of writing, one of the most popular mods is the auto-bulldoze mod).All in all, if you've been looking for a city builder to sink your time in to and thoroughly enjoy, Cities: Skylines won't do you wrong. The price point is fantastic for a game this entertaining and as much as people might draw comparisons to other city builders, I personally think Skylines can very well stand on its own in the genre.

												If you want a fun-filled city builder that doesn't get lost in micromanagement, then this game is for you.  I always loved the earlier SimCity titles but I hated worrying about whether I could get the power or water to work.  After playing more casual builders like the Tropico series, I began to prefer that style over the more technical aspects of other management sims.  Cities: Skylines blends both of these worlds beautifully with all the benefits.Learning curve is fairly light so don't worry about whether you have the time to learn what the game has to offer.  I watched a 30 minute tutorial on YouTube and began playing immediately.  Sure the premise is simple but don't let that convince you that the game lacks complexity.  Managing traffic jams, proper zoning, passing policies all allow for a custom experience with tons of replay value.  At a modest $29.99 USD pricetag, you can't afford to wait!			"

												We shall remember that game as the game that killed SimCity 2013, by far.Pros :- Water physics- Roughly 70 hours on SimCity 2013, more than 20 cities built and completed. 49 hours on Cities : Skylines, not even the half of the map of ONE CITY full. - Huge potential- Workshop content- Low price- The freaking dam that changes the whole scenery- Animals in the streets (but no llamas)- Planes that can land on a 60 meters runway- Water physicsCons :- Not as good as SimCity 4- Lack of llamas (but there's a mod for that)- Lack of content (But there are tons of mods) EDIT : After Dark expansion adds a lot to the game.- No day/night cycle (but there's a mod for that)- Graphics quite weak sometimes- (Too easy ?)- Unity Engine might slow down while playing on huge cities.11/10 would mod it more and more and more.

Skylines is HUGE, and options are as well when powered by the workshop, there is virtually no limit in how diverse your city can get. I loved the last DLC ""After Dark"", adding bike paths to my cities is very appealing to my vision of an eco-farming city. Load and loads of features.

If you want something as ""deep"" as the SimCity series, give the modders a few months to crank out some difficulty adjustment mods and a disaster mod (currently there are no large-scale disasters in the game, just local fires, sickness, etc).  For $30, this game is an absolute steal - but it's going to get a LOT better in the next year as the modders dig their teeth in, so I wouldn't blame anyone for waiting til then to jump in.			"

												As people say, it's basically SimCity but better. (By the way, the DLC is overpriced for the content it gives; even when it's on sale, don't buy it ;) ). Also, although the system requirements say at least 3.0 GHz, I am using a 2.5 GHz computer with a i7 intel core and it is working fine. So, don't worry too much about that.			"

												I'm currently 12 hours into this game, and I won't look back.Cities: Skylines is one of the best CIty Simulators out now. They literally took what SimCity wanted to do, grew a pair, and did it. Pros:-Great Optimization(My GPU isn't even the ""minimal"" and I run this on Maximum. w/ a slower CPU.)-Large building space(Yeah, i'm looking at you, EA.)-Mod support from Day 1. Already tons of mods on the Workshop.-Flow of traffic and people is very smooth and feels very responsive.Cons:-No tutorials, figure it out or find a guide.-City seems to stop growing for a while after you hit a ceartain pop. Then correct itself.-Few bugs, but the ones that are there are super annoying.(No crime rates, etc.)Overall I would give this an 8/10 and would say buy it if you are looking for a great City Simulator. Doesn't seem to be much out there doing a better job.			"

												This game is lots of fun and allows you to manage all the apsects of a city, whether it's urban planning, managing land uses according to economic demand, traffic engineering and managing transport routes.There is a rather long game loading time, which deters me from playing unless I have a long slot of free time. However, once the game loads, you are indulged in building and managing your city. I can easily spend 6 hours on the game without even realising it (I have been wondering why the afternoons have been really short lately). Even when there is nothing to build, there is a lot of fun in watching the endless stream of vehicles moving swiftly through your well designed highway network, following trains to their destinations, and especially the citizens as they emerge from train stations or wait at bus stops, and being satisfied knowing that each person using your mass transit is one less car on your roads.

												We shall remember that game as the game that killed SimCity 2013, by far.Pros :- Water physics- Roughly 70 hours on SimCity 2013, more than 20 cities built and completed. 49 hours on Cities : Skylines, not even the half of the map of ONE CITY full. - Huge potential- Workshop content- Low price- The freaking dam that changes the whole scenery- Animals in the streets (but no llamas)- Planes that can land on a 60 meters runway- Water physicsCons :- Not as good as SimCity 4- Lack of llamas (but there's a mod for that)- Lack of content (But there are tons of mods) EDIT : After Dark expansion adds a lot to the game.- No day/night cycle (but there's a mod for that)- Graphics quite weak sometimes- (Too easy ?)- Unity Engine might slow down while playing on huge cities.11/10 would mod it more and more and more.

This may be the game for you...First of all the experience of playing the game is fantastic, with a massive steam workshop anything about the game you would like changed can be done with the mountain of mods, including vehicles, buildings, user interfaces, and menus. Whether you are European or American both are catered for when playing, with multiple biomes that have there own unique buildings that spawn in them ( European buildings in the European biome map). Overall I love this game so far, would love to have something negative to say about it... Maybe the traffic could be easier to manage?... GET THIS GAME FOLKS			"

												Hey look.... a city building game where I can build actual cities, instead of small towns, and I can even expand them!At first I was a little hesitant about buying the game, after being so dissapointed with the recent Simcity, but I bought the game none the less, and I am glad I did. Cities: Skylines have thus far been a very enjoyable experience. I have put just about 14 hours into the game, at the time of this review and I don't really have anything bad to say about the game.Gameplay:+ The difficulty feels just about right, and it seems to increase along with the size of your city.+ The game WILL punish you, if you make the wrong decisions, and let them be for too long.+ I enjoy having to balance my ever changing budget+ Even after 14 hours of gameplay, I still feel I have alot to discover about the game.- Having to delete abandoned buildings one by one, can be very tedious, boring and frustrating.- Upgrading and changing road types could work better.- Elevating roads, making bridges and then connectiong them to other roads can be a bit tricky.The game:+ The game runs smooth on my high-end rig+ The graphics are great considering the small download size+ The game seems to run Fullscreen (Windowed Mode) by default.

This is not the case, this game have def. taken over the 1st. place on the list. This game has almost everything that Simcity did not and does not have. Be aware that the developers haven't actually completely finished the game yet. Tunnels are missing and some minor bugs is to be found in the game. Overall not anything you really notice. I would definitely recommend this game and I'm happy that the successor to Simcity 4 has really come out now.			"

												*Edited for patch 1.1Unlike the disappointment that was SimCity 2013, Cities: Skylines is a real city simulator/builder. Every single resident in your city has a home, a job, an education (if you build schools that is), and everyone has somewhere they need to go. You can watch them leave their home, take the subway to the bus stop to take the bus to the mall, and then do the same in reverse to go back home. As someone who fell in love with SimCity when the original came out as shareware in 1989 and have played every Will Wright game since (as well as some of the none-Will Wright followups), I highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who likes city builders. This game is what we wanted from a new SimCity game, without all the bad decisions EA made.The game isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close. It makes building truly massive cities fun and possible, and with the right hardware the cities look pretty good too with an incredible attention to detail. Building a succesful (profitable) city is fairly easy (easier than SC4 that is), but getting past the 50,000 resident mark, while dealing with traffic, water, power, garbage, and sewage is the real challenge. Getting past the 100,000 resident mark requires some creative thinking in the construction of intersections, highways, and bus lines, but it can be done and you can keep expanding your city until you run out of land to purchase.While the game is a true simulation, it has no natural disasters and if you can keep your city from dying to polluted water or choking in traffic jams, then you can continue building until the budget can't cover it anymore.Traffic has been improved greatly since launch and is now much easier to manage. We've gotten tunnels and the ability to build roundabouts and any other kind of road or rail at any level above and below ground, and the game continues to have some of the best mod support of any game ever released.

												One of the greatest city builders out there that also includes workshop support for even more hours of fun!-Undoubtedly, this is one of best city builder games I have ever played. Although I cant help to compare this to the latest SimCity from EA, there are many pros and cons that are noticable. Some pros that can be seen is that Cities: Skylines allows you to purchase more plots of land if you run out of space, set districts and apply certain policies, and has definently more variety of roads, buildings, and cars than SimCity. But indeed like every game, there are some cons that are equally noticable. These include (in my opinion) no proper day/night cycle, time should last a few minutes instead of a few seconds, and car AI that should let emergency vehicles have the right of way during emergencies. The cons are not bad, but they should be definently improved or added sometime in the future.But the good news is, Colossal Order is planning to release their brand new expansion After Dark which includes a day/night cycle and adds some nighttime locations like nightclubs to see your city come to life. There is currently no set release date or prices but you can read more about it here[www.paradoxplaza.com]. Along with that, there are many mods in the workshop that can help enhance your experience throughout the game that add more roads, buildings, fixes, etc and also graphical mods.-Overall: If you are deciding wheather to buy Cities: Skylines or SimCity 2015, I recommend Cities: Skylines because it offers more features that SimCity 2015 lacks.

												A great step forward in the City Building Genre. Not just a mimic of Sim City 4, but a unique format, as others have put it Sim City is a City Building game with traffic, Cities: Skylines is a traffic strategy game with city building. The subtlety of the balance of the game is the best I've seen in a long time. When you first start out it isn't too hard to make a profit (unlike other games which are primarily based on the monetary mangement concept) but as the city gains size it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain growth as your services get drained and the requirements become more complicated.The same goes for traffic management, you start the game with your little roads thinking everything is hunky dory but as the traffic grows within your originally built infastructure it requires meticulous planning and investment to get a city running efficiently.I haven't even touched public transport as well as other things in the game and I can say I am already satisfied with the game. Great playability.The modding community has also been a huge success and has added some great features + assets to the game which compliment it perfectly, not just make it a cheating game breaking fest, which is a big plus for me.DOWNSIDE: You can't recraft the land, not a massive thing but sometimes you notice it is missing.

Initial ImpressionsWell, I can honestly say that I was looking forward to it. Many comparisons made to Simcity, stemming from a place of fondness of course. While the ""Sim"" brand will always have a place on my gaming rig (I miss you so much Sim Tower![en.wikipedia.org]), Cities: Skylines delivers on many levels.Current ConsiderationsOkay, lets be succinct: I'm wringing every last bit of playability of the vanilla version for this game before I move on. It's just that good!Future FixationsCities: Skylines has an asset editor to create your own mods in-game or you can import your own models. The modding community just blossomed within hours of the game release. Without a doubt, I will be using these creative mods in the future and quite possibly creating a few myself.			"

												If you enjoy city builders you owe it to yourself to pick it up. One of the best Ive played in a very long time. My only legit complaint is it doesn't have as much convenient city information as SC2013. Other than that its a better game in every way imaginable. The bugs that are there are slowly being ironed out. Hopefully we can get some more info menus in future patches/xpacs but overall not bad from a team of a dozen people or so.			"

												The first city building game since SC2000 to keep me glued for a nearly 8 hour session. Even taking the day off to indulge a bit more! The main negative for me currently is that it is honestly WAY too easy, but the devs have stated that they will add scenarios and the like in the future, so this may be remedied. Speaking about the devs, the most impressive thing about this title is that a team of 13 people put it together, so kudos on pulling off elegantly what EA/Maxis and AAA funding couldn't do.			"

												8/10, would recommend to buy at full price.Cities: Skylines is a game that, for me, is an extension of my younger gaming expiriences. The best way to describe it, without giving the basics (its a city builder/sim), is that I believe this game is the logical continuation of the ENTIRE genre of city builders. What I mean by this is that Cities: Skylines fills the hole left behind after the release of the last major city builder.... Sim City 4. If you grew up on city building, and love the idea of a slightly more technical approach, this game will satisfy. That said, gamers new to the genre, or gamers looking for a city builder with little learning curve, Cities: Skylines can also be a good fit. All in all, a very well made city builder, which runs smooth and with good graphics and technical gameplay, and is also not too hard to learn.			"

												Cities: Skylines the logical progression of classic city builders, and yet it has something more; something for everyone. Whether you're like me and played Simcity 2000 but could never last very long without going bankrupt (which is the case for me now with Skylines) or you're a municipal control freak and turn these games inside out, you'll find something to enjoy.The games ""living"" traffic system adds another fun dimension to the game. It's hard to describe, but you can really watch individual citizens move about. Think of it like Rollercoaster Tycoon in that sense. If you aren't careful, you'll spend hours with unlimited money enabled just trying to create the ultimate roundabout. That's sort of like a rollercoaster, right?The robust modding api and workshop integration means you can really flex the game to work for you. You can subscribe to maps and assets to add some variety to your infrastructure or subscribe to mods that give you tools or tricks like automatically demolishing abandoned buildings or even tweaking the balance of the game. These kinds of things take a few years and shoddy modding wrappers to get working in other similar games, but Colossal Order has proven to be extremely competent and has provided us with a brilliant API. Take your time with this one, the community has a lot to offer when you're done with the base game.			"

												About six thousand years ago when the dinosaurs ruled the Earth, I discovered this game called ""SimCity"", and it was good. So insanely good that I played almost every incarnation of the game for the next 20 years, except for the really horrible ""social"" versions, which were terribly dumbed down.Then after the great flood washed away the dinosaurs, and took with it the last of EA's great developers and designers, we few surviving life-long SimCity addicts were left playing SimCity 4: Rush Hour for long year after year, hoping for the light to shine down from the heavens and impart on us the great knowledge, wisdom and truth of a brilliant new version of SimCity. That's when EA shoveled on us the massing stinking pile of dinosaur dung that was the ""new"" SimCity (aka SimCity 5), and lo, it was dark, ominous, horrible, and shockingly tiny. And DRM-restricted. And generally awful to the point where we all agreed SimCity was forever dead, killed by a greed-driven troll in the dark mountain keep of Electronicus Artus.And then Cities: Skylines appeared. And there was much joy and celebration! And lo, it was not only good, it was GREAT, and instantly assumed the torch of being the true spiritual successor of SimCity 4. If there had been a real SimCity 5 in the spirit of its predecessors, then Cities: Skylines is that game.True, Skylines doesn't have all of the options that SC4:RH did, but clearly the developers are on the right path and doing the right things. Tunnels are now in, and I honestly feel that these folks ""get it"". I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a true spiritual successor to SimCity 4: Rush Hour. Stick with these guys, it feels like they're on the right path and could grow this game into something truly amazing in time.			"

												Essentially everything the sequal to SimCity 4 should have been, this game is. Huge maps, the ability to create districts with different governing policies, and the budget management that was lacking in other games exists here. The transit system creation (down to being able to place the lines, and add express trains to busy subway tracks, etc, and the ability to create unique highway interchanges and road paths make this game come to life more than most city building games ever have.

												Last night I was up until 3 am playing this game. I spent an hour desiging a single four way highway interchangeI'm missing my mealsI'm seriously considering eschewing all social gatherings for the next month.This game is just too good. For years I've been playing city sim games, and I really havent found anything that can beat the old Sim Cities from over 10 years ago. Cities XL series, while fun, just doesn't hit the right notes.Skylines on the other hand is everything you ever wanted from a city sim. This is the sim city game we've been waiting for. This is a genre ender. I dont see how any other game can really make major improvements on this. It's got everything. This simulation is near perfect (it's scaled down a bit to make it easier, you won't notice it). It is very well optimised, Im running a 3rd gen I3 and there is very little lag (CXL lagged a lot for me, in comparison). The devs are involved in the community. The mod community is very active. It's relatively cheap, and the download size is tiny compared to most games.Now, I've gotta have my lunch so I can play more.			"

												Vanilla GameIs the best city builder since Sim City 4, if from a City Builder you like something like the classic Sim City and not like Tropico, Anno etc... So the focus is transport and you can build the city as you want because the game is almost to easy. Is easy to get money but your city will suffer from a chain of problems that you can address by adding resurces, reshaping roads and smoothing trafic. Anyway no metter how many problem the city does have is almost inpossible that your citizen become unahppy; and because criminality is linked to happyness police is not really necessaty. I suggest to give a try to the vanilla game before installing any mod/mapModsThe mod can already totally reshape the game experience: you can download tons of additional buildings both ploppable or growable, you can change the point of view to street level, alter the colur scheme and resolution, alter the interface (tranforming Chirpy in a scroll text just like the one on SC4), alter games rules to increase or decrease the challenge.Maps are also great: usign the site terrain.party you can download a map from your favourite location in the world, and since the map in the game is preaty big you can recreate a small city and its sourrounding. The water simulation express its true potential when you try to add a river in your custom map.TL:DRA great Game, maybe non perfect and not particularry challenging, but surely a great platform with a lot of potential for modding or expansion			"

												Eight hours in and I've been really enjoying it so far. It's very much inspired by the recent Sim City title (the UI is pretty much pulled directly from Sim City) but it makes some very important improvements. The cities are MUCH larger once your city grows and you can expand to additional squares. The game does a better job following individual citizens around the city. Also, the Steam Workshop support is great. There have already been a lot of neat mods and additional assets created and the game has only been out a few days. Also, the price point is better than Sim City's at launch, so that always helps too. If you were disappointed by EA/Maxis' title, check out this one instead. If you haven't played a city simulator game in a long time, this is the one I'd recommend picking up.			"

												This game is excelent.  It is everything SimCity should have been but wasn't.  They took the same idea and expanded into all the areas a good city builder should. Workshop support for player made buildings and mods make the game endlessly replayable.Make your own maps and build huge cities on them.  Creating bus lines, subway lines, feels great when streamlining your city.  The game really is best in class by far compared to all of its competitors. Pros- Great Mod/Workshop Support- Huge flexibility in designing roads and districts.- Runs great and looks great!- The details that you can see make the game really immersive.- Cars actually park on the street/in parking lots.- Good soundtrack.Cons- No nighttime (yet)- Had two incidents where the game crashed (possibly mod related)- One of my save files got corrupted. (Has been good for a while though)- Some buildings can be a tad finicky to place sometimes. Silly Airports.- No Multiplayer.- Traffic can be a little silly at times and won't utilize other lanes. Though mods can help.Very fun game, I am addicted.  Very small bumps in a great game!			"

												This game is lots of fun and allows you to manage all the apsects of a city, whether it's urban planning, managing land uses according to economic demand, traffic engineering and managing transport routes.There is a rather long game loading time, which deters me from playing unless I have a long slot of free time. However, once the game loads, you are indulged in building and managing your city. I can easily spend 6 hours on the game without even realising it (I have been wondering why the afternoons have been really short lately). Even when there is nothing to build, there is a lot of fun in watching the endless stream of vehicles moving swiftly through your well designed highway network, following trains to their destinations, and especially the citizens as they emerge from train stations or wait at bus stops, and being satisfied knowing that each person using your mass transit is one less car on your roads.

												I always loved strategy games and played several of them. But sooner or later I was dissapointed by them.Either they were too linear or too limited.Then I heard about this little gem and was really sceptical. I watched several youtube videos and thought hard wether I should spend the money or not...and if I would be willing to buy a new pc for this game.In the end my curiosity won and it was not dissapointed! A great game and I especially love the community and their never-ending and great ideas!			"

												Bought sim city for £40 (I think it was a long time ago)- It was first day release and the servers weren't working correctly and it require 24/7 internet connection to play so it kept booting me offline- 1 week later- Spent 50 minutes trying to log on- Took me about 30 minutes to fill out the small square of land they give you- Traffic Ai was driving through my main city causing huge traffic jams because that the shortest route even though there was a clear highway that would them to their destination much faster- Bought another sqaure of land and had to keep using a menu to go between each square this and the traffic Ai made it impossible to fix the traffic issuesGave up and bought cities skyline for about £15- Doesn't need 24/7 internet connection- Traffic AI is quite smart and tries to follow on the highway as long as possible- Fixed all my traffic issues and my city grew rapidly and demand for industry and commerical - I then bought the land next to my starting square and they merged together so no annoying menu- The water physics are surprisingly good and the dam are awesome- Land terrain tools are awesome- Mod supportedWould recommend this game and the natural disaster DLC with it			"

												""The city sim that Sim City (2013) should have been"" pretty much sums it up.Most of its minor flaws (depending on personal preference) can be ironed out with mods, for which there is a very active community. Also, the developers have been diligently patching the game and I'd like to point out that the European map & buildings pack included for free in the last update would have probably been sold as a DLC by most of their competitors.

												One of the greatest city builders out there that also includes workshop support for even more hours of fun!-Undoubtedly, this is one of best city builder games I have ever played. Although I cant help to compare this to the latest SimCity from EA, there are many pros and cons that are noticable. Some pros that can be seen is that Cities: Skylines allows you to purchase more plots of land if you run out of space, set districts and apply certain policies, and has definently more variety of roads, buildings, and cars than SimCity. But indeed like every game, there are some cons that are equally noticable. These include (in my opinion) no proper day/night cycle, time should last a few minutes instead of a few seconds, and car AI that should let emergency vehicles have the right of way during emergencies. The cons are not bad, but they should be definently improved or added sometime in the future.But the good news is, Colossal Order is planning to release their brand new expansion After Dark which includes a day/night cycle and adds some nighttime locations like nightclubs to see your city come to life. There is currently no set release date or prices but you can read more about it here[www.paradoxplaza.com]. Along with that, there are many mods in the workshop that can help enhance your experience throughout the game that add more roads, buildings, fixes, etc and also graphical mods.-Overall: If you are deciding wheather to buy Cities: Skylines or SimCity 2015, I recommend Cities: Skylines because it offers more features that SimCity 2015 lacks.

												Cities: Skyline is a city-simulator not unlike its Sim City predecessors. Unlike EA's most recent installment, however, Skyline understands what its consumers want. None of that token multiplayer online-connection ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t; it's just a quality city simulator with excellent modding support and a quality developer.I'll get the negatives out of the way first. One of the most annoying things is a Twitter knockoff that pops up on the top of your screen. Yes, it keeps you informed on what the citizens are thinking but not nearly as intuitively as one would like. Plus, it's annoying. Outside of that, there are a few other things here and there; buildings get abandoned like no one's business, and I would much rather have some sort of construction crew I could hire rather than having to go through and manually bulldoze each individual abandoned property. The public transit systems, while useful, don't provide the best feedback on how popular they are or how efficiently they are functioning. Finally, the roads could use a bit less liberal snapping; it's very hard to keep things straight, and you end up wasting space.That might seem like a lengthy negative paragraph at a glance, but I'll be honest: it's just nitpicks here and there. The game is quality with incredible simulation: all your citizens can be tracked, and their cars can be clicked and observed extensively. And when they ask why the mayor is sitting in the back of their car? Who cares. You are the one true mayor. How dare they question the authority of your elected office?There are a lot of nice touches to the game that make the cities you build feel vibrant and realistic. Water flow is key to maintaining a balance between pollution and your water supply, and the physics, while simple, are effective. The game isn't some casual time-waster either; forethought and budgeting are required to stay afloat. But if you don't want to worry about that, there's also auto-installed mods for things like unlimited money and full-unlocks. You can buy land for your city with each milestone you achieve through population growth, as well as gain upgrades to your buildings and districts. The game also runs very well, and the mechanics are very easily picked up--especially if you have experience with your classic city-management builder. If you don't like any of the maps, there is also a map creator you can use, which is fun to use if I do say so myself.So all in all? This is a quality addition to the genre. It's accessible to newer players and refreshing to veterans, and if you are a fan of the genre, I would highly recommend it. The game is full of content, and new content is being added by the vibrant modding community. The developers treat the community with respect and appreciation (UNLIKE A CERTAIN OTHER COMPANY), and they are very actively involved, appreciating feedback and discussion among their forums. So yeah, there are a few faults here and there, but I would say this game is definitely worth it's price.			"

												Cities Skylines is a game where you build up your city from a simple Highway entrance to a large metropolis. It can be fun at times, while still putting the player in stress in the form of fluctuating demand, trafic and complaints of buildings in their city.     Although, the game LOOKS realistic, but it's nowhere even close. The AI of cars, the (small) variety of buildings, and the way boats & other vehicles just phase into each other. And in order to make the city look realistic, you have to go and search all over the steam workshop (a place which has 300k+ items for C:S) and download assets & mods which can be faulty and dangerous for your computer. Plus, you still have decent lag even with a Titan processer (The best of the best) with all the downloads. Overall, it's pretty cool, but it needs more work on AI and preformance omptumization.			"

												Paradox and Colossal Order give us the best city builder since Sim City 2000. While some may not like Paradox's DLC model (and let's be honest, it can be a bit intimidating for new players), CSL offers loads of awesome content out of the box for a very affordable price. Micro-managers will love the ability to fine tune almost every aspect of their cities, from the names of city districts all the way down to following a single citizen around throughout his day. While there is a bit of a learning curve and the in-game tutorial is rather lacking (a hallmark of Paradox games) there are many youtubers and an official wiki that can help get you up to speed. A great, affordable buy for pretty much anyone!			"

Speaking about the devs, the most impressive thing about this title is that a team of 13 people put it together, so kudos on pulling off elegantly what EA/Maxis and AAA funding couldn't do.			"

Along with that, there are many mods in the workshop that can help enhance your experience throughout the game that add more roads, buildings, fixes, etc and also graphical mods.-Overall: If you are deciding wheather to buy Cities: Skylines or SimCity 2015, I recommend Cities: Skylines because it offers more features that SimCity 2015 lacks.

												Man I bet Maxis wishes they could make a city building sim like this again.This is a seriously amazing game that's just tons of fun to play around with, the expansions add a lot of content that's never really been in a good city building sim before and it has a lot of mods that just smooth out the issues the game has.It's better than Simcity, Tropico, CitiesXL, Anno and pretty much every city building game that's ever been released as far as I know of... maybe barring Banished which is just a fantastic little isolated experience but it doesn't come close to what Skylines has to offer.9/10			"

												Though my computer isn't the best for this game, it is good enough that I can form an opinion for it. This game is definitely a step up from the SimCity series. I found that the game was more complex that SimCity 2013 and the traffic A.I. is better. I love how the game manages to densely pack the buildings close together, something SimCity 2013 wasn't able to do. I also like the bigger city size, though with all 25 tiles, it might as well be a reigion. The water physics is also a nice touch, as was the map editor.Something I don't like about the game would be the lack of disasters. In SimCity 2013, the disasters added a challenge to the game. In Cities Skylines, the most difficult challenge would be solving any traffic problems your city has. Really, the worst that can happen is a death wave due to disease or the flooding of a low lying areas. Another thing I don't like is the fact that we can't change what the suspension bridge looks like. Also, the game doesn't really have a good amount of different buildings, meaning that there is often the same building side-by-side. Also, I found that the game suffers from some game glitches due to mods (i.e. Road tools disappearing in the map editor).Overall, I would definitely recommend this game!			"

												I'm currently 12 hours into this game, and I won't look back.Cities: Skylines is one of the best CIty Simulators out now. They literally took what SimCity wanted to do, grew a pair, and did it. Pros:-Great Optimization(My GPU isn't even the ""minimal"" and I run this on Maximum. w/ a slower CPU.)-Large building space(Yeah, i'm looking at you, EA.)-Mod support from Day 1. Already tons of mods on the Workshop.-Flow of traffic and people is very smooth and feels very responsive.Cons:-No tutorials, figure it out or find a guide.-City seems to stop growing for a while after you hit a ceartain pop. Then correct itself.-Few bugs, but the ones that are there are super annoying.(No crime rates, etc.)Overall I would give this an 8/10 and would say buy it if you are looking for a great City Simulator. Doesn't seem to be much out there doing a better job.			"

												Cities Skylines is like everything a (fanatic) city-builder wants to see in a game. With DLC still incoming we can expect a lot from the company for sure! Although it could be benefitial to have a PC that can handle a pretty heavy game like this one.Pros:- Wide range of mods and CC being made in the community for improving your city.- Will not get boring even after I don't know how much play time. (I have like 200 hours at the moment)- All the different kind of aspects of managing like: traffic, RCI and so on, are actually pretty challenging sometimes which keeps it more fun to play.- All the details are amazing and to see everything moving is just wonderful!- The huge area to build on is just a reason alone to buy this game.Cons:- A good PC is needed if you want to play this game (with mods) without too many problems or lag.But in the end you will have a beautiful city to look at!

												Cities skylines, o que dizer dessa delícia? Bom, eu não posso falar muito sobre o jogo pelo fato de eu ter jogado somente quando eles liberaram o final de semana grátis(risos), mas para falar brevemente, o jogo está muito bom, aconselho a todos jogarem. O jogo tem uma temática mais realista do que qualquer versão do  sim city, deixando qualquer fã de simulador piradão, os gráficos estão bons, dá para melhorar mais. A jogabilidade é extremamente amigável, ""muito fácil de jogar"", mas não tão fácil assim. Você tem que pensar muito no jogo, para não deixar a sua população faltando algo. Para isso você deve estar atento a qualquer mudança na cidade, se ela está crescendo e etc.E não se espelhe no nosso governo atual.Abraços.			"

												Cities: Skylines on its own is a very solid game. Everything I loved about SimCity 4, but better. Larger surface area to build to, more extensible, and a good price point. But the real key is in the mods. The mods can let you go from making relatively large towns to megacities. They can improve the sometimes questionable vehicle AI, and allow you to fine-tune the game to your liking. If your PC can handle it, you can creat an entire region, with a central city and suburbs and towns, all interconnected by road, rail, or metro.Great Game++			"

												I bought this game because it was categorically better than Sim City. I invested way more money than I should have in DLCs and the game itself for Sim City, and was massively let down. This game sports one of the largest workshop communities I have ever seen. I have recently met several new friends playing this game where I was able to commission some new pieces in the workshop. I would say it helps if you have a fair size amount of ram on your computer though. I tended to get bored very quickly with what the game initially had to offer and became addicted to utilizing workshop mods and assets. It can take quite the toll on your computer's memory capacity. So ye been warned. However, in my opnion totally worth it. Lmao company even released a free DLC... who does that?!?			"

												This game has taken the throne as the ultimate city building game for me, and I don't say this lightly. My first was the original Sim City, because I am old like that. Cities: Skylines is what a modern city builder should be. Plenty of details to dive into, but you can also take a more casual approach, if micromanaging isn't your style. Although some amount of micromanagement interest is probably not a BAD thing in this case (especially when it comes to planning your neighborhoods and traffic). If building cities is your bag, this will not dissapoint.			"

												I've not come to Cities Skylines via Sim City like many reviewers here.I've always found the idea of City Simulators to be a bit dull, but after reading reviews on Steam and spotting a 50% discount, I took a leap of faith and boy was I impressed !! Building roads, housing, water, electricity, school, police, fire, trash, transportation etc. in such a beautiful sandbox is about as much fun as I 've had on a PC in years.  Making your population happy and making money for expansion is a surprisingly satisfying activity. Zoning, districts and council policies are all concepts which are introduced gradually without fuss or complication. The 3D game engine is spectacular, intuitive and gorgeous to look at.I had a two thousand citizen city after just a few hours and spent another couple with the game on 'pause' just admiring my creation.I'm months away from modding the game but already I can see huge replayability and value for money.Congratulations to development team - Cities Skylines is clearly a labour of love.I would recommend this game to everyone, especially town planners. (Sorry guys, I confess I used to think you lot were all wierdos!)Buy it.			"

			Just something different I thought I'd try. So join me as I endeavor to answer, is it worth it? If you enjoy my videos please hit that like button and consider subscribing!		

Fans of city simulation games have bore an itch that has not been scratched. I’ve felt that itch as well, waiting for a quality successor to one of my favorite simulation games, and possibly one of my favorite games I had growing up. That game is SimCity 4. Since SimCity 4 came out in 2003, there has been no game that I felt was worthy of being called it’s successor. Games like Cities: XL and even Maxis’s own SimCity (which came out in 2013) have failed to produce an experience like the ever popular SimCity 4.Cities: Skylines (Which has no relation to the CitiesXL Franchise) is from the makers of the Cities in Motion franchise, a series focused primarily on managing a cities traffic. And funnily enough traffic is one of the few things I believe this game struggles with, but we’ll discuss that later.So first, lets just have a quick overview of the game.After a brief loading screen which provides you with a few random tips and tricks, you’ll be presented with your map. And a message, on the bottom right that serves as a basic and unintrusive tutorial.I generally don’t care for pop-up text tutorials, but I think colossal order did a good job, the tutorial is simple to skip and disable, as well as read and understand, and it doesn’t impact your game in a negative way.In order to build anything you will need a connection with the outside world. You do this by simply selecting the road, being presented with another easy to understand tutorial, and clicking and dragging the road to its desired length. Simple enough right? It’s been done this way in nearly every city sim I’ve ever played, it works, so it doesn’t need fixing. I think that is the same approach colossal order took while developing this game. They took everything that works in a city builder, and put it in the game. For the most part they succeeded. And where they may have failed, both in opinion and reality, users are empowered via to the Steam Workshop to create the game experience they want.This is all they had to do! This is all maxis and ea had to do to create an experience that will last a long time. Simply take what people liked from SimCity 4 and move it into the next generation of modern computing. Thats it.Now, this isn’t to say Cities: Skylines doesn’t have its faults, because it certainly does.There are some minor ones, graphically the game isn’t stunning. There are no filters and it’s just kind of grey. Although the included color correction tool in the options menu may change the visual styling more to your liking, it is very limiting only providing you with 4 options. Perhaps this can be rectified with mods, in fact it may have already been, considering there are over 30,000 mods as of this review.Another gripe I had was the lack of variety in buildings. From a distance this isn’t so noticeable, but zoom in to any one neighborhood, and you will be presented with a plethora of identical looking homes. Both in appearance and color palate. Additionally, the lack of any disaster mechanic such as what you’d find in the SimCity series is disappointing. It could have been a great way to make cities more memorable. Which brings me to another point.Often times I’d find myself playing this game for several hours in one sitting, building a city up from nothing, to a thriving megalopolis. Only to abandon the city the next day I play simply because my cities don’t feel special to me. Perhaps its just a failing of my personal style of play, or perhaps its a strike against Cities: Skylines.One of the primary issues you encounter is traffic. Traffic management quickly becomes your primary concern once your city begins to grow. It is unclear to me if this was by design or simply an undesired consequence of how the game handles “agents.” What I mean by agents is that every single moving speck, also known as your citizens, has a purpose or function, they aren’t simply randomly moving around the city with no purpose. Every delivery truck has a destination and source, just as every citizen has a job and a home. What this means, is that without careful traffic management and planning, you can experience bottlenecks, due to either your own incompetence or perhaps just how the game handles traffic, which seems to direct traffic based on the shortest distance available, and doesn’t take into account congestion.There are some other smaller gripes I have, but traffic is by far the biggest antagonist I have seen. Which brings me to another point. Beyond traffic, there is really not any end goal or ongoing metric that you have to manage. Which can turn some people off if they are looking for the game to tell them what to do, which it really doesn’t. There are some achievements or milestones, based on population which unlock new services. But these stop after 80,000 population. Meaning if you’re playing just to unlock everything, congratulations, you’ve just done it.In addition to milestones as an ongoing goal, you can also unlock unique buildings, which are earned by meeting certain requirements. For example, once your city has the airport, you can unlock the Grand Mall, which improves metrics like tourism, attractiveness and entertainment. But again, this is really all there is if you’re looking for a sense of progression. You have to create your own milestones if you really want to enjoy this game to its fullest extent. But even then, you are not experiencing all this game has to offer.The best way to play this game is with mods. There are a myriad of mods, which promise to fix nearly every problem I have encountered.A mod fixed the obnoxious color of pollution in the water and ground. A mod let me correct the direction of my roads without the need to delete and replace them. They have added in game terraforming, they allow me to place roads on top of roads. In short the possibilities of this game, as well as it’s long term viability are essentially endless. Thanks to the modding support provided by the devs, and the catalyst that is the steam workshop, making the installation of these mod files painless.This is the game that may very well dethrone what is often considered the definitive city builder, SimCity 4.Now, there's simply the matter of answering the original question I posed at the beginning of this video: Is it worth it?Despite it’s minor failings with traffic management and building variety, I think I can confidently say that this game is indeed worth the bargain price of $29.99.

												Cities Skylines still remains one of the best city builders available in terms of flexibility, available space, mods, and so on.In terms of available space you get a gigantic 9 tile area to work in by default. Which can be expanded with the 25 tile unlock mod. Since maps are different and inevitably cities get built different every time you play you don't unlock these tiles in any particular order either. You just purchase any tile that is next to another tile you already own. Which means you are not locked down to a simple square.There is a LOT of community content now. The game has been out for a while and the workshop is full of mods, maps, and assets to make your game better.  Of course I always recommend first play throughs be straight up vanilla just to get a feel for the unmodded a game. However, there are some real benefits to using mods.That said though I really can not recommend any of the paid DLCs other than After Dark. This was the first DLC they released and it still seems like the most impactful to date. I would have to say that what makes it better is that it provides things that are useful in building the city or in managing the city. This would be, as example, like the Bus Terminal which is an almost necessary thing for managing your city. Using it you can easily see how many of your citizens will travel between your various routes.Snowfall and Natural Disasters on the other hand always seemed, to me at least, more gimmicky than really helpful. Like they were just put in to say ""here is new content. enjoy!"" but they really didnt help anything like After Dark did.  The Snowfall DLC pretty much only gives you the street car (tram) service to help with actually managing your city and everything else is just winter flavored Skylines. Actually one might even say that Snowfall is more hassle that its worth since you have to build in an all white zone which people have complained many times about this causing eye strain and headaches. Then you have specialized services for heating and road maintenance which eats up more of your city resources than you normally would.Natural Disasters is kinda one of those things i remember from the first SimCity game I played as a kid. I remember working on my city and having the a tornado or godzilla go through the city and destroy things. Then I would have to rebuild. Seemed like might be interesting. Not so much though to be honest.Where in that old game when you didnt have much else to worry about except placing power lines and roads... this game you have a lot more to worry about. Probably the least threatening aspect here is the forest fires, but everything else if it hits your city can really be a problem. The thing I find the worst about this, and I have seen this thought elsewhere too, is that I have to spend so many hours building up a great city then a disaster comes and smashes things. Which I am not even one that goes overboard with a huge amount of detail! I have seen streamers that really micromanage on the details and if I put that level of detail in only to have it destroyed I would quit playing.Mass Transit Will be coming out soon and it promises to be another good DLC that will be helpful in many ways. What is known about it right now is that there will be new public transportation added in the paid DLC which will help in managing the city better and the free patch that goes along with the DLC release will have a LOT of quality of life changes which are focused on traffic and transportation.Here is a run down of the DLC content:After Dark:Added PrisonsAdded District Specializations (Industry and Commercial)Added Taxi ServiceAdded Bus Terminal (handles multiple bus lines where citizens can go to change between lines)Added Bicycles and Bicycle Pathssee the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.2.0Snow Fall:Added Winter ThemeAdded Tram ServiceAdded Snow Plow (only on snow maps obviously)Added more energy consumption and heating requirements (..on the snow maps)see the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.3.0-f4Natural Disasters:Added 7 DisastersAdded Early Warning System (to warn you about disasters happening)Added Helicopter (fire, medical, and police)Added Evacuation Routes (for disaster events)see the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.6.0Mass Transit:Added MonorailsAdded BlimpsAdded Cable CarsAdded FerriesAdded Transport Hubs (multi-transit buildings ex. monorail+bus terminal)see the full patch here: TBA			"

												In this game you can...-Flood your city using dams-Kill your citizens by putting a water pump down the river and the sewage pipe up the river-Turn on sandbox and spend 2 hours building a highway (actually that's what I seen on some streams)-Fill a lake with sewage and call it a♥♥♥♥♥♥Lake-Build a dam, wait for river to get dry and build nuclear power plant there, then destroy the dam and laugh because of power plant saying that they have no water.-(Unrecommended) build a city that will keep the citizens happy and generate income.

												Despite a strange lack of graphics options, this game is fantastic. It is a more grounded and realistic city builder with none of that annoying micro-management that plagues a lot of these city builders. The only problem is that the police AI is broken and the civilians, even when you have two hospitals, will refuse to go there. Also, Chirper is incredibly annoying, providing no actual, useful information whatsoever.			"

												This game is phenomenal. Not since I first bought and downloaded Minecraft have I played one game for such a long period of time without switching to another game here or there. This game has the feel of a early RollerCoaster Tycoon game where you can tell the developers took pride in creating and perfecting every little detail and aspect of the game. This game is extremely addicting in the best way possible. Your city, the city that you watch rise out of a field of grass, feels alive. There is always a buzz around town and you truly feel like you and your civs are in it together. You feel a sense of obligation to your fellow city members after a while. If there is a traffic problem, you want to fix it for their sake and your own. After you fix that first problem, you look to improve another aspect of how your city is planned. After that, there is something else to improve. You can see why it is so hard to bank that final save of the night and hit that quit button. There are a few little things here and there that aren't perfect in the game yet. Some UI tweaks are needed and the driving AI is in need of an overhaul but for a game that was developed by a team of under 20 people a few minor issues are to be expected. I've seen blockbuster titles being released with more issues than this game. Mod support is incredible in this game as well. I've never seen such a seamless integration with the steam workshop in a game. If there is an issue that you have with an aspect of this game, there is very likely a mod that will change it for you.I would say I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game already and I don't intend on putting it down in the near future. I can only say thank you to a development team that deserves the high praise that this game has garnered. I can only hope that they keep making games that are as simple yet deep with gameplay as Cities: Skylines in the future.			"

												This is a great game. Sim City 4 will still always hold a special place in my heart but this one comes very close, if not with the flaws of Sim City 4 balanced out with this game, it's the same.The game is fluid. I've had a city with almost 100k residents and no lag moving around the city and taking care of things. the game is a bit more challenging though...don't have the right balance of services and your city and you'll crap out. the flaws of this game:* As mentioned, if you don't have the right balance of things your city will fail, and fast. While laying new subway lines for my CBD my population went from around 15k to around 5k. Turns out that portion of my city randomly died, and fast. I then discovered that I had a minor traffic jam in which ambulances were waiting for a red light! One of the major flaws of the game: The emergancy services don't ignore the traffic lights when they're responding to calls - this makes major problems if you have a minor traffic jam, your ambulences are stuck waiting in it and your citizens die.* More onto the above point, if you have a well established public transportation system, 90% of the vehicles on your roadway are AMBULENCES! This is SO annoying. If you need to get precise, no matter where you zoom, you hear the sirens! EVERYONE in your city will call 911 if they have a bloody nose it seems! THIS IS SO ANNOYING.* The landfills have to be placed in the midst of your city, you can't just shove them off in one corner and have your garbage trucks carry the garbage all that way. This is a major problem as the landfills cause ground pollution. Probably not that badly as an incinerator, but with ground pollution near to your residents they'll get sick.* The onramps/offramps look a bit weird and are hard to manage, same with the curves of the roads. Not a game breaker though.All in all, I definitely recommend you get this game. It's fantastic, and with a HUGE modding community already going, it'll only get better.			"

												Good build simulator, fills what simcity lacks while simcity got some features this miss. Like play online and link cities together. Although linking in the way as simcity would not be needed in singleplayer as the Cities are alredy huge. A mayor buildning would have been cool i guess too. I probably edit this if i come up with more stuff i like/hate.+Huge expansionzones+Play with or without unlimited money+ Great electricity possibilities.+ The whole game feels more fun when it's huge rather than just a small corner of what simcity 4 was like simcity 5.+Tourists and export/import+/- A house for the mayor would have been cool i guess.- It feels like there is a bit few buildnings at times.- No multiplayer- Just made another - for the lolz like as there is nothing bad to say about this game other than this that i can come up with now..

												Cities: Skylines is one of the best city-builder games I ever played. The traffic is a real challenge, you will always have a traffic-jam anywhere in the city.

												Cities Skylines still remains one of the best city builders available in terms of flexibility, available space, mods, and so on.In terms of available space you get a gigantic 9 tile area to work in by default. Which can be expanded with the 25 tile unlock mod. Since maps are different and inevitably cities get built different every time you play you don't unlock these tiles in any particular order either. You just purchase any tile that is next to another tile you already own. Which means you are not locked down to a simple square.There is a LOT of community content now. The game has been out for a while and the workshop is full of mods, maps, and assets to make your game better.  Of course I always recommend first play throughs be straight up vanilla just to get a feel for the unmodded a game. However, there are some real benefits to using mods.That said though I really can not recommend any of the paid DLCs other than After Dark. This was the first DLC they released and it still seems like the most impactful to date. I would have to say that what makes it better is that it provides things that are useful in building the city or in managing the city. This would be, as example, like the Bus Terminal which is an almost necessary thing for managing your city. Using it you can easily see how many of your citizens will travel between your various routes.Snowfall and Natural Disasters on the other hand always seemed, to me at least, more gimmicky than really helpful. Like they were just put in to say ""here is new content. enjoy!"" but they really didnt help anything like After Dark did.  The Snowfall DLC pretty much only gives you the street car (tram) service to help with actually managing your city and everything else is just winter flavored Skylines. Actually one might even say that Snowfall is more hassle that its worth since you have to build in an all white zone which people have complained many times about this causing eye strain and headaches. Then you have specialized services for heating and road maintenance which eats up more of your city resources than you normally would.Natural Disasters is kinda one of those things i remember from the first SimCity game I played as a kid. I remember working on my city and having the a tornado or godzilla go through the city and destroy things. Then I would have to rebuild. Seemed like might be interesting. Not so much though to be honest.Where in that old game when you didnt have much else to worry about except placing power lines and roads... this game you have a lot more to worry about. Probably the least threatening aspect here is the forest fires, but everything else if it hits your city can really be a problem. The thing I find the worst about this, and I have seen this thought elsewhere too, is that I have to spend so many hours building up a great city then a disaster comes and smashes things. Which I am not even one that goes overboard with a huge amount of detail! I have seen streamers that really micromanage on the details and if I put that level of detail in only to have it destroyed I would quit playing.Mass Transit Will be coming out soon and it promises to be another good DLC that will be helpful in many ways. What is known about it right now is that there will be new public transportation added in the paid DLC which will help in managing the city better and the free patch that goes along with the DLC release will have a LOT of quality of life changes which are focused on traffic and transportation.Here is a run down of the DLC content:After Dark:Added PrisonsAdded District Specializations (Industry and Commercial)Added Taxi ServiceAdded Bus Terminal (handles multiple bus lines where citizens can go to change between lines)Added Bicycles and Bicycle Pathssee the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.2.0Snow Fall:Added Winter ThemeAdded Tram ServiceAdded Snow Plow (only on snow maps obviously)Added more energy consumption and heating requirements (..on the snow maps)see the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.3.0-f4Natural Disasters:Added 7 DisastersAdded Early Warning System (to warn you about disasters happening)Added Helicopter (fire, medical, and police)Added Evacuation Routes (for disaster events)see the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.6.0Mass Transit:Added MonorailsAdded BlimpsAdded Cable CarsAdded FerriesAdded Transport Hubs (multi-transit buildings ex. monorail+bus terminal)see the full patch here: TBA			"

												The game is very immersive. My first taste of the game sucked me in for a few hours and unlike some games it will entice me back for more as there is plenty to discover. If you're a fan of city builders then you're in for a treat here. Don't expect perfection though as there are a few bugs to iron out (i.e. burger joint signs on drug stores, Fire Engines disappearing off of the map when they should go directly to the burning building) but be assured these are extremely minor bugs that don't take anything away from the fun of the game. With Steam Workshop activated I'm sure they'll be loads to add to the game in future. The main thing i love is the fact that you can play it anyway that you want to - small scale towns/districts, large scale towns/districts - it even has a sandbox mode (unlimited money) if that's your kind of thing.I haven't even got to the public transport side of things but considering Paradox made Cities in Motion as well I'm expecting good things.One last thing to add, I will not be as petty to compare it to similar games in the genre, however it is great that you don't have to be online all the time to play it and the maps can become huge!!Well done the developers. 8.5/10 "

												Great game so far. I stayed away from SimCity 2013 after hearing all the bad reviews, although I enjoyed SimCity 4 a great deal. Being able to customize assets with a neat in game tool is pretty sweet. Having the game be very open towards modding is a huge plus too, and hopefully the developers will update the game frequently with bug fixes and new features.What the game should improve on/add -- Population and job density: After upgrading low density commerce and residential to high density (which at first looks like the equivalent of medium density buildings from SimCity 4), the increase in jobs and population per building is quite low. The city I have right now has a decent amount of medium high rises, yet sits only at around 10,000 population. If I had built this city in SimCity 4 I would probably have around double the population I do in Cities: Skylines. I'm sure some modders will fix this, but it would be nice to be fixed in vanilla too.- Allow for roads to be dragged across other roads: Currently if I want to build a 4 lane street and connect across multiple 2 lane streets, I have to drag and connect to the first one, then stop, click again and connect to the 2nd, since if you try to simply drag them across all the roads at once the game brings up the ""space in use"" error. - The graphics: Yes I know graphics aren't everything, and I don't need an amazing looking game for the game to be fun. My beef with the graphics is that the buildings and terrain have this blurry feel to them most of the time, which is acceptable viewing them from a distance, but up close they should be pretty clear to the camera. - The cars: In my opinion they look too plain and generic. Yes they have different colors and types, but for the most part they honestly look like those colored cars from The Game of Life board game. More realistic and detailed cars would be nice to see.- Ability to drive around your city, akin to the U-Drive-It mode from SimCity 4. Definitely not necessary to add in the game, but would be neat to drive around the city, either first person or 3rd person. 1st person would be much cooler, but 3rd person would be easier to code in most likely.Overall I would recommend getting this game if you like city builders. I wouldn't give it a perfect score, as the population/job density issue is really bugging me, but that'll likely get fixed.			"

												Well what can I say. It's a big middle finger to EA's SimCity. There is so much more complexity and entertainment to be found in this game over SC.I've only played 18 Hours of it so far and in that time I've roamed around Los Santos from GTA 5, Venice, France, UK and Gotham.I've ruined two worlds by accidentally polluting the water and putting thousands of people in hospital running up my debt and now finally after those 18 hours I've finally got the hang of the game and I'm now safely running a 30k pop world and rising.PROs- Higher learning curve required over SM- In-depth tax, resource management, budget system- Mods- Large Landscape- Custom MapsCONs- No autosave feature- Mods disable achievements- Manual BulldozerPossible future patches could include the cons listed.An autosave feature would be a godsend, every so often my PC decides to randomly cut off for no reason and if I haven't sayed for quite some time, that's a huge chunk of my time wasted as I'll have to do it all over again.Some mods actually benefit the game without deteriorating from the experience (unlimited cash) such as a the autosave mod.Having to manually click each indivual road or house item can over time become tedious, automating this like the Bulldozer in SM would be beneficial			"

												I like this game very much. I'm, actually was, a fan of the SimCity serie but it's dead because of EA and its poor management.Finally Colossal Order Ltd. does what EA didn't and it creates the best City simulator out yet.Eventough it's still in its first phase. and it needs some tweaks here and there, you can enjoy a full City simulator experience like it should be done in 2015.Highly recommended			"

												This is a great game. Sim City 4 will still always hold a special place in my heart but this one comes very close, if not with the flaws of Sim City 4 balanced out with this game, it's the same.The game is fluid. I've had a city with almost 100k residents and no lag moving around the city and taking care of things. the game is a bit more challenging though...don't have the right balance of services and your city and you'll crap out. the flaws of this game:* As mentioned, if you don't have the right balance of things your city will fail, and fast. While laying new subway lines for my CBD my population went from around 15k to around 5k. Turns out that portion of my city randomly died, and fast. I then discovered that I had a minor traffic jam in which ambulances were waiting for a red light! One of the major flaws of the game: The emergancy services don't ignore the traffic lights when they're responding to calls - this makes major problems if you have a minor traffic jam, your ambulences are stuck waiting in it and your citizens die.* More onto the above point, if you have a well established public transportation system, 90% of the vehicles on your roadway are AMBULENCES! This is SO annoying. If you need to get precise, no matter where you zoom, you hear the sirens! EVERYONE in your city will call 911 if they have a bloody nose it seems! THIS IS SO ANNOYING.* The landfills have to be placed in the midst of your city, you can't just shove them off in one corner and have your garbage trucks carry the garbage all that way. This is a major problem as the landfills cause ground pollution. Probably not that badly as an incinerator, but with ground pollution near to your residents they'll get sick.* The onramps/offramps look a bit weird and are hard to manage, same with the curves of the roads. Not a game breaker though.All in all, I definitely recommend you get this game. It's fantastic, and with a HUGE modding community already going, it'll only get better.			"

												I have played almost every city simulator that has been created. This one by far is the best. Not just because it is a passion project from the developers, but because this is going to be supported for a very long time. Specifically with the modding support. Day 3 and there are already significant mods/maps/objects available.  Can not recommend this one highly enough.  BUY THIS GAME!			"

												This is the city builder we have been waiting for, for 12 years now. A most worthy successor to Simcity 4, an improvement both in scope and execution over Sim City 2013. Highlights are the Water Physics, the road building (especially the roundabouts and interchanges) and the sheer joy of the soundtrack (and the fact that it runs nice and smooth even with larger cities). Looking forward to future content, both though the modding comunity, and through Colosal Order and their publisher Paradox.Colosal Order, you have done amazing work, big hand to you, and hope you rain down awesome DLC onto us!

												You can tell when a game is created by passionate artists and developers. This could be the SimCity 4 successor that we have been waiting all these years for. Everything that SC2k13 did wrong, Colossal Order tried to make right. City sizes are 9x bigger, and easily modded to 25x bigger than SC2k13. They didn't only make things better, they also introduced many new features such as districts, specialized industrial zones and dynamic water movement. Modding support is also a huge feature that is offered. The Steam Workshop has over 1000 mods, models and maps already online less than 24 hours after the release. There are a handful of requests for features that didn't make it to release, but the devs promised that they would continue working on this game to include as many new features as possible. (Such as road & highway tunnels, disasters and day/night cycles).This is only the first day of the launch, and the game is already extremely stable, and looks beautiful.I look forward to seeing what the devs and the mod community comes up with in the future!This game was created by a small indie development team and look at what they produced. I highly recommend this game to anyone who felt disappointed with SimCity and wants to play a genuine city simulator that has the fun of previous versions, but the new features that modern gamers want to play.

It's not overly easy, nor does it punish you, but simply rewards and scolds you for your creativity or ineptitude. There is just so much to it, it's amazing just how damn well this beats runs.			"

												This is an amazing game. Following what SimCity 2013 brought of issues, terrible choices and problems, this game was released with a lot of similar ideas, but making pretty much all of them better. It is really fun building your city and placing your public services to offer power, police, education, and others. It is a great challenge to manage space for all of it. And for this I recommend playing this game without placing service buildings and roads over residences, commerce or industries. It makes a much better challenge that got me to enjoy the challenge much more. While really fun to build and plan your city, the variety of buildings makes me feel like there is slightly too few options and no modifications or customization to the buildings, but I really don't think this takes anything away from the game, it is more like something I'd like than something that is missing from the game. And when you know that a group of 13 people made all of this, it feels like it's not really missing anything. On the other side, the lack of expansible service buildings help you make better use of space if compared to EA's SimCity 2013.The best part of the game is probably the traffic management. Following the Cities in Motion games, that the focus was to manage traffic, many amazing ideas and features come from it. The way that you can manually build roads, railways and metro lines is amazing, giving space for a lot of different ideas and customization, you can build it the way you want it to be. I spent a lot of hours building and rebuilding roads, planning bus lines, bringing railways from far away to transport people and cargo from and to the city, and planning how my metro lines and stations would be placed.The traffic is not without it's flaws. Sometimes you can place a 6 lane road and for some reason all the vehicles will be using only one of them and making a huge line instead of spreading around and allowing the traffic to flow. In some cases it's possible to fix this situation, but not everytime.And one other thing that I really missed is any kind of negotiations with neighbor cities. I'm not talking about the multiplayer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from SimCity 2013, but something like how it was on Sim City 3000, that is a great game that had a nice feature that you could make agreements with neighbor towns, it was really nice.My final verdict is very positive, I think this game is great and if you're into city building, or even have a slight interest in it, you should buy this game. It is at a reasonable price, and offers a lot, it will probably take away dozens of hours of your time, but you will enjoy these hours.I'm really looking forward for what can be made better in this game and in a possible sequel, but am also afraid of the strategy from Paradox of selling 10 thousand DLC's per game. Hope it's not the case for this game, that the DLC's offer really good content for a acceptable price.			"

												This game is phenomenal. Not since I first bought and downloaded Minecraft have I played one game for such a long period of time without switching to another game here or there. This game has the feel of a early RollerCoaster Tycoon game where you can tell the developers took pride in creating and perfecting every little detail and aspect of the game. This game is extremely addicting in the best way possible. Your city, the city that you watch rise out of a field of grass, feels alive. There is always a buzz around town and you truly feel like you and your civs are in it together. You feel a sense of obligation to your fellow city members after a while. If there is a traffic problem, you want to fix it for their sake and your own. After you fix that first problem, you look to improve another aspect of how your city is planned. After that, there is something else to improve. You can see why it is so hard to bank that final save of the night and hit that quit button. There are a few little things here and there that aren't perfect in the game yet. Some UI tweaks are needed and the driving AI is in need of an overhaul but for a game that was developed by a team of under 20 people a few minor issues are to be expected. I've seen blockbuster titles being released with more issues than this game. Mod support is incredible in this game as well. I've never seen such a seamless integration with the steam workshop in a game. If there is an issue that you have with an aspect of this game, there is very likely a mod that will change it for you.I would say I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game already and I don't intend on putting it down in the near future. I can only say thank you to a development team that deserves the high praise that this game has garnered. I can only hope that they keep making games that are as simple yet deep with gameplay as Cities: Skylines in the future.			"

												I bought this game because it was categorically better than Sim City. I invested way more money than I should have in DLCs and the game itself for Sim City, and was massively let down. This game sports one of the largest workshop communities I have ever seen. I have recently met several new friends playing this game where I was able to commission some new pieces in the workshop. I would say it helps if you have a fair size amount of ram on your computer though. I tended to get bored very quickly with what the game initially had to offer and became addicted to utilizing workshop mods and assets. It can take quite the toll on your computer's memory capacity. So ye been warned. However, in my opnion totally worth it. Lmao company even released a free DLC... who does that?!?			"

I still remind of how angry I used to get everytime we would simply ask for EA not to destroy core game features of SimCity in its 2013s version and they would just ignore the comments on their devs blog... One week after the game is launched and if you go to the Steam Workshop, the team that developed this game is already commenting on the mods they think would bring interesting stuff that should become core in the next update... thats how bad youre gona love this game. By the way, it is a 5 star game, fair price, very open to modding and very close to simcity in its best years, but much more improved. If you are a SimCity player already, the game experience should feel familiar, so not very difficult to start. Buy it.			"

												*Edited for patch 1.1Unlike the disappointment that was SimCity 2013, Cities: Skylines is a real city simulator/builder. Every single resident in your city has a home, a job, an education (if you build schools that is), and everyone has somewhere they need to go. You can watch them leave their home, take the subway to the bus stop to take the bus to the mall, and then do the same in reverse to go back home. As someone who fell in love with SimCity when the original came out as shareware in 1989 and have played every Will Wright game since (as well as some of the none-Will Wright followups), I highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who likes city builders. This game is what we wanted from a new SimCity game, without all the bad decisions EA made.The game isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close. It makes building truly massive cities fun and possible, and with the right hardware the cities look pretty good too with an incredible attention to detail. Building a succesful (profitable) city is fairly easy (easier than SC4 that is), but getting past the 50,000 resident mark, while dealing with traffic, water, power, garbage, and sewage is the real challenge. Getting past the 100,000 resident mark requires some creative thinking in the construction of intersections, highways, and bus lines, but it can be done and you can keep expanding your city until you run out of land to purchase.While the game is a true simulation, it has no natural disasters and if you can keep your city from dying to polluted water or choking in traffic jams, then you can continue building until the budget can't cover it anymore.Traffic has been improved greatly since launch and is now much easier to manage. We've gotten tunnels and the ability to build roundabouts and any other kind of road or rail at any level above and below ground, and the game continues to have some of the best mod support of any game ever released.

												Its the game called ""Sim City"" you've always dreamed of playing, Except its NOT OWNED BY Electronic Arts. Very enjoyable. Needs multiplayer though, but I think the developers are working on that, from what I heard.Pros- Cities can be built really really big.- A ton of modding support, customizing games has never been better.- Beautiful graphics, cities look amazing- The water has physics, you can make a damn, it will fill up, then break it, you'll have a tsunami.- Many many in game features making it better than Sim City.Cons:- Has some minor bug, not game breaking, such as walkways making holes into the void under roads.

												Great game so far. I stayed away from SimCity 2013 after hearing all the bad reviews, although I enjoyed SimCity 4 a great deal. Being able to customize assets with a neat in game tool is pretty sweet. Having the game be very open towards modding is a huge plus too, and hopefully the developers will update the game frequently with bug fixes and new features.What the game should improve on/add -- Population and job density: After upgrading low density commerce and residential to high density (which at first looks like the equivalent of medium density buildings from SimCity 4), the increase in jobs and population per building is quite low. The city I have right now has a decent amount of medium high rises, yet sits only at around 10,000 population. If I had built this city in SimCity 4 I would probably have around double the population I do in Cities: Skylines. I'm sure some modders will fix this, but it would be nice to be fixed in vanilla too.- Allow for roads to be dragged across other roads: Currently if I want to build a 4 lane street and connect across multiple 2 lane streets, I have to drag and connect to the first one, then stop, click again and connect to the 2nd, since if you try to simply drag them across all the roads at once the game brings up the ""space in use"" error. - The graphics: Yes I know graphics aren't everything, and I don't need an amazing looking game for the game to be fun. My beef with the graphics is that the buildings and terrain have this blurry feel to them most of the time, which is acceptable viewing them from a distance, but up close they should be pretty clear to the camera. - The cars: In my opinion they look too plain and generic. Yes they have different colors and types, but for the most part they honestly look like those colored cars from The Game of Life board game. More realistic and detailed cars would be nice to see.- Ability to drive around your city, akin to the U-Drive-It mode from SimCity 4. Definitely not necessary to add in the game, but would be neat to drive around the city, either first person or 3rd person. 1st person would be much cooler, but 3rd person would be easier to code in most likely.Overall I would recommend getting this game if you like city builders. I wouldn't give it a perfect score, as the population/job density issue is really bugging me, but that'll likely get fixed.			"

												Cities Skylines still remains one of the best city builders available in terms of flexibility, available space, mods, and so on.In terms of available space you get a gigantic 9 tile area to work in by default. Which can be expanded with the 25 tile unlock mod. Since maps are different and inevitably cities get built different every time you play you don't unlock these tiles in any particular order either. You just purchase any tile that is next to another tile you already own. Which means you are not locked down to a simple square.There is a LOT of community content now. The game has been out for a while and the workshop is full of mods, maps, and assets to make your game better.  Of course I always recommend first play throughs be straight up vanilla just to get a feel for the unmodded a game. However, there are some real benefits to using mods.That said though I really can not recommend any of the paid DLCs other than After Dark. This was the first DLC they released and it still seems like the most impactful to date. I would have to say that what makes it better is that it provides things that are useful in building the city or in managing the city. This would be, as example, like the Bus Terminal which is an almost necessary thing for managing your city. Using it you can easily see how many of your citizens will travel between your various routes.Snowfall and Natural Disasters on the other hand always seemed, to me at least, more gimmicky than really helpful. Like they were just put in to say ""here is new content. enjoy!"" but they really didnt help anything like After Dark did.  The Snowfall DLC pretty much only gives you the street car (tram) service to help with actually managing your city and everything else is just winter flavored Skylines. Actually one might even say that Snowfall is more hassle that its worth since you have to build in an all white zone which people have complained many times about this causing eye strain and headaches. Then you have specialized services for heating and road maintenance which eats up more of your city resources than you normally would.Natural Disasters is kinda one of those things i remember from the first SimCity game I played as a kid. I remember working on my city and having the a tornado or godzilla go through the city and destroy things. Then I would have to rebuild. Seemed like might be interesting. Not so much though to be honest.Where in that old game when you didnt have much else to worry about except placing power lines and roads... this game you have a lot more to worry about. Probably the least threatening aspect here is the forest fires, but everything else if it hits your city can really be a problem. The thing I find the worst about this, and I have seen this thought elsewhere too, is that I have to spend so many hours building up a great city then a disaster comes and smashes things. Which I am not even one that goes overboard with a huge amount of detail! I have seen streamers that really micromanage on the details and if I put that level of detail in only to have it destroyed I would quit playing.Mass Transit Will be coming out soon and it promises to be another good DLC that will be helpful in many ways. What is known about it right now is that there will be new public transportation added in the paid DLC which will help in managing the city better and the free patch that goes along with the DLC release will have a LOT of quality of life changes which are focused on traffic and transportation.Here is a run down of the DLC content:After Dark:Added PrisonsAdded District Specializations (Industry and Commercial)Added Taxi ServiceAdded Bus Terminal (handles multiple bus lines where citizens can go to change between lines)Added Bicycles and Bicycle Pathssee the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.2.0Snow Fall:Added Winter ThemeAdded Tram ServiceAdded Snow Plow (only on snow maps obviously)Added more energy consumption and heating requirements (..on the snow maps)see the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.3.0-f4Natural Disasters:Added 7 DisastersAdded Early Warning System (to warn you about disasters happening)Added Helicopter (fire, medical, and police)Added Evacuation Routes (for disaster events)see the full patch here: http://www.skylineswiki.com/Patch_1.6.0Mass Transit:Added MonorailsAdded BlimpsAdded Cable CarsAdded FerriesAdded Transport Hubs (multi-transit buildings ex. monorail+bus terminal)see the full patch here: TBA			"

												Well what can I say. It's a big middle finger to EA's SimCity. There is so much more complexity and entertainment to be found in this game over SC.I've only played 18 Hours of it so far and in that time I've roamed around Los Santos from GTA 5, Venice, France, UK and Gotham.I've ruined two worlds by accidentally polluting the water and putting thousands of people in hospital running up my debt and now finally after those 18 hours I've finally got the hang of the game and I'm now safely running a 30k pop world and rising.PROs- Higher learning curve required over SM- In-depth tax, resource management, budget system- Mods- Large Landscape- Custom MapsCONs- No autosave feature- Mods disable achievements- Manual BulldozerPossible future patches could include the cons listed.An autosave feature would be a godsend, every so often my PC decides to randomly cut off for no reason and if I haven't sayed for quite some time, that's a huge chunk of my time wasted as I'll have to do it all over again.Some mods actually benefit the game without deteriorating from the experience (unlimited cash) such as a the autosave mod.Having to manually click each indivual road or house item can over time become tedious, automating this like the Bulldozer in SM would be beneficial			"

I probably edit this if i come up with more stuff i like/hate.+Huge expansionzones+Play with or without unlimited money+ Great electricity possibilities.+ The whole game feels more fun when it's huge rather than just a small corner of what simcity 4 was like simcity 5.+Tourists and export/import+/- A house for the mayor would have been cool i guess.- It feels like there is a bit few buildnings at times.- No multiplayer- Just made another - for the lolz like as there is nothing bad to say about this game other than this that i can come up with now..

												The game is very immersive. My first taste of the game sucked me in for a few hours and unlike some games it will entice me back for more as there is plenty to discover. If you're a fan of city builders then you're in for a treat here. Don't expect perfection though as there are a few bugs to iron out (i.e. burger joint signs on drug stores, Fire Engines disappearing off of the map when they should go directly to the burning building) but be assured these are extremely minor bugs that don't take anything away from the fun of the game. With Steam Workshop activated I'm sure they'll be loads to add to the game in future. The main thing i love is the fact that you can play it anyway that you want to - small scale towns/districts, large scale towns/districts - it even has a sandbox mode (unlimited money) if that's your kind of thing.I haven't even got to the public transport side of things but considering Paradox made Cities in Motion as well I'm expecting good things.One last thing to add, I will not be as petty to compare it to similar games in the genre, however it is great that you don't have to be online all the time to play it and the maps can become huge!!Well done the developers. 8.5/10 "

												An incredible game!If your a fan of building sims this is the one for you. Simcity used to be the daddy back in the day but has slowly gone down hill over the years and became terrible! Games like City XL tried to pick up where Sim city left off but failed in my opinion. Then this little gem appeared. Pretty much blows away the competition. Easy to use, highly detailed down to the fact you can watch a person leave their home and go to work. The company has endorsed modding so the amount of extra content is mind blowing. From basic stuctures to being about to get into a copter and fly around your city. One of the best games of the year so far!10/10 A MUST BUY!			"

												This is such a great game! This is by far the best city building game I've ever played. I've played SimCity and love it, but this goes so far beyond. There are so many options. I love the natural resources, which really adds to the gameplay. The only thing I think could be improved is the road building; it's sometimes difficult to place the road right where you want it. Overall, this game is great! If you are considering purchasing but are unsure, just buy it! You'll be pleased. "

												Surprisingly solid and refined game that is fun, has depth and feels very accessible. Lots of stuff to dig into, especially considering the price.The game is not perfect (a bit on the easy side, lack of building variety, needs some events and/or disasters to break up the later game a bit), but still lots of fun - and mods already start addressing some of the problems and the developers are already promising free content patches.Even in its current state, it's well worth the price of admission and a good city builder, the future potential is just the extra cherry on top.

												This is hands-down one of the finest city building games I have ever played.I've enjoyed games throughout the entire Simcity series (from 3000 on and excluding the newest) and on to smaller-scale management games such as the Anno series. Although these are good games, few have been as utterly absorbing as Cities: Skylines.The game is reasonably ""easy"" in the sense that you won't encounter a steep difficulty curve from the economic side of the simulation. That is, you're probably not going to run out of money, and before long your coffers will be so full you'll have more money than spending options.However, the real difficulty comes from the optimization, and it's baked into the game's design so organically that it makes you wonder why it hasn't been done before. If you want a large city with skyscrapers, you will have to get your services in your neighborhoods ""just so"" to get them to appear. You will hit population resistance points where you simply cannot grow unless you've optimized your layout, traffic, services, and so on.The traffic system can be a game unto itself, I found myself spending 45 minutes designing a complex ""spaghetti bowl"" traffic structure in the heart of my city, then watching and fine tuning it for the next hour or two by adding lanes, changing distances, or rerouting traffic to prevent jams. You can even watch the composition of traffic to get hints (lots of trucks means the industrial area is contributing too much traffic, etc.)You'll spend a lot of time looking, and then making small adjustments, but you won't mind thanks to the gorgeous diorama-style graphics.Simcity made it easy to get overzealous, and as your city grew you often found yourself ""putting out fires"" (sometimes literally) to keep it running, the larger the city, the more new wrinkles would show up that you would be constantly addressing. Cities: Skylines takes on a different style, moment-to-moment management of your city is reasonably relaxed, but if you want it to become a powerhouse metropolis, you'll have to master a number of systems and make it as efficient as possible. And then the traffic jams start...I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone looking for a relaxed city builder with enough depth there to chew on if you want it. It's a masterwork of game design and should be experienced by anyone with even a slight interest in city builders, and the Steam Workshop is well-integrated with loads of additional content available.

												Cities: Skylines is everything I wished Cities XL and SimCity4 was.  I can build an enormous city without having to build any satellite  support cities.  :cartwheels:  Add in the Steam Workshop mods and I can customize my gameplay, maps, and buildings to get the exact experience I want.  I was a bit leery of purchasing this as there have been so many let-downs with the city-builders over the last decade.  I'm happy to say Cities: Skylines is the one I've been waiting oh-so-long for.  If you're at all into city-building simulators don't pass this one by!			"

												I've not come to Cities Skylines via Sim City like many reviewers here.I've always found the idea of City Simulators to be a bit dull, but after reading reviews on Steam and spotting a 50% discount, I took a leap of faith and boy was I impressed !! Building roads, housing, water, electricity, school, police, fire, trash, transportation etc. in such a beautiful sandbox is about as much fun as I 've had on a PC in years.  Making your population happy and making money for expansion is a surprisingly satisfying activity. Zoning, districts and council policies are all concepts which are introduced gradually without fuss or complication. The 3D game engine is spectacular, intuitive and gorgeous to look at.I had a two thousand citizen city after just a few hours and spent another couple with the game on 'pause' just admiring my creation.I'm months away from modding the game but already I can see huge replayability and value for money.Congratulations to development team - Cities Skylines is clearly a labour of love.I would recommend this game to everyone, especially town planners. (Sorry guys, I confess I used to think you lot were all wierdos!)Buy it.			"

												*Edited for patch 1.1Unlike the disappointment that was SimCity 2013, Cities: Skylines is a real city simulator/builder. Every single resident in your city has a home, a job, an education (if you build schools that is), and everyone has somewhere they need to go. You can watch them leave their home, take the subway to the bus stop to take the bus to the mall, and then do the same in reverse to go back home. As someone who fell in love with SimCity when the original came out as shareware in 1989 and have played every Will Wright game since (as well as some of the none-Will Wright followups), I highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who likes city builders. This game is what we wanted from a new SimCity game, without all the bad decisions EA made.The game isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close. It makes building truly massive cities fun and possible, and with the right hardware the cities look pretty good too with an incredible attention to detail. Building a succesful (profitable) city is fairly easy (easier than SC4 that is), but getting past the 50,000 resident mark, while dealing with traffic, water, power, garbage, and sewage is the real challenge. Getting past the 100,000 resident mark requires some creative thinking in the construction of intersections, highways, and bus lines, but it can be done and you can keep expanding your city until you run out of land to purchase.While the game is a true simulation, it has no natural disasters and if you can keep your city from dying to polluted water or choking in traffic jams, then you can continue building until the budget can't cover it anymore.Traffic has been improved greatly since launch and is now much easier to manage. We've gotten tunnels and the ability to build roundabouts and any other kind of road or rail at any level above and below ground, and the game continues to have some of the best mod support of any game ever released.

												They have actually done it. EDIT: BUT... read the end of the review.To be frank, I was skeptical if this wasn't just overhyped in the wake of the SC13 and CXL debacles, but from what I could gather in the 5 hours it has glued me to the screen tonight, Cities Skylines might be the SC4 successor we have been waiting for. The game is easy in the beginning, but not overly so and traffic and garbage can be a challenge even with 8k residents (although not an unfair one). The simulation is responsive and detailed. The interface is confusing at first but you get used to it quickly enough. They reduced SC4's diagram bloat but sadly some useful ones fell victim as well.Soundtrack is nice but rather repetitive, and the modding community will need to figure out if we can make this as pretty and diverse as SC4 was eventually. I didn't like Skylines' art style from the previews, but playing the game it grows on you. The visual fidelity in the lowest zoom levels is lacking, but you have the reassurance that what you are seeing is actually simulated, unlike SC13. You can see individual citizens, but I sort of miss the traffic flow maps from buildings in SC4RH.Variety is enough to keep me going for a couple dozen hours. I'll update this review once Skylines has passed the test of time ;)EDIT: So, I have played for 25 hours now, and thats it for now. Sorry, but the lack of gameplay depth and seeing the same building 10 times next to the others really won't keep me coming back. Yes there is the workshop, but its an unsorted mess and sifting through the thousands of reskinned buildings to find the occasional new one is exhausting. We need some content curators or new gameplay content fast.			"

												Oh dear god. It's like playing Transport Tycoon all over again. I only bought this late yesterday afternoon. 11.3 hours later with boggled eyes and nowhere near enough sleep for a middle aged man.........I gambled on buying this no entirely sure that my PC would even run the game (i5-2310 2.90Ghz, 8Gb RAM, GeForce 560SE) I was suprised to find I was able to run to quite a high detail level. No doubt the bigger a city gets, the more PC power I'd need, but it's trade off I'm more than happy to do. Even at lower detail the game is georgeous.The game is massive and the editor is easy to use. (Oh the water!!!!!) Click on the supplied, in game, Mod to play without running out of cash and you've got a sandbox mode. Pure joy.I recommend the first person view Mod from the Workshop aswell.Score out of ten? I don't know. Poison me with dirty drinking water, take me through traffic chaos to the city hospital and hope I don't end up at the crematorium... ask me then!!!!!!!!Top job, totally recommend, for once the hype was right			"

It has the depth and complexity of the best of the Sim City games mixed with sleek modern graphics.Your City live breathes and evolves constantly through the game, as you grapple to keep it from falling into enviromental and economic disaster.The only disadvantage to this game is the lack of unique disaster events, e.g earthquakes, that the Sim City franchise featured. However the developer has promised to patch them into the game.With strong features, engaging and complex game play as well as Steam Workshop mod support, Cities Skylines in everything that the recent Sim City reboot should have been.

												Easily the best city builder to come around in a long time. It also does alot to bring new wrinkles into the established formula. Being able to name and customize pretty much anything in the game is fantastic. And also having the ability to create separate districts within the city is a great addition. You can even set different policies within each district. Want an area with no smoking? You can do that. Want people to recycle? Click the checkbox.Only thing I'd say that could be considered 'negative' would be that you can't take any loans out until you reach a population of 400+. So if you get a little overzealous when starting out (like I did), you might find yourself in a bind. You can take a Bailout, but then that disables being able to do certain things.Overall I'm really enjoying the game, and I can see this being a top played for me for awhile.			"

												You can tell when a game is created by passionate artists and developers. This could be the SimCity 4 successor that we have been waiting all these years for. Everything that SC2k13 did wrong, Colossal Order tried to make right. City sizes are 9x bigger, and easily modded to 25x bigger than SC2k13. They didn't only make things better, they also introduced many new features such as districts, specialized industrial zones and dynamic water movement. Modding support is also a huge feature that is offered. The Steam Workshop has over 1000 mods, models and maps already online less than 24 hours after the release. There are a handful of requests for features that didn't make it to release, but the devs promised that they would continue working on this game to include as many new features as possible. (Such as road & highway tunnels, disasters and day/night cycles).This is only the first day of the launch, and the game is already extremely stable, and looks beautiful.I look forward to seeing what the devs and the mod community comes up with in the future!This game was created by a small indie development team and look at what they produced. I highly recommend this game to anyone who felt disappointed with SimCity and wants to play a genuine city simulator that has the fun of previous versions, but the new features that modern gamers want to play.

												A real return to city building greatness. I approached Cites:Skylines with a small amount of trepidation, I have already been burnt by the disappointment that was the most recent Sim City. However Cities:Skylines is no Sim City clone. Rather it takes a lot of the best elements of the Sim City franchise, and puts them into a very a slick, playable and user friendly package.  The game is friendly to a new user, introducing new elements and features over time in a gated sense, but don't be mistaken it isn't impossible to fail, on my very first city I managed to bankrupt myself before I had proper infrastructure or even a few buildings because of my complex and excessively ambitious waste management and water system. From the get go there is a lot to do providing an engaging experience, but not so much as to overwhelm. There is enough detail and content to introduce the newer player gradually whilst  simultaneously allowing players with more experience new ways to improve and experiment. You start off small, with a few roads and your very most basic amenities and infrastructure for water and electricity. You attract a few hundred people, build a school, and start expanding your commercial center. Before you know it you are the mayor of a town of 50,000, rebuilding motorways, managing 6 lane roundabouts and trying to build a spaghetti roller-coaster of a highway junction to alleviate excessive congestion as traffic pours into your Metropolis to visit your colossal skyscrapers. It is a very satisfying experience, through your own strategy and planning you have turned a small dull field with a few small houses into a buzzing, noisy city with a real character of your own choosing. Despite how enjoyable the game has been so far in the short term, my most considerable worry going into the future is the potential lack of replay value. You build your infrastructure , you grow your city, you put amenities and services. The play pattern every game is pretty much identical, and there are very few randomly generated elements to change this. Combined with the lack of multiplayer capability really begs the question what will keep players coming back for more. However this is certainly somewhat alleviated by the games innate modability and interaction with the steam workshop, which seems to add a lot of capability and even quality of life fixes to the game. This game has such a low price-tag that you could easily get your value for money in a few play throughs, and even if  you do get burnt out there is not much to lose. The game also has all of the appropriate attributes to evolve and grow with the release of DLC and steam workshop content, making it a really appealing prospect to come back to when you feel like a spending your time building a city.The game is fairly slow tempo by design, this shouldn't be a surprise it's being a  city builder not Call of Duty. If slower simulation games (Civilization, city management games, Rome Total War etc) are not to you preference then I can't really suggest this will do much to change that. It's a great game for relaxing, and thinking, but its not high tempo competitive nor challenging game. Though that does not mean it isn't engaging,  there is always something to do and things ever changing as you grow your city, it always keeps the player considering of ways to improve/diversify or grow the city.The lack of multiplayer is a missed opportunity. Had the game had similar multiplayer functionality to the most recent Sim City, such as if there was some way of building concurrent cities that would evolve and change depending on a friend''s decisions in real time would have made for an even more complete experience. At the very least better functionality in terms of sharing cities and visiting cities created by friends would add a lot discussion and interaction, but  I imagine these  features are possibilities for the future, the game itself is a great platform which could be easily extended to a mutliplayer experience which I feel would round off the experience and add significant longevity.  Conclusion4/5. A very good city building simulation that is very accessible, with a user friendly and functional UI and variable gameplay pacing. The game is simultaneously relaxing yet intriguing, and ultimately leaves the player feel very satisfied. The steam workshop, and other modability means the game may continue to grow, but the static gameplay pattern with very little variability or random events and no current multiplayer make the longevity questionable.

												I feel young again! I feel like not going to work, I feel like not going to sleep. I feel like playing - playing non stop. There are very few games that give that feeling nowadays (although thankfuly once in a while such game pops out every now and then) and Cities: Skylines is certainly one of them.If you even remotely like building stuff - don't hesitate. It's a real no-brainer here!			"

												An amazing City Building game that takes personalization to another level! There's a lot of content, enough to have you playing for hours and hours. Most people viewing or playing this game have been introduced to SimCity so I'll break it down. There is more content in this game than in SimCity and it's also HALF the price that was at launch. The Map Sizes, with the current mod, can be up to 25 times the map size in SimCity, most computers cannot handle that though so it's a do at your own risk which is fine. The graphics are great and it runs flawlessly on my i7 4790k. The content for this game has unlimited potential in the future. Basically if you like City Builders and Simulators than this is the game for you, it's what SimCity and Cities XXL should have been, hands down (: Also there really isn't any bugs, at least none that I've experienced so far.

												I love how the team of this game is so attentive to feedbacks... so different from EA. I still remind of how angry I used to get everytime we would simply ask for EA not to destroy core game features of SimCity in its 2013s version and they would just ignore the comments on their devs blog... One week after the game is launched and if you go to the Steam Workshop, the team that developed this game is already commenting on the mods they think would bring interesting stuff that should become core in the next update... thats how bad youre gona love this game. By the way, it is a 5 star game, fair price, very open to modding and very close to simcity in its best years, but much more improved. If you are a SimCity player already, the game experience should feel familiar, so not very difficult to start. Buy it.			"

												As city builders go, it's great. As for an entire region; it has it's limits.Road ""snap"" issues really frustrate me especially when it comes to city building, beauty and symmetry is key. Wonky road connections are not.The amount of liesure activities are poor and filling space basically amounts to plopping trees. Some land fillers etc much like a Cities XL mods would be welcome.A much better highway/road system is required. Creating life-like ideas with roads turns out to be terrible, aesthetically.  Negatives:- Road Snap.- Single lane sliproads.- Cars not using inside lane on roundabouts.- Inability to set road/lane priority etc.- Leisure activites limited.- Lack of upgrades for services etc.- Tunnels.- No Terraforming except entire map creation, nothing while playing.- Multiplayer?- Overlays are limited.- Lack of real information.Positives:- Turn it on, build a city.- Easy difficulty.- Trains/Metro/Buses.- Modding tools.- Steam Works. Thousands of prefab intersections within first day and mods.- Cost.- District creation.- Simple at it's core.Would restructure districts again.			"

												I've really looked forward to this game. Feel like I can give an early impressions review. Pros: - Performance is very good, smooth, the camera never stutters. Have felt no slow-ups. - Easy to pick up the nuances of the game.- Pretty. - Mods. And this will save the game (see cons)Cons:- I feel like there isn't much variety in types of buildings. The mods however should over time offer a massive amount of content and I feel like it's only a matter of that this comment becomes irrelevant. - Small gripe, but why can't the different lines be different colours? I find it really confusing and quite finicky to create a bus line. - Another small gripe, but the two different blues used for Offices and Light Commercial are too similar, I often click the wrong one. - Not very...exciting? It's fun to play, its light hearted, its nice to kill a bit of time but after an hour or two I found myself logging out. Some sort of immersion is missing. There isn't that much do apart from expand your city, there's no trade (not that I have yet seen) for example. Maybe having some ""ghost AI"" cities far on the horizon that you can't visit but see could be connecting to your city and then opening possibilities of trade would be really awesome and give more emphasis on feeling that you're part of a connected world. At the moment it just feels very isolated.-----------------------------------------------Overall, it's worth the money and fun to play even it's a bit shallower than I had hoped.			"

												An incredible game!If your a fan of building sims this is the one for you. Simcity used to be the daddy back in the day but has slowly gone down hill over the years and became terrible! Games like City XL tried to pick up where Sim city left off but failed in my opinion. Then this little gem appeared. Pretty much blows away the competition. Easy to use, highly detailed down to the fact you can watch a person leave their home and go to work. The company has endorsed modding so the amount of extra content is mind blowing. From basic stuctures to being about to get into a copter and fly around your city. One of the best games of the year so far!10/10 A MUST BUY!			"

												SimCity was one of the very first games I was ever really hooked on.  I vividly remember building cities in black-and-white on my dad's office Macintosh.  Since then I've jumped on pretty much any game that claims to be city-builder-ish.  And not since SimCity 4, over a decade ago, have I had this much fun building a city from scratch.The scale of the space you can build in is great.  Starting with 2km x 2km and eventually expanding out to 9km^2, you can build truly massive cities. What makes that scale even better is you can really divide up your metropolis in a number of ways.  From districts that can have individualized govt policies (legal pot, smoke detector ditribution), to localized city services that aren't connected to the larger grid.  The game gives you a ton of room to experiment.The one big challenge though you'll face is transportation.  Building an effecient city grid of roads, public transit, trains & subways that doesn't have terrible choke points is difficult.  Use of elevated bypasses, rail corridors etc are difficult to plan as you don't get access to them until an hour or more into a game, so you may find yourself abandoning your initial city area to build up things ""properly"" in a newly opened plot of land, then going back and bulldozing your original downtown to start it over again.Beyond the traffic challenge, it can at times be difficult to know why your city isn't growing.  Sometimes demand drops to 0 for no apparant reason, then 5 minutes later skyrockets again.  There's obviously something going on that's pushing down demand, but as a player it's hard to figure out some times.  A few patches to improve UI and reporting will no doubt solve this issue.In the end, the traffic planning and the simulation feedback issues are pretty minor in the face of what's probably the most fun city sim since the glory days of Maxis.  And at what I'd consider a ""budget"" price point, if you're a fan of the genre, this is a must-buy game.			"

												Do you want to build and manage a glorious city? The latest SimCity game didn't give you what you wanted?Look no further, Cities: Skylines is there to sate your needs.- Plenty of ways to build and manage your city- Good variety of city customization options- Compelling and refreshing gameplay- ""Easy to learn, hard to master""- Extensive modding support and toolsThis game hasn't been out for a long time at the time of this review but already I dare say this is the best citybuilding game in years. In Cities: Skylines you are responsible to build and manage a city (obviously) and you are given the tools, many tools, to help you in your adventure.Created by the team behind the Cities in Motion games, this game is made by people knowing the genre and this isn't hard to notice. Cities: Skylines features a solid range of tools to make the city you desire, in my opinion far outmatching other games in the genre such as SimCity 5/2013 (given this title was quite horrible to begin with).You build, manage and expand an ever demanding city, capable of surviving on its own. In Cities: Skylines, you are given plenty of options and ways to customize your own city to your heart's desire. With the ability to create districts you can name certain regions of the city as you please and furthermore, even add policies to that specific district or to the entire city. For example, you can ban heavy traffic passing through a peaceful suburban community, making your citizens happier or assign specified industrial areas to promote farming, improving your income from that district.The ability to customize the city goes in depth, if you want you can even rename your city's inhabitants, houses or even cars, if you're into that.As for the core citybuilding itself, it offers solid mechanics and an appealing visual style that should interest every gamer liking the citybuilding genre. Cities: Skylines offers a reasonably sized area to begin with, which seems to be larger than certain other games in the same genre, but when it comes to size this isn't the most impressive: As your city grows, you become able to buy new zones adjecent to your current area, expanding the city. In total, you can create a city nine times the size of the starting map.Not only the size of the map is a big feat of the fame, its mechanics regarding transportation, water and electricity supplies, education, law enforcement and others is well laid out and the city will change for better or worse depending on your urban planning skills. If you want, you can even build a dam to supply your city with the power it needs to flourish. (Though beware, you don't want to have your city upstream of where the dam will be, the reason why should be obvious.)The last thing I'll discuss is one of the best additions to the game, in my honest opinion at least, is the modding support.Cities: Skylines offers great in-game tools to customize the base game to your own desires. With the in-game tools you can not only design your own maps but you can easily design your own buildings, parks or road areas using either existing in-game props or by converting images into the game. If you can't be bothered making your own assets or ""mods"", feel free to browse the Steam Workshop, barely two weeks after launch and this game already features a massive amount of player-made content including several cool and beautiful assets as well as entirely custom made maps (In this case I refer to the GTA: V map 'mod', which displays the game's map remarkably accurate.)All in all, there is nothing that I would critize about this game, it's a solid citybuilder with extensive customization tools, Cities: Skylines is my personal favourite citybuilding game of the last decade.

The latest SimCity game didn't give you what you wanted?Look no further, Cities: Skylines is there to sate your needs.- Plenty of ways to build and manage your city- Good variety of city customization options- Compelling and refreshing gameplay- ""Easy to learn, hard to master""- Extensive modding support and toolsThis game hasn't been out for a long time at the time of this review but already I dare say this is the best citybuilding game in years. In Cities: Skylines you are responsible to build and manage a city (obviously) and you are given the tools, many tools, to help you in your adventure.Created by the team behind the Cities in Motion games, this game is made by people knowing the genre and this isn't hard to notice. Cities: Skylines features a solid range of tools to make the city you desire, in my opinion far outmatching other games in the genre such as SimCity 5/2013 (given this title was quite horrible to begin with).You build, manage and expand an ever demanding city, capable of surviving on its own. In Cities: Skylines, you are given plenty of options and ways to customize your own city to your heart's desire. With the ability to create districts you can name certain regions of the city as you please and furthermore, even add policies to that specific district or to the entire city. For example, you can ban heavy traffic passing through a peaceful suburban community, making your citizens happier or assign specified industrial areas to promote farming, improving your income from that district.The ability to customize the city goes in depth, if you want you can even rename your city's inhabitants, houses or even cars, if you're into that.As for the core citybuilding itself, it offers solid mechanics and an appealing visual style that should interest every gamer liking the citybuilding genre. Cities: Skylines offers a reasonably sized area to begin with, which seems to be larger than certain other games in the same genre, but when it comes to size this isn't the most impressive: As your city grows, you become able to buy new zones adjecent to your current area, expanding the city. In total, you can create a city nine times the size of the starting map.Not only the size of the map is a big feat of the fame, its mechanics regarding transportation, water and electricity supplies, education, law enforcement and others is well laid out and the city will change for better or worse depending on your urban planning skills. If you want, you can even build a dam to supply your city with the power it needs to flourish. (Though beware, you don't want to have your city upstream of where the dam will be, the reason why should be obvious.)The last thing I'll discuss is one of the best additions to the game, in my honest opinion at least, is the modding support.Cities: Skylines offers great in-game tools to customize the base game to your own desires. With the in-game tools you can not only design your own maps but you can easily design your own buildings, parks or road areas using either existing in-game props or by converting images into the game. If you can't be bothered making your own assets or ""mods"", feel free to browse the Steam Workshop, barely two weeks after launch and this game already features a massive amount of player-made content including several cool and beautiful assets as well as entirely custom made maps (In this case I refer to the GTA: V map 'mod', which displays the game's map remarkably accurate.)All in all, there is nothing that I would critize about this game, it's a solid citybuilder with extensive customization tools, Cities: Skylines is my personal favourite citybuilding game of the last decade.

												This is what Simcity 2013 should have been. It is the only game since simcity 4 in 2003 to achieve this excellent of a complete city managing system, and is equally as supported by some of the best mods on steam. I struggle to think of enough superlatives to describe this game.(warning, it is a very cpu heavy game, not on the gpu. It also eats up ram, a large city would easily use 12gb on its own. If you're sitting on 8gb or less, i would strongly recommend upgrading to 16gb as you will see significant frame increases.)Furthermore, For what feels like the $100 game simcity was going to be, this thing's only $30!! Simcity 2013 was the first and last preorder i ever made, and i feel now that I spent the $30 on simcity, and the $100 on Cities Skylines. Because that is what those two games are worth.You would be a fool not to buy it. "

 INTRO	It's a city builder game, with civil engineering aspect and some creativity as game element.Recommended for those who loves playing Sim City. PROS	 Decent graphic engine for a 2015 game (It's playable on my crappy laptop that runs on GT 720m) Overlay visualization is well designed (Switching between foreground - Underground not confusing me) Building are actually can be modified Milestone will makes you to play more and more as the city growing Lay your city plot carefully, it's the key to enjoy the game You can uprise and downrise the road-line, thus creating tunnel or bridge is easy Roads are actually can be set as single lane (One way) too Mods are available, but it will disable your steam achievement progress City region can be expanded once your city is big enough CONS	 Map variant too few, lucky the community made more than we need Twitter style as quick-tip, sometime the text are skipped due to its border is too small Terraforming is hard to master, for me. At least. Traffic codes are weird, my ambulances and firefighter trucks are heading way farther than it actually can be done. Despite the traffic is less crowded than it currently use as main route. Resulting casualties and burned down building OVERALL RATING : 8/10 "

												Recommended purchase.The idea behind other city simulations finally done better in every aspect. Additionally deep, but not overwhelming, and complex, but not complicated, with a well designed and easy to use and accessible UI. Simply endless fun.If you are looking for city simulators, you can look at all the others - you found the best one here with Cities: Skylines, no doubt and by far.Now, a year after release, there is even a whole scene of YouTubers, who use the unlimited money mod of this game and spend all their time mainly with the design features of the in-game city editor and who then use the city simulation component of the game only to bring life to the backdrop of their creations - much like building a model railroad, only in your computer and way cooler.If you want to just casually play a few hours and create a small town, or if you intend to go deeper into the concepts, that depends practically only on you, on what you want to do with the game. Both seems to be possible with the game, for one part probably because of the game's accessibility.I've bought it shortly after release, about a year ago, and unfortunately didn't play with it since (only 20hrs seeing if it works), until recently.Now, after a three week vacation, one year and two DLC packs later, I can see bazillions of workshop items to enhance the game, tutorials of varying depth and orientation on video platforms and in written form on Steam/reddit/imgur, that can help mastering the challenges of the game with less experimenting and more method and intent from your side. A lot of people have shared their experiences online, go look..During these past three weeks I've spent about 40 more hours with Cities: Skylines, additionally about 10 hours of reading up on actual urban planning science and watching a number of videos from more experienced gamers. Yes, Cities: Skylines is a game, and because of that it is of course a simplified version of reality. The game's challenges are still very much oriented in the real world challenges of urban planning and you can actually verify your own ideas on how to solve any of these situations of growth and tackle the multicausal nature of your city situation.Also, probably because the game's background simulation is much more complex under the hood than it may seem on the surface, every city you may create is an individual bunch of problems and you'll never find any magic bullet solution for any of your problems anywhere. It's amazing to see how playing the game more systematically can enhance your world view.There's usually far more than one way to do things in the game, the creators seem to have encouraged this by their game design and also seem to have encouraged the community to be creative and enhance the game with mods. Under the hood of the game everything looks fairly modern, my fast i7 4GHz gaming rig is actually doing some work here and I haven't even reached the 2^16 simulation agent limit, yet.Anyway, because of its fine surface polish, low price, peaceful and educationally valuable content, this game can be recommended to anyone anyway. It's a fine game no questions asked, no matter for who or how you look at it. It think there can be not much substantial doubt in this. That's why I thought I'd owe this game at least a review, as it is a masterpiece in every aspect I can think of. And I think it was not just one head who created this game, it feels like many people put their best together successfully to create this game.It's especially recommended for people, who look for more than just a timesink and it can probably easily be like that. I think, I'm learning a lot for my life, like multitasking, making better decisions, being more disciplined - just by playing this game. A perfect gift.There's just one other game I know of that I could easily spend hundreds of hours with, and already did. Cities: Skylines is another one in this rare kind.I'm really amazed by what Colossal Order created here and I'm thankful for their efforts. It delivers on pretty much everything I've been waiting for since 1989 and more. Thank you!			"

The game also supports modding right off the bat and there's already tons of stuff up day 1, you can even download highway cloverleafs and such if you suck at them like I do. 9/10.			"

												If you've played sim city, then you would've had some trouble with traffic. If you managed to get good traffic management in Sim City, then you'd be a master at traffic management in this game because the traffic design is so much better, no stupid AI, and you can have more complex road systems eg one way roads, actual overpasses, etc.			"

Why not allow tree drops like painting districts???  It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I have to click per tree. I WANT THIS AREA coated in trees...why can't i spend a 1/2 mill  to do it? If it's an issue due to mapping zones that's crazy because Zones are on a predefined grid, while Trees are point to point. so if i have the ""paint the district"" circle in an area, I should be able to fill that area with trees and click/hold and paint it around. Why is this - after many updates and expansion - still a thing? PLEASE LET ME PAINT TREES!			"

												This game is just fantastic in every aspect. You can just go ahead and buy it or you can read my experience with Cities: Skylines first if that is your fancy.Game is all around pretty great, satisfactory, balanced and it has a relaxed atmosphere. In this game there is no arsonists or disproportionate crime rate (I am looking at you SimCity!), everything is balanced maybe aside from everyone starting to die at the same time. You can just focus on building a very well designed city while keeping an eye on what your citizens need. Game itself is also constantly updated for balance or various fixes, and they release expansions in a true Paradox fashion by not making you feel like you have to buy it to access every feature on that DLC as they give you most substantial game mechanic updates for free with a patch, but of course for other optional features on that DLC, you are going to need to buy it. Now I will list some aspects of the game that I am enjoying the most;-Your space limitation basically depends on your hardware. For example, game allows you to have 9 tiles which are 2 square kilometers each and even a single tile is pretty big but if you so desire you can go beyond 9 tiles by using a mod to have all 25 tiles , however, if you do not own a powerful machine you will probably not be able to handle all 25 tiles that are filled with people and things.-Traffic. It is plain fun and pretty satisfactory to solve or at least alleviate traffic jams. I've been more focused on solving these problems than to collect garbage, dead people etc. Mainly because of that feeling of satisfaction after solving a traffic jam and seeing that intersection or interchange flowing... it fills me with pure joy just watching them. As I am writing this review I also am watching an interchange that has been flowing thanks to my awesome mayoring skills.-Mods and modding community. Since Colossal Order is not a huge company, naturally they could not fit every little detail they may have wanted to put in the game because they had to focus on more core elements of the game and this is where our lovely modding community comes in. You want limitless money? Sure. What about everything unlocked from the start? You got it! There are also hundreds of assets, maps and game mechanics in the Workshop. Basically, if you want something in the game that had not been put in by the devs themselves it probably exists in the Workshop or you can just make it yourself since asset editor is pretty easy to use as long as you are not planning to make something from ground up, because then you'd need some experience with that kind of stuff.-Colossal Order had said they will be going forward with Paradox model in terms of dlc. So basically, when they are going to put out a DLC, they will give some key features of that DLC for free like Paradox has been doing for their games (CK2, EU4). This is a huge plus in my book. And it also means that they are going to support this game for a very long time and they will not just release a new game every few years.-Paradox Interactive. These guys are the publisher of the game and unlike EA or Ubishit, they are not going suck us dry. I've been enjoying their games for almost a decade now and they have never disappointed me.-Public transport. You can set up your very own subway, bus and regular train stops that are actually helping with the traffic instead of clogging it (I'm looking at you SimCity!). You can set up as many routes as you'd like if you are into that kind of stuff. -Policies and districts. You can set districts. This allows you to create a specialized industry and/or to implement some interesting policies like only high tech buildings, heavy traffic ban, raise taxes for only that specific distirct etc... You can implement policies for the whole region too.- You can flood your city with poop water and watch those miserable scumbags suffer. I sometimes do that to a region just for fun. If I hear someone complaining about garbage not being collected I just plop a landfill on top of that whiny wimp's house. It fills me with joy, try it out.Warnings: If you like the genre I can assure you that you are going to be addicted to this game so beware. It can bring out the dictator in you. Your mind will see things differently when you are outside. For example; yestarday I took the bus for going back home and there was a serious traffic jam. I got up from my seat and started to analyse the road network around me to figure out what the problem is and how to solve it. I am a translator but after having played this game I'm thinking of picking up civil engineering it seems fun however in real life you can't just bulldoze something that is in your way which is unfortunate.To sum up, It is a fantastic game all around. If you like the genre and/or disappointed by latest SimCity and Cities XXL, I recommend picking this game up you'll love it. Price tag is also great. Considering they sold ShitCity for 60 dollars... I am pretty sure that I'm forgetting couple of things but alas, I have to go back and bulldoze houses of some whiny asshats. Anyways, thanks if you took the time to read my rather lenghty review. Also, Colossal Order, if you are reading this, THANK YOU! I give this game 1 GabeN (PRAISE HIM!) BUY THIS GAME IN THE NAME OF OUR HOLY SAVIOUR LORD GabeN!			"

												Fantastic game, which was cheaper than SimCity 4.Each person, vehicle seems to be its own entity, but that is great for simulation.You need a good computer for this, it currently takes two cores and my graphics card seems to be running near the max speed. If you put the game into the fastest simulation speed, it takes up four cores. So, that has the hall mark of a well planned multicore support.The only downside I have is that is has the same commercial/offices to residential density problems that SimCIty 4 had. A few people living in apartments, but not enough jobs in buildings of similar size. The residential buildings have 70 people. All these big office buildings, including level 3 have less than 30 workers in them. I'm not sure that 1-2 person per floor (at the taller end) makes sense. This can be fixed with the multitude of mods though and there's enough to satisfy nearly everyone's wishes.Overall, an enjoyable game. Highly recommended.			"

												Visual style might not be appealing to everyone (it seemed quickly-put-together at first), but UI itself is consistent and it's pretty easy to get around all the game's aspects which is a very important aspect for this genre.It is pretty easy to learn (only took me like 5 restarts from scratch lol) and has great creative potential. You will be able to manage transport, provide education and jobs, terraform your peace of land (or buy a new one, pretty cheap too) and build canals and many other things while the little bird at the top of the screen shows you how pleased your citizens are and if there are problems.The game also appears to support mods extensively which is bound to please us PCMasterricers.Pick it up along with 'After Dark' DLC (taxis and some other pretty-important stuff) and you will easily waste dozens of hours in this game without flinching if you are the slightest bit into that sort of thing.chirper/10			"

												This game is just fantastic in every aspect. You can just go ahead and buy it or you can read my experience with Cities: Skylines first if that is your fancy.Game is all around pretty great, satisfactory, balanced and it has a relaxed atmosphere. In this game there is no arsonists or disproportionate crime rate (I am looking at you SimCity!), everything is balanced maybe aside from everyone starting to die at the same time. You can just focus on building a very well designed city while keeping an eye on what your citizens need. Game itself is also constantly updated for balance or various fixes, and they release expansions in a true Paradox fashion by not making you feel like you have to buy it to access every feature on that DLC as they give you most substantial game mechanic updates for free with a patch, but of course for other optional features on that DLC, you are going to need to buy it. Now I will list some aspects of the game that I am enjoying the most;-Your space limitation basically depends on your hardware. For example, game allows you to have 9 tiles which are 2 square kilometers each and even a single tile is pretty big but if you so desire you can go beyond 9 tiles by using a mod to have all 25 tiles , however, if you do not own a powerful machine you will probably not be able to handle all 25 tiles that are filled with people and things.-Traffic. It is plain fun and pretty satisfactory to solve or at least alleviate traffic jams. I've been more focused on solving these problems than to collect garbage, dead people etc. Mainly because of that feeling of satisfaction after solving a traffic jam and seeing that intersection or interchange flowing... it fills me with pure joy just watching them. As I am writing this review I also am watching an interchange that has been flowing thanks to my awesome mayoring skills.-Mods and modding community. Since Colossal Order is not a huge company, naturally they could not fit every little detail they may have wanted to put in the game because they had to focus on more core elements of the game and this is where our lovely modding community comes in. You want limitless money? Sure. What about everything unlocked from the start? You got it! There are also hundreds of assets, maps and game mechanics in the Workshop. Basically, if you want something in the game that had not been put in by the devs themselves it probably exists in the Workshop or you can just make it yourself since asset editor is pretty easy to use as long as you are not planning to make something from ground up, because then you'd need some experience with that kind of stuff.-Colossal Order had said they will be going forward with Paradox model in terms of dlc. So basically, when they are going to put out a DLC, they will give some key features of that DLC for free like Paradox has been doing for their games (CK2, EU4). This is a huge plus in my book. And it also means that they are going to support this game for a very long time and they will not just release a new game every few years.-Paradox Interactive. These guys are the publisher of the game and unlike EA or Ubishit, they are not going suck us dry. I've been enjoying their games for almost a decade now and they have never disappointed me.-Public transport. You can set up your very own subway, bus and regular train stops that are actually helping with the traffic instead of clogging it (I'm looking at you SimCity!). You can set up as many routes as you'd like if you are into that kind of stuff. -Policies and districts. You can set districts. This allows you to create a specialized industry and/or to implement some interesting policies like only high tech buildings, heavy traffic ban, raise taxes for only that specific distirct etc... You can implement policies for the whole region too.- You can flood your city with poop water and watch those miserable scumbags suffer. I sometimes do that to a region just for fun. If I hear someone complaining about garbage not being collected I just plop a landfill on top of that whiny wimp's house. It fills me with joy, try it out.Warnings: If you like the genre I can assure you that you are going to be addicted to this game so beware. It can bring out the dictator in you. Your mind will see things differently when you are outside. For example; yestarday I took the bus for going back home and there was a serious traffic jam. I got up from my seat and started to analyse the road network around me to figure out what the problem is and how to solve it. I am a translator but after having played this game I'm thinking of picking up civil engineering it seems fun however in real life you can't just bulldoze something that is in your way which is unfortunate.To sum up, It is a fantastic game all around. If you like the genre and/or disappointed by latest SimCity and Cities XXL, I recommend picking this game up you'll love it. Price tag is also great. Considering they sold ShitCity for 60 dollars... I am pretty sure that I'm forgetting couple of things but alas, I have to go back and bulldoze houses of some whiny asshats. Anyways, thanks if you took the time to read my rather lenghty review. Also, Colossal Order, if you are reading this, THANK YOU! I give this game 1 GabeN (PRAISE HIM!) BUY THIS GAME IN THE NAME OF OUR HOLY SAVIOUR LORD GabeN!			"

												Fantastic game, which was cheaper than SimCity 4.Each person, vehicle seems to be its own entity, but that is great for simulation.You need a good computer for this, it currently takes two cores and my graphics card seems to be running near the max speed. If you put the game into the fastest simulation speed, it takes up four cores. So, that has the hall mark of a well planned multicore support.The only downside I have is that is has the same commercial/offices to residential density problems that SimCIty 4 had. A few people living in apartments, but not enough jobs in buildings of similar size. The residential buildings have 70 people. All these big office buildings, including level 3 have less than 30 workers in them. I'm not sure that 1-2 person per floor (at the taller end) makes sense. This can be fixed with the multitude of mods though and there's enough to satisfy nearly everyone's wishes.Overall, an enjoyable game. Highly recommended.			"

												This here is hands down the best city simulator on the market right now.Cities: Skylines takes the SimCity formula, builds upon it and then expands it even more, based upon Colossal Order's (the gamedevs) previous game development experience. If SimCity 2013 was too small for you and your people not having a permanent workplace and a home annoyed you immensely, then Cities: Skylines is what you need.Of course, some things that many people enjoyed in SimCity 2013, like modular buildings, are not present in this one, but this is only true for the out-of-the-box game. The wonderful thing about this game is that you have an enormously creative community that publishes a huge amount of mods that range from simple ""quality of life"" fixes to new game mechanics and total revamps. The game provides easy-to-use mod tools that allow you to stop relying on someone to make this thing you always wanted for you and try to create it yourself.All in all, this is is a great game that motivates you to learn new things (like real-world city and road design) and rewards you with stunning views of the masterpiece that you have built - only to encourage you to start a new city that would be even better and creative than the previous one.I have played this game for more than 100 hours and I definitely look forward to playing it more when the new Natural Disasters DLC comes out.

												3/26/15: Fixed Spelling ErrorsCities: Skylines takes the faults in Sim City (2013), fixes them, adds its own style and begins our path to a long and fruitful franchise. It's the spiritual successor of Sim City (RIP Maxis). As the population of your city grows, the game unlocks buildings, monuments, new sources of power and city service buildings to help you craft your city. The best aspect of Skylines, took no more than a few days to take off- the modding community *slow clap*- you guys will continue to drive longevity and replay value by adding new content, imported buildings from past Sim City games, and mods to enhance our experience. Great work so far. Not to take anything away from Colossal Order. These guys fixed a lot of the bugs found in the first weekend in just 4 days. (keep in mind this is a team of 13!) This is the ""Sim City"" we've been waiting for. Could not be more happy.			"

												All the text below is only my opinion, and not everybody will agree.One of the best sity simulator of last years.First about main features:Pluses:+ Big territory. You are starting with 2x2 km piece of land, but reaching some points with number of citizens, you can buy aditional pieces. In the end you can control 6x6 km.+ Easy zone structure. Build road - get place for buildings, 4 squeres in both sides. Buildings can be from 1x1 to 4x4, not so much, but game is mod-opened, so lets wait a bit. 6 types of zone for living, working and shopping.+ Large variety of city services - polices, clinics, schools and so on in differnt ways.+ Many ways to get resources for production- import from other cities using port, railway or highway, or just produce by yourself.+ Amazing traffic sim - all road can easily stuck becouse one truck unloading goods to factory.+ Use dams to change level of water.+ Upgrade of buildings connected with many parameters.+ Create our own stuff using in-game tools.+ Good public transport realisation - you need to plan everything in your lines to decrease amount of cars on road.+ Citizens  have own homes, cars and works, not just a picture on a screen.+ Draw districts with own policy.+ Chirpers - citizens will say you true!Minuses:- No terraforming.- Not so big variety of buildings.- Productions chains existm but its no so clear how it works.- After all hours I played, I dont know what profit turism gives to you. Very weak. =(- No day/night cycle.- No random events.- Annoying chirper- citizens will spam you!and its only a small part of pluses and minuses, but main of them, in my mind.And the game is still on of the best - developers planned all existing stuff wery good. But some important thing doesnt exist - its imposimble to create a city with own spirit, like it was possible in Tropico. But as I already told, game is opened for modding, and I heard that developers will not stop supporting project - they will add more content with patches and mods. If you fan of city simulators and some calm strategies, or just wanna to relax - its a good choice.So, I gonna mark in like 8/10 now, and for sure it gona be 9/10 very soon. Have a nice play!			"

Cities: Skylines ReviewIntroductionCities: Skylines is an utterly fantastic game. Paradox to this day has still never failed to deliver a great game. C:S as I will be calling it in this review is by far the greatest city-builder in it's genre. The realism of the game's details is striking and the way you handle your city's economics is not hard at all. Some people (like myself) will compare this to SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow, and at this point it's safe to assume the C:S has blown it out of the water. I'll put it here in bold: C:S is the better buy over SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow. The last EA game that I consider any good at all, was SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition. I've never throughoughly enjoyed a game that was produced by EA after that.Now C:S; yes, there are DLC's. Yes, they are paid for; but here's the beef on that. The base game is so good that the DLC's are out there to futher customize your city. And not cosmetically (essentially), I'm talking like, take for instance Match Day (which is the only free one at this point), it adds a Soccer stadium to the game. Yes it costs alot, yes it looks cool, and yes it actually does something. Your city must be able to handle the traffic flow of people coming in to see games in the stadium. The game events will cause massive influxes of money, but you have to be able to handle it. Point is, the DLC's in this game are useful (except maybe Snowfall, which has a heck a'lot of snow).General GameplayThe eccentricity of C:S compared to other games is incredible. Here I will discuss how and why it is. C:S offers many, many game mechanics that were never seen in previous city builders. One blatent example is the Steam Workshop. C:S has the ability for the community to create new content for the game and upload it so that others can incorporate it into their cities as well. Yes, SimCity 4 had assets (and dependencies, ahhhhhhhh dependencies), but you had to go through all the generic troubles of installing through directories and have the right dependencies (AHHHH). In C:S you check a box. Boom.C:S in-game mechanics include real-time water. I love this feature. I think it's one of the best mechnics in the game. SimCity 4 has water, but it doesnt...really....move. C:S does, and it moves! If you build a dam for hydroelectric energy, you better make sure that it was placed properly because (coming from personal experience) if you don't, and the water level behind the dam surges up and over the river banks and into your city and suddenly you lose half the populous of your city and then there's like no money, and a crap city, then oh well, you done did bad. That is what makes C:S so good. Your decisions make a direct impact on your society (not to say that you can direclty place this kind of house on this kind of zone (and correction, that is possible through assets in the Steam Workshop)).I don't think it's possible to right a review on this type of game without saying that there is quite a bit of a learning curve. C:S has a pretty big learning curve. Each city starts out with 2 highway connections. 1 incoming, and 1 outgoing. The way to plan this first part of your city will be your money maker. If you plan it badly, then your traffic will cause you some headache when you go to fix it and the placement of certain buildings like medical facilites and schools will make you lose money when you discover that they were placed in an area that won't let you upgrade a road, or something of that nature.Keeping on with the learning curve and moving into traffic. Traffic is another animal in this game. Yes, you have to worry about the flow of traffic in your city, becuase if your incoming traffic is being clogged up with trucks and what not becuase they are making this crazy turn in an intersection, it's safe to assume that you can change that into something more useful. The flow of traffic in your city needs to be carefully managed. Traffic is money. Outgoing goods from your industry earns your city money. So does incoming goods to commercial zones. You need to have an efficient route through your city if just passing through and so forth. C:S has spent a good amount of time developing this system and I have to admit, I'm still a little flumouxed on getting certain parts of my city to flow like they should.Last section in mechanics I want to talk about. Land Value. Ever since release, Paradox has added some amazing and cool looking things into the game. Canals for instance (yes, there are canals, and quays (keys), and other environmental tools) will provide a serious land value bonus to an area. The more desireable the city, the more people come, and the more people come, the more money you make. It's a very pleasing sight to see all that green in an area after you plop down a canal and the water is in there (not overflowing into your city as I have had before). The enviornmental set itself is a very intersting tab. Say you are designing a city not for the heck of playing the game, but because you want to design the most cool looking city you can (and you can, with the infinate money mode (screw the citizens!)), take ""Strictoaster"" on YouTube for example. He is a urban designer, that not only does it as his job, but in games such as C:S (his favorite) and Planet Coaster. His work is phenominal. It's a real testiment to the powerful game that C:S is.VisualsC:S is incredibly detailed. If you were to zoom in all the way onto a road, you could see the minute rocks and pieces of stuff that goes into making a road, IN THE ROAD. When it rains, there is flowing water on the sidewalks, and roads. Citizens will pull out their umbrellas and hats (some are caught off-guard and pull out a newspaper over the head). Not to mention the nighttime graphics. I think the best time a city is in the full screenshotting glory (unless you have a beefy computer (That is, better than this one I have)), is at night. The towering lights of skyscrapers, orange glows of the avenue street lights, and the sky-shining lights of suspension bridges over heavy waters. All of that is just incredibly well designed.I will have to throw this in there. C:S does require a bit of a good computer to get the game looking good. Playing it on a 1.4GHz i5 with integrated intel HD 5000 graphics doesn't do much for you (saying that from experience after looking at longer loading times, trees that look like pieces of plastic, and distance rendering that looks like blobs of paint on a box). I would suggest you actually read the system requirements to get the game running.""Re-use"" and Game LengthC:S is a city builder. The sheer amount of time you spend refining your city is enough to keep me realing on one map for weeks. C:S has an infinate amount of hours in it. Theoretically, as long as you don't get bored of it. As soon as you've spent that 3 month period on a city, and you have that feeling that you've done your best and it's done, you can simply start up a new one. On a new map. Or a community created one.Review OutlookMechanics: 8/10Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Quality over SC:CoT: 10/10Overall: 9/10**Thanks for reading that, that's the longest review I've ever published. :P			"

												Cities Skylines finally itches that urge for a city builder with so much to give. Creat huge cities and expand over a huge region or make mini little towns here there and everywhere. I bought it, I'm hooked and cannot stop playing. The overall performance of the title is excellent and the graphics... you cannot help but sit back and marvel when you have big cities or your creations and running at solid frame rates. Every city builder fan should really check this out or even if you're not you never know what you might find that you enjoy!

												The city builder everyone has been waiting for since SC4 is here. Thank goodness.The original SimCity wasn't called a game by Will Wright, it's designer. It was called a software toy. That's because there was no winning or losing beyond some pretty basic functions (like not losing money) but was  a matter of how you wanted to create your city. How do you want your citizens to get to work? Do you want to create a city where most everyone walks through parks and forests? Do you want to create an ultra-dense metropolis? A suburban community? Now Maxis built on that formula and ultimately created the very complex and enjoyable SC4. It wasn't really a software toy any more though. It was a simulation.Skylines takes it back a bit towards the original SimCity. Whatever your dream is, you can pretty much create it in Skylines. This is the type of game where you can spend 30 minutes just building one intersection or do it in 5 second. You can spend hours crafting that new walking path or add 50,000 people to your city in that amount of time. They've added a host of options - road types, pathways, zones, policies which allow you to create most anything you can imagine. It's a ton of fun and harkens back to that Software Toy designation.Now it's not perfect. At times the game isn't challenging enough. You'll find yourself making tons of money and no real problems in your city (besides traffic). Traffic remains a stubborn problem sometimes no matter what you do. Since traffic impedes city services like fire, garbage and so forth it's not always an easy fix. But beyond that there's little challenge. In SC4 it was very easy to mess up the balance of a neighborhood and watch it crumble into decay. Skylines is much more forgiving and the lack of challenge is probably the biggest flaw.At the same time, you play a game like this simply create and have fun. You can create a small town or a massive metropolis. And unlike the Cities XL series, this one has personality. It's cool just following a vehicle around your city. The day/night cycle is interesting. I find the art style cute and the music charming. But what I like most of all is that you can really tailor the game to your goals and then drive forward towards those goals. And when you want to do something different, the game gives you the tools to pursue those new goals. I'm not just plopping down another generic neighborhood. I'm crafting a new development complete with walking trails around a pond. Or I'm crafting the majestic entrance off the freeway to my stunning metropolis. Or I'm crafing a self-sustainable logging community in the foothills, isolated away from the rest of the world. The choice is yours.The Steam Workshop integration helps too. You have many mods, buldings and other options to choose from and that kind of community involvement gave long legs to SC4. Thus Skylines is perfect for all ages and something that most gamers will greatly enjoy.			"

												The failure of SC2013 created a void I thought I would not be able to fill.  After cities XL Platinimum, I had thrown in the towel, until now.Cities: Skylines, it's an incredible game with a high difficulty curve.list]  Great maps.  Many features new to the genre: districts, deathcare, modifiable city connections, purchasable map tiles, & more!  Easy-to-use tool asset editor.  Map maker.  Complex traffic simulation and versatile road tools.  A large mod community.  Depth and a sense of challenge/purpose.  Dynamic water mechanics and the hydroelectric dam tool.  Giggles at epic dam failures!  A well-rounded, well-developed, complex city simulation!With a good learning curve, a creative community, and solid replayability, this is a game you do not want to miss out on! "

												Cities: Skylines is everything that Simcity was meant to be and more. With a streamlined interface, well thought out game mechanics, nice graphics and animations, and a massive map size allowing you to potentially build a huge city on, this is by far the best city building sim to date.Most importantly though the developers didn't ♥♥♥♥ up the game with features that nobody wanted, and there is no forced multiplayer or always online requirement. And you can get all this joy for about half the price of most mainstream games.Buy this game. Not just because it is great, but also because the developers deserve your support for making something that all city building fans have been asking for.			"

												3/26/15: Fixed Spelling ErrorsCities: Skylines takes the faults in Sim City (2013), fixes them, adds its own style and begins our path to a long and fruitful franchise. It's the spiritual successor of Sim City (RIP Maxis). As the population of your city grows, the game unlocks buildings, monuments, new sources of power and city service buildings to help you craft your city. The best aspect of Skylines, took no more than a few days to take off- the modding community *slow clap*- you guys will continue to drive longevity and replay value by adding new content, imported buildings from past Sim City games, and mods to enhance our experience. Great work so far. Not to take anything away from Colossal Order. These guys fixed a lot of the bugs found in the first weekend in just 4 days. (keep in mind this is a team of 13!) This is the ""Sim City"" we've been waiting for. Could not be more happy.			"

												This here is hands down the best city simulator on the market right now.Cities: Skylines takes the SimCity formula, builds upon it and then expands it even more, based upon Colossal Order's (the gamedevs) previous game development experience. If SimCity 2013 was too small for you and your people not having a permanent workplace and a home annoyed you immensely, then Cities: Skylines is what you need.Of course, some things that many people enjoyed in SimCity 2013, like modular buildings, are not present in this one, but this is only true for the out-of-the-box game. The wonderful thing about this game is that you have an enormously creative community that publishes a huge amount of mods that range from simple ""quality of life"" fixes to new game mechanics and total revamps. The game provides easy-to-use mod tools that allow you to stop relying on someone to make this thing you always wanted for you and try to create it yourself.All in all, this is is a great game that motivates you to learn new things (like real-world city and road design) and rewards you with stunning views of the masterpiece that you have built - only to encourage you to start a new city that would be even better and creative than the previous one.I have played this game for more than 100 hours and I definitely look forward to playing it more when the new Natural Disasters DLC comes out.

												All the text below is only my opinion, and not everybody will agree.One of the best sity simulator of last years.First about main features:Pluses:+ Big territory. You are starting with 2x2 km piece of land, but reaching some points with number of citizens, you can buy aditional pieces. In the end you can control 6x6 km.+ Easy zone structure. Build road - get place for buildings, 4 squeres in both sides. Buildings can be from 1x1 to 4x4, not so much, but game is mod-opened, so lets wait a bit. 6 types of zone for living, working and shopping.+ Large variety of city services - polices, clinics, schools and so on in differnt ways.+ Many ways to get resources for production- import from other cities using port, railway or highway, or just produce by yourself.+ Amazing traffic sim - all road can easily stuck becouse one truck unloading goods to factory.+ Use dams to change level of water.+ Upgrade of buildings connected with many parameters.+ Create our own stuff using in-game tools.+ Good public transport realisation - you need to plan everything in your lines to decrease amount of cars on road.+ Citizens  have own homes, cars and works, not just a picture on a screen.+ Draw districts with own policy.+ Chirpers - citizens will say you true!Minuses:- No terraforming.- Not so big variety of buildings.- Productions chains existm but its no so clear how it works.- After all hours I played, I dont know what profit turism gives to you. Very weak. =(- No day/night cycle.- No random events.- Annoying chirper- citizens will spam you!and its only a small part of pluses and minuses, but main of them, in my mind.And the game is still on of the best - developers planned all existing stuff wery good. But some important thing doesnt exist - its imposimble to create a city with own spirit, like it was possible in Tropico. But as I already told, game is opened for modding, and I heard that developers will not stop supporting project - they will add more content with patches and mods. If you fan of city simulators and some calm strategies, or just wanna to relax - its a good choice.So, I gonna mark in like 8/10 now, and for sure it gona be 9/10 very soon. Have a nice play!			"

												Now, I am going to take my time to write a review about this. Cities: Skylines is a city building game which I love. Simcity 2013 didn't satisfy me with the lack of realistic detail, mods and big maps like Cities: Skylines did. I have to hand it to Paradox for this game. You all met my satification with a game. The realistic feel to a big city, the amount of amazing detail put into this, THE MASSIVE WORKSHOP.. every little detail and it's still growing. I own nearly every DLC aside from the Natural Disasters DLC, both building addons and the Radio Station DLC due to some reasons. You're paying $17 for a DLC that yes, adds disasters and some more detail, but it still isn't worth $17. The two building DLC's that add new buildings are kind of pointless too considering you could go on the Steam Workshop and find/make your own. I found the Radio Station DLC pretty neat considering it takes away the plain old CSL Soundtrack but I just didn't bother buying it. I have over 100 hours (Yes it isn't a lot but I just made this account in the summer but I've been on this game for 2 years now) in Cities: Skylines and I still love playing it. I recommend this game with the following DLC's: After Dark and Snowfall. Those two DLC's added a lot and I really love them even though I barely use the snowfall maps haha. This game, be warned, is great but it's a pretty tough game to run at times. If you have a lot of items off the Steam Workshop like me, you'll be waiting at the loading screen for a good 5-7 minutes. I'm not complaining at all, but I'm just sending out a warning. I recently bought a new PC with good specs just to run this game. I run it on Very Good graphics at 60 fps while just starting my city/zoomed out but I hit around 25fps when I have a bigger city with around 40,000, lots of assets/props and A LOT of traffic. (This is on a GTX 1060 3gb btw)I do have some pros and cons about the game that I'll explain here:Pros:-Amazing Graphics/Detail  -Good Maps-Lots to do                         -Good AI -Massive Workshop           -Lots of cool DLC'sCons:-Harder game to run (Had to buy new $1300 PC)-Some rip-off DLC's-Traffic can be stupid at times hahaOverall, aside from my bad Pros & Cons list, I highly recommend this game for city builders. It's such a highly detailed game with amazing & fun things to do. 10/10 buy this game, totally worth it! :)			"

												If you were in any way disappointed by SimCity, you should buy this game. The design shows a passion and love for what makes city-building games great, and the execution is near flawless. The road building tool is absolutely amazing. It is powerful enough to let you solve traffic issues logically, rather than figuring out work-arounds, or just suffering through traffic. That's not to say it's easy, it does constantly present thought provoking puzzles. But each issue with traffic has a HUGE number of solutions, and each one is fun to implement since the tool is so well designed. In fact, just designing interchanges is a blast.The new district feature is the best thing to come to city building games since map creation (also included btw). The control it gives you over your city allows you to build the city you want.The dynamic water adds some incredible life to the maps, which changes as your city grows and you make changes.City expansion makes planning much more complex and fluid than previous city building games. You will find that old strategies have to be rethought in a more realistic way.You can legalize drugs.There are a few bugs, but none are even close to game breaking. No need to wait for a patch, or servers. In it's current state it is the best city-sim I have ever played. I've only been able to play for a few hours so far, but I'm excited to get to the weekend and sink quite a few hours into this gem.9.5/10			"

												I've had this game for a little while now but haven't really played it during that time, so here's how yesterday went- Decided to try actually learning the game for once intead of automatically going bankrupt- Decided to just play a little because of having a paper to write the next day and would also like to wake up earlier to play games with a friend for a bit first and still have time to write- Ends up playing until the sun comes up then finally goes to bed- Woke up, friend no longer online, and played game even more- It's now dark outside and still haven't written paper10/10 burning houses (tends to happen a lot in-game) would screw self over againEdit: Paper written now			"

												Cities: Skylines is everything that Simcity was meant to be and more. With a streamlined interface, well thought out game mechanics, nice graphics and animations, and a massive map size allowing you to potentially build a huge city on, this is by far the best city building sim to date.Most importantly though the developers didn't ♥♥♥♥ up the game with features that nobody wanted, and there is no forced multiplayer or always online requirement. And you can get all this joy for about half the price of most mainstream games.Buy this game. Not just because it is great, but also because the developers deserve your support for making something that all city building fans have been asking for.			"

												The failure of SC2013 created a void I thought I would not be able to fill.  After cities XL Platinimum, I had thrown in the towel, until now.Cities: Skylines, it's an incredible game with a high difficulty curve.list]  Great maps.  Many features new to the genre: districts, deathcare, modifiable city connections, purchasable map tiles, & more!  Easy-to-use tool asset editor.  Map maker.  Complex traffic simulation and versatile road tools.  A large mod community.  Depth and a sense of challenge/purpose.  Dynamic water mechanics and the hydroelectric dam tool.  Giggles at epic dam failures!  A well-rounded, well-developed, complex city simulation!With a good learning curve, a creative community, and solid replayability, this is a game you do not want to miss out on! "

												All the text below is only my opinion, and not everybody will agree.One of the best sity simulator of last years.First about main features:Pluses:+ Big territory. You are starting with 2x2 km piece of land, but reaching some points with number of citizens, you can buy aditional pieces. In the end you can control 6x6 km.+ Easy zone structure. Build road - get place for buildings, 4 squeres in both sides. Buildings can be from 1x1 to 4x4, not so much, but game is mod-opened, so lets wait a bit. 6 types of zone for living, working and shopping.+ Large variety of city services - polices, clinics, schools and so on in differnt ways.+ Many ways to get resources for production- import from other cities using port, railway or highway, or just produce by yourself.+ Amazing traffic sim - all road can easily stuck becouse one truck unloading goods to factory.+ Use dams to change level of water.+ Upgrade of buildings connected with many parameters.+ Create our own stuff using in-game tools.+ Good public transport realisation - you need to plan everything in your lines to decrease amount of cars on road.+ Citizens  have own homes, cars and works, not just a picture on a screen.+ Draw districts with own policy.+ Chirpers - citizens will say you true!Minuses:- No terraforming.- Not so big variety of buildings.- Productions chains existm but its no so clear how it works.- After all hours I played, I dont know what profit turism gives to you. Very weak. =(- No day/night cycle.- No random events.- Annoying chirper- citizens will spam you!and its only a small part of pluses and minuses, but main of them, in my mind.And the game is still on of the best - developers planned all existing stuff wery good. But some important thing doesnt exist - its imposimble to create a city with own spirit, like it was possible in Tropico. But as I already told, game is opened for modding, and I heard that developers will not stop supporting project - they will add more content with patches and mods. If you fan of city simulators and some calm strategies, or just wanna to relax - its a good choice.So, I gonna mark in like 8/10 now, and for sure it gona be 9/10 very soon. Have a nice play!			"

												Cities Skylines finally itches that urge for a city builder with so much to give. Creat huge cities and expand over a huge region or make mini little towns here there and everywhere. I bought it, I'm hooked and cannot stop playing. The overall performance of the title is excellent and the graphics... you cannot help but sit back and marvel when you have big cities or your creations and running at solid frame rates. Every city builder fan should really check this out or even if you're not you never know what you might find that you enjoy!

												If you want a great city building game, look no futher. It allows a high amount of professional and casual customization alike, with easy access and learning curve for the more indepth stuff for even those players like myself who were never really into the genre but had one or two titles we liked in the past 1-2 decades. Most of the (visual) content that's a paid expansion (night life, winter weather) are even included for free for everyone owning the base game, though more features (such as night and snow actually having effect on the city simulation and all the features related) are still of course included only in the DLC, you don't feel like you are missing out on anything if you don't buy them. In fact, it feels like you are getting great stuff for free, well integrated without ""BUY THE DLC TO USE THIS"" messages everywhere (dear EA, Ubisoft, and all you cashgrabs - this is how you make somebody WANT to support your projects).After SimCity2000 I came back to this genre with Topico 3 and I must honestly say that Cities: Skylines is really missing that personal touch Topico 3 had (and 4 lost, haven't played 5), so if you are looking for a mechanically friendly introduction to a complex simulation system, with a bit more ""colder"", professional feeling, Skylines is made for you. Plus it's usually super cheap for everyone like me who'd buy it as an experiment. You see, I don't have an outrageously high time spent with it, I had a single city that I grew bored of and left the game for likely forever, still I look back at it as a great game that was worth it's price on sale. If you are more dedicated to this genre than I am, you just cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines.			"

												Awesome city building game, reminded me of the Simcity 4 days. Bought this last december during the sale and only touched it this week, and it's a great game.Since there's too many things to say, I'll just say it in bullet formatTHE GOOD-Runs decent on my system, it can handle HUGE cities and has no problems whatsoever, it's about time we use that 64bit architecture. although I would say the performance could do a lot more better.-The city/traffic/civilian simulation is realistic. The cars and the people aren't just eyecandy, they actually do something. Everyone has a name, you can see where they live, see that they go to school/work, they buy their stuff and go to malls, etc. They could own a car or use public transport, you can actually follow them and see them do their daily affairs.-Traffic simulation is the best I've seen in ANY game. same with the civilians, there is an economy system and every car in the game has purpose, may it be delivering goods from industrial buildings to commercial buildings, or providing raw materials to industrial, or civilians going to school, work, garbage collectors, etc. -Public Transport is also the best, you can actually setup bus/train/metro lines or setup taxi services, ship lines and airlines, and see them in action and actually serving the civilians who are realistic as well as mentioned above.-The road placement is very flexible and allows you to build roads of all shapes and sizes, you can even adjust the height, up to the underground level. Because of this, Interchanges are in the game(and it's actually useful, because of realistic traffic simulation) and you can also make your own or get pre-made ones from the workshop.-♥♥♥♥ the grid system, you can design cities that have curvy roads, and it's as easy as doing grids, although I personally like doing grid system cities, a lot of people look for this specific feature-lastly, MODS, THOUSANDS OF MODS, are in the game, and If you've played Elder Scrolls, and Half-Life, you'd know how mods vastly improve the gameplay experience, this is one of those games where it's super mod friendly and allows for countless mods for various purposes to be made. Examples are pre-made road designs, new structures, cars, camera tweaks, maps, skins, even ones that make the game more realistic.THE BAD-the only bad thing for me is that it's hard to learn the basics, thankfully we have Steam Guides so I was able to learn the mechanics of the game quickly. Although I would say it's hard because it's that realistic, if you want a good road system you'd have to take a look at real life road systems. so you're not just learning the game mechanics, you're also learning how city traffic and roads work in real life as well.10/10 The best city building game I've played so far, ok the bullet format isn't much of a help, I still wrote a lot of things			"

The graphic is good. The AI is funny because they uses only 1 of 3 lanes, and i saw they parked they car in one distric then they took metro to another distric etc. I liked most are mods, there are many mods so you won't get easly bored.

												i've only played a few city building/management simulator games, but i'm a fan of the genre. of the ones i've played, cities: skylines is by far the most indepth one i've come across. i almost didn't get it because i worried it would be too much for me to manage and that it would be more frustrating than fun, but i was happily wrong. i really enjoyed picking the right map and environment for the city i wanted to build. then having to make sure each zone had enough water and power while at the same time making sure the city was close, but not too close to the highway and train tracks. it took several attempts before i got a manageable city going. i forgot to put up fire and police departments one time. another time, i built right by the highway, but ended up backing up traffic for miles outside my city. yet another time i didn't set up garbage routes or crematoriums to dispose of the dead. there's so much going on in this game. once i figured out the different public transport systems and how to use them to lighten up traffic flow on the roads, and remembered all the different aspects of city management, i was able to get a good city going and raised it up to about 110K citizens before i moved on to another game. i haven't been back to this game in a while, but i plan on returning to tweak my city designs and expand. i want to unlock and build more of the monuments as well as try out the different DLCs for this game. i picked up the snowfall dlc, but haven't exploed it much beyond using the trams and setting up tram lines in my towns. i want to get and try out the after dark dlc soon too. perhaps i'll updaye my review around then as well			"

												Let's be honest, you are reading reviews because you want reassurance that its a good game.I'll keep it short. Sim City sucked, this doesn't. Collossal Order is still developing DLC for the game with the intent of making the main mechanics free downloads and the paid DLC big extensions. There are tons of mods available (and I mean tons) to plug the gaps that CO left for us to build on (nice way of saying missed).The maps are huge, this is the way Sim City should have been. If you even have a slight leaning towards city simulation games, stop thinking, reward yourself and buy this game.Besides CO are Finnish, and Finnish are nice humble people, and boy do they know their subject matter. Its nice to know that there are ethical developers out there still and I like to reward developers like that who make a game the way gamers want it.UPDATE: While the DLC has been rather ho hum, with such great mods, you can't half blame the developers if they have difficulty finding new things to add. That said, I think they have plenty of space to go, such as being able to edit lanes on a road? Huh CO? Please?BTW the game is still excellent. Still pouring hours into this thing, especially with the awesome new mods that come out everyday.			"

												This doesn't just hit a home run, Cities SKYLINES bats it out of the park into orbit and to the moon Alice... and then some.9 Hours into this game and I just can't put it down.  NO LAG, NONE, ZIP, ZERO, this game runs SMOOTH (specs below).Started my first city today, messed about for 5-15 minutes getting the feel, then threw that away to start fresh now knowing what I need to do.  Having been playing 'Simcity' since the SNES version was released around 92 or so...Built roads, facilities, zoned as needed.  Plenty of options.  You purchase more map tiles as you go, they are part of your live city.  No loading/saving to access another tile.  This game is downright awesome with that expansion bit - they nailed it.  I mean NAILED IT.  This is the TRUE SUCCESSOR TO SIMCITY 4 DELUXE.  THIS IS WHAT SC2013 SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  I'll write this again so everyone can see it. THIS IS THE TRUE SUCCESSOR TO SIMCITY 4 DELUXE, THIS IS WHAT SIMCITY 2013 SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  IF YOU LOVED SIMCITY 4 AND PLAY IT TO THIS DAY, BUY THIS.  ENTIRELY WORTH IT, VERY AFFORDABLE!  There was Simcity on the SNES and pc.  Then there was Simcity 2000 on DOS 6.x on the venerable amd 486 66 ...Then there was Simcity 3000... but 2000 and 3000 didn't quite capture the magic that Nintendo put into the SNES version.  For so many years I kept that SNES and Simcity... and then Simcity 4 came out... it was good, but not until Rush Hour expansion was it great.  Rush Hour combined into the Original was also marketed as the Deluxe version.  Adding in the NAM mod to Simcity 4 deluxe made the game really awesome if you were into highway design, and really could excell at traffic management.  Cities XL was buggy, and laggy... and very vague (and therefor frustrating).  Cities XXL had promise but just did not deliver beyond multicore enhancements - it was generally everything (bad with the good) that XL was... re-wrapped into a new package.  Simcity 2013 had promise, but EA's greedyness and needless DRM and small city sizes/day 1 bugs really got the game off to a bad start.  You just couldn't build to your imagination's content like you could in Simcity 4 Deluxe - beyond the initial degridding.  Simcity 2013 was like a demo, a demo of something that could have been so awesome...  but last week... last week I heard some bad news.Maxis, to us City-Building afficianados - was something quite dear - Maxis was shuttered.  The Sims (EU studio) live on, but Simcity, as we know it, was official pulled off life support and pronounced dead... and know I know why.This game.  GOD BLESS THESE DEVS, SKYLINES NAILS IT.  EVERYTHING.  5/5!!!There is SO much realism packed into this game, and many things I did not expect.Traffic management? Check!Ability to build with realism using roads/avenues/bypasses to hearts content? Check!Highways, offramps/onramps buildable?  Check!Multilevel bridge over bridge stuffs for super-snazzy interchanges?  Check! (Roundabout, cloverloaf, diamond, trumpet, freeform entirely -not just PREFABS only, if you like - your imagination and the space available is your only limit)Large expansion of the city as needed?  Check! (more with MOD support)64bit exe and NO memory leaks?  Check!GREAT graphics (for a city builder)?  Check!  [Directx 11 video card required under Windows!]Sufficient sound feedback and decent music?  Check!  (Music in non-intrusive, sound fx I have no complaints on)Good play control/movement/UI design?  Check!Mod support?  Well, not yet - but devs are promising it!Healthcare AND deathcare? EEK!  Check!Trains for passengers AND freight?  Check! Seaports for passengers AND freight?  Check!  (improves industrial demand)Airports to attract more tourists and connect you better to the outside world (and their money!!!)? Check!Ability to creat custom maps and a terrain editor (and importing greyscale heightmaps)? Check!Ability to build in sunny tropical climate, or the more northern latitudes (custom gfx, sun angle)? Check!Broad range of options to customize the game to your hardwares ability/disability?  Check!Alternative ways to solve the many problems you face, and the ability to see you have them? Check & double Check!!!Game breaking bugs?  Nope - not in over 9 hours into it... not anything I can see. No CTDs, no glitchyness, nothing.I could go on and on...  58,000+ people in the city, 6 million in the treasury and making a good income monthly.I just can't seem to want to stop playing or get bored of this... I am absolutely in shock at how good this game is. Simcity 4 Diehards, This is the game WE have been waiting for - do NOT hesitate!  NO REGRETS HERE!THIS GAME IS NOT AND IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH CITIES XL OR CITIES XXL IN ANY WAY/SHAPE/FORM, OTHER THAN IT BEING A CITY BUILDER, A GOOD ONE AT THAT, A REALLY REALLY GOOD ONE. There are only TWO reasons you should not buy this game. 1.) If you cannot afford it.  The price IS very reasonable - VERY REASONABLE.2.) If you have a video card that is not capable of DirectX 11.  Do not use Intel video, it's glitchy.That said, those on Intel-based laptops, you need to force this game to use the dedicated AMD or NVIDIA gpu, otherwise it will be slow and glitchy defaulting to the laptop's Intel gfx.  You can do this from inside AMD Catylist, or Nvidia Control Panel.  You can find these solutions in the discussion forums here on Steam.  INTEL GFX IS NOT SUPPORTED.As stated above, hardware specs are here:i7 4790k @ 4.6ghz on Asus Maximus Hero VII Z97 Chipset motherboard16gb 2400mhz ram (8gb x2) corsair dominatorAsus Radeon 7850 2gb gddr5 [1ghz core] video card with Direct CU II cooling (the don't-ever-hear-it cooler)Dual Toshiba SSD drives in Raid 0 for OS & Games, for quick loading (almost zero load times. maybe a second or two)Soundblaster X-fi Titanium pro soundcardFractal Arc XL case with Seasonic 750 watt PSU, and Phanteks somethin'-14 red coolerI listed everything in the event someone wants to dupe the whole hardware config, game runs AWESOME.  NO LAG on HIGH settings.Seriously, get this game now.  You'll be glad you did.   The devs really got this one right.  Finally, A SIMCITY 4 REPLACEMENT!If you're a small kid with no money, do some extra chores for money!  Paint the dog, wash the lawn, mow the hedges, trim the carpet, vacuum the dishes, sweep the walls, scrub the garden, tiedye your white kittycat, ANYTHING to make money to buy this game (actually forget the bit with the cat, that might get you grounded, or worse, clawed and grounded).Can't wait to see what the NAM team does with this one :)--Cheers guys and good luck!  ... now if I can just kill that annoying little blue bird...***Laptop users DON'T forget if you have intel GFX to make sure this game uses the AMD or NVIDIA GPU!  Desktop users should be just dandy as this issue won't happen.  AGAIN, INTEL GFX IS NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME/POSSIBLY EVER.			"

												Wow, Cities: Skylines... Where to begin...- Firstly, this game is the game that EA's Simcity should have been, except about 1000 times better. More buildings, more options, better gameplay mechanics and generally more everything!- Secondly, The gameplay and the customisation feature of this game are truely its strong point. With thousands of Workshop items, assets and vechicles created by a community of dedicated fans that are added to your game with a simple click. This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness. Simcity did see a few updates but nothing compared to the love this game has recieved from the developers.This game has problems though, it has to be said. I have experienced problems during my play time, mainly around the stability on my PC, especially seeing as I am not running your typical /r/pcmasterrace beast machine. Asides from the occational lapse of framerate, crashes can occur. In the past, I have been left with a few hours of progress wiped because of foolishly not saving my progress. Collosial Order seem to have fixed this as crashes seem to happen less frequently then it used to but I do still see a occasional drop of FPS in my game, but again, I am not running an epic PC. Thinking of it, this game is so addicting that I have had to force myself to save or enable autosave.But that's really it, a lot of pros and a few tiny cons. Cities: Skylines is a must have for gamers who like Simulation games, City Builders, Moddable games and a whole lot of mircomanaging.EDIT (25/11/'16): I highly recommend buying the game with the extra DLCs. Although it will set you back a bit more, you will be supporting future development of the game and the extra features are mostly worth it. Think of it as a virtual highfive to the devs.			"

												About time we have a good City Builder from a reputed company.After playing this for some time, here are some feedback compared to SimCity4: Deluxe.PRO:1. Game starts as expected. Build some roads, electric, water, and zones.  Bulldozing gives money back instead of costing money.You don't spend money to zone or re-zone.  You can easily lose if you screw up this part. A second failure point that can crop up at this stage is placing something now that creates a pollution hub later.2. There is a lot to manage but you start small - then as you get bigger, the more you need to manage. Progression feels good and appropriate for a game in this genre. Pacing is also smooth. The Pace is dictated by Milestones, as you reach certain goals in the game you get to purchase more land, unlock buildings and more upgrades.3.  Mods in this game are pretty good in their potential.  Anyone can make Assets or Maps.  4. There is enough to simulate to entertain you but there isn't too much depth.  The level of depth feels appropriate.  Not dumbed down by any means.5. Lots of potential room for DLC, Expansions and more content WITHOUT being stripped down to nothing.  This is not a half-game awaiting the rest in microtransactions. CON: No big flaws yet.  1. Some parts of the UI are primitive.  When you click to view Energy, Waste, Fire or Crime, it doesn't tell you how much money you are spending on it. So there is some juggling of one tab to the next.2. You cannot move or re-size the windows that open for you when you click buttons.3. The music could have a better presence.  It is a bit quiet and often I hear nothing but birds.4. ""Forced"" to start small and build big from scratch.  You ""can cheat"" if you like, but playing without cheats you cannot just start building a large city. Some people might dislike having the same starting situation evey single time on terms of what you can build and how you advance.Linear Progression is the rule of this Sandbox.  Fortunately, you can advance in a non-linear way. Overall:  9/10.  The only thing that could have made this game better is to have more control over the size of Zones - the ""Zones"" appear next to road types when you build roads. You don't place ""zones."" Once the road is placed and the ""Zone Spot"" appears next to the road, you may designate that as Residential, Commercial or Industial.This is the best City Builder on the market, period.			"

												Day One review:GET IT... it's awesome, does have a few glitches, but they will be worked out....DAY TWO UPDATE:Well I'm 18 hours in... I have noticed a few hiccups, I have 2 pc's, one @ Work one @ Home, The work pc is technically slower than my home pc, but loads Skylines quicker. Don't ask why IDK... Also, I was one of those people who subscribed to mods before release, bad move.. Most got duplicated instead of updated, and my game went bonkers, I had to remove each mod in game, which for some reason is a chore, you can only delete one at a time.. Also, gameplay, The core game is weird, and I hung around long enough to get a few acheivements, but I've switched over to Sandbox mode, why? because the finance model is flawed, I can have 10% tax on everyone and still lose money..  I will just play with unlimited funds & a few good unlimited resource mods.. The map editor could use a video tutorial, I have played games with map editors before, but for some reason this editor just doesn't feel as good as it could...So, definitely get this game it is better than SIMCITY & Cities XXL series.. just don't think it's all peaches & creme.. there are some head scratching moments... But CO is good about support for their games...Day 2 update part two:28 Hours in, I have ditched the base game mode for now, the MODS & Sandbox definitely save this game, I have built a city w/ 100,000 people in it, but still somehow, industry didn't have enough people to fill the jobs... REALLY? Also, building up for the monuments is pretty difficult if not somewhat impossible without mods.. I have unlocked 25 city tiles, and have laid out seperate districts, so in a sense, from some screenshots i posted it looks like a free form region builder, instead of the constrained regions of SIMCITY 2013.. I would be able to fill in all the gaps, but That could take a few more days, besides that, a full 2x2km section in my city is all railroads & highways.. I honestly can't see myself going back to no mods, not until some stupid routing bugs get squashed.. Why have 3-6 lane highways? The CIMS only use 1 freaking lane... But other than that, this game does beats the tar out of Simcity as a whole.. I can't see myself ever going back to SIMCITY 4 or 2013.. Skylines has definitely won me over... I am patiently awaiting TUNNELS & major bug fixes..			"

												Refreshing city building game that touches on the roots of the original Sim City games. As a complete package I would rate this game over Sim City and it's expansion pack ""Cities of Tomorrow"". Bigger zones to build out on, basically these equal the size of Sim City regions. Better road management options, better public transport option (subways!), Day/Night cycle based budgeting, mods, great graphics, overall a more complicated but more rewarding game.Couple of things it falls short on would be budgeting, while you have more fine tuned options to adjust your finances, it lacks the ability that Sim City has where you can indivualy reduce/increase funding to say schools. In Cities Skylines if you adjust the budget for Education it affects all schools, so for example one school may need more funding because it overcrowed. By increasing the funding to education it increases all school funding nore matter the type. So while I may now have enough money to suuport the Elementary school, my high school is now over funded. Region play is missing from Cities: Skyline but makes up for it in the size of maps. Plus the avaliability of terraforming and making your own map!Industry is handled better in Sim City than Cities: Skylines hands down. While in Sim City specializing in certain industries (Oil, Ore, etc..) has a progression type mechanic too it, you dont start out with all the goodies. In Skylines you more or less lay down Industry tiles, district it to whatever you're trying to produce (farms for instance) and just kind of let it go. No real interaction with it like there is with Industry in Sim City.In my personal opinion it's still a vastly more fun game and with Steam Workshop support the possiblities are endless!			"

												It's been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, it's been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.There is a very realistic feel to this game. It's not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The ""Chirper"" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.The Good:+ Solid graphics and rich detail.+ Realistic simulation elements.+ Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings.+ Variety of buildings.+ Many customization options.+ Easy-to-use UI.+ Extremely high replay value.+ Mod-friendly with editting tools included.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.+ Pleasant audio/background music.The Bad:+ Lack of random events/natural disasters.+ Graphics could be more life-like.+ Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplay.Final Thoughts:Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.			"

												great and not so great at the same time. vanilla game is pretty lacking, DLC overpriced for the content (after dark is borderline), steam workshop really gives it the ""umph"" it needs, very large mod community that does great work. very CPU intensive though the higher your population goes, especially with mods aswell. Vanilla traffic AI is extremely sad, 90% of your population will funnel into the same lane, regardless how many are free and what traffic rules are in place. definitely managable you can force traffic to flow a certain way and it works still, sort of. Mods do answer this, but it adds to the intensive CPU usage.  good builder lots of fun still although does get boring after a bit, the only real challenge after you learn whats going on is battling the awful AI :P,  definitely wait for a sale though or just grab the vanilla game + after dark. the other paid DLCs, youre just paying for weather effects, which is not worth any more than 5$ each imho.

												I bought the game when it first came out and had fun setting up my cities. My main compliant, is that the AI is dumb and there are to many traffic jams where there shouldnt be any. No matter what you do, it's really hard to fix traffic issues. I also think the DLC is a fu<king joke. Those are things that should be free with an update, no something we should have to pay for. I mean really $15 for night time and $15 for snow??? Those things should be included for FREE, I hate that companies just release stuff like that for more money. If people would stand firm and no buy stuff that should be free, the company would be forced to include it in a update for free. I think the game could be really good, but feel like you're limited in certain areas that you shouldn't be... I don't really think the game will change directions though, so you have to like it for what it is...			"

It ran really smoothly, no problems whatsoever! I currently have: Snowfall and Match Day installed.Then the update came, along with the Natural Disasters expansion pack (which I did NOT buy)... I tried running my game and I don't know how to check what FPS it runs at now, but I can't scroll or zoom without very painful delays which end up sending me all over the map, let alone actually do anything. If we could revert to old versions, that'd be great. I'm really sad because this game was so enjoyable and now it's just frustrating to no end and I can't actually play it.Edit: extra comma			"

We have Steam Workshop !But but but, one thing im dissapointed:Limited amount of buildings, city looks a bit repeated, hope devs can add more building types for residential and commercial zones.			"

												As it was said before, this is not an economical simulator. This is just a 'city painter' without any thought behind the game play or any challenge. I really tried to make thing better and installed a bunch of mods supposed to make the game harder or more realistic but in the end it does not help.  You just sit and paint new blocks. That is it. I would recommend to play Sim City 4 with NAM mod instead.			"

												Negative because it doesn't deserve that much thumbs up.Yes it's beautiful but I enjoy more playing SimCity4 Deluxe that this.Who tested this game before release ?? Vehicles don't use 2/3-lane road properly, so building larger roads doesn't change a thing to the traffic except making them drive fatser.The buildings are too much the sameThere is no recycling center, who makes a 21st century city building game and does not provide anything else than dumps and incinerators ?It's cheaper than SimCity (2013 version) so it's not a rip-off and at least you can here install mods to improve what you think needs be improved.

												I've played 10 hours and I have seen everything the game has to offer.There's next to no challenge is this game, once you get your city of the ground. After that, it is chugging out more zones for the city to grow.People complaining about not enough healthcare? Dump another hospital somewhere in the vicinity and the issue is solved. Once your city is going money is no longer an issue.This cycle repeats until you are too bored to continue.The only interesting and difficult part is managing your traffic, which is somewhat annoying since you need to reach a certain population milestone before you can start building highways and such, making it hard to plan your infrastructure in advance.There's also this amazing feature of the game (or maybe Unity) eating up as much RAM it can get its hands on. My system has 6GB of RAM and Cities: Skylines decided it should use 4GB of that storing god knows what. Chrome even had to move all of my tabs to the pagefile to make room for the game.This game is fun, but only for a short bit. Don't pay much more than a tenner for this game.			"

												This game is advertised as a 'challenging simulation' so I bought it with expectations to get a city planner/builder with depth, challenge and realism. All I got was a shallow sandbox game. You can spice up the difficulty with a hard mode and mods, which basically results in having less money and income thus having to wait longer to be able to buy the stuff needed to progress.Yet there is nothing that can make up for the lack of more complex game mechanics. The game offers an over the top local traffic simulation which is far from believable and some minor challenges which are easily overcome by building appropriate infrastructure at the right spots.There are indeed a few mechanics where policies and economy matter, but nothing to write home about. In general the game feels incomplete and oversimplified.+ If you like sandbox games with good mod support and simply enjoy building beautiful cities you will probably also like this. - If you're a fan of simulations and believable game worlds you will be highly disappointed. Not worth your time and money. Gets boring quickly and lacks replay value.			"

												Your city is like a painting, but for a paintbrush you use roads and tress, parks and whatnot. There is none of the old Sim City micro management of your city. Sure you can change the tax rates and give few policies but that's about it. It looks nice and is a joy to watch your city grow, but it all feels too empty and gets boring really fast, unless you really like the traffic management. Which is what this game really boils down to. Just have The most efficient transport infrastructure and you are good to go.			"

												This game is good as a City builder sandbox. But will fail to captivate Simcity 4 fans. Why?Because he management part is simple! There is no real challenge to the game thanks to a progression system and the inability to experiment.All these flaws rears it's head 5 hours into the game. Visual and performance-wise it's fine, nothing to really complain about, the workshop would solve the generic art direction. There are few good ideas here and there,  like how far a service can be reached is shown by street instead of the usual circle. There are some other good ideas which seem incomplete or not having a prominent, noticable effect - e.g.: Day and Night budgets.But the game focuses on macro-management rather than micromanagement. Pro: it's less overwhelming for those looking for a sandbox experience.Con : it's too limited for challenges in maintaining a city.  Examples would be how taxation is done, how zones are handled, how structures are available.  All of these have a formula to them, without anything disrupting the formula. The game overall becomes a formula.  No Natural disasters. Fires are harmless and only burns down the building without spreading. The problem solving? Formula!Decision has a consequence, consequence has a solution, 99% it ends there No rinse repeat. Therefore the game just doesn't throw challenges.The progression system is the big deal breaker here. It allows you to play safe without experimentation. In order to get buildings you need to cross a certain amount of population. In my first city I happened to unlock buildings conveniently as I could afford them and sustain them. For some reason it's easy to  earn more money than you spend. There is alot of bad UI decisions, one notable one - the annoying twitter bird, that sits inconvieniently on top-center of the screen. The game is also missing a way to control day and night cycle, however I realized that that would break the game budget mechanic (which allows you to set budget for services based on time - Again a good idea which is very underdeveloped).It's here when the mirror begins to crack. The games popularity and critical acclaim comes from all the anger and spite towards EA's Simcity 5, which I though was such an awful game that people consider mediocre titles like ""Cities Skylines"" as the resurrection of the city building genre which we've been desiring since Cities XL. Yes, that game we would be playing if it wasn't for the crappy engine. Bottom-line, C:S is good as a sandbox for your young one or casual relaxing city building experience. It's bench-marked with SImcity 5, a game which can make a - square drawn in MS paint and exported as a jpeg then renamed to a .exe - look better.Planning takes a backseat here, sadly that part was never advertised. Because this was always advertised as ""A deserved sequel to Simcity 4"". This game seems unfinished and the gameplay is very underdeveloped.			"

												You can stalk your own citizens! I followed a guy named Mark (I forgot his last name). I was for sure Mark was a terrorist. He looked like a terrorist, smelled like a terrorist, and even talked like a terrorist, or so I imagined. He had just gotten off of his boat as a tourist.All his other tourist friends took the subway, but not Mark. Mark took his car... Fishy right? I followed him in his green van. I knew something was up. Who drives a green van? Mark does. He got onto my freeway and this is where I knew it would go down. Traffic was backed up for miles. What did Mark do? He waited, just sat there. His plan was failing, and I knew it. All of the sudden he merged into the left lane. Oh no! His plan was back into action.He later turned into my industrial area. Well played Mark, you though I would be stupid enough to think you worked in industry. Well guess what MARK! I know you were a tourist! You don't work in MY city! He couldn't shake me, and he knew it.He continued on with his plans to terrorize my city! There he drove back onto the freeway. Trying to cover his tracks I see... He merged left. Then left again. He turned... right into my tourist area. How suspicious I thought. He only wanted me to think that he was a tourist in my city. I wouldn't fall for it. He parked his green van on the right side of my road, only this road was no parking! Mark had slipped up. I knew he was up to something as he got out and went to go ""sight see."" I would NOT fall for that Mark. Not this time.Hours passed, days it seemed, and yet he was still sight seeing in my tourist district. I had to think of something before he carried on with his plan. It was too late. Mark got back into his car... I knew this would be it as he turned on his blinker politely and merged back onto my freeway. He was going to blow up my bridge... I saw it in his eyes, eyes that deceived everyone. Those crystal blue eyes hid a dark secret that I had yet to find out.The sweat ran down my face as Mark crossed my bridge. It was safe. But he was heading back to the tourist ships, there he would surely make his move. He didn't... He left my city. Until we meet again Mark. I'm onto you.9/11 ......Mark			"

												Citites: Skylines is both more forgiving and more in-depth than the likes of SimCity 4. Running out of money is a lot tougher, and there's a lot more to manage like the size of your roads, sewage, and cemetaries. The game starts off really slow as, unline in SimCity where unlocks are based on the year, the unlocks here are based on population, so you start off with coal power and no high-density zoning. Over time, the game opens up, and you get a lot of room to build and experiment. If you like city builders, this game is definitely a solid 9/10, it shines in comparison to the likes of the newer and even the classic SimCities.			"

												Years of playing city builder games made me wish for a lot more -- and I thought I found that in OpenTTD. However, it's then lacking the ""building a city"" part of the game that was also fun.This is the first game that truly has me wanting to start a new city often to try out new ideas, to incorporate ideas I've seen others try out, and to incorporate a mod system so well that it's almost effortless to maintain.This is not a perfect game by any means, but it's head and shoulders above any similar game on the market right now.I can't recommend you try this enough!

												Cities: Skylines is the new gold standard for city builder simulation games, and will be for the foreseeable future (probably until Cities: Skylines 2 in 5-10 years if Paradox can think of ways to develop a sequel that improves on the original). If you were a SimCity fan disappointed by Maxis' last SimCity (2013) but still like the genre, don't hesistate, C:S is the new standard bearer. If you're price sensitive, wait for it to go on sale, and it'll be a great deal you can sink hours into.Pluses:+Active mod community+Ongoing development with value-add expansions and DLCsMinuses:-No multiplayer, e.g. the regional maps in SimCity 2013			"

												Rating - 7/10Probably the best citybuilder since the big name in the industry missed the mark in 2013.First, the good:Decent visuals Large city areaGREAT mod support Reasonably deep simulationTools to create maps, assets, and themes already in base gameThen, the bad:Agent-based pathfinding (garbage truck conga lines, unrealistic travel of water and power, emergency vehicles sent from a random station instead of one immediately next to the building that needs help)Small tracklist of repetitive musicLack of challenge past a certain point in most citiesWonky traffic AI (no right turns on red, no way to assign turn lanes, cars occasionally get stuck)Overall, I enjoy Cities: Skylines.  I certainly recommend it if you enjoyed Maxis' excellent city sim series back in the day.  It's definitely not without flaws, but the modders have helped with most of the issues I have with the game.  Besides, they're a small team of passionate people who released a game that in many ways surpasses what a AAA game developer put out just two years before.  I'd call that a huge success story.Final rating: 7/10:  If you like the genre, this is a must-play.  If you don't care for citybuilders, this may change your mind, but wait for a sale.			"

												The first thing i was extremely happy with is that it was not affiliated, bumped shoulders nor even glimpsed at focus home interactive ( Cities Xl ). Cities: Skylines is a game thats well put together, extremely fun, so much to do in so many aspects of the game and it runs smooth with no issues that i can see.I Love my city builders ever since simcity 4, then simcity 2013 got released and i was let down big time. then came cities xl wow !!!  what a mess of a game that was, i was truly losing faith in city builders since focus home interactive were obviously run by wild monkeys who should just stop now and give up in the gaming industry. But then the day came when cities: Skylines was released and yes i did have my doubts since i have been burnt before. but after purchasing and downloading it, i pressed play and something magical happened it didnt crash, in excitement i quickly drew out roads and placed resedentials and commercials and industrials and laid down power and water and to my amazement my city was coming to life smoothly, beautifully and with ease.Graphics Are Great, NO LAG !! NO LAG WOOHOO, Game Is Amazingly Put Together.The is so much to do and its filled with pure gameplay !!I am definately impressed by this game and look forward to what the developers will do next with this game.10/10 no doubt. they basically learnt from other developers mistakes and created a masterpiece :)			"

												Cities: Skylines has the best emergent feature yet. If you build your city in chunks, people will move into your city in chunks. If people arrive in your city together, they grow old and die together.Anyone who isn't syncronized to the death/repopulation cycle becomes horrified by the mountains of dead bodies and move out, spreading the massive wave of death and repopulation across the whole city.There's something transcendental about that.

												Cities: Skylines is what SimCity (2013) should have been. Incredibly open, large spaces to build on, incredibly moddable, and gorgeous.That's about all that needs to be said, but on top of that, the developers are very open and communicative with the community on forums and Reddit, and there's a fantastic community of modders and asset makers working on the game.

												This is my first review I've written, so here it goes.I've played Cities Skylines for 350+ hours so far, including the After Dark DLC, and I can truly say that I am addicted to this game. Ever since it came out on March 10th, I barely have time to play any other game that I've bought because I just can't get enough of it. I downloaded Steam primarily to play this game after playing SimCity 2013 for two years prior.I can honestly say that this game makes up for the mistakes SimCity 2013 made. Cities Skylines contains bigger cities, cims have a home and job which they actually travel to (instead of randomly parking at the nearest home or building), creating your own maps in the map editor, and workshop support which modders have posted some outstanding work on. I could list even more pros but I would be rambling on forever. The other thing I like is that the devs at Colossal Order are actually listening to the community, replying to users questions and concerns, and are working their absolute hardest to satisfy everyone, and if they can't do something, the modders are always willing to give it a try.Now the game is not perfect. It can get laggy (at least for me) sometimes but that's really minor and I can deal with that. I'd like to see some weather changes added to the game but I am in no hurry to see huge updates as the game has surpassed my expectations. I'd like to have the population limit of 1 million increased although, I completely understand why the devs put it in. Although, I thought I saw that in the last update that several limitations were increased, though I can't be sure if the population limit has changed. Other than that, I have no real complaints or concerns at this point and I fully recommend Cities Skylines. If I had to give it a rating, I'd give it 9 out of 10.			"

												It's hard to say anything more about this game that hasn't already been said by hundreds of people before me. So I will just put this into my own perspective. I really, really, really like this game.I have been playing city simulators since the first SimCity was released. The genre has come a long way since those early games. I have played pretty much every SimCity (including spinoff games such as SimCopter) excpet for simCity 2013, lets be honest it's not the greatest entry in the series, and modern takes like Cities XL. So right away I felt at home with Cities: Skylines. What I really like about this game is it's deceiving simplicity. To start with the game is easy enough to get even new players to the genre building with ease. And for veteran players the interface all looks similar enough to what we have been using to settle in very quickly. The city population milestones means new services and enhanced buildings are brought in steadily. However it soon becomes more challenging to manage larger cities as the populous need more attention to keep happy. But that challenge never seems over the top or unfair. It is managable but you have to be on your toes. I would really reccomend this game to anyone familiar with or new to this genre.			"

Some niggle AI problems but I am sure they will be patched and they are not at all game breaking.Best part, the game is likely to be well supported by the devs with updates and the game is open to modding by the community ensuring plenty of variety, items, buildings and fun.Highly recommended.

												Cities: Skylines is an amazing city builder. I haven't playes a Sim city game in a long time, admittedly, but Cities: Skylines really brings the genre to the forefront.The logic to this game is very good, where every peice of traffic or people actually has something to do, rather than just being cosmetic. This does make things a bit trickier, but overall that is much more fun. Similarly, the mechanics of district zoning is something I hadn't expected, but turns out to be really useful.Things do tend to get a bit hectic when you end up with a large population [>100,000], but that may just be due to my own lack of experience.The audio graphical design to this game are really good. It makes it a joy to just sink in to playing for hours. From a wide angle view of the environment, right down to the models of buildings and vehicles it all looks and sounds great. The interface isn't overly complex or cluttered, and it is easy to learn. The modding community to this game is amazing as well, with loads of great content. The devs are even taking hints from various popular mods and integrating relevant additions into the game itself, which is always nice to see. That, and the few gripes I do have about the game [like no tree brushes] can easily be fixed by a mod. They install easily, and I haven't had any game breakages from them.This game is definitely worth buyng if you like city builders, or simulator games of any kind.			"

Guess what? It really is fun!If you're new (like me), it takes a few tries to actually get a city running before falling into a financial crisis, but once you do it, you won't regret spending 30€ on this game. The graphics are good (with a cartoony vibe), cities are realistic, it's not too easy, but not too hard. There's also mods, easly installable through the Workshop, so you can have ten times more fun!9/10			"

												If you are looking at City skylines and like what you see than you may as well just buy it because it delivers exactly what you want out of this kind of game. The management tools are nice, it's a clean looking game and has tons of free mods. It delivers everything you wanted out of the last Sim City game but didn't get. And you can play it on steam what's not to like? I've spent hours in the game just messing with building intersections because the traffic part of the game is very detailed. I'd recommend this game to any one interested in the city builder genre.			"

												I have found this game to be very well made, fun to play, engrossing and supported wonderfully by a great community.  As you build your understanding of the mechanics, it becomes more and more interesting.  The developers created a great balance in this game.  Some systems are handled simplistically to speed things along and others require a bit of management.  To build a functioning, growing city takes thought and consideration of a variety of systems issues. To make it also beautiful requires another level of thought, but develops a love and satisfaction within us.  The expandability with the workshop addons and mods from the community along with the asset and map builders make this game something that can be played in many many ways.  I love it.			"

												I'm going to edit my review since I don't think my previous one was that good.In Cities: Skylines, you can build cities. It's pretty realistic: you have to deal with traffic issues and what not, you have to build fire stations so your buildings don't burn down, you have to build cemeteries and crematoriums, etc.Overall, the game is very good, but what makes it even better is the Steam Workshop support. Without mods, I wouldn't have gotten the 67 hours I have logged on it as of time of writing. There's mods for basically everything. You can install mods so you'll have lots more of building varieties, you can add landmarks to your city, you can have a gigantic statue of a hamster if you want, there's mods to change the color of your roads or even Americanize them if you want.. As of recently, you can even mod VEHICLES: I can now see DeLoreans driving my city.And you can install a mod... with one click. You don't need any dragging & dropping folders, etc. like for other games like GTA IV.The developers are very great as well. They listen to their community and they are very active.This game was very well worth it in my opinion.			"

												It reminds me of the old Simcity from Maxis they did ages ago. But its more modernized with todays standard city building game needs. Just awesome. One small mistake can ruin your city in no time. For example, I gave my city sewage water to drink because it wasn't far enough from my drain pipes...so they all eventually died...just great :).This game will remain on my computer for ages... I recommend itPros: Beautiful graphics Simple to use but can become complex and hard at some point Steam Workshop for mods Looks simple but with some time, you'll know its more complex...so its not you're basic Simcity 1 game Fired Maxis employee's play this game but won't tell you Developer and publisher house are small and can do better than Maxis and EA Lots of replayabilityCons: Lack of sim communication feedback (think of simcity4 sims on the streets giving feedback) Learning curve UI needs work a bit Not needed,  but lack of end game for goalsLast thing to note is the number of things gets unlocked. I find this unusual as its more of a skinner box technique so It's not a really bad thing but the more you get your population growing, the more things it unlocked so you can use them. So I can't really put it in pros or cons in my opinion.Highly recommended game to buy if you liked Simcity or City XL type of city building game			"

												I played almost every city building game you can imagine: each and every SimCity game (even SimCity Social and Societies, yuck), the Anno series aka Dawn of Discovery, Cities XL, Stronghold, Cities in Motion, Tropico, and even the really old stuff like Caesar or Pharaoh.You can imagine that I love these types of games!And let me tell you this - Cities: Skylines is easily the best city simulator in over 10 years, trust me. The base simulation and game polish is very solid, but with easy and well integrated mod support, the game is nothing short of phenomenal.And it's only 30 bucks. And was made by 13 people. Could someone pinch me?			"

												Pretty amazing game overall. There's a lot of depth in the gameplay and after playing, you quickly realize how complex traffic can be when your city starts to grow. One of my favorite aspects is the data provided for evaluating the effectiveness and outreach of your hospitals, schools etc. That really helps you decide where to focus at any given point. I also like that you can manipulate the roads while paused. It's hilarious to watch what the vehicles do once the game is unpaused. One big thing I think would help is not to close the road panel when you simply just want to deselect the type you currently have. That part is frustrating as I find it a common occurance. I also think some of the camera controls could be bound to the mouse as it's a bit frustrating to manipulate otherwise. The game is very demanding, so if you're playing on an compatible laptop, expect it to run very hot (without third party cooling help). It's a very addictive and fun game and I feel it presents a lot of real world design challenges and can make you really appreciate many city planners, techical and skilled worker's jobs. I highly recommend it!			"

												Currently the best city simulation game I've played. Hands Down.You have the power to create breathtaking cities, and the workshop allows you to explore every possibility.  You monitor multiple aspects that each have an important role in ensuring your city's success.  As a Sim City player years ago, I would say I prefer this over the franchise.  EA eventually ruined that series, and by Sim City 4, I never played them again.  Cities XL Platinum was a downright letdown. Bug after bug, and very confusing interface.  Right here, this is the game you have to get.Pros:-Amazing Scenery-Constantly Updated Workshop Content to enchance your city-Multiple starting maps apart from Workshop Content-Developers constantly updating-Multiple mods for creative experience-Expansions being put into the game (European Theme)-No EA-Fairly simple interface-Gives a challenge by having control over multiple areas supporting your city-RealisticCons:-No disasters (Fire/Crime/Death does exist in the game)9/10			"

												This game is quite fun if you enjoy micro-managing everything. I personally do not so I didn't get much more than a few hours of entertainment. Without mods, the game can get kind of annoying in the later game stages where there is a lot of burned down buildings and abandoned bulding that pile up. Personally I felt that the world creator tools were clunky and hard to use. It wasn't easy to control them when scaling height for terrain.All around though it had some nice features and customization. However, I personally did not enjoy it all that much			"

												Cities: Skylines is what the latest Sim City should have been.  A complete city simulation but be warned of the expansions as they do not yeild enough content to warrant the price!   Cities: Skylines in a brief description is a city simulation in which your ultimate goal is to design a city that meets your requirements.  There is no actual objective, no missions, just a pure sandbox play.  You start with a tiny town and slowly grow into a spawling city.  As you level up your city through population milestones you unlock more necessities of a large city.  Proper planning goes a long way when it comes to city and even town design.  You can quickly have a large traffic jam for miles if you don't engineer your roads correctly.  Even if you create a 6 lane highway to bypass traffic, the rules in this game will insist the that inhabitants of the area take the shortest route not the quickest route.  This must be considered when designing the road systems from the very beginning.  It is all too easy to get caught up in building out blocks and areas for your industry and commerce and totally forget about the road requirements.  An easy way to start off is to build a road then delete it, this opens up other roads that are not initally available for some reason.  As you progress you can make freeways, underground roads and suspended roads for more efficient travel.  It takes a civil engineer to make a good road system and I obviously need much to learn in this department despite my advances in understanding how to properly build a road system.  As you grow you zone your areas much like Sim City.  You have your basic residential and commercial and then as you grow you can get into the high density residential (skyscrapers) and high density commercial as well as office space.  Offices provide commerical output and don't generate noise like a typical commerical zone would.  Think an office versus a diner or gas station.  Day and night, rain and fog, as well as snow if you have the expansion are all weather effects.  The day and night were free additions to the game but the expansion for the nights adds other buildings as well.  You can adjust budgets per time of the day.  If you want, you can increase budget during the day hours and decrease the budget for the night hours since they have two independent sliders.  What I find interesting, is that school is also in session at night as well as a few other services that normally wouldn't run during that time.  Elementary at 2 am? Sure thing, get your♥♥♥♥♥to school.  There are mods out there and tons of add-on buildings that people have created using the asset and map editor.  There are so many mods that you could easily fill up a quarter of your harddrive if you went nuts about it.As I continue playing Cities: Ckylines, I find myself always coming back and wanting just 5 more minutes.  Sometimes I'll expand into a brand new district I have planned out and end up wanting to quit in 5 minutes but end up playing another 45.  This game can really take some time out of the day if you let it.  You can design a small town with sewage spilling into the river or expand enough to get water treatment plants and build dams.  If you don't want skyscrapers you can implement policies that limit how big the buildings can get, it is completely up to you.  For what it's worth, I haven't had this great of a time with a city simulation in quite some time.  Since the last Maxis Sim City now that I come to think of it.  With mods, you can easily fix some of the annoying problems like the traffic issue that I explained earlier in that they don't care if the highway is a parking lot, they would rather sit thre than take the new 6 lane bypass you built.  A few other things can get annoying too such as education and the industrial area not building to demographics.  It would have also been nice to deny education to certain schools for a more granular control process but there may also be a mod for that issue as well.A bunch of small issues that don't really get in the way of the big picture.  Build whatever you want, make it look awesome or turn it into North Korea.  Ultimately it is your choice and with a load of maps both official and custom, you won't get bored!			"

												I've always been a fan of sim games, including all of those sim city games that ended up being massive failures. Cities: Skylines is exactly what I was looking for. It's fun, has hidden humor (ever tried following the hurse around?) and you don't need a degree in order to start playing. The price can't be beat, and they've already pushed out free content. That doesn't even begin to touch on the amazing mod community. If you're tired of paying for overpriced city building games, I would certainly reccomend Cities: Skylines, it's hard not to be addicted.			"

												Hey, I have about 20h in at the time of this review, so I think I can make a pretty quick overlook.Short Version: Good Game, I recommend everyone to get this game if you like City Builders/Simulators.Long Version: The game is good but not without its flaws. There are a lot of basic features missing in the game as of 1.1.0. As someone who doesn't like to use mods for anything than aesthetic changes, with this game I felt the need of grabbing a bunch of mods as soon as I understood how the game worked. I hope that the game keeps evolving the way it is, so that eventually I wont have to search for mods to do basic stuff. Overall (Ill get killed for this), I had more fun with SimCity 2013 at the start than with this game, but SC2013 got boring pretty fast, and C:S has a lot of potencial and I see myself playing for much longer than I did SC2013....I hope we get natural disasters at some point, even if they dont occur naturally... It's fun to blow up your city after you're done playing that map. "

												The Good of Cities Skylines :+You can build a big scope of big city +The change of getting a profit in order to expand an area of the city is 70:30.....or 90:10 , which is good...depending from how you  manage it +The scale of the city are outstanding , beautiful , gorgeus , amazing , and also makes you wanna live there +With Mod , everything can be so fun , especially when it comes to create the city more impressive +It is way more better than the previous leading of the genre , SimCity series +Even without the features of Disaster effects and random event , the game still impress me with the the detail of the big city . But with that kind of random event and disaster effects could make the game getting worse +My favorite Mod so far is the First-Person View Mod , you can see the scope of the city that you create by becoming the Citizen of the city and explore it everytime you want ... AWESOME !!!!+It's suitable for every age , from the young one to the old one +The graphics are so immersive and giving the sense of big city is like +The musical score was more better than the previous SimCity series . But still can recreate the sense of big city +It's only 2 GB size of HDD storage , with 4 until 6 GB of RAM , but still can make the whole fun things from the first 40 hours of gameplay (which is LONG and GOOD) , untl to the next hours The Bad of Cities Skylines :-I can't open for more expanding area . Alhthough you can open one area in one map until 100 km2 , but i want more than that , like i can open the entire map (324 km2)  so i can see more open world of the game's environment . I hope this one will be considered in the their new series or updateIf you still keep yourself hoping for a kind of a City-Building game , grab your wallet and and see if there's still 15$ and BUY THIS GAME , IT'S REALLY AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												At first I was like ""What's all this hype about? This looks like another SimCity game. Does the citybuilding crowd just get really hype about citybuilders for some reason?Turns out, it's just because the game is fantastic. The city building is great, and you can tweak even the smallest things like policy management and building zones, but the coolest thing, by far, is viewing the individual lives of each of your citizens. They all have their own jobs, houses, and families, and that's just absolutely awesome. It actually makes you feel like a mayor protecting their citizens. It's not about ""Get firetrucks to get the burning buildings to stop flashing."", you're actually trying to protect these people (from themselves, admittedly).In any case, I've had a ton of fun so far. I can see myself playing for many more hours to come.			"

												A quality city-builder though not as Messianic as some make it out to be.Graphcis are solid, but not stunning. Mechanics are a harmonious blend of detailed and easy-to-use.TL;DR below.This game borrows from previous city-builders which had success, namely SimCiy 4 and Cities in Motion, while avoiding the pitfalls which made Cities XL and Simcity 5 disasters.In the end, this game's appeal is greatly heightened by the disappointments of Simcity 5 and Cities XL and it's ""Sequels"" which looked frightening like clones of their predecessors.While innovative and clever (especially with way pollution directly impacts the game environment via the soil and the water), Cities:Skylines innovates only mildly while maintaining an overall pleasant experience. The graphical experience does come off a bit fuzzy despite settings being maxed and the game is sorely in need of an update which establishes a day/night cycle. A solid game with excellent gameplay. Easy to grasp, semi-tough to master, this game is as solid 8/10 with the potential to become a 9 - 9.5 with a high definitions texture upgrade and a few feature upgrades (smog effects, clouds, weather, day/night cycle to name a few.)While it scratches an itch long unscratched given that SimCity 4 is 10 years old and there have been no legitimate challengers to it's dominance save a disappointing Cities XL experience, Cities is a good that could be great but seems to be a few steps away from being genuinely terrific. TL;DR8 / 10 with the Potential to be better with a few solid updates that will (hopefully) not end up as cash grab DLCs.A good buy at $20 or less, but unless you are desperately in need for a city-builder, I wouldn't pay full price for it.Fun, easy to get into and enjoyable, though a bit fuzzy graphically and asking for an HD upgrade.

												I don't know how they did it but it's incredible, it FEELS like a real city with real people populating the city who need real jobs and real places to go shopping.There are some caveats, roads and planning is hard when you get really big scale. There's a reason there's a science behind city planning and as someone who hasn't been educated in that subject I feel like I might benefit from it from this game.It's really easy to make a town (and very fun) but it's super hard to make a city that doesn't implode.This is not just a successor to Sim City, it's going beyond that. Sim City wishes it was City Skylines!			"

												Excellent game.It's obvious that the game is automatically to be compared with Simcity game series, and it's not about saying that the one's good and another's bad, but Cities: Skylines really has what it lacked in Simcity.My main points:— The controlls are great;— The cunstruction system is very convenient and easy;— I really loved the zoning;— All the in-game atmosphere: city-growing, the traffic (traffic jams, parked cars, public transport management), the presentation of influence of adding different constructions near the zones — all that looks really vivid and lively, so it's a big pleasure to play the game;The game's absolutely lovely and great, and I'm glad that someone is making quality products like this.

												This is probably the best city simulator I have ever played.I was weary of getting this since the last city simulator to come out, Sim City, was a total disaster. But I saw this and everyone saying how good it was so I gave it a shot. It was the best $30 I have ever spent. Well worth it.Some of the features I love are how you can rename not only the buildings, but the people themselves. If you have a problem with saving money, you can either fix that in the economy panel or you can turn off a building. The people rarely complain about taxes up until about 15%, which is lovely as well. Some problems with the game that I have are the traffic (which can be fixed with mods I assume) and theres no weather system yet, which I hope Colossal Order and Paradox can bring in the future. Otherwise, do buy this game. You will not be disappointed.			"

												At the time when cities were built, man was not yet able to generate monetary streams. Now, several years later we have multiple streams of income. I really love the banking system in this simulation as I also am able to control people their lifes. Getting richer by raising taxes and investing makes me want to play more and more to get richer and richer tot he point of infinite money. I would recommend this simulation to my fellow banker Sir Rothschild and Sir Rockefeller. 9/11 would recommend.			"

												In short, this is EXACTLY what SimCity 2013 should have been. I mean let's face it, no more restricted areas to build in, interchanges, more practical zoning, and much more. There are a few draw backs that I should mention though: Using resources, control takes some getting used to. Other than that I have nothing bad to say about it. Simply put if you like Cities XL, SimCity, and Anno 2070, you should absolutely pick this up and give it a whril, there are already mods available to fix some of the annoyances that do exist. This is just on point and looks beautiful.			"

An earthquake, a tsunami, a huge fire in a nearby forest, a landslide, a leaking dam, wind turbins' blades ripping off from their mounts and scaring people off, terrorists attacks (alright maybe not that disastrous), highway accidents, send services over to a designated place to fix things up, collapsing bridge, car pursuits, celebrities (and their controversies), protests from people, campaigns to move people to another land in your city (for example, trying to get them to move to the other side of the river without the impossible work of increasing the land value), hostages, robberies, banks, etc.So many possibilities!

One of the best things about Cities Skylines is that it is on steam and can be easily downloadable and you can download add-ons and mods!

												Mods, so many mods.It was the mods that really made me want to get the game. There's so many you can get and customize especially when choosing from a whole list of thousands of assests. The game in general is built pretty well. Like everyone else has said, it was what SimCity 5 should've been. 100% agree.			"

												The game is absolutely enthralling. The roads and transport systems, pollution and noise, and property development are complex enough to keep things interesting but simple enough to be fun. There is a real joy to helping your city grow without having to micromanage every aspect of it.			"

												I want to say its like Sim City 5, but its not. For a couple reasons, The game was playable on Launch Day, There were fixes for the minor hiccups,There was no DRM outside Steam.Cities: skylines City specilization feature works, The population reacts as it should with the actions you choose The ai traffic obeys its own ruleYou arent limited to only one square, but you can aquire more land.The Road building is a little wonky, but it works.   I could go on, It has one small fault, the buildings dont have modules that can be attached to them like in sim city 5. While a fault im sure it can be added to the game, By Devs or by Community Modders. Theres another good side, The devs of this game support moders and it has Steam workshop on day one. If you want a city builder game, look no further.			"

Cities Skylines is a good but not incredibly deep game. There is nothing wrong with the game, but you should know that after only a couple hours you will have unlocked everything there is to do. I am still recommending the game, but I hope that they improve the amount ofdepth in teh future. Take for example teh police system. If your crime rate is high, installinga police headquarters willl imeddiately fix it. You do not even have to design routes for the policemen or anything, they atomatically and quickly drastically lower the crime rate. Much of the game is like this; simply building buildings that will lower a certain thing. Pros  The game is fun, and easily addictive. I stayed up very late building that last city block. The game runs well. My computer is not super good, but can still run the game at around 30 FPS. Traffic is designed very well. Cars will react realistically at insterctions for the most part, and will take alternate               routes once you make them Power systems are realict, and you have to make sure to run power lines to the houses.  [There is a large varierty of roads and monuments that can help flavor your city. Cons   Many social systems are only placing a building and that is it. These are the education, fire fighting, police, and healthcare systems. All you do is place a building and the computer does teh rest. That is no fun, and I wish we had more control. Many of teh buildings look exactly the same. They are all generic models only defferentiated by their name. This makes your city look like something in Russia, as opposed to where people actually want to live.  The bird at the top that displays your tweets is incredibly annoying. The tweets are always teh same, and tell you nothimg important. You can disable it and I would recommend it. "

ImpressionsFrom the first 2 hours I can already comment the complexity of the simulation in this game is outstanding and runs really smooth, you don't get bogged down; The in game hints offer just what you need. Seems well optimised and has no game-breaking issues that I've stumbled upon yet. From a developer that created transport simulations before; This game holds nothing back. You WILL get traffic problems if you don't plan ahead and it's your job to fix it or problems arise in game. Things progressively get difficult as you expand into new building grids. The map size is huge for those who are worried. With a quick mod you can unlock the full map allowing you to build huge metropolis's. The game is so detailed you even rename pigs...  After spending over 4 hours in the asset/mod manager alone just perfecting and learning the way roads form, with their one way systems or complex intersections and then to finally implement them and watch the traffic flow freely made me smile. Repeating on many reviews; This is the game SimCity should have been. With the built in map editor you can recreate your home town/city and see how the game stacks up against the real thing. With, already, hundreds of workshop items from the community ranging from; custom maps, buildings, highways, junctions and items you wont run out of ideas or playable maps any time soon. With fluid camera motions and a in-game ""Tilt Shift"" filter, there are some amazing screenshots around already.SummaryI really want to review more but I'd end up writing an essay. All in all I highly recommend this game for anyone, from casual to die hard city building fans. Both groups will find their niche. "

												I don't write reviews often but this game definetly deserves it. After the fiasco that was the last SimCity, I've searched long and hard for a modern city building game that could satiate my desire to be the mayor of a giant metropolis.The freedom you have to create your city and exand across the map are tremendous. You can create your own cloverfield intersection with the road tools if you like, or plop down the prebuilt ingame one. There are also loads of mods in the workshop that add all sorts of neat ingame content.Perhaps the only forseeable downside to the game is the fact that there are no disasters. As a person who played simcity with disasters disabled, however, I don't see that to be a problem, and the developers have stated they will add it in the future. Overall, this game deserves the price tag and it more than beats Maxis' SimCity. If you're on the fence, watch a few videos and decide for yourself!			"

												This is the game that SimCity 5 was supposed to be. Personally I enjoy designing intersections - I never really understood the whole ""never turn left"" thing before I saw how it affected things in the game.I don't like the way that public transport lines are implemented - it is hard to seperate out lines from one another if they overlap anywhere and modifying an existing line can have some strange results.The game looks fantastic. I particularly recommend downloading one of the first-person mods and taking a walk around your city. It really it fantastic to see some of the vistas from ground level.This is an outstanding city builder with some very, very minor flaws that I expect will be fixed or modded around.			"

												I sort of realised that I don't like city building games AFTER I bought this game, so I screwed around for a while. From what I've seen, a lot of effort has been put into the game. You have to connect water pipes so your city's citizens get water, you have to set up power plants, and there are some great end game goals. If you like city building games, I reccomend you get this game. If you don't, get it during a sale, just so you can create the worst city ever.			"

												On release day, I started playing when I got off work and before I realized it, it was midnight and I hadn't eaten dinner. I was so physically weak from lack of food I could barely get out of my chair. 10/10 would be malnourished again.The game plays and feels like the city builders of the late '90s and early 2000s. As far as I've been able to tell, the city building genre died after SimCity 4. I've tried playing the XL series, SimCity Societies and 2013, and at best they feel dead and soulless; at worst they're broken, boring and a waste of time and money. This one feels fresh while relying on the classic mechanics, and ends up being the most fun I've had playing a city game since 2003. This is the game I've wanted for over a decade but haven't been able to find.			"

												This is the game I wanted SimCity 4 to be.  It has tons of flexibility with the transport network, and it's easy to build curved roads, elevated railways, and so on.  It's very easy to build any type of city - well-planned, organic, chaotic.  Fill it with smokestacks or Japanese Gardens!The game uses tile-based zoning for R/C/I.  It also has a ""districting"" feature that helps name neighbourhoods and set special rules for different parts of town, which is a nice touch.Zonable land is indicated next to access streets, and since it still has to be broken into squares for the game engine, it gets a bit wonky on hills, curves, and acute intersections.City infrastructure buildings are oddly sized compared to the 8x8 street grid size.  I can understand a University or Garbage Dump being gigantic, but something like a high school or hospital should be more reasonable.			"

Even graphically it is quite impressive. Pick it up, definetly worth it.			"

												It's a smashing game, it really is. You expect a certain level of frustration with games like this not behaving how you want them to, but Cities: Skylines seems virtually frustration-free, which is a splendid achievement.If there's a criticism to be had it's that it's a bit too easy - I find it quite hard to fail in any way and I doubt it's because I'm just great at it. As others have said it might benefit from disasters being added, both in the earthquake sense and economic crashes and the like. But, overall, a tremendous game.			"

												Cities: Skylines is, in lack of a better description, a super Sim City. Even in the game's community the inhabitants are referred to as ""cims"" (instead of ""sims"").When creating and growing cities, at first the challenge is about budgeting but soon the biggest challenge is about functionality - whether creating new neighbourhoods intelligently or micro-managing the ones that already exist. The ammount of micro-managing, especially traffic, is inversely proportional to the thought you put into creating new neighbourhoods.The game fools you into thinking ""hey, this is easy, i keep an eye on demands and create what they need and the city grows"" but then, when you notice, you have sick citizens because of pollution, burned down buildings because the fireman can't reach the fires, traffic jams that don't allow people to go to work or, even if they do, don't allow cargo trucks to keep the economy working, etc.One thing is for sure, after some hours playing this game, you will think about your own town's city planning whenever you go out and drive.

I think that what the developers have tried to pull off in the whole of the game is amazing. Even though I have suffered from some lag and graphics difficulties, many due to my MacBook Pro's performance issues. I have found this game highly addictive and very entertaining.I highly recommend this game to any city simulation gaming fans, or just anyone who simply want to have a try at this type of game. Very easy to pick up and play and very easy and fun to play and very much enjoy. 9/10 (My score)			"

												I love this game, it's already getting great mods. (very quickly)I had very high expectations for this game and it's completely exceeded them. It's not just better then simcity 2014, it's the best city builder to date period.You can build huge sprawling cities, and suburbs, and small towns, with districts and the transportation system, all on one map. Fantastic.I would love to see some expansion packs come out soon, disasters would be nice that way we can play around with emergency services more. With their really actually remarkable water simulator, they could go further and make hurricanes with storm surges. That with tornadoes, forest fires, earthquakes and epidemics would add a really interesting dynamic to the game.As many have pointed out, variety in the buildings is another priority, but with moding that is starting to get solved by the extremely active community.Overall, one of the best games on steam, if you haven't bought it yet, i strongly reccomend you do so now. It is worth every penny and then some. I bought the Deluxe edition for no other reason then to support this company more, i can see myself spending many more dozens of hours building and tinkering with my cities.			"

												IN SHORT: The game is great, no glitches (that I've ran into or noticed), mod community is amazing, and the simulation is perfect. This is what SimCity (2013) should've been. If you were disappointed (like myself) about SimCity (2013), you should give this game a try. I've played it about 12 hours since buying it 4 days ago, and it's addicting. Good game!FULL REVIEW: I've been into city simulation games since SimCity 4, and when EA announced SimCity (2013) I was extremely excited. It looked amazing. However, upon getting the game it was a huge waste. Random disasters was annoying so I ended up playing sandbox all the time. Offline mode didn't come for months. The city sizes were small, everything was just terrible! I ended up playing at least 7 hours before I was done.Few years later, I'm checking Keralis' channel when I see his Cities: Skylines series. I'm like, ""looks like another SimCity, no thanks."" Watching a few episodes, I find myself EXTREMELY impressed. This is what SimCity should've been. Exactly.After checking this game through, I ended up buying it, for HALF the price of what SimCity costed, this seemed worth it.12.5 hours of gameplay later, I'm still enjoying this game. At first, it seems like you have as much space as in SimCity... THEN you unlock more areas, and it gets bigger and bigger. My city is at least 3x the size of a SimCity city. I was also impressed with the graphics. I'm running a pretty terrible computer right now, and using medium graphics works well. Plus I liked being able to change the keybinds, something you couldn't do in SimCity.Oh, did I mention highways? Yep, that is what sold me. The amount of customization in this game is incredible. Ramps up, elevated highway across the city, curved ramp along the shoreline, pretty much everything is possible with the road controls.Only things I did not like was the one way street direction controls, which was easily fixed with a mod; the cars' pathfinding, which I've somewhat understood, just hate how they don't use multiple lanes when going the same direction; and curving roads can get a bit difficult, especially in tight spaces where the road is trying to snap to other objects. Otherwise, everything else is good.I HIGHLY recommend this game, many hours of fun for me and many hours to come! Can't wait to see what I can do next.			"

												I have been playing Sim games since Sim City 1.  I can finally stop buying City builder games!!!!  This is the best I have ever seen.  If I went into all that this game has to offer this would turn into a novel.  The top highlights I have seen so far is as follows:The road layout - there are no limitations.  Pull road where and how you want to.  From small roads to super highways plus mods you can layout your city with no limitations.Districts - What a unique idea. You can test policies on small areas and specialize your areas.Buildings - You have everything you need for services.The graphics  - Zoom into your city!  The most detailed incredible view of a city I have ever seen. Zoom out to see it all.No limitation on spreading out.  Normally with city builders you’re locked into a small square to build in.  No more.  You add new land to build one huge vast city.These are just some of the highlights.  If you like city builders BUY THIS.  This will be last city builder you will have to buy. "

A modern city builder that will suck your time if you're into that sort of thing.You start with a road, this connects everything in your city. You then zone the sides of this road to allow people and businesses to move in. They need power and water like any modern city, and then they can grow. Of course, then you need education, policing, fire coverage, rubbish collection, healthcare... and this is before you expand beyond your starter tile, unless you want some interesting times which is also good.You can tweak your taxes and expenditure, have different taxation between different districts of your city and ban lorries from going through your residential area. Or just ban pets if you despise cuddly things.Create new land, flood that new land and bulldoze houses of residents who backtalk you on Chirper while flooding their new house if they won't leave.As long as you enjoy games about creation and don't mind a slow pace of things at times(or ridiculously fast when you suddenly run out of poo capacity), I honestly think as long as you meet the minimum requirements you will have a good experience with this product. Colossal Order have done a massive credit to the genre with this title, and gave it humanity again.			"

												""Everything Sim City should have been"" AND MORE!Not only was it perfectly playable on launch day and I have so far only encountered couple of minor glichtes, it sucks you right in. Pros:-lovely art style, good mix of real and toy-like aesthetics -runs very smooth, even with bigger cities-very high attention to detail(e.g. ambulances actually carry sick people out of building, vehicles use turning signals, office workers leave the offices to go for a smoke and many many more) you can spend hours watching your citizen -music and ambient sounds fit perfectly-districts and district specific policiesCons:-personally I feel money is too easy to come by-roads sometimes try to snap really weird-no overview of all public transport lines and no easy way to delete them-some plots look too small, especially for agricultural and forestry industry-you might be sucked in for hours before you realize itConclusion:Considering this game was made by only 13 people and the low release price this game is a must buy for every fan of city builders or similar genres.

												Like others have said, it's everything SimCity 2013 should have been.  It's much more in-depth than SimCity, more control over finances, more control over layout, and bigger maps.  The only thing that SimCity did better was road plopping.  For some reason, plopping roads in Cities is frustrating when trying to get things just right.  I'm OCD about my roads.  All in all, 9.5/10.  Can't wait to see what they do with DLCs and add ons.			"

												this game is very good but extreamly hard and has alot of bugs and AI mistakes, the only way ive been able to play the game normaly is thru modifying the game, and now when i cant see or use my mods its totaly impossible, there is no turtorial only slightly helpful advise, the startup money youre given is too small and one slip/up is a slow and painful gameover, i dont recomend this game to people who want to play it vanilla but i do recomend it to people who want to modify it, but youre installed mods might go invisible and cannot be used anymore :(			"

												Excellent game with a lot of mods and a very strong community. The game itself is very good for being recently released and is constantly getting updates. Here are my ratings:Graphics: 7.5/10 (It is OK but not the best... some mods can make it better)Content: 9.5/10 (Mods make it excellent)Realism: 9.5/10 (Traffic simulation could be better, ie the lane usage)Replayability: 10/10Performance: 6/10 (Extreme lag on cities ≥250,000)Overall, if the performance would be fixed then i would find myself playing the game more. However, I'm capped at playing with a population ≤100,000 people because of performance related issues. Regardless of the performance setting I would choose, the game would fail to surpass 15FPS which deems it unplayable, and I am playing this on a Core i7 2.3Ghz Nvidia GT650M 8GB DDR3 RAM... not impressed.

												This game is quite fun if you enjoy micro-managing everything. I personally do not so I didn't get much more than a few hours of entertainment. Without mods, the game can get kind of annoying in the later game stages where there is a lot of burned down buildings and abandoned bulding that pile up. Personally I felt that the world creator tools were clunky and hard to use. It wasn't easy to control them when scaling height for terrain.All around though it had some nice features and customization. However, I personally did not enjoy it all that much			"

												I have never played a city builder as good as this one.+ Plenty of road options and things a city needs (fire stations, police stations, etc)+ Workshop support which contains so much (amazing) user-made content+ Each citizen and building has it's own name+ Citizens have little animations, like sitting and playing on a tablet or roaming on a skateboard+ Basically includes Cities In Motion, meaning you control public transport+ Make your own maps and assets, and share them+ Traffic management, even if it is overwhelming and hard for me, it's still fun trying to find methods to organise it+ Creativity within the building of the city and the way you build it+ You can walk around as a citizen/car and look at your beautiful city+ It looks stunningOne negative about this beautiful and absurdly amazing game:- I've found the community is a little hostile at times and if you have had a problem with the game, Reddit is probably the best place to search for an answer.How dare you be so perfect.

												Its been very long since I've been so fond of a game. While vanilla has its flaws (lack of one way road directional arrows unless you zoom in on a junction, a rather stupid traffic AI, the lack of geometrical data when editing) these can all be fixed with some great mods from the community. Some of the assets in the workshop are just stunning, and fun, for me at the moment, seems endless.The DLC-s add a fair bit of content, but the game is great fun without them, in vanilla or with mods.There are probably a lot of features I have yet to get into deeply, so I won't go in to more detail for now. Will update when my hours have increased.			"

Wrong, what I didn't realize it would clog the river, causing polluted water to go upstream and into my water plants, next thing I knew, everyone was dying, it was horrible, buildings everywhere were being abandoned, I was bankrupt, loans werent avaiable anymore, fires were breaking out and no firemen to operate the stations, criminals were breaking into everywhere and no police to stop them. It was the Water Pollution Disaster of Year 2024. Over 10,000 people died.Other than my story of my first city being destroyed, this game is fun, definitely a time killer and worth buying.			"

												This is exactly what the sequel to SimCity 4 should have been. Hopefully EA takes notice that SimCity failed not because the city-building genre can't work. It's because of extremely poor design choices (small city sizes, needing an always-on connection, forcing multiplayer and DLC) that came from the top-down.My only complaint is that the game needs mixed-use zoning (retail/office, retail/residential) to be able to plan and build more realistic, dense, urban cities. Until then, this is mostly just a suburb simulator.Also, maybe adding a political element, like in Tropico. Real cities have elections.			"

												This is by far the best current city builder. I bought it shortly after it came out because I had been eyeing Sim City (the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2010(?) release) but didn't like the cut of its jib. I can say this is incredibly fun and satisfying, with active and helpful devs. There are a few minor annoyances, like the AI seems to have stupid pathing on highways (sitting in the middle lane until merging at the last second to get off their exit is a particularly annoying bit). However, this could be due to my faulty city design. The building is great, being able to switch from ""snap"" mode (great at making hard angles or straight roads) to ""fluid"" mode, where you can build free-form. Also, building styles are varied enough that your city looks diverse, yet not too diverse that it seems out of place. Overall, this is very fun for the casual city builder or hardcore one. 10/10, highly recommend.			"

												If you liked Sim City 4 then this is the game for you. SimCity was a let down for me, small city and very little room to expand in the game. This is the best city sim I have played in a long time. You can expand your city as your population There are still a few problems that I find like how they all seem to use 1 lane even though other lanes are free to use.

												I have found this game to be very well made, fun to play, engrossing and supported wonderfully by a great community.  As you build your understanding of the mechanics, it becomes more and more interesting.  The developers created a great balance in this game.  Some systems are handled simplistically to speed things along and others require a bit of management.  To build a functioning, growing city takes thought and consideration of a variety of systems issues. To make it also beautiful requires another level of thought, but develops a love and satisfaction within us.  The expandability with the workshop addons and mods from the community along with the asset and map builders make this game something that can be played in many many ways.  I love it.			"

												I followed a donut truck owned by a fashion company delivering to a drugstore for 5 minutes. It never managed to deliver.On an actually serious note this game is AMAZING. All the good things about Sim City without the monstrosity that is the newest of the titles. Traffic is a serious issue at all times, one that can actually be managed, and there is less focus on city specialization, although it does exist. The world size is 25 tiles, each one about the same size as a new Sim City city, up to 9 of which can be owned without mods. Speaking of mods, mod support is VERY good and seamlessly done, unlike another title which i refuse to name once more, in case it flies out of the nearest mirror in an attempt to end my life. If you don't like traffic management I DO NOT recommend this game.			"

												After the Cities XXL fiasco last month, I had little to no hope that a decent city builder would ever be able to come through. Cities: Skylines proved me wrong. This game is amazing. When you are building your city you have so much to think about to make your city run the best it can. Below are some of my pros and cons for the game.Pros:-Amazing water physiscs (build a dam in a bad place and it floods your city)-Huge map, grows with you (you start the game with a 2 by 2 km sqaure, similar to that of Sim City, as you reach milestones you are able to expand and purchase more squares, up to a total of 9 squares without the mod and with the mod you can purchase up to all 25 squares)-active environment (lots of cars and people moving about)-customization (you can zone off districts, name them, have special policies in each district, and you can even rename vehicles, homes, and people!)-asset editor and map editor (its fun to make your own intersections, buildings, maps, parks, etc.)-powerlines and water pipes(you have to connect power and water to your buildings, makes the city builder 10 times better)Cons:-the snapping of roads gets a little funky sometimes (really hard to make a highway on highway interchange)-the overlay with natural resources cant be opened at the same time as district zoning (if you want to designate a district to be farming, you have to guess where the fertile land natural resource is)-only a one lane off ramp, a one and two lane off ramp would be cool to add more realism-you can't change one way streets to two way streets without deleting them (if i build a curvey neighborhood with a one way street and later decide i want to make it a two way street, i have to demo the whole street and attempt to rebuild, which is almost impossible to repeat the same exact curves used)-I'm having a few bugs with loading in workshop items/maps, but I think they are working on it now (will edit when fixed)Either way don't let those cons stop you, they are little things and I'm sure they will be fixed one way or another. This game is absolutely awesome and I would recommend to anyone, especially with the price of only $29.99. "

												Really well made not just city builder but city management aswell UNLIKE Simcity gamesPros:-1) each person has their home and workplace ( unlike simcity)2) each person has their own specific vehicle3) Houses upgrades4) traffic/peds isnt decoration, it has aim and origin(unlike cities XXL)5) Water Physics, REAL WATER!!! not just a simple texture( remove land near water and it will flow in that hole etc etc etc REALLY COOL!! [unlike any city builder TILL NOW)6) BEAUTIFUL ( like simcity )7) 10 secs loading times8) MODS MODS MODS MODS!!!!!!!Cons:-1) 50 fps2) constant updates causes mod imcompatibiltyneutral:-Dlc packs( assets etc )i know most of poeple are against textures being soldbut i on the other hand take them as a support towards the developer and i take the textures just a donation return gift ( if that even is a real word) 9.5/10 4 for depth2 for graphics2 for extensive modding support2 for actually great forum and support staffbut wait that makes 100.5 is deducted becuase devs dont care about toxicity in the forumsnow i am not saying every hater is a troll or toxic but there are SOME( very less in CS discussion but there ARE ) who just likes to♥♥♥♥♥♥on itwhen it will be confirmed that all toxic morons are banned , i will change it to 10/10EDIT:-I havent seen a toxic player in a whileso 10/10			"

												This game is beyond awesome.. beats the new Sim City by a long shot, and in many ways is better than Sim City 4.  I do wish there was some kind of ""region"" like SC4 or that there were many more playable tiles (even larger than the 25tile mod).The most recent update made the game even better with tunnels and European buildings. :)			"

												Fabulous Game!It may seem boring, Building a city. But it is seriously addicitive, Your constantly trying to figure out what you could do to make your city better. The game makes you feel like you want to plan your city out on a piece of paper before you start. I would highly recommend this game, I cant stop playing it!! Tips: 1. Dont put too many junctions in the roads, later in the game it will cause major traffic problem. Major traffic problems means that your residents will struggle with Garbage and Fires as vehicels cant get to them fast enough. 2. Dont build too quickly, I started games off where I built quite a large city with the start off money and ended up in debt. 3. Make sure your constantly saving you game, You can get a Mod from the Workshop that will make your game save every 10 mins or so. Cons: If you play on MAC (like i do) you encounter some graphical issues, hopefully they will get a patch out ASAP.			"

												This game is really a much much better SimCity then SimCity itself. I think the whole genre should be renamed after this game.My wishes for the future:More maps out of the box coming with the gameUnique landmark buildings like a special historical residence that actually works as a residence. They should add a whole lot of variety to your citiesMore focus on the economy and production side of the game. You have a great working city simulator why not extend its capabilities to also include economic simulation in a more detailed fashion.My first complaint about the current state of the game would be monuments. They are way too powerfull ! A building that removes need for any ecucational facility ? I do not agree with that. Instead it should be something that increases the efficiency of the current facilities.My last complaint is about terrain height handling. As with all similar games this one also cannot really handle height differences gracefully. Still this is by far the best game of its kind.			"

												Throughout my child hood, I was a fan of sim city, sadly, the series gradually declined in quality over the years. But I feel that Cities: Skylines recaptures what made the old games good while still maintaining a unique identity. But be warned, while the game has a definite flow, there are some difficulty spikes native to a more advanced city sim such as proper planning for very large amounts of traffic and so on.			"

Cities Skylines lets you have the freedom to do anything you want and you can play without any boundries. Cities skylines gives you a huge space to build and a fertile/ strong tax system that you depend on. One of the best things about Cities Skylines is that it is on steam and can be easily downloadable and you can download add-ons and mods! I rank Cities Skylines a full 5 stars because of thier acomplishment of this wonderful game. Thank you so much Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order.

												I am very, very picky about my city builder games. City builders and strategy games (such as Civ 5) are neck and neck for my favorite genre and have the most playtime by far than any other type of game. Also, it is exceedingly rare that I rate anything 10/10. I am one of those people who will rate something 9/10. You really have to blow me away to get a 10/10 out of me. That being said, I am giving this game 10/10.It is the best city builder ever created, hands down and I have been playing them since Sim City 2000 came out. This blows Sim City 5 completely out of the water and is obviously targeted to do so (the price point, mod-ability, and city size). Playing the game or reading the other positive reviews will tell you why that is the case, so I won't get into the gritty details.			"

												This game is probably one of the greatest City builders I've ever played. The simulation of each cim in the game is very detailed, the way traffic flows almost mimics real life, and above all the simple and effective UI lets you diagnose any problem you may have. It's not hard to get into and fully understand but takes time to effectively understand the more advanced aspects of the game.Pros:The UI is very well doneThe simulation of many aspects of the game are almost lifelikeFull support of mods and easy to access them in gameMap editor and asset creator are fun to play around withCons: Traffic is a hassle if you don't understand how to set up connections correctlyTraffic will make it so when you look at any intersection you ever see again, it'll trigger a mental breakdownStill some bugs that are planned to be fixed (some mods may be bugged as well)10/10 Would stress over it again			"

												This is the game that SimCity 5 was supposed to be. Personally I enjoy designing intersections - I never really understood the whole ""never turn left"" thing before I saw how it affected things in the game.I don't like the way that public transport lines are implemented - it is hard to seperate out lines from one another if they overlap anywhere and modifying an existing line can have some strange results.The game looks fantastic. I particularly recommend downloading one of the first-person mods and taking a walk around your city. It really it fantastic to see some of the vistas from ground level.This is an outstanding city builder with some very, very minor flaws that I expect will be fixed or modded around.			"

												IN SHORT: The game is great, no glitches (that I've ran into or noticed), mod community is amazing, and the simulation is perfect. This is what SimCity (2013) should've been. If you were disappointed (like myself) about SimCity (2013), you should give this game a try. I've played it about 12 hours since buying it 4 days ago, and it's addicting. Good game!FULL REVIEW: I've been into city simulation games since SimCity 4, and when EA announced SimCity (2013) I was extremely excited. It looked amazing. However, upon getting the game it was a huge waste. Random disasters was annoying so I ended up playing sandbox all the time. Offline mode didn't come for months. The city sizes were small, everything was just terrible! I ended up playing at least 7 hours before I was done.Few years later, I'm checking Keralis' channel when I see his Cities: Skylines series. I'm like, ""looks like another SimCity, no thanks."" Watching a few episodes, I find myself EXTREMELY impressed. This is what SimCity should've been. Exactly.After checking this game through, I ended up buying it, for HALF the price of what SimCity costed, this seemed worth it.12.5 hours of gameplay later, I'm still enjoying this game. At first, it seems like you have as much space as in SimCity... THEN you unlock more areas, and it gets bigger and bigger. My city is at least 3x the size of a SimCity city. I was also impressed with the graphics. I'm running a pretty terrible computer right now, and using medium graphics works well. Plus I liked being able to change the keybinds, something you couldn't do in SimCity.Oh, did I mention highways? Yep, that is what sold me. The amount of customization in this game is incredible. Ramps up, elevated highway across the city, curved ramp along the shoreline, pretty much everything is possible with the road controls.Only things I did not like was the one way street direction controls, which was easily fixed with a mod; the cars' pathfinding, which I've somewhat understood, just hate how they don't use multiple lanes when going the same direction; and curving roads can get a bit difficult, especially in tight spaces where the road is trying to snap to other objects. Otherwise, everything else is good.I HIGHLY recommend this game, many hours of fun for me and many hours to come! Can't wait to see what I can do next.			"

												TLDR: The SIMulator of a CITY that won't let you down. Don't let the ""Cities"" name fool you. This game is indeed another in the Paradox Interactive ""Cities"" franchise, but it has none of the problems those game had ( poor performance, memory leaks, mediocre graphics sometimes, lots of paid dlc, a game re-release every year).This game, by the folks of Colossal Order is the city simulator you waited for since SimCity 2000.Running on Unity Engine, this game totally delivers a good experience and will sink you a few hundreds of hours, in the pursue of the most-efficient-city.As for the size, your cities will be huge. You start with a 2x2km tile, and by reaching population milestones you'll get the chance to purchase  up more until you have 9 total.Why 9? Because most computers will be able to simulate 9 of them .want more than 9? You can unlock the full map (5x5 tiles = 25 tiles) with SteamWorkshop mods since DAY ONE.+ Solid Gameplay+ Runs smoothly+ Graphically sound.+ Ingame content generation (can import heightmaps to create real world maps!)+ Steam Workshop support+ Modding capability+ The UI is really competent - It didn't come out sooner			"

												I've been waiting on what SimCity promised but couldn't deliver. This is it. A few things are broken, buildings start abandoning for no reason above a certain population level which makes for a clicking chore where you have to clean up all the greyed out buildings around the map. But the map size is huge which is what made me fall in love with SimCity 2k. Doesn't have as much micromanagement as SimCity but maybe that's a good thing. The traffic congestion can also be a bit tedious to manage but thats to be expected from a game company that produced a traffic management sim (cities in motion) as their last game. All in all it's a great game and depending on what it is I might pick up DLC in the future.			"

Being a loyal decades-long fan of the SimCity franchise (first I've seen it as a SNES game) - Cities Skylines is what we passioned city builders always dreamed of.Detailed, entertaining, making sense - it just all works well and nicely. It is well balanced (i.e. a short water or power don't screw up your rep entierly), makes fun and is really detailed. You can control anything. And stuff like item distribution, resource allocation and traffic - it all makes sense. And if you see a problem and you correct the source, the problem actually goes away!

												Absolutely amazing game.Did you enjoy SimCity but always wished there was more depth to the game?Cities:Skylines brings every fan's SimCity wants into one game.  If EA actually listened to its community it might have a game half this good.You can play this game so many times (even on the same map) and develop your city however you feel.  Feel like a railroad city? Try and make it work. Want to be the center of commerece? try and make it work.  Want to have a city without stoplights?  Try and make it work.  Everything about a city planning sim you could ever want.			"

The base simulation and game polish is very solid, but with easy and well integrated mod support, the game is nothing short of phenomenal.And it's only 30 bucks. And was made by 13 people.

												I am very, very picky about my city builder games. City builders and strategy games (such as Civ 5) are neck and neck for my favorite genre and have the most playtime by far than any other type of game. Also, it is exceedingly rare that I rate anything 10/10. I am one of those people who will rate something 9/10. You really have to blow me away to get a 10/10 out of me. That being said, I am giving this game 10/10.It is the best city builder ever created, hands down and I have been playing them since Sim City 2000 came out. This blows Sim City 5 completely out of the water and is obviously targeted to do so (the price point, mod-ability, and city size). Playing the game or reading the other positive reviews will tell you why that is the case, so I won't get into the gritty details.			"

												This game is probably one of the greatest City builders I've ever played. The simulation of each cim in the game is very detailed, the way traffic flows almost mimics real life, and above all the simple and effective UI lets you diagnose any problem you may have. It's not hard to get into and fully understand but takes time to effectively understand the more advanced aspects of the game.Pros:The UI is very well doneThe simulation of many aspects of the game are almost lifelikeFull support of mods and easy to access them in gameMap editor and asset creator are fun to play around withCons: Traffic is a hassle if you don't understand how to set up connections correctlyTraffic will make it so when you look at any intersection you ever see again, it'll trigger a mental breakdownStill some bugs that are planned to be fixed (some mods may be bugged as well)10/10 Would stress over it again			"

												A very promising city builder. A good game, just like the games Paradox always release :)Good points :- All that everybody says : quite big map, avoidance of Sim CIty and Cities XL mistakes- The traffic management is great, i sometimes spend lots of time just wtching people go arround and optimising stuff- The water physics is great, careful with that :)- Graphics are nice and clear, and even if the game is not as detailed as the last Simcity, this may not be a choice for a big map.- haven't seen a bug after almost 20 hours playingReally nice to play right now, this game still has a few points that may be improved, but I know we can count on Paradox and Cities Skyline teams to make this game even better over time.For now the points that should be improved :- Deleting destroyed buildings manually can be boring in a big city as you have to destroy like 10 buildings all arround the city. A mod prevents this from happening, and allows me to just sit and watch my city without having to pause every 3 minutes to clean up arround :) I know a well organised city has less destructions, but when you reach 50000 hab, it's a lot of work to delete everything^^- The roads. It's great already, but a certain game (that you, Paraddox, should know well :p) named cities in motion 2 goes a little bit further in terms of flexibility. This first thing that would prevent us from destroying all a fully evolved neighborood, would bhe to be able to upgrade a two ways road in a one way road. This would be really great, since it is one of the most frustrating points. The other would be to personnalise the number of ways on a road. For example, if you want a one way road, you can have the small one way road (2 ways) or the one way big road (6 ways). All highways have 3 ways and entrance 1 way (or 3 ways if using a highway). Why not being able to have two ways entrance or a 4 ways highway ?About the roads, I know that since the AI transport algorithms must be really complex (and they are, actually, the best of all city builders) and may be limitating the possible choices.Anyway, I look forward for update and extentions for this game !And if you're looking for a city builder, don't hesitate, this is probably the best one now, and this is made with love by Paradox <3Good luck to the amazing dev team :)			"

No IAP, No  forced cooperation / socialization or external log-ins, No manipulative behaviour meant to induce you to keep playing, and an awesome collection of mod items that enhance the feel, such as an FP camera (ride along with your citizens!), Day/night cycle, and tons of user made aesthetic items.

												Worth every penny and every GB of RAM on your computer, although I don't like how this game after getting Natural Disasters crashes and gives me the blue screen of death occasionally to this day (yes I reinstalled it, disabled all mods and assets, and make sure my drivers were up to date, I even reset my whole computer) yet it's still crashing, which is why I don't 100% agree with the engine they used to make this game. Although it looks beautiful and extremely realistic, it comes at the cost of lag and lots of crashes (especially if you have a mod and asset addiction like me) unless if you have an extremely good graphics card (I have a Nvidia 750 GTX TI and average 50-80 without mods and max graphics and 24 GB of RAM and with 1257 mods and assets it consumes 21 GB, but has a common chance of not being able to load at all and just crash). All in all, if you have a decent computer and a lot of time to spend, you really should get this game.			"

												When I first saw screenshots of the game, I thought: wow, it looks really nice, but will it be any good?The answer became clear to me when I watched youtube videos of it and read other steam reviews. And that answer is yes. I bought the game, and immediately fell in love with it. It truly is the best city builder game since Sim City 4. $30 is a really good price for this game.Here are some pros and cons:Pros: + Easy to learn         + Amazing water physics never before seen in a city builder game         + Make your own maps with ease         + Easy to download and use player created content         + Every single person in your city has their own lives, families, cars, houses, etc.         + You can click on anybody in your city to see where they live, where they work, where they are currently going, and what they are doing, and also follow them around to see what they do.         + Realistic sewege system (watch your sewege pipes pour poo water into the rivers/ponds/oceans, and watch it spread around in the water)          + Realistic traffic system (cars drive way more realistic than in sim city, and they don't disappear when they get to their destination, they park and the owner gets out)         + You can rename any building, person, or animal in your city, and also rename your districts.         + You can make districts         + You can build water pipes and power lines like in the good old sim city games         + Detail everywhere (See ambulances go to houses and pick up patients with a stretcher, hearses picking up dead bodies, garbage trucks picking up garbage, delivery trucks taking goods to shops, etc)         + Beautiful graphics         + Runs really smooth, even with everything set to Ultra with my Gtx 560 ti 2gb, I get 40+ fps in huge cities, and 60+ fps in small cities.         + You can import real locations into the game by importing heightmaps you can download on terrain party, and use them in-game to build cities on.        + I still haven't noticed any bugs in the game        + Detailed transportation system (make bus routes, train routes, metro routes, etc.)        + Lots of different road types to choose from, and lots of things you can do with them.         And now for the cons, most of them can be fixed by downloading mods from the workshop though.          Cons: - No day/night cycle (there's a mod to fix that)                   - No weather system or seasons                   - Abandoned buildings can get annoying (But you can prevent abandoned buildings if you are a very skilled city builder, or download the mod that auto-destroys them) And that is all. Yes, that is seriously the only problems I have with this game, otherwise it is the perfect city builder.                                                               9.7 out of 10			"

												Cities Skylines is a neat little city-builder that starts great but is sadly lacking an ""end game"". The graphics are cute and the mechanics mostly work. The lack of diversity in buildings or vehicles in your city can easily be fixed by downloading the hundreds of quality mods existing. The only downside to the game is that once you've understood the formula and reached a decent-sized city, there isn't much driving you forward to go bigger and better, and not much new to unlock. Hopefully they'll fix this in an upcoming patch or expansion.			"

												A city building game that gets everything right. The only problem I have playing is whenever i get the hydro dam unlocked it talks me an hour before i can spot playing with the water and actually play the game. The company should really think about making a seperate game or mini game add on thats just playing with the water.			"

												I was curious how this game compares to older SimCity titles - especially Simcity 4 and 3000, which i played a lot. In term of game mechanics it is very similiar though I think it is superior to Maxis productions. After spending few hours ""ingame"" I think its far more worthy successor than Simcity5 and I would deffinitle recomend Cities: Skylines to anyone. I was impressed how city becomes more difficult to be governed during longer game - feels natural as more citizens mean far more problems.Pros: quite simple mechanics for begginers though... the game gets way more difficult as the city grows :) all the traffic and municipal problems seem very natural great workshop items and mods.Cons: none!

												Once you have started playing this game, time will move in light speed, and suddenly it is another day.The city is so beautiful. Browsing it with different views make me feel like travelling to another city in real world.But some drawbacks:- No tutorial at all. It only has some help boxes. Youtube videos are way better than that.- Without unlimited money, it is a bit tough when starting a new game, mainly due to the lack of loan for the first level.- The minimum requirement is a lie. Even the 6GB Ram in recommended requirement is questionable. I have installed some assets and the game has already used up all of my 8GB Ram.- DLCssssssss. I understand they need money. But I'm really not a fan of this approach.			"

												I don't know how they did it but it's incredible, it FEELS like a real city with real people populating the city who need real jobs and real places to go shopping.There are some caveats, roads and planning is hard when you get really big scale. There's a reason there's a science behind city planning and as someone who hasn't been educated in that subject I feel like I might benefit from it from this game.It's really easy to make a town (and very fun) but it's super hard to make a city that doesn't implode.This is not just a successor to Sim City, it's going beyond that.

												This game is quite fun if you enjoy micro-managing everything. I personally do not so I didn't get much more than a few hours of entertainment. Without mods, the game can get kind of annoying in the later game stages where there is a lot of burned down buildings and abandoned bulding that pile up. Personally I felt that the world creator tools were clunky and hard to use. It wasn't easy to control them when scaling height for terrain.All around though it had some nice features and customization. However, I personally did not enjoy it all that much			"

												The best city builder in years!  With the most recent Sim City being a giant flop, and Cities XXL feeling very much like a repeat of Cities XL, I'm glad Cities Skylines came about.  The cities can be absolutely massive, the level of detail is very exciting, and there are many features new to city builders!  They could use a few more industry specializations  (Having oil, mineral, farming and forestry already) including perhaps some which we saw in the failed Sim City (Gambling for example), and improved tourism, but its a massive hit so far.  There are always ways to expand though and the fact this game offers so many ways to mod it (for both relatively weak custom content creators like myself, and pros) and that the unique content can be easily shared through steam workshops makes it never ending fun.

												Cities: Skylines is the best city building game that I have played to date. Unlike any other that I have seen, the focus of Skylines is not on fine budget management, or clever zoning, but on traffic management. After your city gets on its feet and people start pouring in, you will spend the rest of the game designing elegant solutions to the gridlock that will plague your city- and slapdash fixes when that doesn't work. Money is rarely a problem, unless you screw up something major and leave everyone without power, or water, or over-educate all your cities and run out of workers, but this rarely happens. Every single citizen in your city has a home, and a job, and they need to be able to get from one to the other easily- no mean feat. When imports and exports are thrown into the mix, snarling traffic jams and clogged up roads  further than the eye can see are inevitable.TL;DR This is one of my favourite games, it's definitely worth the full price of 30USD and is good for endless fun. I'm definitely putting a lot more hours into it.			"

												It's the new simcity, or at least it should be as it's so much better than the actual simcity game that came out at 2013Hours sink in to this game like no other. Though I'd suggest you get a few mods from the workshop. Oh and traffic will be your demise and the biggest challenge. I've had to restart a several times since the cities I've made died when I reached a higher population due to traffic issues.Overall it's a really fun game and if you're in to building cities/towns and such, this is definetly worth a try!For the best experience go download some simcity soundtracks like 2000, 4 and such, put the games audio on zero and jam to some memories gone by~ (The games songs are cool as well, but nothing beats nostalgia)			"

												Cities Skylines has got me to the next level with City Buliding after playing Simcity for almost 1 year. The game provides so many cool features like in the upcoming dlc, Night Life or whatever it name is.  What ever you want can be made in the Asset Editor, for example you wanted to make a bus with 25 tractor cars behind it. Modding is A+, you can get so many mods from Steam Workshop, In my own opinion, without mods the game is really bland and feel unrealistic. But when you start geting mods like Intercity 125 (HST), ICE 3, Bulidings, Buses and a lot more I could list but I won't for the sake of this review as it's getting longer. Overall Cities: Skylines is a Outstanding A+ from me.			"

And the amount of mods, oh my god, theres thousands of mods, thousands of maps and assets, if you need extra stuff, there is probably already a mod for that. all in all, get this game, its worth every penny, its worth more than that, id buy this game as a 60 euro release, its worth that much in my opinion.

												This game is currently the best city builder around.  If you have ever enjoyed a SimCity game, then I would highly recommend picking this up.  It's insanely moddable, and the maps are huge, especially if you mod out the default size limit.  Just a word of warning though -- if your computer is very old or underpowered, you may have trouble coping with a city with over 100,000 residents, especially if your game is heavily modded.  My computer just about hits the recommended settings, so it struggles a bit with my 130,000 population city if I run any other program at all in the background.As with any city builder, there isn't much to do once you unlock all of the buildings and do most of what you set out to do, but it's extremely addicting to keep growing your city and managing the inevitable problems that a massive city comes with.EDIT: I have a new rig and this game runs very, very smoothly now, 100+ FPS.  It's apparently very processor-intensive, so keep that in mind if you have a very old processor.  My old computer had a 2.93 GHz quad core i-7, and it could just about handle it.  If you have something beefier than that and a decent GPU, you should have no problem.  Anything less and you might run into trouble.			"

The gameplay is amazing and even if you are not good with economics the inbuilt features allow you to get better with finance or other things such as that.Graphical:Graphics wise the game is not too intensive running on a Nvidia GTX 750 Ti 2gb I get normally a solid 80fps give or take if my PC has been on a while and is hot, but the graphics are good for the game, the physics are also outstanding adding much realism to disasters like floods and other fun things.Overall:The game is amazing, all in all it's a 9.5/10 from me due to it's lack of multiplayer Gaben pls ;-;			"

												So freakin' addictive. It's like the days of Simcity 3 all over again.Building plans and road layouts have to make sense, traffic is very realistic and will build up and drive to and from destinations. Have to create special roadways for heavy cargo to make traffic flow like a beating heart. I've never been a mayor but how you play this game, really makes sense in how you would actually run a village/town/city in real life. 50% of my citizens have a college degree, and they DO NOT want to be underemployed lol I found this out after I noticed my population started to drastically decline when I got to about 24,000 people. But you will have to find a good balance, not eveyone is going to want to college, so you will need good high paying highschool education or lower jobs. It's satisfying to find out why a zoned area is having a problem and then turn it into a bright part of the community. Interestingly enough, it's a very simple concept. Treat people like human beings and they will work hard, have ambitions, and in return give the city more money in the form of taxes to help improve said city. Every citizen is going to want to feel safe, have a local hospital staffed by local people close by with honest doctors, not worry about their house family and belongings being burnt up in a fire, Keeping their houses tidy by keeping garbage out of the streets. For instance, the laws have a invest now-risk/reward later effect. Sign a law that encourages people to recycle to help produce less garbage which will keep your garbage dumps clean while you wait to get approval to build garbage powerplants to burn the excess garbage. You'll get slightly less tax income, but you won't have to spend as much as quickly mantaining more and more garbage dumps. I love this game. I wish there were more extreme policies that could only be approved if you met certain conditions like for example- cime is 8%, I can now unlock an outreach program policy that would further reduce crime. I LOVE that they made a policy just to ""legalize it"", I signed that bill as soon as I could, and then turned around and banned ciggerettes. In my mind, I do not trust cigarettes because of the extra chemicals they include with tobacco, so I wasn't actually banning smoking tobacco, just big corporate ciggerettes; my citizens, seemed to approve, health in general went up 5% and oddly enough so did happiness. It did dip 2% for a few weeks, then rose about 5%. For a small gain of 3% I hope they continue to make dlc for this game, it has so MUCH potential and it's already my city management game of choice as of this review.			"

												The best citybuilder to come out since Simcity 4. Cities is everything you want from this genre, as there is so much content in the game and a lot of planning and managing to do. With full workshop support there is so much to do with this game. Buy this if you enjoy games like the old Simcities or other city builder games.			"

												After playing a lot of citybuilding games - starting from SC2000... And this is far the best citybuilding game I've played!+ Water dynamics. Ah. Making your own map and you can make water flow just the way you want it to.+ Everything seems to be simulated. You can realistically see where the roads get blocked.+ And making those roads? Bliss. You can create them just the way you want.+ Mods+ Easy use of workshop+ Good pricing.- Save issues now and then.- Upgrading zones isn't as easy as upgrading roads.			"

												The city building game, I wanted SimCity to be. Excellent and very deep, city building game, with HUGE maps, and tons to do.  Maxis and Simcity kinda lost its way, took out all the fun things that made micromanaging a city fun.  Cities: Skylines brought it all back, with so much more!!  The game isn't yet as polished as Sim City, the menu seems are a bit odd, but the depth and  details of the game really made up for it.  With mods, and promised updates, this is the game to play for city building!			"

												An incredibly well done city builder that is pretty much what SC2013 was supposed to be. Slick, deep, pretty and with enough micromanaging to satisfy your every whim. Build beautiful cities where the traffic flows through the streets, or make a giant metropolis killed by congestion. You will find a new appreciation for infrastructure, as well as a great substitute for being a responsible human being who goes outside to do things.			"

												The single best city-builder I've ever played. Cities:Skylines is overwhelmingly fun, addictive, and simply a wonderful experience.Pros:-Great graphics, very detailed-Huge map (without even unlocking all 25 tiles)-Incredible city depth and design-Forming roads and interchanges is incredibly fun (I spent hours fooling around with the various road tools)-Traffic. Oh, traffic. It's very welcome and fleshed out beyond anything I quite expected. Managing traffic is challenging. But in the best way possible.-City data, heat maps, graphs, etc... for your city are presented in a manner that makes them very easy to understand and evaluate. The art and colorful visuals are absolutely off the charts.-Districts are fun and add a different dimension to the game.-ModdableCons:-N/ASo yea, get it. I could sit here all day naming off the positives. But it's worth much more than the $30 price tag.			"

												Great game. Its better than Simcity in many ways. Dont compare this to Simcity. Simcity feels like an arcade after playing this gem of a simulator. Its everything you wanted simcity to ever be, but has failed to deliver time and again. Alot more depth on your city designs, and actually watch your city grow into a huge Metropolitan. The only thing I do not like is the fact that you cannot go in to more depth with charts and scales and see a history of your economies well being. But dont let that deter you from trying this out. I got it on sale awhile back for 10 bucks, next time you should too, if you like city sims, and this is one of the best I must say.			"

												Everything I'd hope for and more with a City Builder! The price for what you get is amazing, and I wouldn't have minded paying more.  The modding API, allows a multiude of mods, especially considering the game is built off of Unity.  Just as Bethesda games become amazing by offering a strong game and platform through which modders elevate teh game, so are modders elevating Cities Skylines to horizons not thought possible when first released! And that was only in March! The first DLC has amazing new features, the core of which are free thought additions for full package cost, but at an acceptable price point.  There is no pressure to buy a thousand transactions and the game isn't artificially gated making it seem cheap but with hidden expenses.  It rewards different types of play styles and doesn't pressure you to recruit friends or hit goals counter to your playstyle. Definately a fantastic game.  I look forward to continued work, both by the devs and modding community!			"

												In short, this is EXACTLY what SimCity 2013 should have been. I mean let's face it, no more restricted areas to build in, interchanges, more practical zoning, and much more. There are a few draw backs that I should mention though: Using resources, control takes some getting used to. Other than that I have nothing bad to say about it. Simply put if you like Cities XL, SimCity, and Anno 2070, you should absolutely pick this up and give it a whril, there are already mods available to fix some of the annoyances that do exist. This is just on point and looks beautiful.			"

												This is a great game. Not brilliant, just great. 7.5/10. If i had a rosette i'd award it to the devs under the ""damn good effort"" category in the games awards ceremony that plays in my head :).It lacks the depth of the Simcity series (ignoring the latest one from EA which fails on so many levels) and that is the sole reason i don't keep engaging with the game. Which is annoying, because i want a fantastic city builder :).With the lack of depth comes a lack of difficulty. As other reviewers have mentioned, once you get over the initial cash flow issues you can't spend the money fast enough. Having said that, what that does do is free up your ability to bulldoze and rebuild/redesign.This leads me onto one of the things that i love about this game - the build system. I've read some reviews about this game being all about building roads and that's unfair, but you will be focussed on building road systems to make your city work. But hey, find me a city where that's not a key feature. That's kinda the point isn't it unless you can do away with roads, cars etc with alternative systems but that's not achievable here. You have to have roads, albeit alongside a decent public transportation system etcetc.And guess what, building roads i actually found to be a lot of fun! The devs have done a LOT of work on making roads work for you - you know, when you need to make something connect from A to B but the game can't ""figure out"" the connection - 99 times out of 100 this game does it right, even if it does natively lack a few road junction layouts which would be useful. Combine with this limitless funds (once you've got yourself up and running with high density) and you can trash and rebuild as much as you like within reason. This allowed me to explore different possibilities to see what worked which i found difficult in Simcity due to cost. Maybe that's just me.Yes there are some issues with the game - lack of depth (compared to SC4, come on we have to compare to SC4, it's unavoidable :); lack of variety in buildings etc; forgiving pollution; no real advancement in how water supply works (basic build a supply, connect with pipes - i'd rather it was just removed as it adds nothing imo etcetc but hey, it's a pretty good city builder.If anything, the popularity of this title demonstrates how much people really really want a deep city builder/management game. Given what we have received with this game I'd say this dev team are the ones to do it!!			"

The modding community and the sheer replayability of this game is what keeps me sucked in like a magnet. If you are even remotely interested in this game, I certainly recommend purchasing it.			"

												Absolutely amazing game.Did you enjoy SimCity but always wished there was more depth to the game?Cities:Skylines brings every fan's SimCity wants into one game.  If EA actually listened to its community it might have a game half this good.You can play this game so many times (even on the same map) and develop your city however you feel.  Feel like a railroad city? Try and make it work. Want to be the center of commerece? try and make it work.  Want to have a city without stoplights?  Try and make it work.  Everything about a city planning sim you could ever want.			"

												This is a great game. Not brilliant, just great. 7.5/10. If i had a rosette i'd award it to the devs under the ""damn good effort"" category in the games awards ceremony that plays in my head :).It lacks the depth of the Simcity series (ignoring the latest one from EA which fails on so many levels) and that is the sole reason i don't keep engaging with the game. Which is annoying, because i want a fantastic city builder :).With the lack of depth comes a lack of difficulty. As other reviewers have mentioned, once you get over the initial cash flow issues you can't spend the money fast enough. Having said that, what that does do is free up your ability to bulldoze and rebuild/redesign.This leads me onto one of the things that i love about this game - the build system. I've read some reviews about this game being all about building roads and that's unfair, but you will be focussed on building road systems to make your city work. But hey, find me a city where that's not a key feature. That's kinda the point isn't it unless you can do away with roads, cars etc with alternative systems but that's not achievable here. You have to have roads, albeit alongside a decent public transportation system etcetc.And guess what, building roads i actually found to be a lot of fun! The devs have done a LOT of work on making roads work for you - you know, when you need to make something connect from A to B but the game can't ""figure out"" the connection - 99 times out of 100 this game does it right, even if it does natively lack a few road junction layouts which would be useful. Combine with this limitless funds (once you've got yourself up and running with high density) and you can trash and rebuild as much as you like within reason. This allowed me to explore different possibilities to see what worked which i found difficult in Simcity due to cost. Maybe that's just me.Yes there are some issues with the game - lack of depth (compared to SC4, come on we have to compare to SC4, it's unavoidable :); lack of variety in buildings etc; forgiving pollution; no real advancement in how water supply works (basic build a supply, connect with pipes - i'd rather it was just removed as it adds nothing imo etcetc but hey, it's a pretty good city builder.If anything, the popularity of this title demonstrates how much people really really want a deep city builder/management game. Given what we have received with this game I'd say this dev team are the ones to do it!!			"

												I bought this game looking to recapture the excitement and fun I used to have way back in the day on the original Sim City and Sim City 4.  For $30, why not right?!?  After playing this game for a few weeks, I have been blown away!  I already enjoyed this game very much before the “patch” released the other day.  After playing “Post Patch”, this is hands down my favorite city builder game of all time.  The graphics have gotten an INCREDIBLE UPGRADE with the patch for free, in addition to many other fixes, upgrades and added features that you will find!  If you are looking for a relaxing, fun, beautiful and very creative and free spirited city building game, look no further than this.  You will NOT be disappointed!			"

												This game is a lot better than Sim City... a LOT better. You can look at other reviews for why but here is why this game is awesome. Ive only played the game for 12 hours and I love it. Its not too much micro managing and not too sandbox. I fell in love when my city began to fall to ruin when my dumbass placed water towers in a heavily polluted industrial area. This quickly made everyone in the city ill and people began to die... rapidly. I went from making 20k+ a week to -10k a week. After I was in debt and lost over half of my city residents I realized what I had done. I fixed the problem and after destroying all of the abandoned houses and whatnot I was back on my feet. That moment when my cash flow was in the positives again was the most glorious moment in any city builder game I have experienced.			"

However, I'm glad I bought it: it does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it does it very well. While familiar to SimCity veterans, the game can also surprise you: for example, I built a dam carelessly and managed to make the river flood right into my city! :o The updates are also doing a good job, like when they added tunnels. 5/5, would play again.

												I never do reviews on Steam, but I felt like reviewing this now since it's on sale and more people will probably be buying it. This is a good game, so I'd recommend buying it. I bought it for full price and I'm still satisfied with it after almost 100 hours (jeez, that time really sneaks up on you!) with this game. However, if you intend to make a mega city that's perfect in every way, keep dreaming. There are things in the game that are screwed up, and need mods to be corrected. Even with mods, some things (like the traffic) only work the way they work and you can't make them any better. Personally, I think a game can't be great if it requires mods to function better and prevent frustration, but this is still a good game. Definitely the best city building game available on steam.

												I have enjoyed playing management/city building/strategy games since they first start appearing in the early 1980's and recently I was asked to start reviewing mods for Cities: Skylines on a couple of websites.Why Cities:Skylines, well it has an amazing modding community that has transformed an above average city building game into an amazing one. The majority of these coders are quiet and unassuming and simply brillant, while a few others are worse than Kanye West (arrogant, self righteous with their heads stuck up their own a backsides) and only so-so coders that blame their short-comings on others. But all-in-all it has a great community that is always coming up with new ideas for making this game more realistic and fun.City building doesn't get much better than this. The modding community has already made this game so much better and CO are still adding new features.If you are a die-hard city-builder or a novice, this game is a must. Great game as it is now, The definitive city-builder game in the future.			"

												After seeing a friend play this, I bought it and while being similar to Sim City 5, this game is far superior, cheaper, and supports mods! I paid $60 for Shim Chitty vs $30 for Cities, a bargain in my book. Anyway, I started a new game and decided to go with a green small suburban town to get used to the game. I loved the road tool in Shim Chitty and Cities took it a step further (+1). My only complaint is the lack of a uniform grid when free forming roads in the middle of an area. Cities definitely has quite a bit of road selection to choose from and the road upgrade tool is a life saver (This game has one way roads too! +1) Next up, I went with a main avenue and zoned commercial along it with developments and windy back roads for residential (Standard setup I assume). When I unlocked parks further on, I built pedestrian paths through the middle of residential areas and bridges over main avenues to allow for shortcuts and because I felt like it made those blurry little people happier (I base my cities around the concept of improving the quality of life). I'm only at 3,000 population at the moment because I'm taking my time and enjoying the game. That's it so far.The best thing is I don't have to worry about space because I can buy adjacent plots of land.... Man what a concept... Genius...So all in all, yes, it's almost the same as Shim Chitty. Pros: Save/load game, no Origin, lots of development space, road types for all ages, water pipes, little blurry people, buildings can spawn in nearly any sized zoned lot, and ORDINANCES (I love ordinances, when Shim Chitty took them from me a piece of me died). That's all I can think of at the moment, like I said its Shim Chitty, but 10x better.Cons: Lack of public buildings (IE: Libraries, museums, and park types) and Pet ban ordinance (Seriously?)I may have missed things as I've only played 4 hours so far, but I'm loving this game already. EA/Maxis/Origin, I hate all of you.			"

												Following on from their excellent transportation manager games Cities in Motion 1 and 2, Cities: Skylines makes the leap to a full city builder that was the obvious next step after Cities in Motion 2.  Obvious that step may have been, but that doesn't make Skylines any less good a game.  Cities: Skylines is the definitive city builder of the modern era.  If you remember the SimCity games fondly then you will enjoy this game.  Certainly it blows the Cities XL series, which is probably the closest equivalent, out of the water.That said, the game is not perfect.  The traffic path finding can be a bit off at times - people forcing their way through the city centre rather than taking an orbital highway for example.  In the vanilla game at least your citizens have a fixed life span, if you zone large residential areas in a short space of time this leads to 'death-waves' that can easily swamp your deathcare capacity.  Large cities with a lot of mods running will run slowly, especially on older machines, but that is inevitable given the level of detail in the simulation.On the other hand there is a very active modding community.  There is already a mod that introduces probabilistic deaths that can ease the 'death-wave' effect.  The developers are also active and developing new content.Overall if you like city builders, buy this game.  If you think you might like city builders, then this game might well convince you.			"

												Long ago, 13th of March, I wrote a negative review about this game. Now I feel it's time for a re-review, since the game has seen some updates and expansions, as well as some mods.I would like to start writing about what is incredibly good about this game. A few things stand out, like the water physics in this game, which is very impressive and fun to play with. Another thing that I really enjoy is constructing roads and trying to solve congestions. It can be surprising how a small adjustment downtown can solve giant traffic congestions that affect the whole city. Visually the game has improved, mostly thanks to third party mods though, like 'Dynamic Resolution', that enables  'SSAA', which in short just improved anti-aliasing a lot, and 'Ambient Occlussion'. These are hardware intensive additions however, but I don't understand why these options aren't available in the default graphics menu.Other mods have also vastly improved the game, such as the Terraform Tool and the Traffic Manager. The modding community is definitely a strength which potential influence I greatly underestimated.What I still find underwhelming, however, is the economic simulation, the pattern at which buildings are erected and the transition from small town to metropolis.The industries actually work with a production chain from raw resources, that you can either harvest yourself, or automatically import into the city, to feed manufacturing plants (industry without raw resource designation), to exports. One issue is that this system is not even really obvious. It's something you discover if you pay attention, while it should be a core gameplay element in my opinion, that the whole city should be all about. Importing resources should cost more money, while harvesting them should cause more pollution, or something along those lines.The skyline in Cities Skylines tends to top off around a certain height. Eventually whole city quarters are filled with 30-story buildings, making it look really uninteresting. Why do all buildings max out to the same level? Maybe they should insert a mechanism that the more a building has leveled up, the more negative effects it spreads around it, making sure you can never get a topped off skyline, as the neighbors, under their shadow, will never rise to the same level. Then to raise a neighborhood you would need to provide even more services, but then again a few buildings will rise even taller, while others only rise a little, creating a visually much more dynamic skyline. Also the neighborhood policy to prevent highrises still allows pretty tall buildings in my opinion, defeating the point of it.The transition from small town to metropolis is way too rapid in this game. I was developing a small town, which is challenging and pleasing at the same time. Money is actually a factor and every building matters. Then, very suddenly, it all changes. Suddenly the money just comes in like water, disabling it as a game element altogether, and the whole town starts to look like a miniature New York; with a population of only 30,000. Traffic starts to replace money as the main gameplay element here, which is fine, but more something for a city of 300,000 than 30,000.So I have put down my criticism again, although I didn't mention waterpipes and other silly micromanagement yet, but I look forward to future expansions and mods that have a really positive influence on the game. I do wish that eventually the whole game will be as impressive as the water physics system, but for the current pricetag of under 30 euro, with sales putting it even lower, this is a fine game to pick up, especially if you are into this genre.

There are lots of buildings and models, the traffic simulation is detailed and mesmerizing, the zoning, taxing, and budgeting panels are easy to learn, the simulation is deep and visual, and the fluid dynamics put a cherry on top.9/10----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Modding----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Modding in Cities Skylines is extremely simple, easy to learn, detailed, and fun. You can edit buildings, make new ones, make your own maps, and import height maps to create real world terrain maps. The Cities Skylines workshop also has hundreds of mods that you can add in to the game with one click.10/10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disasters---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disasters are the only let down of Cities Skylines. There are only occasional fires that don't even spread, and the only 'disaster' you can create is when you a dam on a fast flowing river and break it to make a devastating wave. Other than that, when it comes to disasters, Cities Skylines is bone dry.4/10--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Developer Involvement--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The devs of Cities Skylines are wide open to suggestion and feedback on the game, they give good feedback to community creations, and they are all ears on social media.10/10-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music-------------------------------------------------------------------------------The soundtrack in Cities Skylines is beautiful, it's not overwhelming, and it adds a nice feel to the game that makes you feel like you really are building a city.9/10-------------------------------------------------------------------------------FINAL SCORE FOR CITIES SKYLINES:84/100Very good game, I'd recommend it to any city builder fan.

												Great game!Only thing I miss from Simcity is the ability to look up over to my friend's city and see how he's progressing, and maybe to visit his city as a guest. That, as well as goals. It's a sandbox, I get that, but give those of us who don't want to play forever an scenario or situation to work towards.			"

												Wow, its what a city building sim should be like. Very refreshing to play a game that actually makes you think about how to design a highway intersection, forces you to build roads that comply with the terrain (you need to weave the roads up the mountain) and give semi-realistic hydro power station dams to play with (nice way to flood your city). There are also no ""magical""buildings that will clear your pollution. You can get creative with building your infrastructure and send things underground whenever/whereever you want.Its a great game, and clearly worth more than the $30 they are asking. If they keep this up, they will own this genre for some time to come.			"

												Hey you! Ever wanted a game that is better then Sim City and is addicting? Do you also want to download mods by clicking a simple button? Then this game is for you! Anyways, jokes aside, this game is honestly AMAZING. Its a lot better then that sh!t Sim City, and alot more addicting. This game is really great, and I would seriously recommend this awesome game to you.Onto the Cons and Pros.Pros:After Dark; After Dark is a DLC, but the day and night cycle is free. Once you expand and make your city huge, the night will make it shine more, and make it more beautiful. Highly Addicting; This game is seriously addicting, you will have 10+ hours on this game, trust me.Highly Fun; This game is seriously fun. The mods keeps the game going, and mods also make it even way more fun.Challenging; This game is challenging, with traffic, and demands, this game will make you keep on playing non-stop. Highly Detailed; If you buy this game, I highly recommend you get the first person mod. If you download this, and go in first person, you will see that the civs are highly detailed. With them holding tablets, phones, having watches, and much more. The devs really did put a lot of care and love into this game.Cons:Intel Not Supported; I have a Intel i5 and this game lags alot for me. I read some forums, and apperantly this game doesnt support Intel's. You can still play it, but good luck.Glitches; Sometimes, this game glitches. Like for example, you have 10 incinerators, but your city still says you need to build more. Sometimes the garbage trucks doesn't even go to the building that needs a garbage truck.Conclusion:So, in conclusion, this game is highly fun and addicting, but sometimes glitches. We'll have to wait until they fix the glitches. Anyways, I highly recommend this game to you, and your friends. You will have alot of fun building your city, and will play non-stop. Thank you for reading, and keep building, Mayor!Like this review? Why not check out my other reviews? And why not thumbs up this review? Thanks for reading, and have a wonderful day.			"

												The city building game, I wanted SimCity to be. Excellent and very deep, city building game, with HUGE maps, and tons to do.  Maxis and Simcity kinda lost its way, took out all the fun things that made micromanaging a city fun.  Cities: Skylines brought it all back, with so much more!!  The game isn't yet as polished as Sim City, the menu seems are a bit odd, but the depth and  details of the game really made up for it.  With mods, and promised updates, this is the game to play for city building!			"

												An incredibly well done city builder that is pretty much what SC2013 was supposed to be. Slick, deep, pretty and with enough micromanaging to satisfy your every whim. Build beautiful cities where the traffic flows through the streets, or make a giant metropolis killed by congestion. You will find a new appreciation for infrastructure, as well as a great substitute for being a responsible human being who goes outside to do things.			"

												The single best city-builder I've ever played. Cities:Skylines is overwhelmingly fun, addictive, and simply a wonderful experience.Pros:-Great graphics, very detailed-Huge map (without even unlocking all 25 tiles)-Incredible city depth and design-Forming roads and interchanges is incredibly fun (I spent hours fooling around with the various road tools)-Traffic. Oh, traffic. It's very welcome and fleshed out beyond anything I quite expected. Managing traffic is challenging. But in the best way possible.-City data, heat maps, graphs, etc... for your city are presented in a manner that makes them very easy to understand and evaluate. The art and colorful visuals are absolutely off the charts.-Districts are fun and add a different dimension to the game.-ModdableCons:-N/ASo yea, get it. I could sit here all day naming off the positives. But it's worth much more than the $30 price tag.			"

This is deepness itself, represented with fancy graphics.This is one of those games were you feel that your brain is hooked up to it. Fond of it.

												If you like sim city 4 you will love this game. It reminds me a lot of the rush hour expansion as traffic is your main challenege in the game. Or at least it is for me. It's fun to puzzle out the different ways to make your traffic flow in order to keep your city afloat. There is a lot to do in the game already, but the developers will be releasing free content upgrades which has me excited and given that this is paradox as a publisher I hope to see lots of continued support for this game. I mean crusader kings 2 is how old now, and they are still pumping out expansions for it?This group seems to have the same goal and I am excited.This game has modding support out of the box and already the workshop is filling with people's content, so it's longevity is assured. At 30 bucks this game is a bargain, grab it, snag it, play the heck out of it if you love city building games.I would give this game two thumbs up if steam let me click that button twice.			"

												Pluses to why you should get the game:---No forced online only modeBig citiesPlanned content expansionsResponsive dev team from Steam and Reddit feedbackDay 1 Mod supportCloud SavesThere really hasn't been a game like this in yearsWe all got our hopes up and crushed from SimCity 2013, hoping for basically SimCity 2000+4 with better graphics. After that rehashed released of Cities XXL, Banished seemed to be the only 'city builder' game worth playing. I've already put close to 100 hours into Banished and wanted something more on a meta level. Well Cities: Skylines is it!!!I want to try out mods but I'm not sure if it will prevent achievements from popping.Other things I enjoy are how smooth the game runs (tested on 8core 4ghz, 16gb ram, ssd, gtx780). Cities XXL and even Banished ran at low frames after awhile, this game does not.I don't like the fact it doesn't have auto saves, that's really my only complaint. Last night, I spent 2 hours on my town and for some reason stopped getting oil for my power plant which caused the city to lose all money and most of the population. I guess I should have been saving but figured it was assumed based on other city builders.			"

												A good game, a bit a high cost, but much fun. most of all, this is a beutiful game. well made one, gives a really relaxing feeling. with some mods, it is an outstanding experiance, though ""vanilla"" is still fine. this game is still pretty young (i'm wtiting it in 2017), it is only 2 years old, but I hope some of the mods will be adopted to the game. this game is far better then Sims (the one which you build a city), with no doubt. Good dlc's, it's good and cool that by paying some extra money you can get some cool a$$ featuresin adittion to that by registering to their sort of site/community you get a free building (a casino) to put in your city - it is free. because this game is young I don't complain about the simplicity, but I hope the will add more stuff beside Dlc's in the future. Long story short - this game worth the investment.			"

												Everything you wanted from a SimCity 4 sequel but updated and better. The road, bust, metro and rail placemetn system is really excellent and shows off what they learned makingt he Cities in Motion games, and the way you paint districts is simply brilliant and really brings the cities to life. Plus mod support from the outset! This Collossal Order / Paradox game does not disappoint! Worth every penny.			"

												This is one of the few games I actually bought after torrenting.I like Cities Skylines a lot but cannot stick to it, it bugs me that I need a lot of mods to make it not so buggy and to look better because the default style is very whitewashed and plastic.It lacks the charm old Sim City games had but it's still the best city simulator out right now, definitely worth the buy.

												Before I start the review, let me point out first that this game has a 96% recommendation ratio. So let that sink in for now.So, Cities: Skylines, or as I like to call it: How SimCity Should Have Been.It's really easy to draw comparisons to the EA IP, so let's do that real quick: This game does virtually everything that SimCity does, but better.It has somewhat the same mechanics but with a more user friendly touch to it. Skylines is overall just that, really user friendly. You'll find the learningcurve to be not steep at all. Once you get the hang of it in the first hour, you'll quickly start building your metropol.The difficulty of the game is set by your own creativity. Thats a shame because there is no real challange. If you want to build crazy shapes of roads or an unconventional city all together, youll find that there is de bottleneck. There are no disasters, and even if you mess up your finances or the entire structure of the city, the game will still be very forgiving. Besides that one downside on this game, there isn't anything to add to it. It's flawless in gameplay, there is a huge variety of third party content with the steam workshop implemented. And finally, the game is really addictive. There are plenty of things to unlock. From unique buildings to special types of roads. The game really has a nice pasing in that sence. Also, it looks amazing.So, without any real negative sides to this game, let me just say 'wow'. Buy it already!			"

												I have tried so many city builders before.  The last few years I have been disappointed by a lot of them - Sim City, Cities XL, etc.  However, Cities:  Skylines has blown me away.  It's not as ""pretty"" when compared to other games, but it doesn't have to be.  It truely feels like a simulated city.  The biggest thing I noticed in this game is how the flow of traffic affects your city, which I think is a great thing.  It doesn't feel random.  Each car has a place to be and it makes sense the route they take, which you have to plan around.  Plus, the cities are huge, but it gives you time to open up a new section in your city so you can develop what you currently have.The only downside is the build variety isn't there.  However, that is such a minor point.  This game is worth $50, but they only charge $30.  So it's defiinately worth a buy.			"

It's a bit lite on content at the moment, but DLC, and mods will help that over time, and the quality of the base game for the price is excelent.			"

ImpressionsFrom the first 2 hours I can already comment the complexity of the simulation in this game is outstanding and runs really smooth, you don't get bogged down; The in game hints offer just what you need. Seems well optimised and has no game-breaking issues that I've stumbled upon yet. From a developer that created transport simulations before; This game holds nothing back. You WILL get traffic problems if you don't plan ahead and it's your job to fix it or problems arise in game. Things progressively get difficult as you expand into new building grids. The map size is huge for those who are worried. With a quick mod you can unlock the full map allowing you to build huge metropolis's. The game is so detailed you even rename pigs...  After spending over 4 hours in the asset/mod manager alone just perfecting and learning the way roads form, with their one way systems or complex intersections and then to finally implement them and watch the traffic flow freely made me smile. Repeating on many reviews; This is the game SimCity should have been. With the built in map editor you can recreate your home town/city and see how the game stacks up against the real thing. With, already, hundreds of workshop items from the community ranging from; custom maps, buildings, highways, junctions and items you wont run out of ideas or playable maps any time soon. With fluid camera motions and a in-game ""Tilt Shift"" filter, there are some amazing screenshots around already.SummaryI really want to review more but I'd end up writing an essay. All in all I highly recommend this game for anyone, from casual to die hard city building fans. Both groups will find their niche. "

												In general, this game is a very good city builder. You can look at other reviews for all that stuff, but one grip I have with it is that the traffic becomes annoying. Cars seem to always take the main road even when there are faster more efficient routes available, there's no option to remove traffic lights on an intersection of a small road( barely any traffic) and a big road (a lot of traffic), which causes the mass flow of traffic to stop for maybe one car, although luckily there's a mod that fixes this.Overall, get some mods, and this game is amazing. Great community as well.7/10 "

												Great game, lovely graphics. I've finished building a city and I'll be creating a second one when I can. I do recommend this game because its all about problem solving and lets you be creative with how you go about doing things. I've learned about roads and intersections and city layouts, at least from what the game offers. However this game boils down to traffic management, road layouts and transportation systems. At times problems arise unexplicably, but its rare. Nonetheless, great game.			"

												Cities: Skylines is what the city building genre needed. After the huge dissapointment that was SimCity, I thought we'd have to play SimCity 4 forever (that's not a bad thing mind). Thankfully Paradox has funded this wonderful game. Once you hit 20,000+ pop, it's no longer a struggle to make money to further expand your fledgling city. It becomes a traffic simulator. You'll spend more time re-doing and updating roads once the colossal amount of cars, trucks, vans and bikes swarm your infrastructure. This isn't bad however, it's really fun and I'd like to see all City Building games with it in.The graphics are very nice, although the options are limited and Tilt Shift can get annoying. The sounds are pretty generic, nothing special about them but also nothing terrible. The chirper is annoying though, even though it highlights stuff that's wrong with your city. It gets extra annoying if you legalise drugs. ""I iz gonna lite a spliff init""There's not much of an end game, but there usually isn't with city builders. The only thing stopping you is how limited your ambition is. Workshop is very VERY good, there are some must need mods such as automatic bulldoze for example.In conclusion, if you're itching for a city builder then I'd suggest you pick up this game. You won't regret it. If you're new to city builders, then this is a great game to start with as it is relatively easy (barring traffic problems later in the game) so pick it up if it looks interesting to you.			"

												Not been much into city-builders before but this one got me. It's great and comes highly recommended.Massive scope, customisation, diversity, loads of content, simple and intuitive UI, actions have consequences. This game is a master-class of the genre as far as I can tell. To criticise this game for any shortcomings is to discount the extensive modding community it has so I'll just say that there are virtually no flaws in the game that I am aware of. It is the perfect city-builder and to not get it if you are interested is a meagre favour to your wallet but a disservice to your gaming experince; 10/10 would city again.			"

												It reminds me of the old Simcity from Maxis they did ages ago. But its more modernized with todays standard city building game needs. Just awesome. One small mistake can ruin your city in no time. For example, I gave my city sewage water to drink because it wasn't far enough from my drain pipes...so they all eventually died...just great :).This game will remain on my computer for ages... I recommend itPros: Beautiful graphics Simple to use but can become complex and hard at some point Steam Workshop for mods Looks simple but with some time, you'll know its more complex...so its not you're basic Simcity 1 game Fired Maxis employee's play this game but won't tell you Developer and publisher house are small and can do better than Maxis and EA Lots of replayabilityCons: Lack of sim communication feedback (think of simcity4 sims on the streets giving feedback) Learning curve UI needs work a bit Not needed,  but lack of end game for goalsLast thing to note is the number of things gets unlocked. I find this unusual as its more of a skinner box technique so It's not a really bad thing but the more you get your population growing, the more things it unlocked so you can use them. So I can't really put it in pros or cons in my opinion.Highly recommended game to buy if you liked Simcity or City XL type of city building game			"

												This game lacks the detail and simulation of Simcity 4 but packs more punch than Simcity 2013. If you are looking for a deep simulation city building game, then you'll be disappointed. Otherwise, give it a try. It's a great game if you just enjoy building stuff.			"

												Simply put this is the best city sim available right now. The modding community is amazing and it's great to see a smaller developer take on a genre that has been dominated by EA for the past twenty years. Cities: Skylines is also extremely well optimized for low-end PCs which is awesome if you're not rocking a powerful gaming rig.			"

												This game was everything that SIm City should have been and more. Sure there is some more finese required but the developers have been smart to open the game right up to the community for modding and editing and this has made this game a step ahead of any other city builder.The only bad thing is the amount of sleep and productivity you'll lose as you spend hour upon hour making the finest city possible.

												Cities: Skylines does a great job of taking the fundamental ideas that Sim City 4 attempted and addressing every issue that the community had with it. The resulting game is something that has the same look and feel of its elder genre brethren but has many of the features the community wanted in it. That doesn't necessarily make it the game that Sim City should aspire to be, indeed Skylines lacks any real originality or direction to where it might be going in the future. It's a solid title, one that plays a heck of a lot better than Sim City 4 did, however it's derivative and the onus is on the community to take it in new and strange directions to help differentiate it from its main competitor. That being said it's still enjoyable to play and most certainly worth its current asking price.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/03/20/cities-skylines-i-am-a-generous-mayor/ "

												It has a LOT of playtime in it. It might be a little hard at the start, it WILL take you 2-3 tries to get going, but once you get into it, it is really fun.Now the bad thing is, that the games traffic might have some hiccups here and there.For example:Some cars might dissapear, and you have a massive traffic jam, even though the road has 2 free lanes.But don't let that get to you. If you can get past that it is a perfectly fine game.This review was written on the 9th of september , 2016, so the devs might have fixed these problems.			"

												I love this game, it's already getting great mods. (very quickly)I had very high expectations for this game and it's completely exceeded them. It's not just better then simcity 2014, it's the best city builder to date period.You can build huge sprawling cities, and suburbs, and small towns, with districts and the transportation system, all on one map. Fantastic.I would love to see some expansion packs come out soon, disasters would be nice that way we can play around with emergency services more. With their really actually remarkable water simulator, they could go further and make hurricanes with storm surges. That with tornadoes, forest fires, earthquakes and epidemics would add a really interesting dynamic to the game.As many have pointed out, variety in the buildings is another priority, but with moding that is starting to get solved by the extremely active community.Overall, one of the best games on steam, if you haven't bought it yet, i strongly reccomend you do so now. It is worth every penny and then some. I bought the Deluxe edition for no other reason then to support this company more, i can see myself spending many more dozens of hours building and tinkering with my cities.			"

												10/10In my opinion, this is the PERFECT city building game -- the one I've been waiting for since I first played SimCity2000, oh so many years ago.  This game does what the new SimCity (on Origin) SHOULD have done, and tried (but miserably failed) to do.  For me, Cities: Skylines takes the cake as the best city-builder.Cities: Skylines allows the player to start from nothing, and grow one tiny neighborhood into an ultimately sprawling, fully integrated and interconnected network of high density cities and lower density towns.  You start with one (farily large) square of territory, then build up a nice bustling village, and gradually expand your city by purchasing other, directly-connected squares of territory with new resources and topographic features, until you have a realistic-feeling region.  (This feature contrasts greatly with the new SimCity, which only technically allows you to expand into a ""region,"" since it really only allows you to focus on one square of territory at any one time.  Cities: Skylines gives you a full view of your expanded territory, you can build in any part of your territory at any time, and you can see that your various smaller cities are all a part of a larger interrelated region.)  This ability to gradually expand into a true, interconnected megalopolis, and the additionalability to create smaller districts (neighborhoods), and set policies that are specific to each one, are some of the game's best features.  The game allows you to have real control over what happens in each area of your region.  The road and transportation system is also quite intuitive, and generally allows for easy manipulation and changes.  Transportation systems are easy to set up and change (unlike in SimCity), and I feel like there is a good amount of freedom in setting up roads.  I only wish you could easily change a two-lane road into a one-way road, which it doesn't seem to allow you to do.  But that's a minor critique of an otherwise STELLAR game.  I will say that the game sometimes runs a little choppily on my crappy (but new) Acer laptop, and the graphics are a little fuzzy, but I am positive that this is the result of my aforementioned crappy machine, and not the result of any programming flaws.  Also, the imperfection of the graphics on my machine does not lessen the value of the game for me.  In my opinion, this game satisfies all the requirements for a perfect, ever-engaging city-builder.  The replay value is amazing.  I have put in 45 hours of playtime in about two weeks (by starting and expanding three different cities), and I know I've still  barely scratched the surface.  I can't wait to see how my cities progress!!  If you enjoy the city-building genre, then BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!  Take it from someone who's played just about every city-building game that's been released in the past 25 years - Cities: Skylines will make a worthy addition to your collection.  10/10; 5 Stars; A+++			"

												If you like realistic city builders, this game is just fit your needs. This game has a huge list of things that I really compared from the other city builders such as SimCity and Cities XL series. As the devs said that this game supposed to be like managing a real city.-Huge Maps-Insane Modding Community-Devs will listen and care.-Realistic Water/Sewer System-Good Traffic and Transportaton ManagementSince After Dark was added in that they added in a day/night cycle. The game is missing a few things such as a weather/season system, disasters like hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, massive snowstorm. I think the would improve some stuff but not going to detail it here. Thumbs up to both Paradox and Colossal Order for making this very great game that I really adore playing much. "

												There are some games that are completely addicting and force me to play for just another five minutes (which turns into hours). Cities: Skylines is one of those games. This game does what many city builders cannot. It has the feel of the Sim City series with just a few problems:-Traffic (4 and 6 lane roads are not helpful in most cases)-Not enough people per skyscraper building if you want realism. It's incredibly difficult (potentially impossible) to reach millions of people in your city-Not multiplayer and unable to attach your own cities together to create a bigger metropolis with more traffic issues (that was something that Sim City 4 still does well for singleplayer)Still the majority of the game is amazing fun with challenges to unlock important items for moving forward. I have no idea how many cities I have gone through and it still doesn't get old. It's a must have for anyone who enjoys a simulator.			"

It's not constantly connected to the internet, the trafic works properly, it runs better, no random disasters and (probably most notable of all) the map size is huge.

Heck, I think I've only ever built one town with over 100K cims. I've never had this much fun in a city builder even though I've never even been close to touching the ""end game"" of what this game has to offer. Just planning and building highways and all the way to walk paths is sooooo much fun in my opinion. And that's just a tiny aspect of this game!

												From loving games such as Sim City and Roller coaster Tycoon I have been looking for a good city management game for some time.  I can spend countless hours reworking roads to improve traffic flow and find laying water pips to be a peaceful experience. If that’s you, you might want to give this game a go. Unlike sim city, which it barrows heavily from there are no disasters. The biggest threat to your citizens will be fire. My few play throws the fire became a pain in how many burnt buildings I had to bulldoze. Though that was partly my fault I got rid of a street connecting the fire house. You could say the game was trying to bring my attention to this by burning the people of my city. City: Skylines is the definition of a city builder simulation game.  Its goal is to give you the tools to create a prosperous city the way you see fit. Through a wonderful mechanic called districts I could regulate an industry heavy district to provide farm goods. Personally I like my cities to be eco-friendly and concentrate on resident happiness instead of trying to make the most profitable city I can. From years of playing these types of games, the fun comes from living the fantasy of running your own city your way. City: Skylines seems to understand this. From their UI and overall look of the game people will compare it to Sim City 2013. Though I think as time goes on people will start to point out how this game sets it self apart. You can only see this through playing it.  It's a warm and welcoming feeling for people that want to dive into a city they can make into their own. This game also comes with a map and assets editor. From little I got to play with this feature I have to say its nice to create your own intersections to use in your maps. It keeps things uniform and saves you time from wasting cash and deleting unnecessary from roads that you have to replace, anyways. The developers have thought of steam workshop integrating from the get go. From seeing games of this type try to integrate other players into your game, like having a multiplayer function I much rather have this type of integration where players can add to each other's cities through making unique props, buildings and intersections. I would recommend this game to anyone that love city management games. It's one of the better ones. "

												Best city builder by far. Amount of mods and options to build your city is immense.			"

												An excellent city builder with tons of assets and mods, plus room to expand. This game has huge potential for the future. As a person that loves city builders in general and a veteran of the SimCity franchise. I would highly recommend this beautiful and wonderful game! Also it has one of the best game communities out there! Finally one of a few companies that listens to people's ideas and won't make a mess of it.			"

												This is what I (and you) have always wanted to play in terms of a City sim. The good old Sim City 2000/3000 feel is there, and made much better by a variety of enhancements (simple overlays for indicators, area of effect on buildings before you place them, accurate visual cues, etc.). Conceptually, the game is a bliss. Most things are inherently understood by the player or well summarized by their popup explanations. Still, an advanced in-game tutorial for certain things would have been appreciated (albeit you can see the wiki from the main menu). Most importantly, none of the BS from the more recent iteration of Sim City is to be found. Example: instead of paid DLC for nicer looking structures (and feeling as if you were shortchanged with an incomplete game to start with), they come free of charge. And if you ever felt there weren't enough models, you can either make them yourself or find some on the Workshop. It also looks like tons of people like to share their models on Workshop. Despite certain shortcomings (the Tweeter feed isn't always very useful, the soundtrack could be expanded somewhat, rivers and water in general is somewhat lackluster), this game made me believe in the city sim genre once again. Truly worth its ""overwhelmingly positive""			"

												I put the water pump downstream from the drain in my first city, and everyone is getting sick so I spent all my budget on hospitals. Then the streets are crowded around hospitals so I upgrade all the roads to 6-lane. Then my cemetries filled up so I upgraded them to incenerators. Then the streets are crowded with ambulances and coroners, and people can't travel, so I built an extensive subway network. This lasted for 10 years (game time) untill I found out why my population isn't growing, and by then my economy is ruined, all the prime estate are converted to hospitals, and I recieved the achievement ""Bad Mayor""10/10 would get achievements and learn how to play the game again by feeding people pee instead of water			"
