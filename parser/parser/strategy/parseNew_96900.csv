												Slam Bolt Scrappers is a hybrid of Tetris-style puzzles with aerial combat thrown in. You control a person on a jet pack who collects pieces and assembles them into blocks to make weapons to destroy the other side, but to get the pieces, you need to fight aerial monsters and you have to wrestle them away from the enemy player.I really didn't find much enjoyable about this game, really. As an avid fan of puzzle games, this was really a let-down, because the aerial combat is so much more important. You're not really given any time at all to strategically plan your board to get awesome weapon combos... even if you knock out your enemy, he'll be back in seconds to hassle you again. The only thing that might be worth it is the multiplayer, just for the fun of beating the crap out of your friends.The graphics are cel-shaded and look alright. The music and sound work but aren't memorable. I used keyboard controls, and they seemed to work just fine. The only thing this game is really missing is fun.If you're a big fan of frantic fighting-type games, then maybe you'll get more out of this than I did. I was really hoping for more puzzle-based gameplay from the screenshots, and I was let down. I certainly wouldn't recommend it at full price. If this looks good to you, wait for a sale.			"

												Disclaimer: I was the developer of the Windows/Steam version of Slam Bolt Scrappers, so obviously I am biased. Having said that, when I first signed on for working on the game, I initially wasn't all that attracted to the gameplay, since mashup brawlers were not my thing, but I did love the visuals a lot. It seemed like a good fit for Steam, so despite me not liking the gameplay, I took on the project. However, I was very quickly won over with the gameplay, and now I love the game. It has just the right balance of ""omg, should I continue beating up the opponent right now, or should I go after more blocks and building more towers/weapons??"". It's frenetic and addicting and especially so when playing against your friends. And I still really love the visuals.			"

												This was a nice surprising little game. The playful sound track and jelly like noises enticed me and had me from the word go. It's a very casual party sort of game. The game play is kind of like Tetris, you have different shapped blocks, that when you match them up, create ""attacking blocks"" that shoot at the opponents blocks. You also have your character which flys around hitting other flying around enemies which turn into the blocks allowing you to expand your wall. After a few levels on the single player you unlock the multiplayer game which is where this game will excel. I for one will keep this game installed for the ure fact that it is so much fun to play with your partner or friends in the front room on the big tv.			"

												Games controls COMPLETELY ruin this experience , this game has alot of potential if the devs would spend some time on their controls , this is also the same company that made Go Home Dinosaurs which is also very good if the controls didn't ruin that experience as well , I think if this developer was to hire someone that could implement decent controls that are responsive this company might go somewhere but if they let it go the games this company produces will be remembered for some of the poorest controls ever delivered on a PC platform.3/10  For controls that are even worse than Go Home Dinosaurs.

												If you do not have a Xbox 360 controller to with this game I would reccomend finding one or just avoid this game altogether. The play and ideas for the game are great but the reduced functionalities of the mouse and keyboard make the game more of a frustration to play than fun.			"

KAMGUSTA's mini ReviewYou play tetris. Blocks are given by punching enemies on the screen. Nice try and nice graphics, but boring as hell.I enjoy more playing tetris on my B/W '90s Ericsson T39i.Score 4/10 "

												When they tell you ""controller strongly recommended"", they mean it: game is utter garbage with a kb/m. Not just ""bad control scheme"", I mean straight up ""the mouse is treated as a joystick with absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥acceleration and you will find it impossible to move across the screen without constantly lifting and dragging"".Also unless you plan to have people over to play this it's kind of limited in fun quotient. AI is not amazing, and it seems a lot like this would benefit from ♥♥♥♥ing around with pals. But the multiplayer is local-only.Go buy Go Home Dinosaurs instead from the same company, it's just a much better GAME if you can deal with some clever tower defense puzzles instead of... uh... defending literal towers of blocks.

												Got it in a bundle so i cant fairly comment on financial worth, but its actually rather great. Its smash brothers meets tetris. You are building squares (each colour having a function) the bigger the square the better, you can also beat up things that drop blocks, the other player and other stuff.Yes it has a campaign which gates off content but to be honest this game is only any good in vs mode because who really cares about beating up an AI? You want to beat up your friends!			"

												Building ""weapons"" (read: turrets that attack your opponent's turrets) by matching blocks is somewhat satisfying, but the game doesn't really feel like it goes anywhere with it in the single player. Half the weapon types feel useless, and the combat for your own character feels button mashy, even if there are a few combos. I have a feeling it's the kind of thing that would work better against real people (and it does have local multiplayer I haven't tried), but whether it would turn out to have more depth than I've seen or devolve into punching each other in the face while throwing blocks around randomly, I can't tell.
