												It is a relatively good works in Nobunaga's Ambition series.Simple game than typical strategy game.Recommend the person who takes an interest in Azuchi-Momoyama Period or feudal warlord.PostscriptThis price is a typical price for a long time in the pc game in Japan.In recent years it has increased even inexpensive work. However, still Japan of pc game there are many very expensive work.			"

												Although it can be said to all series, it is expensive. But you can taste the fun that matches it.Battle in the group was also very interesting to me.If it is discounted with special price, please consider purchasing by all means.			"
