												Well, it's a ""match-3"" as they were made a decade ago. Graphics are crude/cheap when compared to today's standards. Still the genre may appeal to some players, like it does to me.As the title says, the goal is to contruct wonders by retrieving stones from background you have to break. There are 7 wonders and each wonder has 7 levels. Each level must be cleared. At wonder 4 or 5, some background tile are doubled. As bonus blocks, it is the usual : 4 block align, 5 block align and every 4 bonus used, another bonus appears, this one destroying several tiles+backgound at random.That's the extend of this game, which I finished in two hours. Once done, you can do a rerun, but with (unselectable) harder difficulty.Oh, and expect a lot of ""no more move"" in this one. Thankfully, it's not at your expense as it redraws the screen freely when that happens. On a playability note, once you move a tile, you can't move any other until the screen has settled. That means that all raws cleared because of your move must happen and you cannot do anything until it's done.I rank this as a difficult one, mainly because of the few varied bonuses. Some tiles are really hard to reach.Last, I installed this on Win7 and it ran without problem. Although, mind the resized screen for any other app that may run in the background :)			"

												This game is broken. You get to the last ""Wonder"" and then you can never complete it. It just goes on forever.			"

												Short outing for this, usually, fun series of match 3 games. Still worth purchasing if on sale or as part of a pack.70/100			"

												Not a bad game just not on par with previous releases from the same publisher.  Subpar graphics, no power-ups, no rotation of tables, no mini games. Not recommended for the price.			"

												Pretty fun old match 3.  I played until I got the 4th wonder done, and just got bored.  That said, it was in a bundle for a few cents US and so I got my money's worth.  I'd say wait for a bundle on this one or try the newer version,5.5/10			"

												Build the 7 wonders of the world with this great Bejeweled style game! It great for casual gamers and great for kids to play around with. You find 3 or more matches to progress through each level. Its great fun and really easy to understand. This is highly recommended for casual gamers.			"

Brief Synopsis:7 Wonders of the Ancient World is a casual tile matching game where in you ""build"" the 7 wonders of the world by matching lines of 3 or more of the same shape. Doing so breaks the tiles behind them. Break all the tiles on the board to proceed to the next board. There are 7 levels in the game, each consisting of several sub levels. In total, the main game took me about 3 hours to play through.Long ReviewStory: The story in this game is pretty flimsy, but in a nutshell, you supervise the building of the 7 wonders of the ancient world. You do this by creating blocks (done by breaking tiles on the board) and moving cornerstones down the board (done by matching shapes) for the workers to collect. Graphics: The graphics are pretty standard fare for a casual matching game. They're simple and, with the exception of the workers, fairly static. Music/Sounds: By far, the best part of this game, in my humble opinion, is the music. It's rather catchy, and despite it playing in a constant loop, it didn't get tiring or turn me homicidal (always a good thing). Length: I was able to get through all 7 wonders in about 3 hours, managing to get the second highest title reward in the game. For £5, this is a bit short for my liking.Replayability: Carrying on from above, 3 hours isn't really a good length for the cost of the game. The game does allow you to go back to previously completed levels to try to get a better score, so it is slightly replayable.I do tend to enjoy matching games and find them to be quite relaxing. As such, my recommendation, if you are the same as I, is to get this game when it goes on sale at more than 50% off. "

												Clearly one of the earlier members of this series crudely reworked (not even resampled) to run on more recent Windows versions, this game seems to lack the power-ups of the later games, and is hardwired at 800x600 resolution. Very little to make it stand out from the other match-3 games out there. As a $2 game, maybe; but not at this price.			"

												Where to start.This is a puzzle game, with the added story mechanic of finishing levels in order to 'build' the seven wonders of the ancient world. Thus the title.How this is achieved is by playing your typical gem-switching puzzle (Not sure what I mean? Replace 'Gem' with 'Candy' - that help at all?) - when you switch gems into appropriate groups of three or more, they disintegrate, and the gems above it fall into place. The 'background' of each gem is smashed, and the pieces fall to the bottom of the screen as bricks, which are picked up by tiny minions, who cart them off - supposedly to create the various parts of each Wonder. The premise of each level is to smash all of the bricks, by disintegrating gems on every square on the grid.Et cetera et cetera. There are other mechanics, but none which really make this anything other than a puzzle game similar to many many other puzzle games. It's definitely good fun for a time, but not £5-worth of fun.As usual - if you can grab it in a sale or a bundle, definitely go for it. You'll be entertained for a while, but when better alternatives spring up regularly on mobiles and tablets for 99p - it kind of makes this seem stuck in the stone age.As always - a video accompanies my review.

												Nothing special about this somewhat outdated match-3 game. The main quest is rather short, the gameplay is boring unlike some other games of this type, the music becomes annoying quickly. A keyword characterising this game is: mediocrity. The player's motto here: to walk through and forget forever. The only strong point is a piece of education but there're generally known facts about the Seven Wonders only. Also, the plot suggest you to act as a streikbrecher. Phew!			"

												Match-3 games are still found in plague like abundence roaming wild and hunting after whales on the brutal seas of the free-to-play smartphone market, but on PC this once successful genre lies in ruins. This game stands a monument to that time before the genre found its true home. Sadly such a monument does nothing but reinforce why this genre died out on PC. It is, as such, of archaeological interest only.			"

												Honestly NO idea why people gave this negative reviews. This game is OLD. Of course graphics and quality will be from the early 2000s. But its still the same process I know and love.Music is still great and nostalgic.  "
