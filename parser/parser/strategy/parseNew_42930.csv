												Last of the elven legacy DLC is a really nice one. Difficulty droped significatly from siege but it's probably the most balance and fair of the entire elven legacy.  It's not super easy like ranger but not super hard like siege. All the basic feature such as graphics didn't change at all since the base game and although it's aged it's still quite decent.Story wise I like it too. Like siege it use the same type of parallel storyline between 2 hero's route and reach an quite epic end for the entire serie. Some of the old hero from other elven legacy show up also. There are some bonus mission to play to see the aftermath of the other elven legacy dlc/basegame. Overall a quite satisfactory finish to the semi-good game serie. It's not a perfect game and yes it does takes a while but once you start getting into it. it's still quite good.6.5/10 for a good strong finish. Recommend to play if you like elven legacy basegame.

												DLC to a game I dislike. But on the other hand, it is a good deal when you buy it in package. And on Sale. Still not my cup of coffee.			"

												This is the best of the expansions and my favourite among elven legacy and fantasy war games. The campaign revolves around small parties with powerful mages with new spells and mechanics introduced to the elven legacy we know. I did enjoy the dwarven scenario the most. I wished all the expansion had this quality. Well			"
