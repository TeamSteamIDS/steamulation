												One of the best space-real-time-strategy-games ever created.It has an interesting story, beautiful explosion-graphics and a high replayability.Multiplayer is pure fun and very challenging.The HUD isn't the best, but also not the worst. Just buy the cheap bundle and try it out!If you are playing on windows 7, THERE WILL BE game crashing bugs. BUT there is a solution!Download Hgm_Soundfix here: http://www.moddb.com/downloads/haegemonia-legions-of-iron-sound-system-fix-> Go to steam/steamapps/common/Haegemonia Legends of Iron, backup your hgm.exe and paste in the hgm.exe you downloaded-> Put compatibility for windows xp service pack 3 and administrator rights. (Rightclick on the new hgm.exe)Download Haegemonia v1.10 [GERMAN] No-CD/Fixed Image from here: {LINK REMOVED}http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_haegemonia.shtmlFor the next step, you need the program daemon tools. You can download it here :http://www.chip.de/downloads/c1_downloads_auswahl_37592209.html?t=1399294859&v=3600&s=cc2dfe68dc013a85111c74a3bbbc71fd-> Extract the files you downloaded and mount the Iso in daemon tools.Then just start the game, it works perfectly fine!P.s. Maybe the game asks for a key, just search one online, they are easy to find.			"

												One you apply the sound fix to this game it's a great space game used to play it years ago and having played through the single player campaign again on the steam version it was well worth playing again.			"

												I love this game. I have loved it ever since it came out in 2002. Yes it's an older game. Yes it has bugs. But these can be worked around with a simple amount of research (like the sound error that some people get). And no it does not have widescreen support. You'll have to enjoy the game with either the black borders or a stretched image, depending on your computer's settings. Is it inconvenient? Yes. Is it game breaking? not in the slightest.For a 2002 game, the game play is great, and the graphics are great (for a game of its era) and the explosions are great even for modern day games.It's easy to get frustrated when you fail a mission, many people haven't quite gotten an understanding for the game yet and blame their mission failure on bugs. I've beaten the GOG version several times and I will surely play through the steam version just as many times. The replayability of this game is endless to me.This is not a short game to play through, many missions will take hours to complete. You start out in the Earth-Mars war, you even get to choose who's side you want to fight for. These missions are introductory missions, teaching you how to play the game, planetary management, and research, and the levels get progressively harder as you go. In some missions, money management is absolutely CRUCIAL.Battles can be quite intense at times and definitely fun to watch.If you enjoy Space RTS games, this is definitely the best. Yes it's old, but its fun, very fun and a must have. Just make sure if you get errors, you look for the fix before rageposting about how ""bad"" of a game it is.Oh and, in the first missions, make sure to press the F1 key (it will inform you of this) as all the information for controls you need will be listed there			"

												I have Spent around 19 hours so far on this game, and I have loved all of them even if a Mission takes Four hours to Complete, or If I don't understand what to do at the begging of it. It's such a Beautiful, and Amazing game I'm so glad I purchased it!			"

												Firstly, this is one of my favorite games of all time.  It was just as fun as when i originally bought it on disk, and that was almost ten years ago.  This is definitely one of the more refined games out there, and for not even being an RTS player, I found this very enjoyable.  Also, the graphics for this game were, at the time of its release, were ahead of curve.  Space is absolutely beautiful and the planets are very detailed.  I highly recommend this game to just about anyone, but specifically RTS and space-opera fans.			"

												Don't buy this in it's current state. Sound errors and no widescreen support.I thought this deserves a new thread. The game's sound issues haven't been fixed and I get this problem continously on Win 7 x64 (about 4 or 5 missions in, when you first get access to wormholes). Play for a few minutes and bam, crash to the desktop.There's no widescreen support, so enjoy playing at 1024x768 or 1280x960. I'd also like to add that I bought this game when it came out on disc back in 2002 or whenever it came out. It's a fantastic game and I love it to this day. I just wish there was a Haegemonia 2 onwards. This steam version just isn't worth your money until these 2 issues are fixed (the sound problem especially). I can play the game at 1280 with the nvidia settings (aa etc) set to max, so the lack of widescreen isn't a huge problem for me but the sound issue is.			"

												This may have been a good game when released but time has not been kind. The limited resolutions and lack of aspect ratio settings conspire to stretch the planets and everything looks fuzzy. Seondary objectives are vague and the strategic view is not much help. Intecepting a suspicious ship requires you to look at every ship in the system until a tooltip indicates which one you can attack. They all look alike.  Command, who has scanned and tried to communicate with the suspect, will not provide any means of IDing the vessel. They won't even tell you what region it was seen in. There are no significant tactical or strategic options. The game is too simple to be engaging and too complex to be a time waster. You have better games to play.			"

												Haegemonia is a pure space RTS in ever sense of the genre! From the gameplay, graphics and sound the attention to detail is breathtaking; creating a solid, immersive gaming experience!Whether you're a seasoned RTS junkie, or even a casual gamer -- this is one game you don't want to pass up!It's laid back, challenging, fun and rewarding -- all the at the same time. Recommended! :)			"

												Very good space strategy game in its time, although its neck was broken with errors,crashes and bugs. But still game mechanisms are unique and above time. The game has given me so much fun and i admired graphics engine before and i admire it today.(played on 1920x1080 - I changed it manually in the folder settings, and my play time didnt count)			"

												Not a terrible game but there are just many better alternatives for space strategy; I'd suggest something like Homeworld or Star Wolves instead.+Graphics are decent for the time+Voiced dialogue+Excellent range of zoom from up close and personal to star map level-Poor UI, often lacking in helpful information-Controls are poorly explained and can be awkward-Game is likely to crash due to 'sound system error' without manual fix/download:http://www.moddb.com/mods/haegemonia-vector-prime/downloads/steam-legions-of-iron-sound-system-and-mp-fix "

												I really tried, it seemed like it had a lot going for it. The controls and the interface are just so damn obtuse though that I can not enjoy it. If the menus provided better information and if the controls were actually customizable beyond only the barest options I'd give it another shot.			"
