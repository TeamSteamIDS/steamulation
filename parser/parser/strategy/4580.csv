												Alright, Dawn of War Dark Crusade, where to begin? This game is by far the best Dawn of War game to date, including Dawn of War 2 and its expansions. If you're an RTS fan, there is little here not to like. (Also, you don't need to own the original Dawn of War OR Winter Assault to enjoy this game)The gameplay is simple and very fun, you start out with a base and a builder unit, you proceed to make buildings filling various roles such as research, unit creation, and defense. You proceed to make a base and units to defend yourself, and you eventually attack the enemy. You have two resources, power and requisition, power is used for vehicles, upgrades and research, requisition is used for everything. Requisition is easy to get, just capture points across the map and fortify them with listening posts. Power requires you to create power generators, but bases have a limited amount.Campaign is simple, you pick a race, and you are given a map divided into territories, each territory is provides you honor guard (Elite units to defend your commander) and a planetary requisition bonus (to buy honor guards or defenses for territories, or buildings if you get a specific plot of land) The map is turn based, with you and the 6 other AI going to territories and trying to claim them, when you attack or defend a territory, you are put into a basic RTS battle. If you win, you get/keep the territory, and whatever buildings you made (not research, though) on that territory. You are also rewarded for attacking/defending, allowing you to get wargear for your commander. Your commander can equip new items that can change your playstyle with him/her or simple make them better. Now, the best part of campaign is the stronghold missions, these missions are when you attack another race's main territory, so instead of destroy the enemy HQ, you are presented other tasks, such as destroy these artillery units to stop part of the map being bombarded or kill this commander and get these soldiers to fight for you. Strongholds are very long, hard and entertaining. The game has a nice selection of races, each filling a playstyle.Tau = Strong ranged units, good offenseEldar = Stealth based, fast movingOrks = Melee swarmImperial Guard = Ranged Swarm, great tanksSpace Marines = All around, good melee and rangedChaos = Kinda like Space Marines, Melee focusedNecrons = Slow as hell, turtling, but can be near unstoppable when they do attackMultiplayer and Skirmishing is fun, pretty basic for an RTS but with bots or people, and your own rules.The graphics and sounds are nice, the graphics show battles in their full glory, with colorful explosions and blood flying from units, and the sound includes powerful gunfire and units yelling in battle. Not much more to be said, the game looks pretty and sounds like war. The soundtrack I do give a shoutout to, its very nicely done.The only real thing I have a problem with this game is the crashing I get. Sometimes in a match or on the menus my game just freezes up or crashes on me, its not common, but commen enough to add it to this review. I think RTS or Warhammer fans will really like this game, given you didn't buy it already, 9/10, great game, but some crashing and freezing stops it from being perfect.Also check out the mods for this game, some of them are very nifty.

												This game is so inspiringly coitus inducing that I played it for many days in the darkness of my cave under a single blanket made of hemp rocking back and forth and refusing to leave the game unattended to go to the toilet, for food and for water. My wife  left me 3 weeks ago because I became engulfed by the need to purge the enemies of the imperium. This game destroyed my life, and I would do it again if I could. This game is like heroin. The more you take, the more you need to survive. I have lost 7 pounds in a week because of this game, much like heroin. The difference between heroin and this game is that you only buy this game once and it's legal. Don't do drugs. Drugs are bad. Like heroin or a pineapple pizza.			"

Pros:+ Solid storyline+ World conquest for a main campaign... as any of the playable races+ Vast array of playable races, all with different playstyles+ Bug-free+ Classic RTS Gameplay+ THIS is how a Dawn of War game should be done+ Multiplayer is still fantasticCons:- None, really.Overall: This, imo, is the pinnacle for the first Dawn of War game.  Soulstorm is fun, yes, but this game came first, hit all the right notes, and Soulstorm just tried to mimic it.  Being able to play the campaign for world conquest with any playable race is fantastic, and the addition of so many races makes multiplayer even more frantic.  By far my favorite in the Dawn of War games.Bottom Line: Worth playing and replaying... and replaying... and replaying...			"

												This review is coming from someone who has been with this game since the date it released, I was professional ( sponsored to play ) In the early days of the game. By far the best RTS your fingers will ever touch. My hours will shine light upon this statement.Pros-7 Races but somehow cleverly balanced ( Tau and necron are broken but can still be countered ) -Active friendly community in the sense of I see a lot of the same people everyday helping them improve and befriending them so we can have a lobby of 8 players who all know eachother.- One of the best resource systems in any RTS very simple to learn but a huge part of the game.- Micro can be used to an insane degree.- Macro can be easy to learn.- Decent graphics and voice acting for how old the game is.- Space marines, Chaos, Orks, Eldar, Imperial Guard. Oh My.Cons- Steam servers have messed up a some multiplayer aspects of the game.-no more stat tracking ( you cant see how many games a person has played/won )-Sync errors happen every once in awhile very low chance but none the less really annoyingbugged lobbys- Having to own every prior expansion to have all the races.-Sometimes the population of the game will have 200+ people online at other times 20 people online.I highly recommend getting this game when it goes on sale and you can pick up all the games at a low price,otherwise I suggest every RTS fan in existance should own this game. It really is something amazing.I had no idea what Dawn of war was prior to this game, it shaped my habits as a gamer, and got me into computer games. So if you have the money pick up this game and learn how to play it, it's incredible. A game I wake up early in the morning to play before class, that's detication!			"

												Dark Crusade was probably my favorite RTS throughout my college years.  While my friends were busy playing Starcraft, commanding the forces of Terrans, Protoss, and Zerg, I was busy fighting wars in the 41st Millennium, taking on foes ten times my greater and defeating them with honor and earning glory.  This was also the version of Warhammer 40K's Dawn of War series that got me into modding, giving me a sweet, sweet taste of what the penultimate prize of Modding experience would be promised to me upon getting Soulstorm.If you've ever gotten the previous two, Dawn of War and Winter Assault, you'd know gameplay-wise that nothing's really changed.  However, with the addition of two new factions; the popular Necrons and the mysteriuos Tau Empire; and new units for all other factions (including Grey Knights for the Blood Ravens, which remains my favorite unit choice to this day), it definitely shines in front of its predecessors.  That, and with an awesome campaign where you can play not just one but all seven factions, promising continuous replayability even after you've beaten the campaign once...there's nothing here that's  not to like.I'd be a fool not to recommend Dark Crusade.  Any RTS player would be a fool to deny that this game stood the test of time.  Stop reading the review, fork out some cash or grab that debit/credit card, and get the sodding game.  The best part about it all is that the multiplayer options are compatible with all versions and are standalone, so you only need one game to have fun.  I recommend giving it a go, it's worth it.  Let's keep this game alive.  For the Emperor!			"

												Dark Crusade is an improvement on the mechanics of Dawn of War and adds new factions, units, and a world map-based conquest mode as the campaign in the game.  For those of us who enjoyed standard scenarios and multiplayer this is entirely an improvement.  Unfortunately, for those of us who were more caught up in the story-based campaigns where a story unfolded before you as you played, that feature no longer exists.The world map does offer a few advantages that I will admit are enjoyable.  First off, you feel more like a true commander as opposed to a company leader in the prior Dawn of War iterations.  You decided on where and when battles will take place and often those decisions are based on which provinces offer the most requisition (currency) and benefits for your units.  The enemy also acts with the same goals and will actively invade your territory if it sees fit, bringing the battle to you.The unfortunate part to this, in addition to the loss of a well developed story from earlier campaigns, most of your battles end up being frantic zerg fights where you churn out your units and upgrades as fast as possible and slam them into the enemy until they are dead.  Obviously, the old strategies do apply, and the classic rock-paper-scissors aspects of the units remain, but I myself always felt more caught up accomplishing objectives and advancing the story.It was a toss up for me, as you may have guessed after reading the above, but I have decided that I'm going to recommend this game since it will satisfy previous DoW players who enjoyed the basic scenarios even if the heavily story-based campaign is gone.

												If I had to pick a single RTS from my collection to recommend to a friend, or really anyone with a remote fancy for strategy, destruction, and all out war, it would be this one. Dark Crusade was the expansion DoW needed; adding both the Necrons and the Tau, two races unprecedented in their leels of badassery, and a smattering of new maps that outshine anything you played on in the previous DoW releases. Chaos still steamrolls & Imp Gaurd are still silly, but whether you're a fan of 40k or just the great genre that is Real Time Strategy, DoW Dark Crusade belongs in your collection.			"

												Dark Crusade was, in my opinion, the best game of the Dawn of War series. It gave players more freedom than the previous two games with its multiple factions, while not suffering from the recycled concepts and poor storyline/voice acting of Soulstorm. The RISK style dynamic is one that I have found inherently fascinating, and one that I hope that Total War: Warhammer will exploit in the future. My personal highlight of the game, and probably the series overall, were the stronghold assaults. With entertaining storylines and objectives that make it feel very much like a special mission in the tabletop game, I found them to be a refreshing and rewarding experience. My one gripe is what seems to have been faction favouritism amongst the production team. Multiplayer combat is made less enjoyable when people play as the Eldar, and make their webway gate invisible, warping it all over the map, and forcing you to adopt time-consuming  strategies to beat. Overall, however, the game rates among my personal favourite RTSs. 9.5/10			"

												I bought Dark Crusade way back when it first came out and I'm glad to see that it's back now, kept alive on Steam. Having played the singleplayer portion of the game to it's max, I can safely say that this is the best Dawn of War game out there to get (if you can get only one of them). Although it has slightly less features than its successor, Dawn of War - Soulstorm, the campaign experience is much more comfortable, rewarding and has better writing and more interesting characters too. Soulstorm is only worth getting if you want the latest and fullest multiplayer experience (along with the original Dawn of War and Winter Assault for the remaining races).			"

												Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of war: Dark Crusade: Black Scuffle is pretty cool I guess. Set in the distant future of the 41st Mellenia, Mankind has decided to show aliens just whos the boss of this gym by beating them all up. 10,000 years after their Jesus figure got cripple, humanity now has to fight an endless war across the stars for total domination against aliens and other humans that don't like them very much. The planet Kronus, located on the edge of an alien empire known as the Tau, has suddenly been thrown into an all out war between numerous different factions. The Tau themselves, a highly advanced alien race that relies on ranged weaponry and the help of other aliens for close combat, basically the nerds of the 40k world. The Imperial Guard, regular humans who fight with flash lights and balls of titanium. They also have big tanks and scary men who wear cool hats.The Eldar space elves who think they're smart but actually aren't. They also accidentally spawned a chaos god a few thousand years ago because they wouldn't stop having planetary scale murder orgies.  So like they're ones to talk about short comings of other races.They suck, I hate them.The Necrons, grumpy robot skeletons who were awoken because of all the gosh dang racket going on up stairs. Now want to destroy all life.Orks, space fungus soccer hooligans that can't stop shooting and punching everything. They're fun guys to be around.The forces of Chaos, evil humans that worship the gods of Chaos. Like to summon daemons (it's spelled like that in game) and get into bar fights. They're jerks. And of course there are the poster boys, the Space Marines, roided up super jocks that are like 8 feet tall and poop pure rage. Each race battles for control of the planet, trying to accomplish their own goals and thwart the plans of others by sitting down and discussing the matter like civil adults.I made that up. They kill each other hardcore.Now, I bought this game at launch, over the years I've accumulated about a hundred hours or so all together and only recently got a CD key from Sega for the steam version after Relic servers shut down. Dawn of war is more or less a traditional style RTS with a focus on base building. It's big thing is that your main resource comes from nodes you need to capture and secure on the map instead of building farms or something like that. This means that there is always a threat of combat as your enemies head out and attempt take points from you, furthering their resource gain while crippling yours. It's an aggressive way of playing that makes you constantly push your units forward instead of just turtling in your base.There is also a toggle for most units that lets them switch between ranged combat and melee combat, giving you another layer of strategy. There are units that specialize in ranged combat and units that specialize in giving wedgies and shoving you in a locker. It adds another layer of strategy as how to build your army. Your firewarriors may have a powerful ranged attack, but sooner or later those angry green rioters are going to reach your firing line, and then you'll look silly. Good thing you have these goofy bird looking guys that like to hit things with sticks, so you can happily fire away while your Kroot friends literally eat their enemies.  Gross. Single player is actually pretty neat. Instead of having a mission to mission story, you instead fight over the planet in a risk-style fashion. Each army has a pre-set number of locations where they can use points to reinforce their territory and buy special units for their army. While it can get kind of dull fighting for the same territory, it makes up for it with the stronghold missions of each faction acting like a more traditional kind of RTS mission. The voice acting is...Pretty friggin great. It's like a bunch of Shakespearean B-actors yelling mad banter at one another. This all being said, should you play Dim Expedition? It's pretty great, it adds a bunch of stuff to the last two games while also having a really neat competitive aspect in the form of multiplayer. If you can get it on the cheap, you should do so, but chances are you already have this game, considering how old it is.Dark Crusade gets 4 aliens yelling at one another out of 5.

												Unlike the previous games in the series, there is no real level for level campaign. You are presented with a planet-spannding map and move your hero to different areas. RTS game style starts when you get on a piece of land that belongs to the enemy. These matches are just like normal skirmishes from the earlier games. Only certain spaces (Enemy HQ, vital locations like spaceports) have a real objective and a neat little game-engine-made cinematic.Sound deserves a special mention here. The music is one of the best I ever heard in games, cinematic quality,  and the voice acting is great too, but a bit cheesey sometimes, tough that fits.Another great feature is the army painter, in wich you decide the color scheme of your units. Sadly this does not work in campaign mode where you play with fixed armies.Sadly I can't cramp more into this little box, as I could go on for hours, but this game is one of the better sci-fi strategy games out there.

												Being a fan of the RTS genre the Warhammer 40k dawn of war franchise beats out many other RTS games even though is a bit old.+Pro's+ Unit's and buildings look very detailed for being  a 10year old game.+ Its funny to watch enemies get tossed around the map by your tanks or Infantry.+ Campaign is rather long even on easy so don't expect to beat it quickly.+ Community is quite helpful & friendly.-Con's(None really unless you think this game is outdated...

												I thought the first game was the peak. the expansion Winter Assault was good but is short length hurt it quite a bit.(I am also a die-hard 40k fan, so I am also a little bias in the review, you have been warned)This game however far out-classes all before it (and to an extent after it). The addition of two new playable factions, those being the Tau (Space commies with Mech suits and angry rooster people) and my personal favorite faction in all of 40k, The Necrons (Spooky scary skeleton robots), of course all the previous factions return with a new unit or two (Imperial guard get weapon teams, Chaos now lets you turn your lord into a daemon prince, etc)This game also adds a new between-battle map screen where you can upgrade your commader, train an honor guard, reniforce captured provinces and, of course, attack your enemy. Most of the battles are just basic multiplayer style skirmishs against the computer (with the exception of some missions that give you a space port or a daemons fury) but, in the heart of the enemy lines, there is a more mission based level, much like the previous games, that if you can conquer, that faction will be removed from the game, an you'll most likly get a wargear out of it too.Out of all the 40k games I have played, this is probably the best and most lore faithful (with the exception of the necron/human mix the Parias, they're gone now), sure it plays nothing like the table-top game, but lets be honest here. If it did play like 40k table top, the game would be alot slower and several hundred dollars more costly (But no less awsome)8.5/10			"

												If you like warhammer, or just want a good strategy game, you should choose this game. It plays pretty much like a standard RTS, but with some elemens like points. Some points gives you recources with which you buy units and some give you a bigger chance of winning.The campaign is great, and while I have not finished it I can tell you I like it. It plays similarly to risk, except its up to your own skill and not blind luck to win.There are seven races, all of which plays differently and have different strengths.And if you have to choose between Soulstorm and this, definetly choose this.

												This was and still is an absolutely awesome game, intense, fun and epic in scope. The rts genre hasn't since produced anything even remotely so cool and fun - and I'm counting Starcraft 2, which isn't bad ofc, but the focus on mining and producing hundreds of units takes away the thrill of combat. The new Dawn of War remake on the other hand focused too much on the micromanagement of units, losing somewhat the feeling of epic battles.Remember those eight player games, artillery tearing the infantry to shreds, tanks charging, massive bloodthirsty demons trading blows with the Eldar Avatar, bodies, blood, blaster fire, laser beams and the endless yells and screams everywhere? God, this game had atmosphere leaking from every pixel of pictures and every byte of sound.Warhammer is about killing the heretics, any time, all the time. Take their land. Burn their structures. Take their heads.			"

Recomend.First time launched it in 2007 and still play. The most balanced and carefully-worked game in DOW I series. Real-Time strategy in Warhammer universe. Needs tactical and micro-control skills. A large variety of different units and vehicles, economical and technology improvements during the game, massive battles with units' special abilities and tactical maneuvers, base building and fighting for territories.Features: Seven different playable factions, every is particular. Realistic battle-system with many factors influent on it. Spectacular and striking shootouts and melee skirmishes. Exciting campaign with an ability to choose fraction. Every way opens new storyline. Opportunity to create a huge army or multiple independent squads on player's choise. Graphics for RTS on maximal parametres are great, even for nowadays. Beautiful effects included. Army-painter that allows players to paint their troops in any color. The lack of errors and bugs. "

												There is no denying that Dark Crusade is the best game in the Warhammer 40 000 Dawn of War franchise. Everything is balanced out very well in comparison to the original and the first expansion Winter Assault. The game offers you and you the possibility to have a more diverse army and not rely solely on the top tier units such as Terminators, Possesed Squad or Warp Spiders.                 The Campaign is also fantastic and has an allure of a classic 40K tabletop game. "

												Dark Crusade is the second expansion to Dawn of War and advertised as a standalone expansion as well. It should however, not really be played as a standalone. The complete absence of any sort of tutorial or incremental introduction of units and technologies makes this an incredibly hard place to start for new players as you're essentially thrown into the deep end from the get go and just hope you learn how to swim before you get overwhelmed. To add insult to injury you can only use the two new races in multi-player unless you already own Dawn of War and Winter Assault.The two new races are very nice additions however. The Necrons are a pure powerhouse, the immortal machine servants of a long dead empire, serving vicious and hungry gods. In game they play quite differently from the others, ignoring usual resources and tactics their build speed is determined by the number of strategic points you own making them a very slow starter, to compensate their units are unusually tough and sometimes even resurrects themselves upon death. Lategame they transform into a steamroller as even their Headquarters becomes a flying, teleporting doomsday machine.The second new faction to be introduced is the Tau and they similarly play differently from the old factions although not quite as big a deviation as the Necrons are. The Tau are a strange mix of specialists, heavily armed but poorly armored weapons platforms and a variety of beastly allies. The biggest difference between them and other factions is the lategame choice of either going to the heavily armed but poorly armed weapons platforms or the huge beast allies they can also summon as choosing one path excludes the other.The single-player changes gear from the previous installments and replaces the linear and scripted missions of Dawn of War and Winter Assault with an open campaign map in a Grand Strategy style. Each faction starts with a stronghold province and must conquer the rest of the map as you play along gaining various bonuses from their conquests including various pieces of wargear for their leader. The problem with this concept is all the maps in between the various strongholds are just plain boring, both in attack an defense. Although the map changes it all plays much the same and it comes down to pure grind very quickly.The stronghold attacks however is where the game gets interesting. Challenging maps with multiple sub-objectives and small video sequences before and after makes them the only bright side of the new campaign.In terms of graphics and sound it maintains the same quality as the main game. A thunderhammer still makes a satisfying thump when impacting a traitor's breastplate and the Ork's still scream out their one word with relentless fervor.That feel that comes from the WH40K universe still exists, but the grind of the campaign makes it have much less of an impact than in the original. Still a good expansion, just not an exceptional one and definitely not one to be played as a standalone game.			"

												The Very Game that introduced me to Warhammer 40k. Back around '07, friend had in disk form. Borrowed, loved it (more than Warcraft), and got it from him. The best part about the DC CD back then was that you didn't the CD to play it: install it, good to go. ok enough memories. let's talk shopfun game, it can be played causally. it's mod friendly. Game is Fully voice acted. Warning: Chaos units shout a lot, it annoyed my cousin when he played (lol). While Units are not Hardcore detailed (easily changeable through mods) but it does the job pretty damn well as the bits and pieces pop out. it also helps increase framerate because of the broad details, and there is going to be a mass of units.You have the Campaign, the voice acting pulling you into the intro. Battle map with different faction having a world war. Each with different quirks and you play one of them. Getting started (fighting the first few battles) is easy and used as a teaching tool and a way to explore the different units, if you don't plan on using the tutorial. Gameplay: the first game that I experienced that a unit has both melee and ranged combat. Explosions!! that actually does knock back!Abilities. Blood. Jumping assault units. Warcries. Deathcries. Blood!! Semi-gore pieces. More Blood!! Special melee kill animation (Sync-kills). Super Units. Heroes. Separate Cap for infantry and vehicles for full battlefield. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!Flamethrowers ^yes it gets its own line Basically, what the picture and video has.Experiencing all that in a single battle makes me drool.AI is pretty easy and repetitive unless you go high difficulty. Maps ranges from small 1v1 to large 8 player maps (Mods to get more and/or bigger maps)Customization is a little limited, being able to change the color of only a few pieces sets of the whole army, but still fun in my opinion. changeable Banner and flags (mods for more, or easily make your own)I have little experience with multiplayer, so I can't review that portion.I Highly recommend it.

												For the Emperor? Bah! What heresy is this? When the Dark Crusade hits, nothing can stop the march of the Necrons!Dark Crusade is the second expansion for the original Dawn of War and it adds two new races; the Necron and the Tau Alliance, as well as brand new conquest campaign and a multitude of new units for the old races. Both new races play distinctively different from the other teams and Relic has done its best to ensure plenty of options for you experiment and tinker with to have hours upon hours of playtime. Unfortunately, time has not been so kind to the game's presentation. Conquest also grows rather monotomous as you continuously have to rebuild, regroup and reengage on every new map. It is eventually best enjoyed with other players in the  beefy multiplayer department. With plenty of game modes and even the option to paint your army in your own custom paintjob; just like the table top game. All in all, the expansion adds more options, more time and more fun to your warfare if you're into the warhammer universe. It is well worth its price, especially considering today's rates during sales, and when comparing it to the investment of getting into the tabletop game.			"

												The defining moment of the Dawn of War series was and forever will be this game here.  Taking the pros of the earlier Dawn of War games, adding two very unique and powerful races, and letting you play as ANY faction on the main campaign is so good... it will sadly ruin you for every other Dawn of War installment, including the shiny newer ones like Dawn of War 2 and Dawn of War 3 when that comes out.  You cant go from 8 well fleshed out, expertly voice acted factions to 4 or 6, with only the Space Marines playable in the campaign... going back to those restrictions feels like pouring cement in your shoes.

												This one adds some new qualities to the Dawn of War style of RTS. The campaign is structured in a more non-linear way, allowing you to choose what areas you attack, whether you want to defend an area yourself or let the computer figure out what happens. It's like they spliced in elements of Risk, while maintaining the base building and combat mechanics you've come to expect from Dawn of War. One thing to note is that you should save often, because if you screw up a mission you'll lose your turn. Also, when attacking an area build the best base and defenses you can because if that area comes under attack by an enemy you automatically start off with all your structures. This would have been nice to know at the start, as I've pretty much screwed myself over and have to wait a few turns to build resources. Prepare for a little less forgiving experience, and a little more strategy in your attacks. Anyway, it's still Dawn of War and that means it's good.			"

												This is, at least IMO, THE Dawn of War game.The Pros:+ Campaign is amazing, Destroy HQ was much more fun than Annihilate IMO.+ Characters are charismatic, badass on their own right and are voiced really well.+ New races are not minor races that only a select few likes or even knows about (adding dark eldar over tyranids was a smart choice, guys)+ Skirmishes are fun, especially when you play destory HQ or annihilate in a 8 player map as a free for all in which case the game just becomes a huge, yet glorious ♥♥♥♥fest+ The last Dawn of War to give it's new commanders voice lines (Carron and Boreale kept Eliphas' and Thule's voice lines and only had different voices in the campaign which honestly upset me the most)The Cons:- Necron and Tau are really, REALLY powerful.- All strongholds in the campaign constantly send you harrashing units and large hordes, and they might come in and ruin your base while your units are trying to stop the production of another group of units. This was especially thing that annoyed me in the Tau stronghold cause there were SNIPERS SHOOTING AT YOU that needed detectors to smack down and you had to take a longer route if you did not want to bump into the units protecting Unity Plaza while taking out the production posts.- Eldar were not nerfed and are still just as annoying as they were in the past.- The classic ""hunt down the last ♥♥♥♥ing webway"" returns, glad that was fixed when Soulstorm came out.- You can NOT move your units around as soon as they start attacking an enemy unless you click on a listening post/relic/building/etc, they will just sorta attempt to move there and just go ""lol ♥♥♥♥ that i gotta kill this warp spider that is almost about to kill ME"". This was a glitch and got fixed when Soulstorm came out though, so that is great.- Chaos was still in need of a new vehicle unit but we got a Daemon Prince instead, I mean that is cool too but damn they could have brough the Hell Talon or at least a Dreadnaught along with the Daemon Prince!

												Probably the best Real time stratergy game ever made!Singleplayer:Space Marines, Imperial Guards, Eldars, Orks, Chaos Space Marines, Taus and Necrons.The story mode contains 7 different races on a big planet. At the start of it, you have one area on the planet which is your stronghold (every race have a stronghold which is a heavily defended and fortified). You capture other areas by fighting the controlling race in Real time on a map. Most areas unlocks an honor guard that you can recruit, so when you fight someone again, you start with that troop in the begining of the fight. (example: an honor guard for the Space Marines could be a small marie squad that has more health than your regular marines + more damage) The planet map is turn based with a very simple resource managing. When capturing an area, you will recive X amount of resource points to spend on honor guards or reinforcing locations after a turn. The singleplayer also contains a Skirmisher mode, which allows you to choose map, what opponents to fight and victory conditions. It allows for training (because the AI can be quite a challange) or just for fun. The MultiplayerI have not actually played much of the multiplayer, but from what I have played, its fairly stable and fun. But it does have a few issues, mostly relating to syncing issues and clients lossing contact with each other. This game also have tons of mods and awesome expasions for free! I recommend the Titanium Wars mod. Over all, this is a fantastic game with tons of replayability! 9/10 "

												Definitely the greatest version of Dawn of War out there. Gameplay, visuals, voice acting, everything is top-notch. The single-player campaign is entertaining, replayable and VERY atmospheric. If I should name one strategy that I enjoyed the most during all my years of gaming, I would immediately spit out ""Dark Crusade"".10/10 would fanatically exterminate all the alien species again. For the Emperor!			"

 Very fun and not repitive! Everyone should buy this game, and try it at least once, either you are a Fan of Warhammer40k or not!!!You can play as these very remember-able races from the WH-40,000 universe:
 Tau empire! - For the greater good! Chaos! - Burn the galaxy! Orks! - Moar dukka burna choppa!  Space marines! - ""good guys"" Imperial Guard! - Space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!aaand Eldar! - To save Craft-World! What's so ""different"" in this RTS game, and why should i buy this rather than Red Alert 2? Okay, you should go ahead and buy Red Alert 2 if you had the chance, but about this game:Really god damn high zoom level, with a 360o turning feature! To see the battle unfold next to you!Very balanced gameplay, with no Meta-Strategies winning every time... eh...  NECRONS, THEY EXIST - ""We can come back to life, and 1 shot your greatest tank with only 4 troops"" And a lot more stuffy stuff steff. Lastly , but not least i recomen you \___N E V E R___/  play this game if you're completely new to RTS,because it's basically a straight up upgrade to old RTS, and if you don't know how to play it, the tutorial is ""kinda""okay but won't tell you about advanced stuff like number binding, group selecting or others... you'll get r*ped.All by me!

												In the grim dark future of the 41st millennium, there is only war.In this standalone expansion to the epic series of electronic games known as Dawn of War, you can command armies of the Tau and fight for the Greater Good, or take control of the sinister Necrons and destroy all that crosses your path.Well, that's my lacklustre ""epic introduction"" done. Dawn of War - Dark Crusade adds the Tau and Necrons to the list of playable factions. While you can play as any faction introduced in Dawn of War or Dawn of War - Winter Assault in single player, unless you have both those games you can only play Tau or Necrons in multiplayer. Apparently there's a mod for this but I'm not entirely sure it's legal, so I don't have it. Being banned isn't much fun, and I like Tau anyway.The campaign uses a RISK-style map, and you must conquer the planet Kronus and drive all other factions off it. This being Warhammer, all the factions are lunatics, to a greater or lesser degree. If you're unfamiliar with Warhammer, stop. Why are you unfamiliar with Warhammer?The available factions in this game, for those of you who for some reason are unfamiliar with Warhammer 40,000 or its fantasy counterpart, are:The Tau. Blue space communist who fight for the Greater Good. Useless in melee.The Space Marines, super-buff guys in powered armour. Nicknamed Catholic Space Nazis.The Imperial Guard, the less-superpowered allies of the Space Marines. Technically part of the same faction, but they're separate armies so whatever.The Eldar, high-tech space elves on the brink of extinction. Ridiculously overpowered in this game, since they can literally turn their whole base invisible and field ridiculous amounts of troops.The Orks, fungus-based humanoids who just want to kill stuff for fun. Completely ridiculous but oddly endearing, they run partly on duct tape and space magic.The Necrons, Egyptian-themed immortal robots who hate everything living.Chaos, a collection of space demons who worship evil gods. Evil by Warhammer standards, and there are Warhammer factions that make Adolf Hitler look like someone's grandfather. Unless of course he is your grandfather, in which case I apologise.Now, if you had to have all that explained to you, go and study Warhammer 40,000. You scrub.*The game is an RTS, since it's based on a tabletop wargame, and quite a good one. Instead of training individual units, you train squads. The graphics are a bit outdated and make some of the units look silly (Chaos Marines look adorable, for some reason) but having played Minecraft, literally anything is a step up. Boy do I love bashing Minecraft.Pathfinding occasionally throws a tantrum and units randomly mill around before moving on to the point where you want them to go, but apart from that the game is generally fun to play and well-balanced, if a little outdated. Unless of course you count Eldar, who are ridiculously overpowered.If you're a fan of Warhammer, and you like the Tau or Necrons, I'd recommend this game.*Please note that this is all said as a joke. Most people will know this, but there a few people who will leap to the comments section to rant about me calling non-Warhammer fans ""scrubs"". "

												This is a must have game for any fan of Warhammer 40,000.This game got me started with the fandom and has been a motivation for finding a better RTS title over Star Craft.  DOW: Dark Crusade is a 2nd expansion to the Dawn of War series.  yet it introduces a more dynamic and unique single player campaign.  Which allows you to select one of the six factions and begin your conquest of the planet Kronus.  Each newly conquered section grants a new powerful unit, resources and upgrades for both yoru army and your commander.  The Combat system introduces typical ranged combat from rapid fire weapons, bombarding artillery and flame throwers.  BUt what really stands out is the melee combat.  Where squads of up to 12 or more engage hand to hand.  Many combatants will end with a finishing move, either putting a boot to the face or a pistol style execution.Size and scale are impressive in the game.  As we watch massive war tanks support the ground troops or watch the epic duel between two titanic demi gods.Gravity matters in this game.  So if you hear or see an artillery shell land in the middle of your army, don't be surprised if you see them take to the air.  Don't feel ashamed if you see your infantry get kicked like a soft ball by the demi gods on the field.  But feel honored when you see your captain plant his hammer into said demi god's head with a thunderous BOOM!The game is a typical Real Time Strategy (RTS) title, which means players must amass resources for buying troops and building facilities too upgrade current units and buy new more powerful ones.  The only difference with resource gather is capturing strategic points and building power generators.  So you don't need to worry about mining gold or chopping trees here.The Community has been very generous with offering mods which allow gamers too try variety of custom made units, abilites and maps as well as alternating banners and badges for your units.  The original DAWN OF WAR trilogy is a must have for anyone who enjoys RTS with range and melee combat.  Likewise for those who are either familiar or unaware with the Warhammer 40,000 franchise.

												I've been playing Dark Crusade for years.  I first got it in 2013 on Amazon along with the base GotY Edition and Winter Assault.  Hands down, it's up with Red Alert 2 and Age of Empires 2 for my favorite RTS's of all time, the big three that I'll never be able to properly decide between.  Its squad based mechanics, its perfect combat pacing, the base building mechanics (take notes, DoW2), and the sheer variety of playstyles between each race just make it a must have.  It also has technical perfection behind it, with very few compatibility problems and full widescreen/high-refresh-rate support.  It still looks good in 1440p and 144 Hz, and its visuals (while the ground can be a bit blurry) still stand out as more than adequate for the job.  The terrain scarring still looks nice and there's no standout bad visuals.Why am I dropping my review on Steam so early, though?  Well, I just have to point this out; Sega has been amazing with the property.  After adopting THQ's Relic IPs and the company in the big crash, Dawn of War 2 had a GFWL patch that moved the game over to Steamworks.  Eventually, Dawn of War 1 had a similar patch, removing the Gamespy roots.  LAN mode was sacrificed in the process, a sad exclusion from the new version, but nonetheless I feel that it was a great move to continue support for the game.BUT IT DIDN'T STOP THERE.  Sega's support team has allowed just about anyone to go over to their Support Site and request a Steam key to replace retail copies.  So, I finally gave this a shot on Friday night.  By Saturday morning, I had a nice response asking me for a few more things, a picture with a support number, the game, keys, and receipt... or I could just provide what I had and they would try to help me out from there.  To be clear, I wasn't expecting to get my keys-- it was an Amazon version of the game, only three years old, and digital download rather than a physical box.  Nonetheless, I provided the information and submitted it Saturday night.This morning (Monday), I got a new response:Hi lol you don't need my name! Get outta here!

Thanks and enjoy your Steam games!
Please follow the steps below to redeem the voucher and download your game. The direct download is provided through Steam and will require you to first download the Steam application and create a Steam account. If you already have a Steam account, skip to step 3.
1) Go to http://store.steampowered.com/about/

After entering the code your download should begin.
Please let me know how obvious accidental cutoff here.  Definitely not a bot, then! 
Best Regards, 
(support guy's name I won't disclose but nonetheless you are appreciated)I thought GOG support was a one of a kind experience, but Sega is just on point.  Every request I've sent their way has been a smooth experience and Relic/SEGA's continued support for a game now 12 years old (9 in DC's case) they're not profitting off of anyway is admirable.  The fact that they've been even bothering to provide keys for old customers is great.  The best part?  THIS ISN'T ISOLATED!  They've done the same for their older Total War games as well, including Medieval II and Rome!Make no mistake, SEGA is an excellent company.  Yes, they make some strange decisions from time to time, no company's perfect; but nonetheless, over the past year they've earned a dedicated customer, and I'm sharing this so that you may be too.  This is a company that treats its customers right and deserves every bit of success it gets.			"

												A must have for any RTS player who likes building army's with basebuilding, this time u can even paint and logo your own army and banners.The resource collection and economy works different, u capture 3 diffrent type of points, most are requisition points, one power and one relic is all u need. most armys will get lets say their main income from requisition points except the necrons as far as i know, for them, power is the main income.power works different as well, it also works as income, so the more u build or the more power points u take the more income of '' power '' u get.u spend requisition and power on buildings and units / expanding units and on upgrades.and the last one, relic points are one for each player in the map, capturing this will grand access to lets say the superweapon unit and the elite units of your army.all points can be defended by building outpost on them and upgrading them, except power points, u need to build around them to defend them, this can also be done for the other points.u build using working that are different for each army as well as the starter units from the HQ.so that is basicly how it works and its more easy then it sounds really.there are tons of races, units and buildings and tons of upgrades, when u think u are done and upgrade your main, everything has upgrades again.painting your own army and giving them logo's and creating your own banner is also unique to dawn of war.every race plays different in building and in army.all the expansions and the original have great campaings two of them have a risk like campaign map with some ingame cinematics.9/10 cant with for dawn of war 3 wich will come out this year.

												Here's how you win:1. Play Necrons2. Go for Spaceport so you can attack anywhere, then go for Fury.3. In game now, make your monolith as defensible as possible.4. No units need to be made, only scarabs and monolith upgrades. Maybe build the spiders so you can move them.5. Use your scarabs to get the monolith to the stage before awakened. That is priority, but when not building the summoning cores, have your scarabs build turrets, power cores or obelisk.6. Get the tomb building thing to upgrade the Necron Lord.7. Get the upgrades that let you turn invisible, heal you over time, and whichever else you like.8. Get the Reaper upgrade thing.9. Briskly walk your Lord over to the enemies' base. No need to build an army. If you have starting units, have them help defend your base.10. Attack their HQ.11. If you die, simply revive, you'll respawn where you died.12. To speed up the process, use the Reaper state thing.13. Have all your home turrets upgraded to the best they can be, and do not settle for enough, this region can be attacked in future by a more powerful race, so keep it fully loaded.14. If you run out of Gauss Turrets, make more monoliths so you can make more turrets.I've never lost.10/10 game for making an unbeatable race.			"

												Ok, where to begin?I've been a fan of warhammer for only a few weeks, andmy friend who plays it reccomended this game to me, so i gave ir a try and i loved it. The gameplay is satisfying and fun to play around with, the army painter is really helpful for deciding your color themes both in this an your real life collection, the army choice is nice, with it including 7 races, along with the factions within those races, such as space marine chapters, tau septs, ork clans, etc. but it could have some ore armies in it that could be nice, such as tyranids and dark eldar. The camera is a little sensative at times, but other than those 2 things, i would very highly reccomend this game to both warhaer fans and non warhammer fans alike.			"

												10/10I've played (to some degree) as every faction. I haven't played thru to the end, but I've gotten the farthest as Tau. I bought this on May 20th, 2016. I tried it with a controller, but realized it was mouse-and-keyboard pretty quick. Tried Skirmish, didn't like it much.  1 day later, I discovered Campaign Mode, and played as Tau. It was ok, I guess, but at first, I had trouble keeping enemies at bay and keeping my strategic points. Heck, I didn't even know I could add squad members until about 2 months ago. I hold a victory celebration after every major victory. A major victory is taking out a faction completely, though a minor victory is taking a certain region. I suggest you get this. 10/10. Or much rather: 10000000000000000000000000/10			"

												I love Dark Crusade, There is nothing like watching the Righteous Adeptus Astrates take on the forces of Chaos and primitive fools, And the eldar ofcourse. This game will get your blood boiling and the blood running, I recommend you get the zoom out mod, Other than that, The game is damn near perfect, Seeing massive armies decimate one another in glorious combat.I have beat the campaign as most races, All but necrons and chaos, it never gets old, But even better is the skirmish maps, Me and my friend once had a 4 hour battle against two tough AIs, I was Space Marine, He was imperial Guard, He gave me artillery cover while my Adeptus Astrates decimated wave after wave of Eldar and IG, over 40,000 must have died, It was glorious like no other game can be.15/10 Must buy if you like brutal massive warfare RTS games.

												I would always recommend this game, in fact I am currently in the process of teaching people in my college to play it.This game is a classic simply put and I remember back whenever I bought it in the physical format before steam was a thing.For fans of warhammer 40k this is amazing, for fans of RTS games this game is great, a gem from the past for sure.Although the three most overpowered factions are.Necrons because NecronsOrks because they literally have an infinite army.Space Marines because of drop pod capability to reinforce any significant location on the map immediately.

												While the initial two releases were amazing in their own ways and the sole post-release release of soulstorm is deeply flawed, Dark crusade stands well on its own, not bogged down by lore or the need to play prior/later instalments, and easy to manage. The champaign is fun, and while the maps may be similar, what happens from map to map usually isn't, as the enemies can sometimes defeat eachother. and usually this's a pretty fun variance, though the defense AI is probably not worth betting on. though if you just buy this online all you can play as are the necrons and the tau, which id say is the sole-and largest- downside about this game. that asside, the modding comunity is massive and fantastic, and the game's fun, fantastic music.basically its a good RTS with fairly well designed factionsjust watch out for the eldar. seriously.

												The happiest gaming hours of my gaming career. Its sad to think that this little comment of mine is more of a epitah then a recommendation, but in essence thats what it is. I loved the mystery of the game, it added a whole new universe to fight in, in your own way kinda like the Total War series but better because of the fact that there is a deeper connection, and lore based history. The mass of the battle were the best thing ever especially when you played the Imperial Guard, and held the line for countless hours with your line of bolter turrets, and Leman Russes (not to mention the guardsman wih their handy dandy flashlights). I just loved it theres no other way to describe it. The towering and spiring cities. The massive factories, and munofactorums. The story lines, mystery, and darkness where you want to huddle your forces together against the horrors of chaos as your men die in hundreds, and thousands. I just wish that like I said this wasn't a sermon to a dying video game, and my homage to it. In my personal opinion I want someone like Creative Assembly to build a game off of this ne of a massive universe reborn, in the still smouldering, fighting,and ultimately dying game that is the Dawn of War I, Aand II series.

												Dawn of War: Dark Crusade is an exceptional RTS. I guess the biggest complaint that I have would be that its alittle like Starcraft BUT WHO CARES?! You command freaking massive legions of the most powerful armies in the WH40k universe, its got this Dynasty Warriors-esque meta-campaign, you can customize the colour palette of your armies, and its a stand-alone expansion, no vanilla game required.

												I used to have this game on disc, I'm so glad I was able to pick it up again, all of these years later. This game is really the meaning of ""Traditional RTS"", set in the Warhammer 40k Universe. Dark Crusade includes 7 Factions to play as, including the T'au Empire and the Necrons of Kronus. The campaign has been changed entirely, into a risk type of game. The objective is to conquer the map as your selected race. To make booting another race off of the map a bit more exciting, each army (including your own) has a ""Stronghold"". This is basically the main base of the army, you could even consider it as a boss battle. Now I will move onto a more brief list.Pros:- 7 Armies, each can be played in the Campaign. Replayability can last a while.- Balancing is fairly good, some things might still be considered a bit ""OP"".- The pinnacle of the DoW Franchise.- Multiplayer has still been kept online to this date, about 10 years later!- Each Army has a different playstyle, rather than just using the same tactic for every army.- Quite a large learning curve if you are new to the franchise.- In my opinion, this is still better than it's successor, Dawn of War 2.- Variety of unique units for each faction.Cons:- Multiplayer community is quite small here, though it is still alive.- This game isn't really a ""Pick up and be good"" game.- Some units do have slight pathfinding issues in some cases, like the Necron Monolith.- There isn't really a playable story. Though there is a background story to the campaign, it's not like Winter Assault or Dawn of War.Even though it isn't perfect, I would reccommend picking this up any day. The latest Dawn of War 1 game is Soulstorm, however Soulstorm has it's fair share of dis-advantages. I'm just gonna put it this way; Dark Crusade for the Singleplayer and vanilla game, Soulstorm for the mods.11/10 would dakka again.			"

												I rate the game Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade 4/5. Good. This is far more than a simple add-on to the largely mediocre Dawn of War. This is an excellent and fairly vast expansion. In terms of its overall structure, this is probably the best Command and Conquer style ""RTS"" (Real Time Strategy as they are called, though applying the term ""strategy"" to this kind of game may be a little bit of a misnomer as most ""RTS"" games includes relatively little actual strategy but more often merely include certain tactical elements) I have ever played. It's most notable strengths are that it allows you to play as one of many different, unique factions, each faction has its own ending and the global-scale battle map allows the single-player campaign to give you, the player, a great many choices as you attempt to progress through the war.But this game is not without flaws. Indeed, this game, particularly the single-player campaign, has some fairly serious flaws.An example of The Good (if not Great):+The single player campaign map gives you excellent strategic options. Remember the old between-mission battle maps that were found in some of the oldest Command and Conquer games? This mode works a lot like that but instead of letting you select either one battle or another, your options are much more varied. If you capture the sector which has the spaceport your options become even more numerous because then you can attack most places across the globe. Likewise, capturing certain other sectors gives your forces certain other strategic and tactical benefits which make an enormous difference as the campaign progresses. This between-mission global strategic map mode is a truly excellent feature which lets you choose how you want the single-player campaign to progress while showing you your options (or lack thereof) and letting you see how your campaign is progressing. It is a feature I would honestly like to see in every other ""RTS"" game ever made as it offers unparalleled choice and strategic options well beyond what most other similar such Command and Conquer style ""RTS"" games ever come close to offering you. The inclusion feature should set the bar higher for every other command and conquer style RTS to follow. For me, this feature (combined with the inclusion of the Tau as a fully playable faction) made the game for me and made me want to keep playing the main campaign through to its conclusion.The Mediocre:+/- This game requires you to make heavy use of your lightest infantry units. This severely limits the number of tactical options which ever become available to you while at once causing the body count in each battle to rise dramatically. This makes some sense for certain factions (like the Imperial Guard) but makes less since for other factions. Worse, the Imperial Guard factions still don't have unit sizes which seem to ever be large enough or populous enough while the Space marine units never seem to be durable enough for them to be remotely canonical. The Tau units take casualties far too often as well for them to be canonical. When playing as the Tau or the Eldar the game should penalize you (severely) for taking heavy casualties but it doesn't. All factions require you to heavily rely on infantry before building ANY tanks or other vehicles (making the game all too command and conquer styled for my tastes) and units do not seem to ever level up or gain any experience for being in combat which further decreases this game's tactical depth. Ideally, Imperial guard units should automatically include huge numbers of soldiers and some tanks should be available from the outset. Tau forces should heavily rely on tanks and their APC units from the outset. Necrons should be very, very, very slow (much slower than they are shown to be in this game) but almost indestructible. Space Marines should be much, much more durable but much, much fewer in number. (Remember, in Warhammer 40k, there is said to be fewer space marines than inhabited planets in the galaxy) and they cannot afford to lose the sheer numbers they lose in this game (and neither can the Tau or the Eldar or the Necrons). Since all the factions play so similarly to each other (and none of them truly play like they really should) the tactical options are severely limited as a result and the battles are, as a direct result, much, much more repetitious and uninteresting than they could have been. From what I can tell from reading a few of the Warhammer 40k codexes, what we have here in these Dawn of War games is not really Warhammer 40k, but something with its name that sort of looks like it but doesn't really feel much like it. Still, the world of Warhammer 40k is a big one and so there's some room for my suspension of disbelief. However, this game should also be highly commended for the sheer variety of factions which it attempted to include and everything it did well about each faction (especially their voices and sounds they make when responding to orders). The great many factions and thus the great many campaigns which this game includes greatly adds replay value to this game. My Tau campaign lasted over 30 hours. I'd imagine other campaigns would take just as long as well.The Bad:- The singleplayer campaign is blatantly unfair. In the single player campaign, battles wherein you attempt to attack and take over enemy strongholds or main bases all have additional, almost unfair objectives which must be completed. (I found the Necron main-base to be worst because the mission would automatically fail if you failed to get your little commander-unit out alive (and this is not true in any other battle and that particular battle tried hard to make this objective particularly difficult resulting in some frustration.) Now needing to complete extra objectives to take over an enemy base is fine, if the game was fair about it but this game isn't remotely fair about this-EVER. If an enemy attacks YOUR main base then you only have one or two little bases and all the CPU computer enemy has to do to make you lose the ENTIRE game is to destroy those one or two bases. The CPU must complete absolutely no other additional objectives to defeat you. To make matters worse, regardless of which side you play, in terms of number of main-bases you are very nearly always out-matched in every battle, whether you are attacking a main base or not. In the vast majority of battles in the main campaign the enemy has at least 2 main bases when I had just one (and I was playing on EASY difficulty. Indeed, One might think this kind of blatant, in-built unfairness is due to the game's essentially poor AI but this game doesn't seem to have poor AI. The enemy AI actually acted quite well. And, of course, on higher difficulties the AI responds more quickly and acts more aggressively. The AI is at least adequate to provide excellent challenges when all things are equal (though it is of course less creative than a person can potentially be). Honestly, I don't think that the kind of in-built unfairness that I mentioned above needed to exist in this game and it made for a needlessly frustrating experience. However, I should mention that RTS games are generally NOT my main forte. Unless I'm playing Homeworld Cataclysm, RTS games are games I am generally not very good at. Maybe there should be an option programmed in to make the main campaign blatantly unfair or not if those who are great at RTS games need additional challenges (something like a Pro or Expert mode).-Space Marines still look cute and huggable in this game (big feet, little heads, big shoulders, puppet-like animations).

												Fun game with a risk type mode that can be pretty enjoyable, much better than the next one where you have to rebuild everything each time you are attacked in that mode.  Biggest downside is how badly the ai cheats in this, I have played against hackers that feel more legit than this ai. There is no fog of war for computer. The orc Warboss or Necron Lord will teleport right into the middle of your troops that are way in the back behind your front line, and hidden by the fog of war, maybe even infiltrated and land right in the middle of them constantly. Jump pack troops will perfectly time their double jump to coincide with this, and all of them perfectly skirt the range of your turrets when it suits them. Makes the game more challenging but you watch a few replays and its hard not to feel you are getting cheated.Soulstorm is the one to play, (though ai will behave the same as already noted) unless you are wanting to play the campaign mode and NOT rebuild 100% of the map everytime you defend since it also has Dark Eldar and the Sisters to play. Except for those two things games are nearly identical.			"

												This is a great game.Its not like the two original games Dow 1 and Winter Assault in terms of campaign, instead it has a map where you conquer provinces; each with their own unique conquest gift, such as: Honor Guard. They is a mechanic where you can develop your character with certain new items, which can turn the tide of battle. Overall you can play as seven different factions, this gives it alot of repaly value.The AI may not be as intelligent as Soulstorm; which is a lesser game however, on hard difficulty they can still give you a run for your money.The only issue the have with the game is that their is a certain balance issue with Necrons however, it doesn't spoil the game one bit.

												Fun game with a risk type mode that can be pretty enjoyable, much better than the next one where you have to rebuild everything each time you are attacked in that mode.  Biggest downside is how badly the ai cheats in this, I have played against hackers that feel more legit than this ai. There is no fog of war for computer. The orc Warboss or Necron Lord will teleport right into the middle of your troops that are way in the back behind your front line, and hidden by the fog of war, maybe even infiltrated and land right in the middle of them constantly. Jump pack troops will perfectly time their double jump to coincide with this, and all of them perfectly skirt the range of your turrets when it suits them. Makes the game more challenging but you watch a few replays and its hard not to feel you are getting cheated.Soulstorm is the one to play, (though ai will behave the same as already noted) unless you are wanting to play the campaign mode and NOT rebuild 100% of the map everytime you defend since it also has Dark Eldar and the Sisters to play. Except for those two things games are nearly identical.			"

												This is a great game.Its not like the two original games Dow 1 and Winter Assault in terms of campaign, instead it has a map where you conquer provinces; each with their own unique conquest gift, such as: Honor Guard. They is a mechanic where you can develop your character with certain new items, which can turn the tide of battle. Overall you can play as seven different factions, this gives it alot of repaly value.The AI may not be as intelligent as Soulstorm; which is a lesser game however, on hard difficulty they can still give you a run for your money.The only issue the have with the game is that their is a certain balance issue with Necrons however, it doesn't spoil the game one bit. Overall however this is a great game and is well worth the money. Hope you enjoy! "

												An oldie, but a true gem. I could not recommend this game more. If you are a fan of RTS games that have large scale battles, much like Company of Heroes, then this is definitely the game for you. It is truly a classic! The gameplay is fairly straightforward, which makes it simple to pick up, yet difficult to master. A simple way to put it would be:If you like Halo Wars and Starcraft, then buy it!			"

												As my first introduction to the Warhammer 40K universe, this was probably the most affordable and true-to-form I could get with this game. I've always known of the 40K universe but never thouht about officially dabbling in it myself. However upon catching this game on sale for a killer price I decided to try my luck at it.Turns out, I can't get enough of the game now. It has startegy elements that favour those who would charge the enemy and use brute force to run through their base.My personal favourite was using Chaos to send a Deamon Prince alongside an enormous amount of cultists into the enemy base and watching the carnage unfold.That said the game isn't without its issues. While some races have massive starting advantages, such as the Orks and Space Marines, those who favour Necrons or Imperial Guard have to scramble almost instantly or risk being put on the end of a pike.The game is unbalanaced is what I'm trying to say, as again with said Orks you can just build exclusively WAAAAUUUUGH towers and then your base is defended and you can spawn 100 Orks to meat shield their way into a base. Though may the emprorer have mercy on your soul when the Imperial Guards trudge their way at you with with 40 ♥♥♥♥ing Baneblades all aimed right at your head. They will and I repeat will ruin the entire game for you so be wary of that. The computer also cheats hardcore to get an edge on you that I swear makes the Necron campaign in particular almost unplayable even on easy.However that brings me to the best part about this game, the lore. I love seeing how each race interacts with one another as well as how each one plays, as they all have drastically different play styles.Imperial Guard gets a massive tank that can slaughter everything in sightChaos gets their deamonsOrks get stupidly high numbersNecrons never diePlay the game for yourself and find the rest.This game gets an 8/10.

												I bought this game when it came out on CD, before I ever thought of having a Steam account.  This game is still as good as it was then.Dark Crusade, the capstone of the Dawnw of War Original Series.  I recieved it in the platinum edition box with DoW 1 and Winter Assault, and I have played through all of the campaigns, some several times.  This game, combined with all of the content from the other two games, is one of the best RST titles I have ever played.The gameplay is not only rock solid, it is smooth and fluid for every faction.  I had more fun playing this RTS than any other, and I certainly spent more time on these multiplayer servers than any other RTS game in my library.  It might not have the best graphics nowadays, but it runs superbly on my (Win7) newer machine.  It is an easy game to get into, and it's very fun to play (even to lose at).One of the best RTS games you can purchase.			"

												Picture a game of Risk. Now imagine that everytime you attacked a territory or were attacked you had to play out an RTS game with how powerful you are based on the troop points you had going into it. NOW imagine that when you fight in the same territory again all of your structures remain from the previous battle. That is Dark Crusade in a nutshell. If you're a fan of strategy games and the Warhammer 40K franchise then you will love this game. It's a standalone expansion to the original dawm of war with almost all the major factions and a variety of different play styles. One playthrough I went Necron using my Crypt Lord and fully upgraded monolith to teleport around the map as an army of two and obliterate the enemies key structures. The next time I played Tau making squads of stealth suits that would divide and conquer the map causing the enemies main force to always be in the wrong position.Grab it through a sale or any other kind of bundle and it will be well worth your time and money.

												What an amazing expansion. Not one but TWO new races, both of them awesome and so different to the existing 5. The DVD cover was reversable, so you could favour Tau or Necrons, with awesome artwork on both sides. This game has such fond memories for me. I was loving Winter Assault multiplayer and playing it non stop for what was probably a couple of years, and then this bad boy was announced and it was most exciting thing ever. And the game didn't disappoint. What it added was EVEN MORE variety. Two massively different new races with some new concepts (no requisition for necrons!!?) made the game feel unlimited. We already had 5 completely different races and every multiplayer game was different, with a varying combination of races, map, and players. Sure there are some balance issues and a couple of technical issues but these are completely forgivable when the game is this good and even more so when you know the rest of this story (Soulstorm..DOW2..)A golden age of RTS, the climax of Dawn of War.

												I played this for hundreds of hours when it came out, I only recently was able to get my boxed copy transferred to Steam though (thanks Sega Support!) anyway, I wanted to let everyone know how great the Dawn of War series is, especially Dark Crusade. As a fan of RTS games and Warhammer, I had to get Dawn of War, and I am glad I did. To this day the Dawn of War series is one of, if not my most favorite RTS series out there. If you are even remotely interested in the game I urge you to look further, there are alot of different Dawn of War games you can buy, I am sure that if your taking the time to read this review you will at least find one of the Dawn of War games to your liking!Dark Crusade, like all the ""standalone expansions"" of the Dawn of War series, adds new maps, a new single player campaign, and one of more new races to choose from. Dark Crusade itself adds playable Necron, and Tau Races, and an Overhauled single player campaign experience. Overall though, I have got to say out of the 4 original Dawn of War games, DoW, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm, I think Dark Crusade was my most favorite. I however am not counting any of the Dawn of War 2 games in that decision, as I have not played them all. In the end, I hope my Review has helped you decide whatever you where interested in, good luck in finding what game is right for you!			"

												Always going to be a classic, and the best of the Dawn of War 1 games. Has what I can only describe as kinda RPG elements to it with your commander leveling up and becoming more powerful as you capture, reinforce and defend different regions that grant bonuses like attacking any area or expanding your honour guard. And the Tau and Necron are easily, in my opinion, the coolest 2 races you could put together for an expandalone like this.			"

												Dark Crusade sets you in the over-the-top-ridiculousness that is Dawn of War. The Campaign is narrated by one of the most coolest narrators I've ever listened to. I'd look up his name for this review, but it's 5am. As you begin and end your campaign your adventers will be narrated in an epic voice, and you can immerse yourself into the world of Dawn of War. The cutscenes are whimsical and magical in a way I can't describe, like with the Orks, and the Necrons, the game presents itself with a certain type of charm that I can't forget. Dawn of War 2 didn't give me the same kind of character and gameplay that this game delivers. Dawn of War - Dark Crusade brings you on an epic adventure, to an epic Campaign. The game's narrator makes your actions feel truly noble, brutal, or just downright awesome. The gameplay can't be compared to something like starcraft or command&conquer, it is a truly unique way of presenting RTS with requisition and relic resources. It's simple, makes some sense, and effective.The gameplay itself centers it's focus on your units and their various personalities. Like with the Imperial Officers shooting their own soldiers to gain morale, or the awesome Necrons and their units. The game's Campaign is just fantastic and epic, with a charisma that is almost on par with the Disney movies, but for gamers who love Dawn of War. Dawn of War-Dark Crusade, a game I can't forget.

												Easily my favorite RTS of all time!There was sooo much about  what made the original DoW series great that was completely forgotten in the DoW2 series. I personally think that this was even better than the final installment  in the DoW series ""Soul Storm"", as the single player campaign was way more immersive in this one. The massive scale epic battles of the original DoW series have been replaced for smaller more tactical combat these days, and thats not what 40k should be about. The MP was a perfect balance (starcraft 2 style) spread amongst very wildly different races and species. This game and Space Marine I think completely nailed the feeling of what 40K should feel like in video games. Had it not been for ""Last stand"" mode I might not have even bought the new series.  I have put more hours into this game than any other in my history of PC gaming, (played the boxed version so don't let Steam playtime fool you) and recommend it for any RTS fans , and a must own for fans of 40K.

So I went ahead & got it on steam as well as a few friends so we could play LAN together but to our surprise the LAN option was missing from the steam release which was a real downside for us since most of us had pretty terrible internet and it seemed like quite the odd thing to remove for such an old game. We did attempt to play locally using the online way but everything was far to laggy to be enjoyable so I am leaving this review as a warning to people who are looking to play LAN and or have terrible internet.Pros-	On steam-	Now has steam integration-	Amazing RTS, it’s great to play solo or with a few friends-	Not likely to lag your computer-	Does not feel too dated for its age ;3-       Online works well when you have access to reasonable internetCons-	Removed LAN for the steam release Rating the Original Box Copy 9/10Steam Copy 7/10 for missing features			"

It features also good multiplayer (although it could be better), and interestingly resolved single-player campaign. This is a fairly simplistic game - in terms of the number of controlled units and buildings, and the complexity can be compared to Warcraft 3 If you are looking for games suitable for a loose network play - it's worth.

												A great Age of Empires type game. The Eldar,Tau,Necrons,Orks,Imperal Gaurd,Space Marines,and Chaos all want control over Kronus! This is where you pick one of those 7 nations and lead them to victory in an addicting Risk-like campaign. If you don't like the campaign then you can play in a skirmish mode, or online. Despite some few bugs this game is great.			"

												Classic RTS meets a fairly interesting meta game in this one. The meta game / take over a planet by winning maps of the individual territories supplements a story, but it provides a wonderful excuse to play all other races in the game. And there are many to choose from with distinct playstyles. Tau are shooty from range. Space Marines are what you would expect. Necron are like reanimating space zombie hordes. Fun stuff.			"

												Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War - Dark Crusade is good, solidly prepared RTS with relatively aesthetically presenting a transparent graphics and UI. It features also good multiplayer (although it could be better), and interestingly resolved single-player campaign. This is a fairly simplistic game - in terms of the number of controlled units and buildings, and the complexity can be compared to Warcraft 3 If you are looking for games suitable for a loose network play - it's worth. If the extremely elaborate campaigns, diplomacy, economics and inspiring storyline - search on :).			"

												Perhaps my favorite RTS of all time.  I started playing Warhammer 40k on the tabletop in the early 90's and this game represents my ideal simulation of that experience.  The flavor and atmosphere of 40k is perfectly represented, and the game itself plays great with no bugs that I've ever encountered.  There are 6 factions to play, and each requires a very different approach to the game.  The only downside is that the campaign map and faction placement are always the same in every game, so it can get quite repetitive to play through the campaign with each faction.  That said, there's always skirmish mode, and an enormous amount of user-created maps and mods out there to play with.  If you never played this game, you're missing out.			"

												In the Emperors name, you will purchase this game.Whether you're a w40k fan or a real time strategy game fan, you'll love Dark Crusade.It's incredibly fun, you'll be charging into battle with your enemies, constantly repeating anything your units say.If you've played the original game of Dawn of War, you'll definitely feel at home with Dark Crusade, it's more of the same but much much better. Based on a world map that you can invade other provinces instead of following a campaign story is much better.The W40k universe is so huge and so fantastic that you'll be fascinated by the Imperium of Man with their Soldiers, or the God Emperors Space Marines, the dark necrons, or Chaos Space Marines... Or perhaps the Eldar or even the technological Tau with their Greater Good philosophy (or the orcs... but who likes them? ;) Haha).Set on the planet Kronus, you'll find yourself in the middle of a bloody war, a dark crusade. Where one faction will triumph and the total annihilation of all others. Make sure that it is YOUR faction. You can play as any of the W40k factions that you've grown to know and love... Or at least you'll come to know and love if you haven't experienced a W40k game yet though.Don't let the franchise fool you though, it's very easy to get into the frachnise, this was the first W40k game I've ever played (back in 2006) and I've played all of them since (and the ones before). I'm not a fan of the figures or the board game though, even though the games are based on it... Shh! Plus the CGI movies/clips are awesome. The whole W40k universe is fascinating.Anyway, about the game.It's a typical real time strategy game, construct buildings, construct units from buildings, defeat the enemy. That's a simple run down of it anyway. All of the maps are static too. So when you've built a base in a province, if you're invaded, your base will be exactly the same as it was when you first built it. But any buildings destroyed in the next battle will be gone, but also new buildings will stay obviously. So definitely plan ahead when you first build in a province. (SPOILER: I've found myself trapping an enemy in a small corner of a map and building a huge base all over the map before I destroy them, so that my huge base is persistant if anyone invades it... But that's kinda cheating hehe)It's a very fun game, but don't take my word for it, check out videos of it on YouTube and many of the other reviews of this game.If you enjoyed this game, be sure to get SoulStorm, it's practically an expansion of this game and includes another faction, instead of battling all over Kronus, you'll be battling across an entire solar system on a variety of planets instead!Get everything W40k""So long as the enemies of man still draw breath there can be no peace.""""Ever vigilant.""

												One of the best games when it comes to Warhammer 40k.Can get pretty hectic but is very polished ( for its time ) and feels unlike most other ''standard'' RTS. With good voice acting and well made models feels pretty authentic, at least for someone who hasn't played the tabletop game but loves the lore and universe. Also as a cherry on top I personally love the banter the individual commanders have when sieging a stronghold.Another plus is the fact that even though this is only a expansion for another game it also acts as a standalone for the single player campaign and skirmish.

												Amazing, fantastic, well polished. My favourite of the original DoW series by far. Haven't played this for a few years now and it runs on my current rig maxed out with high persistant bodies giving me a game of maximum carnage. I think first time around I must have played all the races. This time I am starting with the Tau because I like their toys. DC has an excellent single player story as you crusade your army across the planet. The game runs like a dream, in fact a hell of a lot faster than I recall. If you have never played DC let alone the DoW series, where the hell have you been living? Under a rock. Go and play them now or wait for a sale and get a brilliant title for next to nothing. Even the multiplayer has been kept alive by the devs. Now thats what I call devotion.Most deservedly a 10/10			"

I genuinely believe this is the closest we ever got to having a PC action/RTS adaptation of the tabletop model game.

In my unpaid, unprofessional opinion there is nothing close to the DC campaign in any of the other titles in the series.  In addition, the characters are better (with the possible exception of DoW's Gabriel Angelos) and the voice overs don't feel as forced as in Soulstorm.  The graphics are actually really good for when the game was released and Jeremy Soule's music is a nice, not-too-overbearing backdrop to the carnage.  Makes Starcraft look like the play area at McDonald's.  Pure sci-fi RTS perfection.			"

												The best in the Original Dawn of War line up of games. It has the most content, best unit types and class blancing, best campaign, and huge amounts of non linear freedom across a massive battle map between 7 factions. There are some real bull**** momments when enemies are just flat out going to win because they get 12 honor guards to ""zerg rush"" you with and happen to be warlord Gorgutz... every time... oveerall it's a fantastic but still traditional RTS that adds a welth of ideas to its campign with most of them paying off. Easily 20 hours of content for 1 faction playthrough on Normal, and the Blood Ravens campaign is the canonical one story wise for future DoW titles to reference.9/10, would be ravaged by Gorgutz again... and again... ugh, Gorgutz...

												Very good real time strategy game. Similar to starcraft but with an overall map campaign that plays just like Rise of Nations but even better! As you conquer more maps, you upgrade the armor and weapons of your main commander making him that much more powerfull and dangerous. You also gain all kind of bonuses to beat the remaining oponents more easily.There are a lot of factions to choose (8+) and each one play very differently (except the space marine and chaos marines, which are very similar because the chaos marines are space marines converted to the chaos side). The necron for example have very slow ground units so you must build them in big waves and then you send them slowly grinding your ennemies! They are quite resilient but you ain't going to zerg the ennemy with them. And once you get your citadel flying, then boom! nuclear attack all the time on the ennemy! heheheThe ai is pretty rough even at normal difficulty. Prepare to be zerged fast in the maps you choose! Also, i noticed that the number on the map which is supposed to give you an overall difficulty factor for taking that territory is pointless. I've taken big number territory with ease and been destroyed in an instant on territory with a one difficulty rating! So i would not give too much importance to that number. From what i've seen of the factions, the chaos and space marine seem to be the toughest to beat. They are fast even with their infantry, they got troops that can fly and bypass all your defense while striking in your backline and they are tought. A bit unfair for the other factions tought.			"

 An excellent expansion for DoW, well worth the money.   Pros  Two new races - the Tau Empire and the Necrons Remastered campaign, with a different ending for each race New multiplayer and skirmish maps Fully playable as a standalone Imperial Guard is available in campaign, whether or not you own Winter Assault (!!) Cons  Campaign just sort of tosses you in, with very little explanation The game is clearly made for people who have already played Dawn of War, building on skills learned in the base game Some new game mechanics are confusing (how do I spawn units from my monolith once it's fully restored?!) Pretty much requires at least some basic knowledge of the setting to fully enjoyVerdict: I would highly recommend this to anybody who enjoys RTS games, 40K fan or not.			"

												Now we have the second expansion of the Warhammer 40k series and not only that, but a Warhammer game that makes the campaign a little more interesting to play: by making a world map overview, where you can spend many hours stratergically attempting to conquer other Races and sections of land (similar to the flash Warlord games, I use to play) and earn points to not only enhance your army, but to improve the stats and traits of your commander, as well. The main feature of the Dark Crusade expansion is the two new races: Tau and Necron's. It took me a little while to handle Necron's but once you realize their potential, it is sort of ""gg"" from there. This also means that when you play online with your friends, you pretty much have all the available races. This style of gameplay just expands the amount of hours (depending on how much land you expand) that these games already provide. If you enjoy the Dawn of War Games and you don't have this expansion in your collection, then you are missing out, that is just a fact! 95/100!			"

												Dawn of War: Dark Crusade is arguably the best expansion in the series. It abandoned linearity within the campaign that it's predecessors had and replaced it with a Risk-like game. You have your own region on Kronus and your objective is to build up your army and conquer the other factions on the planet. It was fun, challenging, and refreshing. RTS games have never been good at conveying a story, so rather than waste time and money trying to create a story around characters that are emotionless superhumans built only for war, they went with a big map for you to have your own fun. This in my opinion was a smart decision and gave Relic more room to work with now that they don't have to create a narrative. There are of course the commanders that go back and forth with each other bickering about whose side is better. And while that may sound annoying, they actually did a really great job. The commanders feel like they have more personality and are commited to their cause while not putting the attention entirely on them individually. In my opinion, this was a step in the right direction. Because now the rest of the focus is on the military aspect of 40k (which has always been it's selling point). The Plot Kronus is an Imperium controlled world with a native population of Orks and a ever growing Tau civilization. This has caused many skirmishes throughout the planet's history and has awaken the long dorment Necron hordes. Eldar of Ulthwe come to intercept the Necrons and defeat them before they can fully reawake. Meanwhile the forces of Chaos, the Word Bearers legion arrive to take the planet of Kronus for their own sadistic needs in the name of the Chaos gods. The Orks, riled up more than ever now that there is a full planetary war want to sink their teeth on the battlefield. Led by the infamous Warboos Gorgutz, the Orks push into Tau and Imperium controlled regions to plunder the riches of the land and crush anything in their path.The Tau have called in reinforcements to respond to all of this discord. Taking full advantage of this war distracting their enemies, they are more than willing to take the planet for the greater good. And the Space Marines, mighty warriors of the God Emperor are locked in a conflict of interest with the Imperial Guard. The Guard, refusing to stand down and obey orders from the Space Marines have left the two factions of the Imperium fighting eachother in all out war. The Mutliplayer Because I covered the base factions in my last Dawn of War review I'm just going to talk about the Tau and Necrons. The Tau are a young race of aliens that have advanced in technology at an accelerating rate. Because of this they have access to mobile battle suits, advanced stealth technology, and raw fire power that can turn entire platoons of soldiers into nothing more but stains on the battlefield. I find them to be borderline over powered in Dark Crusade. They simply deal waaaay too much damage far too quickly. Have a decked out squad of Guardsmen? Not anymore! Their only Achilles heel is melee. Units like Chaos Raptors or Assault Marines can make short work of Tau Fire Warriors. The problem is, not all factions have melee units with jetpacks... Now a lot of people on the forums would strongly disagree with me that on-foot melee units like Banshees can get in Tau ranged lines. But if you are fighting an intelligent player that knows his or her weaknesses as Tau, those Banshees will be knocked down to a quarter of their squad size by the time they reach the Fire Warriors. And since most Tau players build two to three squads of Fire Warriors, expect them to be shooting the remaining Banshees.Other than just the insane amount of power they have, they're a decent faction. They lack defense turrets in their base, which means that if you attack a Tau base they have no other option but to send their forces back to support their base. This in my opinion is a reasonable weakness and doesn't make the Tau nigh unstoppable. Eldar can easily use this weakness to their advantage so it leaves some options.The Necrons....I don't know what's worse, the fact that they are completely broken or that they are possibly the most boring faction to play as. They're ungodly slow, have no satisfaction to their gameplay whatsoever, and they are so hard to kill that it makes easter egg hunts for Eldar bases at the end of a game look fun. If you are new to Dawn of War DO NOT play Necrons first. They will suck all of the fun you could be having in the game out of you leaving you with a bitter taste in your mouth. Necrons are however fun to play against with friends in team games. But outside of being just a good bad guy to fight, they aren't worth playing. Unless of course you want to be a troll and ruin everyone's day with Pariah's. The Final Verdict It's a 9/10. The campaign was great, some of the balance changes for the other factions were decent, and the two new factions were a welcomed addition despite the questionable balance behind them. However because of the two additional factions and their balance issues I have to count it as a negative. It's like no one at Relic thought about it ""oh yeah! Space terminators that can never die and are slow as ♥♥♥♥ to progress with will be fun!"" The lack of mods is also unfortunate because that means you have to get Soulstorm for mods like Ultimate Apocolypse. But overall Dark Crusade is a must buy if you are getting the base game of Dawn of War.PS: As always leave a comment if you have an opinion on the review or how to make it better. I'm always interested to hear from other perspectives.			"

												Yes, yes, yes.This is the best RTS I have ever played. I usually don't like RTS but I absolutely LOVE Dawn of War. This game has such an immersive, epic, dark and warmongering feel to it. You just enter battle and you hear the Ork soundtrack start with the drums and all in your mind is ""Cleanse! Purge! KILL!""This game doesn't feature all the races in Warhammer 40k but it does feature most of them, and the ones left out have been implemented into the game by modders, such as Tyranids. Relic surprised me with how accurate this is to the lore and the tabletop game. Even the resource costs of troops is the same as the cost for troops on the tabletop (in the tabletop you have X amount of points to spend in a battle for your troops and more powerful troops cost more points). I haven't actually played the Dawn of War and Winter Assault campaigns because I think linear RTS campaigns are among the most boring things in this whole world, but Dark Crusade features a unique and awesome campaign mode. (Soulstorm has this campaign aswell but in much larger scale.)You start the campaign by choosing one of the races; Space Marines, Orks, Eldar, Chaos Space Marines, Tau, Necrons or Imperial Guard. All the races control different areas on a planet and then take turns assaulting other's areas with your hero, conquering them, gaining resources and honour guard (units that accompany your leader in battle who are more powerful than normal units) to spend on buying troops for all your areas or buying honour guard units. You can also unlock new gear for your hero, such as new ranged or melee weapons, better armor that give different perks, certain gear gives abilities like teleport and such, and to eradicate a race you have to assault their strongholds, and those battles have lots of different objectives and side objectives you have to do to win, like destroying different bases and if you want to, destroying bases that provide certain powerful units for the enemy so that the final push will be easier. I remember when I tried to take the Tau stronghold as Space Marine and the battle went on for like 1½ hour because they just kept harassing my base.If you want a hell of a good RTS in one of the coolest, if not the coolest sci-fi universe out there, then this is totally the game for you. I'm not sure if it's still here but there's a platinum version of the game to buy which gives you Dawn of War, Winter Assault and Dark Crusade for 9,99€, I can't find it anymore though. If you manage to find it and you're a RTS fan, then do buy it because it's more than worth it, I assure you.			"

												Dark Crusade has been one of the best purchases I have ever made. The campaign is simple but fun and has great story arc. Only Problem with it is I just can't understand why imperial fights imperial. Oh well.However the real treat is multiplayer. Just grab some friends and it'll be a blast. Chat on skype and you'll wonder why you played anything else. The multiplayer has some issues though including that it doesn't run steam so you can't directly invite anyone.Other problems include mouse moves out of game and into second monitor so disable it and the problem will sort itself.Overall great game and probably the best RTS ever (in my opinion). I give this game 9/10.			"

												Not too sure what to say about this one. with this one they have changed the game entirely since Winter Assult and instead you are on a map. You have to take over territories, each giving a boon of somekind and the game is over when you have driven all other races off the planet.With this change there are quite a few interesting things to note.1. Your general is upgradable. By accomplishing certain things you can upgrade your general in various ways which gives him/her boons. For example, one upgrade made it so Taldeer can spot infiltration enemies and another gave her the ability to regenerate faster and those of troops around her.2. Certain missions are far more than simply (destroy enemy HQ) and involve more difficult tasks like collecting a number of units or destroying certain objectives. All this makes it feel like they actually put thought into it.3. Invading the Homebase. The homebase battles are absolutely EPIC! Definantly buy this if you have the others.			"

												CLEANSE! PURGE! KILL!- Space MarinesThis is one of my favourite games I have played. I owned the disk version first before steam, this game is amazing and is a must have for RTS lovers, especially those that love the Warhammer universe. You'll have a blast destroying your enemies. But take note that easy difficulty for the AI is pretty crap but when it says easy, it means EASY! no real effort needed to destroy your enemy. Standard difficulty is alright but for experienced players, they can deal with this, experienced players that want a good challenge, choose the hard difficulty or higher, it gets incredibly difficult and there are about 3 or 4 harder difficulties to choose from, hard on an 8 player map, it is going to be intense and it is going to get bloody.Summary: Don't choose easy, it is ironically way too easy.NOTE- This game used to be powered by GameSpy, and multiplayer is a big question, can we do it if we were to buy it today? The answer is yes, the servers have been transferred to steam, the game wasn't left for dead when GameSpy shut down. Multiplayer works and is functional. Note that if you don't own the original game or the winter assualt expansion, you will only be able to play as 2 of the 7 races in multiplayer, if you own the original game and this but not winter assualt, you will have access to 6 out of the 7 races in multiplayer. If you get this game, get your friends to get it as well, it is a great game to play with friends.CD keys are not needed to play multiplayer like it did for the disk versions of the game, instead you must simply have the games installed to gain access to races in multiplayer.

With 7 races to play from; Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Necrons (monoliths are op nerf plz), Chaos, Orks, and Tau, in an immersive campaign mode and many skirmish maps, you will absolutely not regret this game. My suggestion is that you purchase this if/when it goes on sale, as £10 for a game this old is slightly taking the mickey, but it is worth.

												Warhhammer 40k: DOW Dark Crusade is a brilliant stand alone and add-on game. The multi-player is awesome, especially with friends and the single plyer campain is fun and tactical and has lots of replay value. Great game.10/10 You must get this game if you want to be addicted to something awesome.			"

												Dawn of War 1 is my favorite RTS of all time, but no one plays it. That's okay though, because the single player campaign in Dark Crusade is really great! The DoW1 package goes on sale ALL the time, so don't pay more than 10 bucks for the game and all the expansions.			"

												I really like this game and I just finished the campaign a moment ago (for the Blood Ravens). Dawn of War Dark Crusade is an expansion to Relic's real time strategy game Dawn of War, which is set in the Warhammer 40, 000 universe of table top wargames. I highly recommend it to any real time stategy fan who loves the grittines and toughness of battles which are primarily set in a distopian future where every alien you meet wants to kill you and eat you for jujubes :D, and that's not all; Your government, which is the Grand Imperium of Man, constantly drafts new recruits in the billions in order to sacrifice to The Emeperor, who uses His powerful psychic mind in order to stave the forces of Super Hell (or Chaos for short) which constantly gobbles up any known dangerous substances in order to get high for the dark gods. The 7 major races are The Blood Ravens; The Emperor's own space marines who came to the planet Kronus to search for the secrets of their lost history. The Ork's or should I say 'Da Orks', only come for the tendency of following their Ork Chieftains for the sake of the Waaaagh!!!! in order to satuate their cravings for constant battle. The Eldar, a mysterious alien race which are a splinters of their former empire 10, 000 years prior to the 41st millenium, have come to Kronus in order to stop their ancient enemies, known as the Necrons, from rising from their tomb worlds and purging the galaxy clean of all sentient life. The Necrons were metallic warriors who slumbered eons ago iduring the aftermath, which in Eldar legend was in the aftermath of the so called 'War in Heaven'. Then there are the imperial guard, chaos and the tau (my favourite), and for that YOU can explore for yourself. For the 4 races I've mentioned there is a ton of lore to explore and unfortunately I cannot tell you all of it. If you think Halo, Startrek  and Starwars had tons of lore, you have never read the Lore of 40k, it is just a massive game world that you need to delve into. As for this game I give a solid 9/10. Please relic in the name of the emperor, where is Dawn of War 3?			"

												I Played this game, from release to now.Game has a wonderful array of units and armies which creates a unique universe to fight in. With 7 playable races and a million ways to play them you're not likely to run out of ways to kill stuff in this game. Best way to play the game is with 2 or 3 mates whilst in skype calls. You can really get involved in the competitiveness of base building and accumulating an army. Whether your making a turtle style base,crawling with turrets and snipers or rushing with bulky green aliens the game is fun at any stage of play from the first seconds to the 15 minutes where someone runs into your barely prepared base with an army of necrons.Campaign is just a series of skirmishes and leaves something to be desired in the area of voice acting and storyline, however it doesn't mean it's not fun. You can have fun in moving from battle to battle. The campaign is a solid The Game has a high degree of unit customization and army painting that makes your army unique to you, the more effort you put into the look of your army the more you can get behind it. Graphics are great and still hold after 9 years! pictures don't show just how good the game looks. All in all the game is in my opinion one of a kind and an unforgettable RTS experience. If RTS and army building is what gets you hard then this game will leave you with a raging erection. "

												A good (and old) Strategy game. The game might get boring since it repeats itself pretty much but it is still very good. It has also different races such as: Orks, Eldars, Necrons, Chaos etc. The choosing of which troop to use might be a bit awkward but when you play it for some time you get used to it. Since it's an old game it doesn't have so great graphics but the graphics are not the most important thing.Also if you're new to this game or these kind of games I prefer you to start with Necrons. They're the best race to begin with if you are learning to play :)			"

  WAAAAAUUGHIt's not a bad game and it actually makes the war feel like a war. If you like RTS's this game needs to be in your collection.  If you are new to RTS's this is a good middle of the road game to wet your feet with. There are better games but this is a good game in its own right.You fight against other races for control of provinces which you must then defend and so on..  Quite nice and unique for an RTS of the time. Only problem is this makes it rather shallow in the story department.Where else is this game shallow, Game play. There is a finite number of distinct races an RTS can have and that number seems to be about 4.  There are 7 playable factions in this game and only about 3 playstyles between them. You'll very quickly figure out  the optimal squad composition and never have a reason to vary from it. So the game play is a little shallow. Fun, but shallow .One glaring negative though is the cheating. Now it's a given that RTS games cheat a little. This one cheats a lot and quite brazenly at that. See there is a unit cap imposed, and this will always make missions dicey. Now I should explain there is a bonus called Forward Base , that allows you to start any attack mission with certain basic structures already build, for a fee. As far as the PC is concerned. It always has forward base active regardless of whether or not he obtained the bonus.. Whether you attack or defend the enemy will always have two pre-built bases.  Remember the unit cap I mentioned. Well each of these two bases basically counts as an individual player. so the end eresult is that the enemy will always have double the unit cap you do and this includes elite hero units as well. Never mind that for some of the races there are certain structures that the pc is allowed to place in ways that are outright against the gamne's rules . The Tau listening post upgrades can only be built  on strategic points when you control the tau. When you fight against the Tau you will find these defense turrets placed and where the pc wants. So the game cheats, hard.If you don't mind the cheating however, the game is pretty fun. It's a great spectacle RTS.  The combat and skirmishes are always fun to watch and the reenforcement mechanic means you have to keep a close eye on your units and  thusly keeps the battles quite engaging.All in all this is a decent RTS. Not as good as the Blizzard RTS's or THe Red Alert games , but a solid RTS in its own right.  Give it and the other expansions a try. So far I can recomend this over Soulstorm, the next game in the series, because, to be honest,  It has a tighter focus and the factions have a more unique feel.			"

												Dark Crusade was probably my favorite RTS throughout my college years. While my friends were busy playing Starcraft, commanding the forces of Terrans, Protoss, and Zerg, I was busy fighting wars in the 41st Millennium, taking on foes ten times my greater and defeating them with honor and earning glory. This was also the version of Warhammer 40K's Dawn of War series that got me into modding, giving me a sweet, sweet taste of what the penultimate prize of Modding experience would be promised to me upon getting Soulstorm.If you've ever gotten the previous two, Dawn of War and Winter Assault, you'd know gameplay-wise that nothing's really changed. However, with the addition of two new factions; the popular Necrons and the mysteriuos Tau Empire; and new units for all other factions (including Grey Knights for the Blood Ravens, which remains my favorite unit choice to this day), it definitely shines in front of its predecessors. That, and with an awesome campaign where you can play not just one but all seven factions, promising continuous replayability even after you've beaten the campaign once...there's nothing here that's not to like.I'd be a fool not to recommend Dark Crusade. Any RTS player would be a fool to deny that this game stood the test of time. Stop reading the review, fork out some cash or grab that debit/credit card, and get the sodding game. The best part about it all is that the multiplayer options are compatible with all versions and are standalone, so you only need one game to have fun. I recommend giving it a go, it's worth it. Let's keep this game alive. For the Emperor			"

												while the gameplay and the charactarisation of the original dawn of war are here there is no compelling story. the game plays out on a risk-like board. with RTS battles happening for all territories. every faction has a base that must be taken in order to win the campain. while these missions since they are more than simple bot matches (due to different objectives and conditons.) are interesting the rest is just filler. it would have been cooler if they'd just released those missions as a campain with a story regarding a few key characters from all the factions in the vain of the original game. if you loved the first one don't bother with this filler.

												Great game, don't get me wrong, but if you're buying this to unlock the races, don't. Apparently steam is no longer generating CD keys for this, Winter Assault, and Soulstorm. Meaning to use each race, you have to start it's respective game, and they don't link. the only one that works properly is the Dawn of War GOTY Edition. So in short, if you're only going to buy this, buy the GOTY because there's more races. You can only have one.			"

												So this is like Dawn of War as a 4x game. There is map with provinces and you can choose where to attack. Sounds cool right? Well, the problem is that there is a reinforce mechanic. You basically buy units to protect a province and when the enemy attacks you, you start with those units. So the defender has a HUGE advantage. There is a counter to it but it doesn't really work. The attacker can start with units but you have to unlock them by conquering provinces...which you can't do because you don't have them yet!And then the enemy can reinforce like 3x more units than you can so you can't attack him and hope to win. And then for some dumb reason the computer gets 2 bases when he attacks you, but you only get 1 when you are the attacker. So there is a huge bias to the computer.Plus, necrons are OP because they get infinite free units.TL:DR computer has huge advantage, necrons OP			"

Although this, the second expansion to the primary game, features a Risk style campaign with little variance between races, it is still the most satisfying and complete. With SEVEN playable races, each with entirely diferent tech trees and gameplay mechanics, no other game can compete. This is better than Starcraft, dare I say it. Note that it features Squad based combat, in that you control groups of infantry units (Company of Heros is the spiritual sucessor from the same publisher). This allows for massive conflicts that are still manageable and allow for micro-management of abilities. Fans of macro- and micro-management can be equally effective, as different races cater to different strengths.The interface is intuitive and translates easy across all playable races. The sound is impressive and chaotic. The graphics are, well, old. The multiplayer is obviously lacking in players the older the game gets, but is still occupied. A simple tracking system shows you (or warns you) just how good your online opponents will be, but it doesn't force a matchmaking system on you. Dark Crusade embodies everything good and wonderful in the RTS genre, and it is by far and away the best RTS money can buy. I cannot recommend it strongly enough.			"

												This is, in my opinion, the most enjoyable, fun, and action-packed RTS game of all time.  The balance between the 7 playable races is excellent; each one requires slightly different methods of play, but they are not so different as to become confusing.  The space here does not allow me to fully explain why this game is so great, but if you like real-time strategy (or maybe even if you don't) I highly recommend that you try this game.			"

												The Dark Crusade is considered the starting point in my campaign with the Warhammer series probably back in 2007. I always come back to this game year after year because I enjoy the single player and multiplayer game modes that include all the races unlocked out of the gate. The single player mode allows you to pick any race and drops you on the map with the rest of the races scattered across the globe. Each section of the map you win provides requisition and other bonuses to your army. The turn based ""Risk style"" mode begins after your first action and then allows each AI a turn in capturing territories. Similar to other RTS games, Dark Crusade is no different and allows you to construct buildings, vehicles and troops. The maps in each territory are littered with capture points that you will need to grab before your opponent in order to gain resources to expand your base. While there isn't much story in the campaign beyond the first introduction scene, more details will unfold as you begin to win battles against the other opponents when you capture their strongholds. The main character for each race is also outfitted with war gear as you fulfill certain requirements throughout Dark Crusade. Once you start conquering section of the map, rest assured that each race will take opportunites to invade and try to force you out of the territory. If I could recommend an RTS game then this would be the one out of all the Warhammer games. Whether it is a group of vehicles bombarding soldiers sending them flying or the up close action of Blood Ravens putting the boots to Orks for the Emperor, I feel there is never a dull moment in battle. I think Dark Crusade is the definitive pick over the newer Dawn of War games because of the maps, large scale battles and the non-linear campaign. Your best bet is to pick up the Warhammer collection, which usually pops up on sale. I had hours of time on Dark Crusade when I owned the original disc but had to purchase it again because I lost them.			"

												I love this game, in my opinion of of th Best RTS Games ever made, (for the record I have not played Soulstorm) although I now might after discovering the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod.  Is it perfect? no.  Is it completely balanced in multiplayer? no.  what it is, is fun as hell and very satisfying to play. Dark Crusafe adds a twist to the campaign modes.  Rather than following a linear path of objectives like the previous DOW and Winter assault, it throws in a Meta game where you are fighting for complete control of a Planet, which throws in tactical decisions on where to buy more support for the territory you just won or to bolster an earlier victory site.  I could go on for hours, but I will simply conclude with this, if you are a fan of warhammer 40k, or just love a satisfying base building push and pull RTS, this is a game that must have a spot in your library, you are guaranteed hours of fun!

												Great game! The campaign took me a while to beat and it sure had its challenges. The way the warhammer dawn of war game's is set up is very fun and it had a great story behind it. One of the reasons why I like this game so much is the way that you can organize a battle plan with different factions. For example if you're eldar you will always be outnumbered but you have some of the best soldiers behind your back. With the Imperial Guard it's the complete opposite.

												The definitive edition of Dawn of War, that still hasn't been surpassed, even by it's sequels. One of the best RTS games in the past 10 years, and I've almost been playing it that long. Pros: +Great entry point for everyone looking to get into Warhammer 40,000.+Seven races playable both in the Campaign and Skirmish modes...+...that all feel different and unique to each other. +Campaign features a ""Wargear"" system that lets you upgrade your Commander after certain achievements you get during the length of your campaign, adding an RPG feel to the game. (Ex: Conquer 3 territories, Have a 3:1 unit kill ratio...)+Great voice acting, truly stellar. +Inovative RTS mechanics, at least back when the game came out. Still, they stood and continue to stand the test of time. +Excellent graphics that continue to impress to this day. Especially the unit models, which rival the tabletop game Dawn of War is based on. +Like the Campaign, the Skirmish mode can offer a lot of variety, with good number of maps that can hold up to 8 players and the option to chose from multiple victory conditions (Ex: Destorying the enemy's HQ, Controlling certain points on the map for an amount of time, Assassinating the enemy commander...)+Army painter; A tool you can use to create a unique look for your favorite race. You can even import custom pictures as your army's banner.Cons: -The Easy difficulty in the Campaign is too easy, making your units have five times the health of your opponent's...-...while the other difficulties don't make the AI smarter, just decrease the difference in heatlh.-The Skirmish  AI also leaves something to be desired, as it doesn't get smarter after the ""Standard"" difficulty and instead resorts to cheating.  -Despite the excellent models and detail, some of the textures can look a bit muddy. -When moving in large groups, the unit pathing is horrible, with units moving backwards and vehicles getting stuck.-Some balancing issues. Overall rating: 8/10Highly recommended to RTS players and Warhammer fans alike.			"

												Dark Crusade is as Warhammer as any good Warhammer game can be, it's damn well fun and despite its age still looks pretty decent. There's a lot of good I can say about this game, but a lot of it has been said before so I'll keep this review short:If you enjoy a RTS that focuses on the battle you are fighting and doesn't waste your time with anything that doesn't focus on the battle, this is going to be for you. It's incredibly aggressive, rewarding the sound tactic of 'Throw as many things at it and hope it drowns in all the blood'. Its fun and its full of gore.And its got more maps and races to play as. The Tau and the Necrons both are fun to play as, although the necrons can be a pain to fight when they get enough strength together. However I found out a lot of firepower can deal with the necrons no problem. Until they rise again after you leave.All in all there's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said by a lot of other people. It's a good game, I enjoy it a lot, you probably will too if you like a good RTS.			"

												SO GOODLet me describe this gameso first off i played it on a different account for over 600 hours on record, i love the impereal guard the most badass race in the game, 2nd comes the Eldar if you learn how to master them, 3rd comes the space marines if your master the orbital strikes, 4th comes the tau if you know how to use the stealth teams and the fire warraiors  or however the hell its spelled, 5th comes the necrons very easy to use if you know hhow to use power and love to take risks, 6th are the orks using the squguith is so much fun to use SO MUCH FUN, 7th choas pretty much useless in my opinion.the game is very legit i totally recomend it, i love the game so god damn much i still cant stop playing it  and if you ever need help with the game im right here as a trainer, and remember ""FOR THE EMPORER!!!""

As someone who has played The Warhammer 40k tabletop game since 1998, I can say that it's even more reason to love the game.I can't stop playing Tau and Necrons..   So addicting even though I've always played Eldar on the table.  The only issue I ""slightly"" have is that it's a bit monotonous after a time.  I generally play in spurts.			"

The game is very similar but not identical.TL:DR Warhammer® Dawn of War® - Soulstorm is better, but this is a near bug free alternative, with mods.			"

												Below is my original reveiw for the game; keep in mind I have since resolved the issue and I'm loving the game.""I love this game, I've played it before on another account and it's great, I wish I could recommend it. But unfortuately, after recently buying the a DoW 3 in one pack, including this game, after loading it up and playing it 5 or 6 times, I am now unable to play it. Ever.I spent $20 dollars on this pack and after a mere 21 hours of gameplay an error occured while trying to start the game: ""Failed to initialize video card."" I tried as many possible ""fixes"" as I could find, but it still fails to start. According to many sources, Warhammer has not produced a definite fix for this problem yet.It was great while it lasted but $20 for 20h is not a fair expense in my book.""As I said, I managed to fix the problem and I now definatley reccomend this game to anyone that is a RTS fan!

												Plays very similar to Company of Heroes 1, being made on the same engine, but with less emphasis on cover and micro tactics.  Map control/annihilation is your typical victory condition.The game revolves around skirmish mode.  You and your opponent have bases on a map, now go and kill eachother.  Not a particularly strong single-player experience unless you just love comp-stomps (no ""story"" to speak of), but multiplayer and skirmish mode are very enjoyable.  The numerous factions manage to be different, but well balanced in power.Something any RTS fan with a buddy or two to play with should consider.  Recommend buying Master Collection when it's on sale (often goes for 50%+ off) to get multiplayer access to all races without editing your registry.			"

												As far as Warhammer games go, this one is at the top. It balances the campaigns and skirmishes better than Soulstorm. Necrons and Tau are forces to be reckoned with. 9/10Pros:Fun, fast-paced combatCustomizeable leaders and you can pick your honor guard.Just enough depth for both casual gamers and hardcore fans to enjoy.Cons:Some of the voice acting, especially for the Chaos builder units, is incredibly annoying. Most are OK, but quite a few of the soundbites get said so often it really makes you want to give a blood sacrifice to Khorne. But hey, Blood for the Blood God, ya know? Battles tend to get out of hand, with an intense amount of juggling to keep things going (especially with the flimsy Imperials).			"

												Main selling point? Second greatest RTS campaign ever (Only surpassed by Starcraft 2: Wings of liberty IMHO).It's basically risk, only with fun battles instead of dice rolls! Heck even some of the special maps are crafted with care that a campaign mission would be (Try eldar and invade the ork stronghold, Farseer Taldeer and Warboss Golgutz will go at it!).Oh yeah, Tau and necron are stupid fun armies as well!Mind you this is an X-Pack, while it is playable as a standalone, if you want to play all the armies you'll need the base Dawn of War, and Winter Assault, otherwise you'll just be stuck as Tau and Necron.

												This game is an absolute must own for any warhammer 40k fan. It has plenty of cutscenes from intros to outros and opening cutscene for a faction and one for defeating them. The game has simple controls to where even a first time RTS player like myself can get into it. The map interface is easy to use and planet resources are the only key winning on harder difficulties. The best part of the game is playing as the iconic factions of the warhammer 40k universe and some play very differently than others I would recommend playing as the Space Marines or Chaos factions first. The only problem i've faced with the game is a bug that let load a saved data for the Ork faction after i exit the game.			"

												how to play necrons can be summed up in this quote ""they have us surrounded the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!"" basically hunker down build up your forces make your base almost inpenetrable while you research basically everything possible while building up your army. and when the enemy comes knocking you send out a massive army of powered up necron warriors pushing them back while bringing up the rear with tomb spyders to collect the corpses to make more necrons and if the enemy starts getting a little too dangerous thats when you start spamming flayed ones behind the enemy until they stop all that annoying breathing and screaming and become fashionable coats! then you retreat after there grand army is ripped to pieces and they desperatly try to recover as quickly as possible then you mass and even bigger army this time with destroyers immortals and destroyer lords for a little bit of extra punch. and by now you should have researched everything for your main base to turn it into a mobile teleporting super weapon and then you throw your massive army of mechanical death at your enemy and watch as they adorably try to stop the endless tide of green plasma and metal all the while teleporting your pyramid/doomsday device towards them and for the final blow you teleport that thing right in the middle of there base and watch it vaporize everything.

												I've been a huge fan of Warhammer 40k for about 7 years now. Not just for the Dawn of War games, but for the lore in general as well. Being a huge fan of warfare, sci-fi, and military related things, no other sci-fi game, movie, or novel has fascinated me more than Warhammer 40k, mostly because no other sci-fi has gone the same lengths, nor can even be compared to Warhammer 40k. (Star Craft, Halo, Star Wars, not even Marvel or DC can compare to it!) If you're a die-hard Warhammer 40k fan like me, or just someone who loves to play RTS games in general, I'd highly recommend adding this game to your library. You won't regret it. For a game that first came out in 2004, (though Dark Crusade came out in 2006) no other RTS is as bloody, gorey, or addicting as Dawn of War Dark Crusade and is still fun as hell to play to this day! Buy now and see just intense the 41st millenium can be!			"

												Now this is a great expansion. Unlike the unbalanced garbage that was Winter Assault, the Dark Crusade is a lot of fun. There are plenty of factions to choose from, a whole planet to conquer, and a nice variety in scenery and missions. When all is said and done, it's actually longer than the original game, and that's just comparing one playthru of each.+7 factions to choose from, so while the campaign is basically the same for all of them, each faction is pretty unique and interesting+The story is decent for an RTS, and isn't riddled with overly long cutscenes like the base game+Scenery ranges from tundra to mountains to deserts to jungles to ancient ruins to an underworld.+One playthru took me nearly 20 hours, so you get quite the bang for your buck.-Pathfinding is still infuriatingly atrocious. It requires a lot of micromanagement, and will lead to you taking a lot of excess damage at times.-Graphics are dated, but that is to be expected, and it hardly makes the game unplayable. My biggest gripe is it can be difficult to command a large army when you can't zoom out very far.-Maybe it's just because I played as the Tau Empire...but I saw very few Warhammers, and I require at least 40K.

												Main selling point? Second greatest RTS campaign ever (Only surpassed by Starcraft 2: Wings of liberty IMHO).It's basically risk, only with fun battles instead of dice rolls! Heck even some of the special maps are crafted with care that a campaign mission would be (Try eldar and invade the ork stronghold, Farseer Taldeer and Warboss Golgutz will go at it!).Oh yeah, Tau and necron are stupid fun armies as well!Mind you this is an X-Pack, while it is playable as a standalone, if you want to play all the armies you'll need the base Dawn of War, and Winter Assault, otherwise you'll just be stuck as Tau and Necron.

												If there was ever an RTS that's insanely addictive, this is it! It's very well polished, has a great tutorial and is very well balanced.What makes the game a real winner is that it's easy to play, but hard to master. Camera manipulation, map scrolling, location bookmarking, building, recruiting, resource management, unit selection, unit grouping and unit direction feel very natural and logical and have been very well implemented. This is often something that is done so poorly in many RTS's and ruins what would have otherwise been a good game, but DOW makes it easy, which means that I can crack on with the more complicated management of my bases, armies and resource gathering.I also love the element where you take a bit with you at the end of each mission to the next mission because that makes logical sense if you're running a war campaign, instead of starting each new mission with 1 builder unit.One thing that can be improved is troop path finding, including formations. Then again, I still haven't found and RTS that does this overly well and I just have to micro-manage my armies more like usual.			"

												DOW 40K: Dark Crusade is a really good RTS with a lot of variety depending on which faction you are playing - with the adding of the Tau and the Necrons it gives you even more weapons in your hand to decimate your opponents with. Although there are a few balancing issues, the gameplay is very good. And the online multiplayer is back and alive after SEGA took over.In short, if you want a good RTS to play with or against your friends or the AI - get Dawn of War.			"

												Dark Crusade is arguably one of the greatest RTS games ever made, and is a triumph for the genre. Every RTS staple in present, in interesting and mechanically creative ways. No other RTS offers as much content and diversity. Although this, the second expansion to the primary game, features a Risk style campaign with little variance between races, it is still the most satisfying and complete. With SEVEN playable races, each with entirely diferent tech trees and gameplay mechanics, no other game can compete. This is better than Starcraft, dare I say it. Note that it features Squad based combat, in that you control groups of infantry units (Company of Heros is the spiritual sucessor from the same publisher). This allows for massive conflicts that are still manageable and allow for micro-management of abilities. Fans of macro- and micro-management can be equally effective, as different races cater to different strengths.The interface is intuitive and translates easy across all playable races. The sound is impressive and chaotic. The graphics are, well, old. The multiplayer is obviously lacking in players the older the game gets, but is still occupied. A simple tracking system shows you (or warns you) just how good your online opponents will be, but it doesn't force a matchmaking system on you. Dark Crusade embodies everything good and wonderful in the RTS genre, and it is by far and away the best RTS money can buy. I cannot recommend it strongly enough.			"

I prefer the campaign node of Dark Crusade (keep buildings) and the armies of Soulstorm (Sisters) so I flip back and forth between these two where I want to relax into a good skirmish or putter away at campaigns for planetary and system domiance.Even if you weren't already familiar (or even fond of) GW's Warhammer franchises the richness of the story and the faction backgrounds really help make the RTS that much more fun. The factions play very differently but are still pretty balanced.Although this game is old the graphics look fine and it handles large monitors well, compared to many other older titles.			"

												This game is a delightful mix of the classic setup of Risk, a dash of RTS management, and the ultra violent world of Warhammer 40K. Each faction has their own storyline and customizable leader thus providing hours of replayable mayhem. The game can start to feel repetitive at times, especially when the computer decides to attack your controlled zones several times over, but if you feel up to it, you can skip the actual battle and have the outcome decided by a traditional ""dice roll"" if you will, though I highly recommend taking firsthand control for every battle. It is by no means a total encompassment of all things Warhammer and seems to favor infantry units over vehicles, but all in all this game is highly enjoyable and should be a part of any Warhammer fan's library. FOR THE EMPEROR!			"

												I love this game, in my opinion of of th Best RTS Games ever made, (for the record I have not played Soulstorm) although I now might after discovering the Ultimate Apocalypse Mod.  Is it perfect? no.  Is it completely balanced in multiplayer? no.  what it is, is fun as hell and very satisfying to play. Dark Crusafe adds a twist to the campaign modes.  Rather than following a linear path of objectives like the previous DOW and Winter assault, it throws in a Meta game where you are fighting for complete control of a Planet, which throws in tactical decisions on where to buy more support for the territory you just won or to bolster an earlier victory site.  I could go on for hours, but I will simply conclude with this, if you are a fan of warhammer 40k, or just love a satisfying base building push and pull RTS, this is a game that must have a spot in your library, you are guaranteed hours of fun!

It's unit system is squad based, which allows you to reinforce them at any time until they get to their max number. Each race has it's ups and downs (The Tau are Stealth and Vehicle Based and the Necrons are infantry based).

												Warhammer 40k Dark Crusade is the 3rd entry into the Dawn of War series and its a strong contender in the RTS market despite not being as mainstream as the Starcraft or Stronghold series. If you enjoy games like Company of Heroes and Starcraft then this is a can't miss title.The game is set on the planet Kronus where the Imperial Guard rule in the name of the Emperor but all is not well on Kronus. The Ork invasion has begun anew on this planet and with all the fighting above the ancient killing machines known as the Necron have awaken which in turn has caused the Tau to appear on the planet in an effort to stop them from annihilating all life on the planet. Of course all this extra violence has attracted the attention of the Blood God of Chaos attention and brought the Chaos Marines onto Kronus. And with the Chaos Marines the Eldar quickly came in tow to stop them from ressurecting more demons and overtaking more planets. The Space Marines (namely the Blood Ravens) are ordered to cleanse the planet now for it is considered overrun with the Alien, the Unclean, and the Heretic. Upon their arrival on the planet they are told their are precious artifacts on Kronus that must be reclaimed at all costs and thus order the Imperial Guard to evacuate from Kronus in order for them to purge Kronus and reclaim the artifacts. The Guard promptly refuses and sparks an intense war with the Blood Ravens. This all quickly turns into a nasty open war.How this war plays out however is solely up to you however. The game gives you a decent background for each race and the events leading to the war but it has not true canon story beyond that. Your campaign mode consists of picking 1 of several races (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Marines, Tau, or Necrons) and then using them to conquer the entire map. The campaign starts off on the world screen where you can reinforce your territories launch attacks or upgrade your Honor Guard, which are essentially free beefed up versions of your basic units, as well as upgrade your commander unit with Wargear, items that add health attack or other bonus abilities to your commander unit. Each race has its own Stronghold which if taken will kick them from the game for that campaign. Capture all strongholds to win.All in all the game looks great despite some age, it sounds great and has a decent soundtrack and its positively steeped in lore for every race. Theres dozens of novels written on this series. I highly recommend this game to any and all fans of RTS games. Gotta cut this one short since Steam wont let me write any more about this game!

												As far as Warhammer games go, this one is at the top. It balances the campaigns and skirmishes better than Soulstorm. Necrons and Tau are forces to be reckoned with. 9/10Pros:Fun, fast-paced combatCustomizeable leaders and you can pick your honor guard.Just enough depth for both casual gamers and hardcore fans to enjoy.Cons:Some of the voice acting, especially for the Chaos builder units, is incredibly annoying. Most are OK, but quite a few of the soundbites get said so often it really makes you want to give a blood sacrifice to Khorne. But hey, Blood for the Blood God, ya know? Battles tend to get out of hand, with an intense amount of juggling to keep things going (especially with the flimsy Imperials).			"

												So, the Skirmish starts off with me as Space Marines against two Ork groups. I get myself going with a little protection, start building up some better marines, make a few heavies. I forget the name of the map, but it has a definite choke point, and it may be something as simple as ""The Wall"". So, I set up my turrets, pop over a few marines, and a few Ork come through and are just gone in a matter of second. So, I build up more turrets, some more heavy bolters, and let the Ork camps build themselves up as I do the same -- but I did half of my time on defense. So, a massive wave of Orks comes through, and wave after wave of Ork is just decimated by the defense grid, along with an Orbital Bombardment or two added in for mostly overkill. What was left behind was a sea of bloodied bodies; truly one of greatest things I've seen in an RTS.			"

												A++  -  Highly Recommend this to any would-be or veteran W40k fan!There are 7 playable races; these are: Space Marines.Chaos Space Marines.Eldar.Orks.Imperial Guard.Necron.Tau.Ontop of that there are 4 seperate race mods you can easily combine together bringing the total ammout of playable races to 11. You will need to download & install these race mods but I'll provide the links you need and help you through the installation.The four mod community made races are:Inquisition Daemonhunt.Steel Legion.Witch Hunters.Tyranid.So thats a total of 11 races!... Loads of variety & lots of fun! Download and install each of these. http://www.gamefront.com/files/files/7861883/inquisition_daemonhunt_mod.ziphttp://www.gamefront.com/files/files/9357045/steel_legion_dc_setup_1.ziphttp://www.gamefront.com/files/files/9642590/witch_hunters.ziphttp://www.gamefront.com/files/files/10901223/tyranidmod045dc.exe(when your installing one or two of these mods they may appear not to be installing, like setup has crashed.. just wait patiently and they will soon install - trust me. When you have those installed them each seperately its time to put them altogether by installing this 5th and final mod - the New-Races-Mixer Mod 0.4  (required to use all 4 new races in Skirmish or Multiplayer at the same time, i.e Tyranid Vs Steel Legion ect.) When installing the final mod (New-Races-Mixer Mod) you will have to tell the installer where to install the files, on my computer the location is:F:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Dawn of War Dark Crusadeuk2.strategyinformer.com/v2/download/407420fe/dawnofwardarkcrusade/dark_crusade_newracesmixer_mod_0.4.zipHave Fun & Enjoy! xD			"

												Main selling point? Second greatest RTS campaign ever (Only surpassed by Starcraft 2: Wings of liberty IMHO).It's basically risk, only with fun battles instead of dice rolls! Heck even some of the special maps are crafted with care that a campaign mission would be (Try eldar and invade the ork stronghold, Farseer Taldeer and Warboss Golgutz will go at it!).Oh yeah, Tau and necron are stupid fun armies as well!Mind you this is an X-Pack, while it is playable as a standalone, if you want to play all the armies you'll need the base Dawn of War, and Winter Assault, otherwise you'll just be stuck as Tau and Necron.

This game might even get you interested in the Warhammer universe! The campaign is fantastically designed, I won't spoil it for you, but you will like it for sure. Of course, this is a pure RTS game with a lot of content and it is not really that easy to master. Anyways, GET THIS.			"

If you only have money to buy one of the games, buy Dark Crusade. I'd also recommend Soulstorm: though it's buggy as heck on its own, the Ultimate Apocalypse mod transforms it into arguably the best Dawn of War experience you'll ever have.			"

												The Dark Crusade is considered the starting point in my campaign with the Warhammer series probably back in 2007. I always come back to this game year after year because I enjoy the single player and multiplayer game modes that include all the races unlocked out of the gate. The single player mode allows you to pick any race and drops you on the map with the rest of the races scattered across the globe. Each section of the map you win provides requisition and other bonuses to your army. The turn based ""Risk style"" mode begins after your first action and then allows each AI a turn in capturing territories. Similar to other RTS games, Dark Crusade is no different and allows you to construct buildings, vehicles and troops. The maps in each territory are littered with capture points that you will need to grab before your opponent in order to gain resources to expand your base. While there isn't much story in the campaign beyond the first introduction scene, more details will unfold as you begin to win battles against the other opponents when you capture their strongholds. The main character for each race is also outfitted with war gear as you fulfill certain requirements throughout Dark Crusade. Once you start conquering section of the map, rest assured that each race will take opportunites to invade and try to force you out of the territory. If I could recommend an RTS game then this would be the one out of all the Warhammer games. Whether it is a group of vehicles bombarding soldiers sending them flying or the up close action of Blood Ravens putting the boots to Orks for the Emperor, I feel there is never a dull moment in battle. I think Dark Crusade is the definitive pick over the newer Dawn of War games because of the maps, large scale battles and the non-linear campaign. Your best bet is to pick up the Warhammer collection, which usually pops up on sale. I had hours of time on Dark Crusade when I owned the original disc but had to purchase it again because I lost them.			"

												This is what Dawn of War should be. Balls-to-the-wall RTS, with each of the seven races being strong and weak in their own ways. You think having a Necron army makes you unstoppable ? Try assaulting the Eldar base on Hard difficulty. Think the imperial guard is no match for your Tau battlesuits? Try taking their stronghold and coming face to face with a Titan cannon and Baneblades kicking the crap out of you. But I digress. Winter Assault and Dark Crusade made me love God of War. I'll be finishing the game with all seven races. Wait for a sale and pick it up. You won't be able to put it down. For the Emperor !			"

												If you are a fan of either the Warhammer 40K universe, or RTS games, or both, then this game is for you. Out of all the Dawn of War games (excluding Dawn of War 2), this one is hands down my favorite. I have sunk a LOT of hours into this game, and I'm only about a quarter of the way finished with it.Here's how the game plays: You pick a race (Space Marines, Chaos, Tau, Ethereal, Orks, Imperial Guard) at the start of the game. Each race has their own strengths and weaknesses. My personal favorite are the Space Marines, who are very versatile and can easily adapt to any situation. Once you pick a race, the game begins. It is set up like a board game, similar to Risk. Each race takes a turn, and on your turn you can choose where you want to move to. Where you choose determines what race you will fight in that area. Every territory also rewards you with Honor Guard, which are elite units (VERY powerful compared to your regular units). In addition to this, there are a couple territories that have special abilities, such as the Spaceport that lets you attack anywhere, or Forward Base which lets you start matches with some buildings already made. The game continues on like this, with you attacking and defending. Your commander unit also acquires War Gear as you play, which makes them even more powerful.The real combat of this game is in the attacking or defending phase. The game plays as standard RTS fare. You gather resources, build structures, and grow your army. There is a lot of variety within a single race, which really helps to mix up the gameplay. You take over resource points and fortify them as your forces clash with your opponent. Once your army is built up enough, then you can obliterate your opponent and win the territory. Two things are important to remember, though. First, the way you leave a territory is what you will come back to when you are defending it. If you fortify it heavily, then you will be hard to defeat when the battle comes back to that area. Secondly, the special territories all have unique battles. The Spaceport, for example, has you gathering special units scattered across the map. The first side to collect 6 of these wins.Graphics wise, this game is behind what you'd expect from a modern RTS game, but it gets the job done very well. The units are all very detailed, and pleasing to look at when you zoom the camera in. The only downside is that the terrain looks a little bland sometimes. However, this game is not about looking pretty, it's about the battles. And combat is really well done in this game. If you've played the other Dawn of War games, then you know how it goes. It's really cool to see the animations of units in combat, they don't just pummel each other until a health bar is gone, there is interaction between clashing forces.In addition to the campaign, there is a skirmish mode that you can play to your heart's content. If you and a buddy have this game, then you can also jump online and play against each other in online multiplayer. All in all, this is a great game. Don't let Steam fool you, I've been playing this long before I bought it on here, and my hours in it are easily 200+. I like replaying the game as the other races to see what I've missed. If you like Warhammer 40K or RTS games, this one's for you. If you aren't sure, then grab it if it goes on sale. Trust me, it's worth it.			"

												Warhammer 40k Dark Crusade is the 3rd entry into the Dawn of War series and its a strong contender in the RTS market despite not being as mainstream as the Starcraft or Stronghold series. If you enjoy games like Company of Heroes and Starcraft then this is a can't miss title.The game is set on the planet Kronus where the Imperial Guard rule in the name of the Emperor but all is not well on Kronus. The Ork invasion has begun anew on this planet and with all the fighting above the ancient killing machines known as the Necron have awaken which in turn has caused the Tau to appear on the planet in an effort to stop them from annihilating all life on the planet. Of course all this extra violence has attracted the attention of the Blood God of Chaos attention and brought the Chaos Marines onto Kronus. And with the Chaos Marines the Eldar quickly came in tow to stop them from ressurecting more demons and overtaking more planets. The Space Marines (namely the Blood Ravens) are ordered to cleanse the planet now for it is considered overrun with the Alien, the Unclean, and the Heretic. Upon their arrival on the planet they are told their are precious artifacts on Kronus that must be reclaimed at all costs and thus order the Imperial Guard to evacuate from Kronus in order for them to purge Kronus and reclaim the artifacts. The Guard promptly refuses and sparks an intense war with the Blood Ravens. This all quickly turns into a nasty open war.How this war plays out however is solely up to you however. The game gives you a decent background for each race and the events leading to the war but it has not true canon story beyond that. Your campaign mode consists of picking 1 of several races (Space Marines, Imperial Guard, Eldar, Orks, Chaos Marines, Tau, or Necrons) and then using them to conquer the entire map. The campaign starts off on the world screen where you can reinforce your territories launch attacks or upgrade your Honor Guard, which are essentially free beefed up versions of your basic units, as well as upgrade your commander unit with Wargear, items that add health attack or other bonus abilities to your commander unit. Each race has its own Stronghold which if taken will kick them from the game for that campaign. Capture all strongholds to win.All in all the game looks great despite some age, it sounds great and has a decent soundtrack and its positively steeped in lore for every race. Theres dozens of novels written on this series. I highly recommend this game to any and all fans of RTS games. Gotta cut this one short since Steam wont let me write any more about this game! For the Emperor!			"

												I have been a Warhammer 40k fan since the first Dawn of War came out and this is not just a step up but two steps up, The amount of content in this game is absolutely amazing and it has all our favriot factions and empires from the lore and series and all i can really say is this game is Pure greatness and i know its an old game with old graphics but that really doesn't matter! so all i can really say is this game truelys shows ""It is better to die for the Emperor then to live for yourself"" so i Greatly recommend this game to any Warhammer 40k fans! and i would give it a 20/10!.

												I really like this game. I'm not much of an on-line player, so I prefer the campaign. Being able to play the different races and conqure various areas on the world map adds tons of re-playabilty to the campain. This is far and away my favorite version of the orignal DoW games. I'd reccomend this to anyone.			"

												This is what Dawn of War should be. Balls-to-the-wall RTS, with each of the seven races being strong and weak in their own ways. You think having a Necron army makes you unstoppable ? Try assaulting the Eldar base on Hard difficulty. Think the imperial guard is no match for your Tau battlesuits? Try taking their stronghold and coming face to face with a Titan cannon and Baneblades kicking the crap out of you. But I digress. Winter Assault and Dark Crusade made me love God of War. I'll be finishing the game with all seven races. Wait for a sale and pick it up. You won't be able to put it down. For the Emperor !			"

												This game is probrably the best RTS game ever.  With nine factions.  With completely seperate units, the developers took quite the amount of time and effort and it came out fantastic.  Rather simple to get the basics, but goes alot more in depth.  The campaign is amazing.  I mean come on.  Has there ever been a single RTS game where your mission is to rule a planet.  It sounds crazy and mediocre and boring, but the prologue makes sense.  Extremely time consuming with exciting fights against all other 8 factions.  Conquering their HQ won't be easy either.  You're up against a boss and waves and waves of coming units within the first minute of the turn.  And yes you take turns attacking and defending with a global view of the map.  You can have units defend territories or take them with you using requisition.  Upgrades are also availabe for your commander to get stronger and cooler.  It's finally suprising how the multiplayer for a game made in 2006 is still functioning!  The multiplayer with friends is a blast.  Use your strenths as different factions to either fight AI or other actual people!  In conclusion this game once again is one of the best RTS games i've seen.  Enough for me to buy 5 copies for my friends.  The price is also cheap and cheaper on sales.  Highly recommend!			"

												10/10 - This is one of the best Warhammer titles there is out there, even to this day. The graphics haven't aged well, but it is still a amazing piece of work. I would easily buy this over any other Warhammer title to this day. It has serveral different story lines that are fairly different from each other, gameplay is fluid/simple, and artstyle is on point. If you want to get into the Warhammer 40K series, hands down this is the game to do get you into it.			"

												Of the collection of Dawn of War games, this one is the best of the bunch.  You can still build bases, make armies, and fight as one of the warriors of Warhammer 40,000 against the other races in your conquest.  This is a classic game in the RTS genre.			"
