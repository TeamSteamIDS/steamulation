												I originally recommended this game, but Ive had to change my mind,At first the game is enjoyable, the challenge is certainly there but the game is lacking in depth.1) Massive jumps in difficulty between  Easy/Normal etc. Enemes on Easy can die in 1 hit, whereas on Normal they can take 4 (thats quite a jump)2) Limited skill tree. You marines can only level up 4 times and this seriously puts them at a major disadvantage late game (especially on Normal and above)3) NG+ is not fleshed out. This connects to point 2, due to the limited levelling up and progression, the only reason to play NG+ is for a scaled challenge. Completed the game on Easy? NG+ is Easy 1.5 etc etc4) The game is meant to be played multiple times, but there is a slight lack in variey (especially in enemies)After completing a few runs, Ive seen enough. There are better games out there			"

												I really wanted to like Steam Marines. There's some pretty cool ideas at work here; turning Space Hulk into a roguelike. Unfortunately, it just falls short of almost every mark it wants to hit.The random levels are entirely too random. Sometimes you'll spawn in a room with no doors. Sometimes you'll spawn in a room of nothing but doors. Sometimes you'll spawn on top of the exit! And on and on. Enemy placement suffers similarly, with you going from no robots to being completely surrounded in the space of a turn.The UI is a mess. The tutorial doesn't tell you everything. And ultimately, what options you do have on a given turn are extremely limited.This game has a great premise, and what's here is a promising effort, but ultimately I can't really say it's worth your time and money. It's not an egregiously awful game, it's just not really much fun.			"

												They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. In Steam Marines, even the things that kill you make you stronger. And there are a lot of things that are very good at killing you.As someone who hasn't played a bunch of roguelikes, this games is brutally difficult. I have often immediately regretted certain tactical decisions, and hung my head in shame as I ended my turn, resigning my squad to a swift and gruesome death.The procedurally-generated levels, combined with the ability to completely demolish walls (I have a strange compulsion to destroy every wall I see) and carve out your own path gives this game a great deal of replayability. You don't memorize levels to make progress, you learn to plan and make better decisions. You will learn when to lure or flank the enemy, and when to shove the enemy off your ship a la Harrison Ford in Air Force One.And when you get too frustrated, there's always hope. Maybe you'll get a giant metal exoskeleton you can use to exact fiery flame-thrower vengeance on your unwitting foes...			"

												When I think rogue-like, I think of a good, challenging (sometimes brutal), game that I can play in a couple of hours. I think of ascending difficulty where I try to find better gear and become more powerful so that I can attempt to defeat ever more challenging enemies until they kill me, or I manage to beat the end objective. Completing the game should be a proud moment that makes me want to brag to my friends that I finally accomplished it.Sadly, Steam Marines fails to achieve most of this. The basic game mechanics aren't bad, and the first couple of levels were fun, but it gets sorely repetitive very quickly. Each area introduces new enemies, but they all do pretty much the same thing (except the bosses, but even they only have a minor twist to make them unique).  On the rare occasions when you find new weapons and armor, odds are your marines can't use it, or it will be worse than what you already have. Once you figure out how to beat the enemies, the game becomes very formulaic and more of a chore to trudge through each level. At normal difficulty, each level took about 30 minutes (that number can vary a lot). With 25 levels, it just takes way too long for a rogue-like. When I beat the game, I wasn't jumping for joy. Rather, I felt myself saying ""finally, it's done."" I decided to raise the difficulty to see if it got better. The enemies were tougher and more numerous, but still did the same thing. The levels just took longer and longer to beat and felt more like a crawl. After a couple of levels, I decided I had better things to do than wait a minute or two between every turn while the computer made its move.UPDATE: Changing the AI speed did help speed up the computer's turn significantly, but wasn't enough to reduce the tedium enough for me to want to play this game again. I got through a couple more levels and decided I'd rather spend my time playing something else. I do appreciate that the developers are still working on the game, so hopefully they'll be able to add enough variety to make me want to play it again.			"

Post Early Access Update:After the release the game still features numerous bugs, glitches and even chrashes. The game still does not feel like a full release. The random generator still spawns you in closed off rooms, the controls are still clunky, the UI still needs work and the overall experience still hasn't improved enough for me to recommend it.Original Early Access Review:I'm at a loss with Steam Marines. The game has promise and I might recommend it when it's finished, but so far the game is just lacking that special umph to make it a great experience rather than a mediocre one.In Steam Marines you start the game looking over the tutorial, end up confused, start up a game and die... horribly. After 2 or so games and tinkering with the classes I started to get a grip on things. You choose a squad of 4 marines at the beginning of the game and each class has a different weapon and a different skill tree. The skill tree is interesting but basic, each level you get to choose a passive or an activated ability. I never did use the powers much as they take multiple points of Action Points (AP being the resource you use to move, shoot etc.) and it always seemed better to just fire regularly.The gameplay is a slow tile-based tactical slog through a ghost ships with robots and other baddies crawling out of the walls before attacking. This can be very frustrating as a wrong move and lack of items to restore AP can lead to dead marines very quickly. Furthermore, the random dungeon generation really needs some touch-ups as rooms with no doors or walls placed on top of each other make it impossible to move without breaking down walls and you need to do this to create proper tactical spacing.At the end of every level you're rated on your performance and if you're a careful player like me you'll most likely end with a negative score even if all your marines survived the level. The score seems to indicate that this is supposed to be a fast-paced tactical RPG but the gameplay itself rewards slow and methodical movement. It's frustrating to say the least.I'm not saying there isn't fun to be had with this game but in-between bouts of frustration, lackluster UI, boring music and a retro look that works but still needs a little work done (dropped items currently don't show up on the map) it just isn't worth the full price. With some polish I'm sure this gem will shine but right now I just can't recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								“In space no one can hear you scream” goes the famous film quote. They might just hear you scream after playing this intentionally hard roguelike game.Steam Marines is a roguelike set onboard a ship that has been attacked. You control a squad of four soldiers who must reach the elevator on each procedurally generated floor to proceed through the ship and eventually find freedom. It would be fair to say the game takes a good amount of influence from the Space Hulk/Crusade and X-Com game series, with its dark corridors and rooms with ‘fog of war’ and action points to spend on movement and actions. While not an original concept, Steam Marines manages to blend its influences into a neat game.Your squad can be created from randomised suggestions or built from scratch. There are four classes to choose from, a leader, support, scout and grenadier. As the names suggest, their weaponry fits their names, the leader takes the front with a close range shotgun, scout with a long-range sniper gun and support with a high capacity machine gun. Having one of each is probably a good idea to get a good balance of strategy and combat.Steam Marines throws you in the deep end with a few words of encouragement to keep you afloat for a minute while you play the tutorial. The tutorial gives you a chance to see how the basics work such as movement and combat. Once completed, you are on your own to work the rest out. The tutorial could go into a little more detail for people who are not familiar with this genre of game. After reading the developers forums I found out a few features I knew nothing about. This is a Steam Early Access game meaning the game is still in development, so this can be excused but it is worth keeping an eye on the forums for this reason alone.After a floor or two, the enemy number becomes many, and you will likely hit a brick wall as you learn the game the hard way. Death is permanent and once your squad is gone, it is game over. Tactics is important as it is in any strategy combat game, never knowing what is around the next corner or behind a door. You will soon learn that moving a soldier with few remaining Action Points into a new room is a silly mistake as they will likely face a couple of enemy units with no points to take action with. The game is turn based, so killing as many enemy units or getting into cover before you run out of AP is essential, the enemy can be brutal even on the easiest difficulty. Tactics such as flanking enemies that have shields works particularly well and grants bonus damage.Steam Marines features a simple leveling up system that improves the soldiers stats such as their strength and class attributes. Your soldiers also have talents which are awarded as you progress and include attacks and defense buffs and special attacks which are important to take advantage of.Much like the X-COM series, you form a bond with your soldiers and you will go to lengths to protect them. One mistake will make you scream as a group of enemy units slaughters half of your squad (if you are lucky). You can explore the ship to find items such as new weapons, health and AP replenishment and boosts. Survivors can join your team to replace any dead soldiers, but they will be weak and need to leveled up.The graphics are an 8-bit pixel art style that is dark and at times scary. Scary, but not in a make you jump out of your seat way, more in a way that you never know what is in the next room. Your heart will miss a beat or two as you enter a new room to see what is inside. The audio adds to the atmosphere with again dark, slow and eerie effects that remind you of X-COM. It creates an opposing atmosphere and builds the tension very well.There was little I did not like about Steam Marines. One minor annoyance is the auto-switch to new soldier once the selected soldiers AP has run out. If you manually choose a new soldier it can sometimes auto-switch to another without you realising and you end up moving the wrong soldier. You can switch this off in the options and I definitely recommend doing it! Steam Machines is a hard game, but it is fairly balanced and death will most likely be player error rather than the game. It is a dark, atmosphere filled strategy roguelike that works very well taking in a lot of inspiration from classic games. If you enjoy roguelike or tactics games this is a perfect game for you. If you are a newcomer, you may find the learning curve a little steep at the start, but it is something that can be reached and enjoyed.You can buy Steam Marines via the homepage at http://www.steammarines.com/ or via Steam here.Gameplay - 8/10	Tough but fair combat system. The approach to the levels gets you thinking the best strategy to reach the elevators.Graphics - 7.5/10	Nice pixel art 8bit style graphics that give a dark, opposing atmosphere.Sound - 7.5/10	Eerie, slow background effects that builds up the suspense.Final Score 8/10Review originally posted on http://www.gamergeddon.com "

												Steam Marines is another futuristic roguelike in town, released from the rather bizarrely named development studio, Worthless Bums. It offers a tactical squad turn-based gaming experience with some rather novel but very exact gaming mechanics which help it to stand out from the crowd. It boasts huge levels of difficulty and promises to provide the kind of old-school frustration which rogue players love to hate. The gameplay clearly caters to the kind of player who likes to make carefully calculated moves and always checks twice to ensure no mistakes happen, and for that type of player this game could well be the next thing on their shopping list. However, whether or not Steam Marines is a great deal of fun for anyone else is quite another matter. The action takes place on a steampunk styled spaceship which is under attack. Your marine squad has been abruptly woken out of cryostasis to deal with whatever-the-hell is going on out there; an array of strange enemy robots and aliens. Details are left unexplained as you enter the top-down isometric playing field to take care of the invaders and progress through the game as far as you can. The roguelike formula is interestingly twisted by the spaceship setting. Walls can be torn apart by both your team and the enemy. This offers the possibility of simply smashing through the walls rather than opening the doors. It also means you can be ambushed from boarding enemies at any particular moment. Equally, you can blast backwards enemies with knock-back weapons sending them into space and causing instant death. The objective of each randomly generated level is to find the elevator and descend. Each set of levels is split into the main decks – engineering, bridge, etc. – of the ship, all of them having their own tile-set and enemy unit types. After completing a deck and facing some kind of mini-boss you may choose the next deck to continue with.Your squad consists of four soldiers who can be any one of four different classes. Those consist of the leader, who has a shotgun; the scout, who has a long range gun and good visual range; the support, who has a machine gun; and the grenadier, who has an area of effect grenade launcher. XP is gained from exploring, descending, and killing enemies. The marines can be levelled up four times, each time you get to choose one of two special abilities; all of which are unique for that class. Additionally, special items, grenades and weapon upgrades can be found throughout the levels and made use of. The game is designed to be completely unforgiving even on normal difficulty levels and it shows. One stupid mistake can easily cost you dearly, and the game is auto-saved in only one save game slot so there’s no way of reversing a disaster. The good news is that your marines do have hit points and therefore can normally withstand a small amount of damage, however; a great deal of errors do result in the death of a squad member. There are also a few rather unique game mechanics in the game which are worth a mention because they make the tactical experience somewhat novel. For example, area of effect damage cannot initially kill units. This means that the grenadier can initially decimate a room of enemies, but can only finish one of them off at a time with direct hits. In addition, the game features flanking bonus damage where attacks from the side or back get additional damage. The gameplay is compelling from a strategic and discovery perspective; in addition the game can move at a fairly fast-pace thanks to the ability to reduce the AI move-delay in the options menu. The combination of deadly enemies, ambushes through the walls, and a short standard weapon-range all adds up to an experience which could be rather charming for a certain type of tactical geek. Conversely, the storyline is rather weak and doesn’t offer the kind of compulsion that, say, the space rouge-like Faster Than Light offered. Aside from a few Christmas cracker jokes from the marines and scraps of semi-nonsensical text discovered on computer consoles – which are really just acting as XP boosts – there really isn’t much plot to speak of. On top of that the game doesn’t offer an awful lot of customization. New weapons are few and far between and the four classes aren’t all that diverse; at least not to the extent of other roguelikes. Putting it all together, Steam Marines may be a tasty little challenge for some, but it’s not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. Perhaps it’ll be a nice addition to a rogue fan’s collection, and maybe a few indie diehards would like to pick it up to see what it’s all about. However, it doesn’t do a sufficient number of things in a new way or provide enough of a compelling experience to make it a hit for everyone; it’s nothing special, but it’s alright.			"

Early Access Review
								Steam Marines is a brutal tactical turn based squad based sci-fi roguelike. It is reminiscant of games such as Dungeons of Dredmore and Sword of the Stars: The Pit mixed up with the AP and Squad systems of X-Com.The game currently offers 4 classes; Leader, Scout, Grenadier and Support which offer a variety of different play styles. This game does have a steep learning curve and like all roguelikes it is a very frustrating but rewarding experience.If you enjoy roguelikes and tactical squad based games then this title is definitely for you, otherwise you may end up putting your fist through the monitor in sheer frustration.

								Difficult? Yes.Unfair? Maybe.Fun? Definetly.Steam Marines isn't a game for everybody. Hell, it's not a game for me -I haven't managed to beat it on easy-. But that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. The artstyle is appealing, steampunk settings mixed with retro-like graphics. The music is appropiate and morale-boosting, especially when fighting those tough bosses. The game also has a rather unique sense of humour, which I'm really fond of.Overall, for a game still in development, it's good value. Give it a try, if you like rogue-like, permadeath experiences.(Also, I'd like to point out that I've played the DRM free version for about 10~ hours. Steam one, not so much.)			"

												Summary: The interface / control scheme in this game is in dire need of some polishing / streamlining. There are so many other amazing roguelikes out there that I just can't be bothered. Heck, there's even a straight up Space Hulk game on Steam which may be less terrible, so if you're craving the derelict spaceship atmosphere of the beloved board game, maybe that's worth a shot instead?__________________________________After a brief glance at the development logs, I have my doubts as to whether or not the developer will produce that any time soon. The game was in early access for at least a year, and I made a point of not playing it til after it was officially released since my backlog is already ridiculous as is. (I think I got it on a steep discount or as part of a Humble Bundle.)In my admittedly brief time with the game, I found a number of irritations:- Long (non adjustable?) delay after your squad members run out of action points before it switches to the next squad member. (Weirdly enough, you can adjust the enemy AI delay re: the length of time for their actions. It's a small quirk, but I knew if I played for awhile, nitpicks like this would drive me nuts.)- Needs easier access to contextual info. It would be nice if I could just hover the mouse cursor over a tile to get more information. I don't think left click to focus does the trick, but I honestly can't remember.- Enemies telegraph their location during their phase. (I was playing on Easy to try to learn the mechanics / interface, so I'm not sure if this applies to higher difficulties.)I found myself wishing it had a user interface closer to something like Dungeons of Dredmor, which had excellent visual feedback and mouse support. Maybe the devs have to work around limitations of the Torque engine that they used to develop Steam Marines. Either way, there are better roguelikes to spend your time and money on.There may be a fantastic game in here somewhere, but I doubt I'll put more than a couple hours into it out of morbid curiousity. Maybe I'm a masochist, but I find it interesting to see how badly a UI / mechanic can be implemented, which makes me appreciate all those little things I usually take for granted in other better games!As it stands, I can't recommend it at anywhere near full price. The regular price on Steam is absurd, as I wouldn't pay more than $3 - 5 max and can't see it being worth more than a tenner if it ever gets proper UI updates. :(			"

tl;dr -> Get Bionic Dues instead. It's 100x better, and cheaper too.I bought this game when it was discounted heavily at the Humble Bundle Store. It had been very high (top 20ish or so) in my wish list because a adore the rogue-like genre. Although I had been very excited to try it, I was very disappointed with my gameplay experience. If you like turn-based strategy games, rogue-likes, and the space theme, then you might enjoy this game. Honestly though, you should play Bionic Dues instead, a much more fleshed-out and well-done game. Here is my review for that game if you wanted some more info about it.The aesthetics are okay - the amount of detail in the characters and background is decent. The sounds and music are also decent, however, I quickly muted the music in favor of my own. The controls are easy to learn, however, the hotkeys (vs. clicking on each action) may take a bit if you are not used to using them - they are fairly intuitive (R to reload) though. There is a tutorial when you begin that teaches you everything you need to know. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with turn-based strategy games, and the lack of complex mechanics keeps the difficulty pretty reasonable (contrary to what I would expect from a rogue-like). Playing the different difficulty levels, however, seem to be scaled strangely - if you move from easy to normal you will find a large spike in how challenging the enemies are.Gameplay consists of you moving 4 squadmembers through a randomly-generated ship floor - your goal is always to find an elevator to the next level. Before you begin, you can select different classes (engineer, sniper/scout, leader, etc) and a single perk (ex: splash damage, extra experience gain per enemy spotted) to better match your playstyle. Your characters can level up and select new skills and abilities, however, the pool is extremely small and lacks variety. I did not like this levelling mechanic because it meant that trying out the other difficulties had less incentive - maybe if there was an increased ability/skill pool or level cap for doing a higher difficulty it would justify playing new game +. Combat and movement occurs on a grid-based system. Each character has a set number of action points (AP) each turn - you can use items in your inventory to refill some AP. Orientation is also important (and costs AP) - you don't want your character facing away from a door or chokepoint. Line-of-sight plays a big role in this game, meaning that enemies can sneak up on you if you are not covering all areas with your team (an enemy unit can be right behind you and not appear on your screen until you turn around). Shooting your weapon costs both AP and ammo, and reloading will take a large amount of AP - so a good tactic is to always have at least one squadmember able to fire (similar to overwatch mode in games like XCOM). You can have your members ""wait,"" allowing them to fire during the enemy's combat/movement turn. This is crucial because your members are very fragile, and leaving them open to enemy attack can easily result in their quick deaths. The lack of depth makes combat fairly boring, as you will mostly be moving your characters, using items, and attacking - compared to other similar titles (Bionic Dues) that have different types of attacks and usable abilities.Enemies will execute their turn after you finish yours, spawning and moving throughout the ship. There will usually be slight indications (noise, a small flash/effect) of general areas where you can expect enemies to be. You can spend AP to destroy walls, allowing you to take unorthodox routes and take advantage of line-of-site (you can often safely scout a room by destroying a wall rather than going through the door). If you break open a ship wall to space, you can also push enemies to their death. There is a small variety of enemies, making combat predictable if you play enough and understand each unit's strengths and weaknesses.As you play, there are a large number of objects you can interact with - doors, crates, switches, etc. Each object may give you a random item, experience, etc. Items are kept in your inventory and shared by all squadmembers - which is good if you want someone to use a ""restore x AP to all squadmembers,"" but only have 1 person with actions left. Once you exit the commander deck area (several levels), you can freely choose different areas of the ship to tackle (ex: armory). Overall, the game plays decently enough, however, there are better alternatives (again, Bionic Dues) that I sincerely think you are better off trying those instead. The gameplay feels far too one-dimensional for a turn-based rogue-like title. Even after only a couple of playthroughs, you will probably be bored of the repetition (even if you are trying to go to different parts of the ship after the commander deck) - the lack of item/character/enemy variety further impairs replayability. It is probably easier to try Steam Marines before any of the more complex alternatives, however, I would still not recommend this unless you were dying to try it. I try not to mention price if I think it is unnecessary, but I would wait until this game is heavily discounted before picking it up - at a retail price of $16.99 I don't feel it is worth it.Do not recommend.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												This game is fun... brutal, unforgiving, permadeath fun.My first play I made it down four floors, but after the second floor, a feeling of hopelessness and dread started to set it.  My team was injured... two guys with a point each of health.  Armor was low, and ammo was starting to run out.  As I dropped down to the next floor, I was praying for helpful goodies in lockers.  Meanwhile, I was getting a feel for the amount of strategy and thought needed to succeed in the game.  Planning ahead is key, as is gaining a tactical advantage.  Managing supplies is vital.  It's all very challenging, and satisfying.As I moved through the third floor, using flanking positions and crossfire traps to take down my foes, I came to the realization that it was already too late for me this game.  In many games, even classics like Half-Life, there's a trusty health pack or armor kit just around each corner.  It's all a bit too convenient, really... playing Steam Marines opens your eyes about things like that, and for me at least, has brought understanding that you don't always have to have the easy outs to get through a messy situation and have fun.It's okay to lose... and you will.  It's okay to feel like you have no clue what you're doing... because you learn as you go.  It's okay that the game is a real challenge... after playing for a few hours, you probably wouldn't want it any other way.			"

												I'm not entirely sure whether I should recommend this game or not, as I have rather mixed feelings about it.GOOD-It has lots of variety, such as...    -classes with different skills,    -nice punch of different items, both interesting and useful,    -good range of enemies (considering the length), and so on.-It has funny odd things, like a collectable painting that can be used for random effect.-It's not too short.-You can set ""facing"" (turning a character in place) to cost no Action Points from game settings. I was able to overcome some of the bugginess with this.-Difficulty: As you learn how things work and how you kill different enemies, things get easier so that you actually survive. Meaning, that you propably wont be playing the game through with first attempt, thus providing some challenge.BAD-It has terrible graphics: sometimes I'm not sure what I'm looking at, while occasionally I have difficulties with reading the text. Sometimes its very hard to say whether a piece of wall is bashed or if it's semi-destroyed. In some maps, the wall tiles are so dark that I have to look the screen from different angle (benefits of flat screen) to be able to actually differ them from background or unexplored tiles. Some enemies can't be recognized from each others, until they blow on your face.-Moving around often bugs like hell: unit graphic may stay behind from actual position during moving, sometimes the whole movement is ignored. I have had two marines standing in a same tile more than once. Luckily this mainly plagues PCs, it could easily make the game unplayable if this would affect NPCs as well.-Shop pricing skyrockets like stockmarket-bubble.-Item prices increases every time you enter a shop.-Shop offers four items, chosen randomly. Combined with above, trying to buy a med-kit can become very, very expensive.-You can't sell items.-Using mouse over the battlefield is buggy, and supposed benefits are often broken. Not to forget that sometimes moving the mouse on the map area causes heavy lagging and shooting CPU-load to roof.-Occasionally ""targeting indicator"" does not appear as supposed to, you have to rotate the character or switch between characters for it to show.-Game is balanced in a wrong way: You must make sure that you wont be shot at all, because enemies will tear apart your marines too easily, even on easy-difficulty. This means that you must use lure-tactics constantly, and even a single mistake may result to complete failure.			"

Early Access Review
								Steam Marines will definitely appeal to a small subset of people, but not to a general gamer audience and certainly not to me (and I love roguelikes!).To not die within the first couple of floors of Steam Marine, you must play extremely cautiously. Open a door; set up the rest of the squad to guard behind. Look around the room; set up the rest of the squad to guard. If there are enemies, kite backwards while setting the rest of the squad to guard and maybe get some pot shots in. Failure to do any of these things risks the chance of some ranged bot popping out the shadows and taking a marine from full health to dead/near dead in a single turn. You have a rough idea of where enemies are from hearing their footsteps, but you have no idea how the rooms and doors are connected until you actually pop your head in and turn about.The marine health/enemy damage ratio is so very low, so there is no room for error. Trying to run and gun, or even advance to a forward position and burst an enemy down, will get you killed very fast. This demanded precision is frustrated by the control scheme: every  of the many actions has a mapped key, with NO context sensitivity. While I'm used to games like this, the learning curve is still a little steep, and the memorization will be a turn-off for many people. This frustration is compounded by the fact that there is no undo, even for benign actions with no impact on the immediate turn, such as guarding. Did you just hit the wrong key at a critical turn and accidentally fire at nothing, or guard into a wall, or use an item you didn’t intend to, etc.? All your hours and effort is wasted now, your run is over.If a repetitive, boring, and cautious slog through a hardcore dungeon where small mistakes will waste hours of work sounds exciting to you, this game is for you. Again, I’m sure there are some people who will enjoy such a neurotic challenge, but this experience is not for most. "

								While I do not expect to rack up as vast a number of hours with this game as I have with SOTS: The Pit, this game is enjoyable and compelling in its own right and is deserving of honourable mention.There are still some slightly clunky, somewhat unintuitive and extremely unforgiving aspects to Steam Marines, but these concerns are quickly forgotten once the quirks have been understood and the basics mastered.  The result is an at times funny, challenging, thrilling and re-playable team-based tactics game that is perfect for short gaming sessions.			"

								The game plays as a rapid dungeon delver, where instead of a singular character you control a team and battle against enemies to reach your destination, an elevator to different levels of the ship. Your team-members will gain experience and new items in their travels, gradually growing more powerful to take on more dangerous enemies. The combat system is simple and easy to get into. Your team and their enemies cannot target each other diagonally, making combat easy to plan and to execute. However, a single miscalculation from one character might end up costing the whole teams life. Learning from such mistakes, by dying, is part of the charm, as in other roguelikes. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys fighting robot-aliens in space with simple tactics. The idea of traversing and exploring levels of a huge steampunk spaceship, under attack from unknown enemies, is certainly quite titillating.			"

								Not as fun as you'd think. Only a handful of adversaries -- and only way I found to advance was by being hyper-careful. (does not lend itself to different playstyles.) Some rouge-likes stand tall on the premise that death is permanent and thus offer suspense... after a couple of days trying to master the game, I just felt like it was futile. If you want a game like this, I suggest ""Sword of the Stars: The Pit"" -- far more engrossing sci-fi rogue-like, which you may never win but feel gratified for getting far. This game you can enjoy somewhat, but you know you're always just one turn away from losing -- and often enough it has nothing to do with what you've done.			"

												TLDR; Skip this game, buy Bionic Dues instead.  Bionic costs half as much as this, and is actually a finished product.Steam Marines is a great concept that never got finished.  Many of the poor gameplay elements, admitted to by the Dev, were supposed to be changed before launch.  They were not.  Dev swore all over the place that he was going to maintain the game post-release, and not abandon it the day it came out.  That's exactly what he did, leaving TONS of game-breaking bugs and glitches.  There is no music, there is no variety, the tutorial in no way prepares you for the amount of missing information you'll find in the game.It's sad, because this really could have been a great game.  It is not.  It's a twenty dollar turd that you should avoid at all costs.  Dev skipped supporting this game to start working on a sequel instead, but that's a dangerous road.  How many people are going to buy another game from someone who just got bored with his first one and left it to rot?  You can still see the 'road map' on the discussions page.  After playing the game for a while, then reading the road map, you realize that a vast amount of the features the dev decided to leave out are exactly the ones that needed to be implemented to make this a great title.  I have no idea what he was thinking, because he was well on his way to making one of the best games to come out of Greenlight/Early Access.			"

												This is a very hesitant recommendation. Steam Marines is a turn-based roguelike that tries to stand out by having the player control a squad of 4 characters (of different classes), instead of a single one.It's also extremely difficult -- far too much so, to the point of imbalance.I haven't played many turn based games, so my perception of the difficulty might be distorted. However, I will say that the gap between Easy and Normal mode is huge -- especially considering that there are also Hard and Brutal difficulties. The game is pretty standard in its mechanics -- each character has action points that they use to move and attack, there's ammo and reloading, and position is crucial. The enemies follow the same rules, some with little quirks that make the game more interesting.It's... solid. I enjoyed my Easy playthrough... somewhat. I'll get into it later.The game has several issues that make it just an ""okay"" game, for me. Still, okay is fine, in this case. I do think the mechanics work well together, and a full playthrough is enjoyable. But that's about as far as I go, as someone who quit on Normal Mode.It's hard to review exactly how I see the imbalance in the game, since it's heavy on numbers. Let's just say that enemies on Easy kill you in perhaps 2 hits, and only have 2 Action points per turn. They also have 6 HP. On Normal mode, they have 4 Action points, 12 HP and kill you in 1 hit. The actions points, especially, make a huge difference, as you need to be really far away from them to be safe. Plus the necessary reloading (that takes ALL of your action points), small rooms, and several enemies at once, make Normal mode infuriating. It's too easy to lose a character on the very first level. And there are 30 or 35 of them!On Easy Mode, however, it's still hard to get through the first set of levels. When you reach the 6th level (second area), you have access to these Hulk suits that are incredibly overpowered, in comparison with the normal characters. After that, you can play through the game rather easily. Which is a huge problem, for me. The first set of levels being by far, the hardest. It's just a big wall that keeps most players away.On my easy playthrough, I actually quit out of boredom. I understood the mechanics and quirks of the enemies, so the game got pretty formulaic. When you beat the game, you go into NG+. I beat that as well. When I started NG+2 I quit. It was simply not fun, anymore. I knew what I need to do everytime, it wasn't fun.At that point, I tried Normal. I didn't get past the first set of levels... again. I could do it, but not without losing a character. There's an incredibly big difference between the two difficulties. It's just not fun, for me.Then, there are other issues about its ""rogue-like"" label. It's always the same thing, essentially.Character have 4 levels, with each one having a choice between 2 skills - a passive, and an active one. Always the same 2 for the given level and class. There's virtually no point in experimentation.Some of the classes are also virtually useless, so your party won't vary too much.Then, the worst of it, is that there are almost no equipment and weapons to find. Even when you do, it's purely numerical and provide absolutely no interesting choices. It's just a question of ""this does more or less damage, accuracy, etc. etc."". If you take something like The Binding of Isaac, there are tons of interactions between the items, some of them drastically changing the game. In Steam Marines, there's none of that.It also lacks a purpose, having a very monotonous pacing. There are 5 or 6 ""zones"", each with 5 levels. You find an elevator to proceed to the next level. Every 5th level, there's a Boss in the elevator. It's always the same. Story is virtually non-existant, and the Bosses aren't very interesting, either. Take FTL, for example, and there's a very clear threat and purpose in the Mothership fight. The whole game is a build-up to that moment. In this game, there's nothing resembling that. Especially with NG+, you can just keep going, without any sense of progress.It's also far too long for each run. Even on Easy mode, is may have taken me 6 hours or something. This is apparently a very, very negative review, despite the recommendation. Well, I really had big issues, especially being unable to progress on Normal mode. Maybe it's just not for me. But I still recognize some merit to its mechanics are the general idea. Perhaps it can appeal to veterans of Turn-Based games. For me, it seems imbalanced, lacking a good difficulty curve as well as pacing a variation.			"

												Steam Marines is an interesting squad based rogue-like where you roam a steampunk ship with steam marines as besieging enemies attack. You sweep levels dispatching robots and aliens, and boss enemies that guard the exit to the areas at the end.The key aspect of this game is that you are leading a group of marines, from which each will have their own tactical uses. You'll have different weapons equipped and different abilities to use - each which will require specific positioning to make the most of.There are also a variety of areas to move around in too. Initially you'll be moving through the Command Deck which will feature basic Robot Enemies to fight off. After beating the Command Deck you'll be able to pick what area you wish to move onto.Of course, you are probably wondering where the unfavorable part of this review comes in, so let's get into that now...Difficulty levels don't seem to be balanced well for inexperienced or experienced players, RNG elements seem to be in places where they shouldn't be - like how much shops will sell stuff for or what they sell or in starting attributes of your marines.Progression is also a rather annoying aspect of this game. You start out in the Command Deck everytime you begin - but it will get sterile quite quickly. Areas feel a bit expansive and long, which is fine, but what isn't fine is that you are moving through 5 levels for each area. When moving through the levels, it is possible for you to spawn next to the elevator - and if it is the last level of an area, you will spawn next to the exit boss....There were also some general annoyances such as skill balance selection being extremely unbalanced - leaving to little choice in what you pick. I also found that the enemies can be somewhat unpredictable in some situations - which is not a good thing to have in Rogue-likes since it is part of the game to understand how enemies operate!Really this should be an enjoyable game, but its chief problem is that it feels like it hasn't been fleshed out enough. I haven't seen any re-visitation from the developer though, so I feel that this negative review is warranted.			"

												Similar to an unpolished version of Space Hulk but less forgiving and more confusing.It is quite fun But takes a while to fully grasp the mechanics such as promotions, using different weapon sights, and how to utilize your troopers properly.  It captures the feel of early 1990's late 1980's computer gaming quite well.  It brought back many memories of playing Laser Squad (the predecessor of the X-Com series by the same programmer).  However this is not as much tactical squad based as it is a cross between that and a rougelike dungeon crawl.			"

								Do you like turn based strategy? Do you like knowing your death was your fault and not because of RNG? Then play Steam Marines.Too often difficulty and randomness are confused. In Steam Marines it is clear that while the levels are procedural and enemies don't spawn in the same place you are supposed to think a turn or two ahead. The position of your marines, whether you blow a hole in the wall or if you remembered to reload the turn before all play a part in your success.It took me over 20 hours to beat the game on normal and none of those hours were from grinding or wasting my time. Every moment was something new I had to think my way past. Yes the game has permadeath and when you lose your squad you start the game over but the pressure is on from start to finish. Being complacent means you can die as easily on the first level as the last.Beyond the game getting better (its still in alpha) the developer is active on the forums, talks about game design and what he intends to do in the future. This is the kind of Early Access game you want to support.			"

Its a bit of a throwback given the challenge and and how the mechanics of the game are not totally clear (you know that having more resistance is good, but not really sure what the aliens are using on the later levels).The random levels and random equipment drop is nicely done to make each game feel different.A couple negatives would be the music (but on most games I usually play my own after anyhow) and more importantly the controls and interface is a bit buggey.  Sometimes it does not properly render units on less you go out to the menu and back in.All in all its a good game for people who like to be challenged and take enjoyment ina game that beats them.

								A few months ago when I entered ""squad-based rogue-like"" into google, Steam Marines is what popped up - like a gift, cradled in the generous arms of my glowing screen. It was exactly what I was looking for: a tactical, sci-fi, squad-based roguelike (with very well done pixel art and a great sense of humour to boot). Many of my marines have been murdered by what I think might be rogue toilets. The difficulty is punishing, but like most games in this genre, mastering the mechanics is a rewarding experience.The game is still in alpha, and performs like an alpha is expected to, but it's great fun anyways.

								Steam Marines is a game about how hard it would be if you were responsible for protecting a ship from robots and/or aliens, but you forgot to pack a map.Steam Marines is a roguelike (pedants be damned) mixed with ""classical"" squad based tactical gameplay, hitting a good balance of both genres.  The core of the game is about managing a team of 4 Marines are you move through a procedurally generated ship, combating a variety of enemies in turn based combat.  You clear the ship room by room, exercising the best tactics you can to conserve life and ammo so you can make it to the next floor.  There's an AP system in place, so on your turn, you move your squad around as far as your AP will let you, and then it's the enemy's turn, exhausting their AP, etc. so positioning and attention to detail is required to make sure you don't leave a Marine stranded in a bad positionI've never strayed past normal difficulty, but even there the game can be pretty unforgiving.  Death is permanent, and often swift.  Ammo is limited and so is inventory space, so you really need to scrounge carefully and decide on what to pack when you move between decks.  I've had games that were rougher than others, but never once did I feel as if the RNG was the sole thing that screwed me over- in most of my games, there was something better I could've done to avoid calamity.Despite being an early access title, I wholly recommend Steam Marines.  Even in its current alpha state, the game is a lot of fun and tactically challenging, and as an added bonus, the developer is really active with the Steam community.What I paid for it: 10 bucks.What I would pay for it: Upon completion, 15 bucks, easy.At the time of this review, the most recent build was v0.8.4a			"

								Its team based rouge like and I mean it when I say rouge like you move your team the enemies move,simple.with one life for each of your soilders you kinda have 4 lives but because you need you team to take on the large amount of killer robots your teams members lives will get shorter with each one that dies.Its got a new game plus mode to so thats sweet.If you like rougelikes then it might be worth it at the 10 doller price,and even though its early access I would not worry because this is a game that is simple no massive goals.It really could be a full game its just a bit small,but thats better then bugs right?

								A brutally hard, Steampunk inspired version of Spacehulk. The AI is relatively crude in it's current iteration but it's still highly punishing of mistakes. If you enjoy Roguelikes, squad based strategy and nice spritework you should enjoy Steam marines.One nice touch is that there's some banter between the troops as well.""What about the mission on Titan IV?""

								Steam Marines is a very well done turn based action game, and it reminds me of the classic xcom games. The game is very unforgiving, and 50% of the time your situation is hopeless, so a lot of rounds just come down to luck. My only real complaint is that there are only 4 classes to choose when you make your squad, but I'm guessing more classes will be added in future updates.			"

Early Access Review
								Played about an hour so far and progressed through the tutorial and first 5 levels of the game, but at this stage I think that's all that is necessary to review. Nice pixel-art style graphics and a well chosen score set the mood for this broody journey through a space ship taken over by killer robots! If you are looking for story it seems that's all you're getting, but the gameplay is so engrossing you'll forget that pretty quickly! Add in the fact that once your squad members die they're really gone for good and a wiped out squad means game over and it's really easy to get pulled into this game. Fiendish difficulty and a steep learning curve help to keep you forever on your toes whilst playing.As far as the early access goes it seems to be a fully functional game, with a lot of room for expansion. For example there are currently 4 possible squad member classes (that cover quite a range of skills), maybe half a dozen item drops (but the varied effects show that there could be many more yet to come), and from what I've seen a small selection of enemies with pretty basic AI. That said I think this Alpha will probably entertain me for at least a couple more hours (especially if the difficulty keeps ramping up as it has been). I imagine the beta and full release will have many hours of gameplay due to the procedurally generated levels and possible squad configurations and tactics.My only gripe so far is with the control scheme and UI which sometimes make it difficult to work out exactly where you're at (which squad member you're controlling, ammo, etc) and makes it all to easy to make costly mistakes. It would be nice to see some refinement in this over the next few builds as it slows you down in a game that is already requiring a lot of thought before each move.I would definitely recommend, especially at it's current low price, currently very good, only going to get better :)			"

YouTube™ Video: SteamPunk Episode 29: Steam Marines 

			Views: 55		

			SteamPunk Bob doesn't care to belong to any Marine Corps that would have him as a member. Also, his voice doesn't care to play nice this week, as he has a nasty cold. Apologies.		

While I get more of a retro future feel (As in Fallout) rather than a steampunk feel from this game, Steam Marines is a very good tactical game. Your decisions feel like they have great weight to them, and it's definitely the best turn based tactics I've seen in this price bracket in a while.It's not the DEEPEST strategy game I've seen recently, but it has enough meat on its bones to be enjoyable.

								I bought this game not expecting much since it was early access, and was very pleasantly surprised. As a big fan of the rogue-like genre, I got a neat little dungeon (space ship!) delver with enough content this early on to keep me entertained for hours. The tactical and random properties to the game are great with many fun features such as finding items, gearing and skilling up your team members - add perma death (wouldn't be rogue-like without it) to the mix and you know you have to think two and three times about your next step. I felt the game eased you into the difficulty nicely, challenged you and punished you fairly for silly mistakes. So far I've only run into one minor bug (which didn't break the game) and I am really looking forward the rest of the development. Definitely worth the money if you're into these kind of genres.			"

The squad-based approach is new to the genre and is done well. All in all, certainly an interesting addition to the list of Roguelikes, and highly original in the setting (steampunk spaceship).Still under development too, so it can only be improved from here.

												This game is just a garbage heap of a mess.  Everything is too random. You can pick your classes for your team, but beyond that you have no control. Each member will have random stats and the weapon stats are random too. The enemies are not designed at all for the gameplay as some would require flanking but everything is too cluster-phobic or require too many AP to do it and because of the of the randomness you may or may not have a shield pricing or ignoring weapon that will do enough damage. Enemies also do ridiculous amounts of random damage, sometimes just scratching them or out right kill them in one hit so when you do flank it just places you in a worse position.The combat is made even more awful by the fact you can’t shoot on the diagonal which burns the already random number of points that are sometimes so low you can’t do anything with them and moving through your own marines consumes even more. Better hope your random weapon is useful because you might as well you harsh language. Punching has knock back but one square means nothing and you were better off blasting them instead of wasting a AP on each side. Your guys are generally so weak both offensively and defensively moving solo or away at any distance is going to get them killed.The level generation is just horrific. It’s far too tight, slapdash and at times require you to bust down walls just to get to the exit. Enemy placement is absurd at times leading to whole room stuffed wall to wall and you hoping they don’t have enough random AP to get to you. Then there are random events that just leave you ???. Moving through each level is a slow and painful process as moving at speed will get you killed. You constantly have to setup ambushes which slow you down to a crawl and even if you are safe the slower marines will drag you even further.The levelling system is barely a thing. You get new skills but most are not particularly useful and your stats don’t seem to increase. You don’t feel anymore powerful than before.Loot is almost non-existent as you mostly find the odd canteen or ammo mag or coins. When you do find a weapon again the stats are all over the place and you don’t really know if it is an improvement or that your marines can even use it.The UI is near unusable as you never really know who you gave the ammo to or understand what the stats are of how they interact. Everything is needlessly pixelated and small making it a chore to read. It’s all ugly to boot.It is just too random, badly designed, ugly, unbalanced and entirely unfair. This is a game that has seriously gone wrong at every level. Utterly unenjoyable and would have refunded it if I had the chance back then and demanded money for the waste of time.			"

												Bought this in early access, but really haven't put in much time. Why? Because it's so unforgivingly hardcore! One mistake, one misstep, and you'll never have enough health to recover. Positioning is extremely important, but so is staying out of your enemy's range and setting up ambushes. Items are everywhere, but so are enemies who are as tough as you, if not more so. And, once one of your guys dies, he's gone forever. You can pick up more crew between levels, but the new guys are never as useful as the guys you lost.I've yet to get past floor 3.The best thing I can say is... it's alightly easier than the original XCOM. So there's that.			"

								While I know it's not fair to write a review of a game after 30 minutes of playtime I do feel compelled to at least give my first impression.  One word comes to mind when I think about my experience with this game.  Clunky.  The mechanics, animation, tutorial.  It is all lacking.  There just isn't enough to grab me.  The art style seems lazy.  The gameplay seems bland.  Maybe there is more to this game than initially meets the eye, but I probably won't spend the time to find it.  If you get it for a dollar like i did, you may still feel like you got cheated.  With so many great games on steam and so many in development in Green Light I feel like my time would be better spent somewhere else.			"

There's just a bit of an unpolished feel which is more than acceptable considering it's in alpha.Again, only played 30 minutes but am SO glad to see a game requiring legitimate tactical thinking. There's literally a handful of decisions each squad member can make on any given turn. I love that. Anyway, for $10 you get what is promising to be a very deep and challenging tactical game with RPG elements (of which I've not spent any time with, yet).25MB download too, nice job guy.			"

								This is a procedurally generated turn-based squad tactical game, similar to the original Space Hulk. There are several different classes to choose from and team member stats are randomized. Even stats like weapon range, which is crucial to the gameplay. I've only played this game a few hours and it has been quite challenging so far.The interface could do with some polishing. For example, items you collect sometimes have incomplete or missing descriptions. I also feel that a system where you can redo moves before commiting to the next turn would be appropriate in this game.Good for a quick gaming fix. However, I only reccomend this game to enthusiasts of the genre.			"

The sprites are more detailed and much better animated, the UI has been cleaned up, and a lot of new gameplay elements have been added. If you are a fan of roguelike games or squad based strategy games, this is it. I'm sorry Space Hulk. You were a fantastic boardgame, but this one plays much better as a PC game ;)			"

 The good The game is pretty nice and hard. Just what I expected :D+ Pixels graphic+ Nice music (might need a couple more tracks)+ Game style that really shoves your mistakes into....

Now you can't shot/hurt it with other marines, nor can the stuck marine get out until he killed the monster with (now working only for him) melee attacks. Which, in most cases, ends up in the marine dying.Especially the last two ones are really game breakers, as the game is hellish hard at times and, surprise, its perma death.I know this is a game where you die a lot - but if I die due to a technical bug and not my stupidity, that really kills all fun for me (and, come on, this game is not a code-complexity monster!).Which is why I cannot recomment it as it is.

								Steam Marines is one of those little gems. Without a Kickstarter and a media campaign to drum up the hype, a lot of people won't offer it a second glance, and that's a crime. It's got lovely pixel graphics and a very appropriate sense of gallows humor, but more importantly, it's a textbook example of classic turnbased design, applying the very best lessons from Sid Meier, to a small but very clever roguelike.

								Lots of fun!!!!!! This is an amazing game, who will provide you with countless hours of fun, as long as you are ready for facing the complete unknown. The first thing to remember about this game is that you have to remember that a lot of it being fun is due to its ""old style"", ""retro style"", game, so don't expect things to come as easily as they come in modern games, where you can control everything just using your mouse ... this game requires you to really understand it and learn how to play it, and that means that the first times that you play you are probably going to loose, a lot! So, be ready to die, die, and die, as many times as it takes until you understand the gameplay. If the game doesn't look appealing in your first try, consider playing a few more times, since the easiness of dying can make you feel kinda blue when u are beginning. One of the key aspects of the game is memorizing what each class of soldier can do (leader, grenadier, etc.) and understand how to use them ... for instance, if you are not careful the grenadier will most likely get your other soldiers in a friendly fire ... also, you need to pay a lot of attention to how many moving points each soldier has, since a single mistake usually means death. What is fun about this game is that each scenario is completely random, so each start is almost like a fresh new start ... details, like paying attention to ammo, to doors that have bombs on them, or learning when is it worth to break down a wall to move to another room instead of using doors can mean the difference between life and death ... game rules as well must be well learned, since ""simple"" things like reloading means using all the action points available for that marine ... learning how to fire at enemies is also interesting, since you can only fire in straight lines (exception to the grenadier who can cause collateral damage around where his shells land), so it is almost like playing chess only with pawns and towers ... the guard mode can be pretty useful if you positioned your marine in the correct line of fire, or useless if he is looking to the left and the enemy is coming from the right ... and no, although in guarding mode, he won't turn and shoot the enemy ... in essence, I think this is a game where you spend the first hour learning ""how to play"" and counting how many times you already died ... however, after understanding the gameplay, it is fun, definitely! Due the random nature of the game you can find yourself suddenly surrounded by enemies or just exploring room after room and getting credits and more ammo ... what is going to happen? Nobody knows, each game is unique, and they are worth a shot ... however, if you are expecting an easy to play game, this is not a good idea ... it takes  time, strategy, memory and the ability to cope with defeat ... just like in real life!

								This is a review of an early-access game. This game has not technically been ""released"" yet. You are paying to playtest and report bugs/problems. In return, you get a copy of the game when it's released. I have given this game a thumbs up because I think it has potential, not because I think you should buy it. If you don't want to playtest a game in development, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.As I said, I think this game has potential But right now, the word is ""simplistic."" And in this context, that's a bad word.The gist is, you get a squad of four space marines of various classes, and you fight through several decks of a derelict space ship. Every turn, each marine gets a certain number of action points. Moving one square costs one action point, shooting costs one action point, turning 90 degrees costs one action point, reloading your weapon costs all your remaining action points.That gets very frustrating, very quickly, but I could live with it. what I CAN'T live with is the aiming mechanic. You can only fire at an enemy that is DIRECTLY in front of you. So if the enemy is four squares north and one square west, your first shot is going to cost three points (move one west, turn north, fire). Not only does that make the game difficult, but it also makes it very frustrating.That on top of the fact that realoading your weapon ends that marine's turn makes this game (for me) essentially unplayable in its current form. There are a lot of nifty ideas in this game, but for now that is preventing me from enjoying it.But take heart! This is a pre-release game, so it will be getting better. I can't say for sure that the things I don't like will get fixed, but I am optimistic that Steam Marines will be a fine game some day.EDIT:Just started playing this game again, and I'm enjoying it thoroughly. Reading my review above, I can't say that any of that has changed (though unchecking the option for ""facing costs AP"" was a big relief), but it seems that it matters less. Another problem that I had before was that it was hard to see. Once a marine looked away from a wall (for example), I seem to recall that there was no placeholder graphic to remind you ""hey! There was a wall here!"" Now walls don't disappear when you're not looking at them. I could be remembering wrong, but if that was a problem before it no longer is.This is now a game that I will whole-heartedly recommend.			"

												With too many bugs that freeze the game, (thus, it not responding) and strictly limited character customization, Steam Marines is okay; the gameplay is great, the graphics are good, and the concept is original, but the game has too many glitches; even during a beta test. My advice? For $14.99, this game is WAY overpriced; it would probably be a better deal to buy ""Freedom Planet"", with that kind of money, on Steam. (After all, for a Sonic homage, ""Freedom Planet"" looks amazing!) For effort, I give this 5/10, saying that the game has good concept, but it KEEPS FREEZING!P.S.; out of my respect for the creators, they should fix the bugs in this game, so it doesn't crash, on a Windows 8 or Windows 10 computer.

												I tried, but in the end i didn't really like the game. tl;dr verdict: Not fun enough!Easy mode is waaay to easy and normal & hard are very punishing. But more importantly, it just isn't very fun to play. Nothing feels ""cool"" or exciting except a few bosses that do manage to stand out. Gameplay works but just feels kinda uninspired. The later decks introduce better enemies and the pace picks up a bit, sadly most of my time was spend running around all too similar layouts and combat situations.It's not a bad game, so you won't regret a purchase, it just isn't very good. Compared to Bionic Dues it manages to bungle the UI in a different way and it's overall simpler to get going, but there's no strategic mode other than advancing through 5-level sets.The worst fault of the game is probably that i never felt invested in my squad or cared about the characters. Despite some random banter and unique abilities and upgrade paths, there wasn't any connection.Also, for a game that's fairly straightforward and easy to get into, somehow the pacing felt very very slow. Even with AI movement sped up, it takes too long to finish a level and it doesn't feel rewarding.The pixel art doesn't work for this game. Some assets look nice and clear, while others look downright ugly.Steam Marines is not a bad game, and it's not even dissapointing. I can't bash the developers because very little here actually stinks. Unfortunately nothing is above average either making me wonder how i spent around 7 hrs playing it.			"

								This is a hard game to review. At first it can seem overly simplistic and somewhat uninspired. In reality this is the difficulty of the game trying to force the player to have some ambition, to get into the feel of a roguelike where you trying to fight your way out of a dire situation. For example, in the earlier stages of the game there is some confusion as to whether you should take out the enemy robots or just run for the nearest elevator with minimal losses but no gained experience. At first this seemed like a design flaw, but after multiple playthroughs I'm of the opinion that the designers want an authentic roguelike experience, they don't want a corridor roguelike where you're just blasing through enemies to get to the randomized item at the end of the level. Thus I appreciate the game so far and need to put more time into it (that is the goal of an good indie game right?).			"

Early Access Review
								Review for early access version:As someone who frequently gets  suckered into  convinced to buy early access games, I was incredibly impressed with Steam Marines. This game feels like playing a full fledged game and while if you look closely you can spot the rough edges, it generally doesn't affect gameplay. Even better than that though is the fact that the developer is constantly active with the community working to fix any issues that crop up and discussing future implementations. As a personal example, I reported a minor bug that I noticed. He responded within 3 hours saying not only had he found the problem, but he also fixed it. If every early access developer put this kind of effort in, it wouldn't be nearly the crapshoot it currently is when buying early access games. If you want proof of developer involvement just look at the forums for this game, he is constantly posting.On the play side of things, this is not a game that will appeal to everyone. You control a squad of four marines progressing through procedurally generated ""decks"" of a space ship. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics reminiscent of the XCOM series in that every unit has a limited number of ""action points"" to use for moving, attacking, healing, etc. Once you have used all of your points the computer takes its turn moving the enemies about in the same fashion. Each of your marines has a different class/weapons and it is up to you to use them in a way that utilizes their strengths. With the exception of a brief tutorial that introduces just enough of the mechanics to kill yourself, there is very little hand holding in this game. Let me be clear though, there is a big difference between accessible and dumbed down. This game is most certainly accessible and honestly, pretty intuitive; it is not at all dumbed down. It will not stop you from accidentally throwing a grenade right next to a teammate, wandering around dying because you went the wrong way, or even wasting your points on accidental actions. This game will never ask you ""are sure you want to (insert random action here)"". If this sounds boring in any way let me disabuse you of that right now. This game is incredibly intense in a on-the-edge-of-your-seat way. If you ever start to feel relaxed, it's probably because you are staring at the menu screen after getting your face melted by a robot. Turn based means you get as much time as you want to choose how to lead your marines to their death, it also means you have to sit and watch as the AI exploits your mistakes to bring said death about even faster. As you progress through the game your marines will earn experience that translates into more perks and better stats. You will find yourself becoming more attached to your marines the longer you survive, making it that much worse when they suffer perma-death. The reluctance to enter a new room or turn a corner is heightened by the fact that the game has only one save file that is constantly updated so there are no second chances. You can find survivors along the way but they will be lowly privates with none of the awesomeness of your fallen soldier. Unlike some procedurally generated games there is a definite (and achievable) end goal which is perfect for people like me who need something to work towards besides a general ""do good..."". If any of this has sounded interesting I would recommend getting this game. Whether or not it is worth the list price is something you will have to decide for yourself, for me it was. If nothing else, watch for the game to go on sale or try to win one of the free keys the developer offers on his site   www.steammarines.com [www.steammarines.com]. Personally, I can't wait to see what this games becomes as it is developed further and until then I will continue to enjoy the current iteration.			"

												If a roguelike met space hulk, this would be their mean offspring. It's a very unforgiving squad based dungeon crawler. The robots on the ship want you dead, and they are very good at it. You need to recognize each type of enemy and learn to deal with them. You can, with some luck, find equipment to help you out. But first and foremost, you need to keep your squad healthy. Learn how the enemies move, learn how to cut paths through the ship, and make sure to cover the entrances to the rooms you're in. It is a very bleak game. You're not gonna find health packs all over to heal your squad, but at the same time you are invested in them. There's multiple classes, each good for different roles, and together they mesh to make it survivable. Losing a squad member hurts, and you will be fighting to save a squadie if he gets cut off from the rest. I do wish that firing was more free line of sight, ala space hulk, but it's all tile based, which offers a different strategic element, though I find it works pretty well with the constricting corridors you often find yourself in. Playing the tutorial is a must. There's not a lot of clicking to be done, as most controls are done with the keyboard, and if you don't play the tutorial, you will not know what keys to use. I almost wish they had just completely removed the mouse from the controls. I think it just confuses people more than anything. Graphically, it's retro. My only real gripe is that I wish there were death animations and corpses left from your squad members instead of them just dissapearing. If you like roguelikes and you like tactical gameplay, and you don't mind (prefferably like) the retro presentation, it's a pretty fun game. I feel like there should be more depth to it, more classes offering more weaponry, etc, but it is what it is, and what it is is a pretty solid, cuthroat scifi roguelike with squad management. Just don't give up after you get murdered the first couple times.			"

												In short: Not a very good roguelike game. Why not? Steam Marines is one of those games that believe tileset graphics are enough to make a good roguelike. The style is indeed lovely but the UI is clunky and the setting uninspiring. You can choose you group from several different character types (engineer, etc.) but I didn't find the system fun or diverse enough to endulge me. So I didn't play much of this. I tried it and was dissappointed. But never again will I by a game by it's looks.			"

The classes, the weapons, the skills and the tactical elements are massivly great. It has aliens and si-fi horrors and youl feel trapped with great music + nice gameplay what is there else to ask?An absolute must for anyone who love tactictal games, roguelike games, space marines and having fun.Kero			"

												Sorry, I cant recommed buying this game. Got it at this autumn sale, and it has been a disappointment.First of all, it has a serious UI design problem: the UI its not intuitive and laggy.Second even at the starting levels it takes ages doing the enemies movements (even with quite decent hardware), you have to wait for halt a minute to the AI to move...It even crashes frecuently when going to the desktop and back...No, no, noooo, such a good game it could have been... what a pity...

												Like so many other reviews I would really love to give this a positive and probably would have if another game hadn’t shown me how it could have been done. For its price tag I would recommend getting it only when on sale if this is something you really want to try…The Good: You have classes all fairly unique, nice range of enemies, it’s tough with a steep learning curve but not impossible meaning you’ll want to try again once you get the hang of it, some nice little collectables.Not so good: Old school graphics, I don’t mind these but only when done correctly these actually cause headaches when trying to play the game (i.e. think two corridors are joined only to find out its outer space). Controls seem on occasion buggy can be a minor nuisance. Prices in shops fluctuate drastically it seems a little too random. Cover doesn’t seem to work very well mainly due to graphics and controls you think you’re in cover when not. It’s hard yes but to the point sometimes the enemies are harder than you and your facing more of them. Too random, some levels you breeze through no problems other times your get creamed by strange map design, and overpowered NPCs.Try Halfway it’s very similar but seems to have dropped the complete randomness for a better storyline and a much more enjoyable play. I would easily change this review if the above were fixed or the price was slightly less (worth it on sale).			"

												Steam Marines is the definition of a difficult tactical game. It is simply Brutal. Every little mistake you make means your death. There was no other game I have played that made me over think my every movement and regret so much some of my actions.Overall it is a carefully crafted turn base strategy tactical combat game. The mechanics are very interesting, once you get a grasp on them … usually after you first 100 deaths in level 1. The UI is slow to grasp, it took me many days till I finally get to understand that your Soldiers can level up and use skills. But once you got everything … it gets very interesting.Despite the brutal difficulty of the game, one cannot say it is unfair. The game stated that is difficult, so the deaths are caused by your decisions alone. On the contrary of what people think that this game is unbeatable … once you understand the way to play it, you are going to wreck those Aliens. You just need patience, a lot of smart thinking and repetition …. and luck … tons of luck.I suggest this game to any turn base fans over there. "

												Terrible. Just getting through the first floor can be a feat most the time, enemies swarm and outnumber and kill in a few hits. Can't get more than 3-4 rooms a game on just normal difficulty. Doesn't help that it feels my input is meaningless, like there is nothing I could have done differently. The tutorial covers only the bare minimum of controls, leaving out anything more in depth that might be good to know, something they even point out at the end of the tutorial. Maybe they expect you to learn through playing but honestly I can't be bothered. Doubt it would help anyway when my guys are just going to be hopelessly zerg'd a couple floors in anway. Pass.			"

												I was expecting a ""traditional"" tactical RPG, but this is something different.  Normally I like experimenting with new & different things, but I wasn't a fan of how things were handled in this game.The movement system is strange where you use directional arrows to move characters around instead of pointing and clicking. If you press into a wall, that actually takes an action point.  This is because you can break through pretty much any wall.  Changing your facing consumed an action point, which I consider an unforgivable flaw.  This is something I'm used to being ""free"" in all other TRPGs.There is no story at all.  There's nothing between each level.  It just jumps into the next level as soon as you finish one.  The goal in every level is to reach the elevator.  You don't have to kill all enemies.  The enemies are unbalanced.  I played at the easiest difficulty and I encountered several enemies that I couldn't cause ANY damage on.  That includes blasting it with my ""heavy"" and nearly killing himself with the splash damage.It felt like a random demo that someone made to show off their gameplay system.  There is nothing tying it all together.			"

												The game is truly one of a kind, it keeps you on your toes all throughout the game. However the game is either too easy (easy difficulty) or too hard (normal difficulty). The destruction of walls gives a whole new aspect to the gaming (that's where it is completely different in gameplay from X-com series). Once you get used to playing it it does become a little bit dull again.I'd give it a 7 kool-aid men smashing through walls out of 10.			"

												Steam Marines is a great turn based game similar to the Warhammer 40,000 game ""Space Hulk"".  You control a squad of four marines trapped on board a spaceship full of human killing robots all wanting to rip your squishy human squad into teeny tiny pieces.  The game is rouge like so each time you play the ship, enemy and loot layout is slightly different meaning nothing is predicable.When you start the game you select classes and perks for each of your four marines, I higher recommend not taking duplicate classes and some loot is class specific.  The leader & scout class are a must.  Marines have an allotted amount of action points which are depleted by one everytime a marine moves, fights, shoots, open doors, use items etc...  Fight your way to the elevator on each floor and take on the boss mob in order to advance.Easy mode is great to gets to grip with the game but the true mature of this game is best played on normal mode.  Easy mode is too easy, marines have lots of action points, enemies have lowered health and action points.  Not much of a challenge.Normal mode is good but is ridiculously difficult.  Ideally this needs nerfing slightly and for that reason I rate this game 6.5/10.  If normal mode was adjusted slightly to make it passably hard as appose to impossible I would rate this 8/10.			"

												This game is basically a stripped down version of original XCOM with residual RPG elements.Or more precisely, it's a rogue-like turn-based tactical space robot/alien/monster shooter with procedurally generated levels.Gameplay is OK in general, but there are enough reasons to look the other way to spend your time on. Here are some of them:- Controls are awful, and prone to mistypes, which for rogue-likes is kind of a big deal;- Map and layout of objects on it is awkward and takes some time to get used to;- I'm pretty sure the only thing which can keep you playing (all 30 short levels) is the game's difficulty. Myself, after dying five times on the level 2 (talk about learning curve) of average difficulty, I switched to easy and then was really bored most of the way;- Monster types are limited, they're stupid, and when they manage to damage your characters it's because of something which would seem more like a game bug then legitimate gameplay;- Leveling up is weird, it's like you're getting XP for discovering monsters, not killing them. And when you character reaches final level, you can reset his feats and start training in other class.Other then that, game is fine, crushing walls in robot suit is fun :)			"

												Instead of being hard this game comes across as poorly balanced and designed, overall limited. Not worth the money.If you want a challenging tactical game or roguelikes with depth there's better choices on Steam.			"

												This is a first feedback from a short play of released version and a full play of an Early Access version that was quite advanced and totally playable.It's a very fun Roguelike game with a team of characters. That's very rare for Roguelike games because it requires control multiple characters. But a mix of design elements makes it work very well. It's very surprising how light the play is despite you control 4 characters. Also the team aspect gives it a lot of originality and helps reinforce the depth.Another noteworthy element is how the game evokes Spacehulk/Alien, that's great.About Steampunk, look yourself the snapshots, it's very light, so don't really search that in the game.About about random range and diversity, it's here, enough to make a play enough different to another, and to keep the surprise which is an important element of the gameplay. But if my experience of Early Access is still valid, and additions hadn't changed it deeply, then the range of variations isn't huge like some of the biggest Roguelike. It's solid random and fair range of diversity of random, but don't expect much more. It's still enough to makes it a true Roguelike.Overall its key words are, very fun Roguelike, light play, good depth, team, Spacehulk/Alien.			"

Early Access Review
								I wish I knew how early and unfinished this game was before I made my purchase. For the first couple minutes of gameplay my marines walked around punching walls until they broke apart. At least thats what I had guessed was happening as it was difficult to make out exactly what was going on just from watching the awful color palettes of blurry mosaic squares moving to amateur 8-bit sound effects. I finally found an enemy and spent a minute trying to figure out how to attack it before quitting out of the game. I'm reluctant to beta test even AAA products so maybe this sort of thing isn't for me. In any case this will most likely be the last early release game that I buy.			"

YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Steam Marines 

			Views: 34		

			Steam Marines is an awesome rouge like, turn based strategy game. It's available on Steam for $15.		

What is it?Steam Marines is a rouge-like turn based strategy game. It's gameplay most closely resembles the old Space Hulk board game (also the more recent games of the same name). Every time you start you get to choose four soldiers, each of which has a class and a perk. You then enter a randomly generated space ship that is infested with evil robots. Your goal is to fight your way to the elevator and get to the next floor.There are five different decks of the ship that you have to go through. Each of these decks is divided into five levels with a boss on the final level. You always start on one deck, but you then get to choose where you go after you complete it. Each deck has its own asthetic and set of enemies that goes with it.Throughout the game, your soldiers will level up, thereby gaining skills and abilities, as well as get new equipment. This adds good depth to the later game (and probably stops you from being completely curb-stomped). I thought I might also note that if you have a less then four soldiers in your squad at the end of a floor you have a chance of getting a new soldier. You don't get to choose the class or perk, but this can at least give you a fighting chance if things don't go too well.Pros:-The game has a good variety of classes. In saying this, I mean that each class has a distinct role in the squad because of their specific weapon.-The enemies feel equal to your soldiers. In my opinion, a squad turn based strategy needs enemies that are on a similar level to your soldiers. Without that, it would either be so easy that you don't have to think tactically, or far too hard. Steam Marines strikes a nice balance.-There are distinct enemies. Through my journey I've seen enemies that are pure melee, pure range, ones that lose AP as you hit them, and ones that can't be damages from cenrtain sides. Each of these enemies needs to be dealt with using different tactics, which adds a good depth to the game.-Each deck has a difficulty rating. You might think that this doesn't mean that much, of course they do that just makes sense. You're right, it does make sense, but the permadeath makes that addition all the more important. You will know which deck is least likely to kill you and thereby least likely to lose you all of your hard work.Cons:-The random generation sometimes causes problems. It is possible to enter a level on that levels elevator. One would think that that would be a good thing, but there is a problem. The boss on the final level spawns on the elevator. The first time I made it to level five I spawned on the elevator, directly next to the boss. This is an almost guaranteed loss.-This con is not necessarily bad for everyone, but it still needs to be noted. The game is VERY difficult. I've played nine hours of the game and I only made it past the first deck once.-The system for executing the enemy turns is flawed. Firstly, on default settings the enemy turn will last an ungodly length of time. This can be easily fixed in the settings, but there is a bigger issue. The game has a setting that, in essence, focuses on the screen as the enemies move. It will do this not only for ones that you can see, but also enemies that you can't see around you. This gives you advanced warning of where enemies are. Turning this off means that it will NEVER follow enemy movements. Your screen is also locked in place while the enemy moves. I hope you kept all of squad together, or you won't get to watch the action. (Man, that was long winded)The game has some flaws, but overall I enjoyed it a lot. If you have played Dark Souls (and are hardnened to the idea of constant death) and enjoy squad turn-based strategy games then this game will hit the mark. It's a lot of deadly fun for $15.			"

												Bottom Line: A contrived attemp at a turn-based rogue-like squad combat sci-fi RPG that has a painfully slow start and so many key bindings that you may need to actually forget some general knowledge to make room in your brain for them (Oh and the tutorial basically only tells you how to move and shoot). I do not recommend this game to individuals with short attention spans (you know who you are) as you will likely not get past the tutorial. I also don't recommend the game to people in search of another good Rogue-like (the reason I bought it...), this game is not it. The Long of it (4 paragraphs):I'm gonna be honest, I tried to get into this game. Really and truly. After roughly five separate attempts over the past year I finally gave up. I know I only have a little less than an hour of play time on it, and truthfully I didn't get far past the tutorial on any of my attempted plays; but what I saw from the time I spent on the game I could tell the game had a serious flaw: even after the tutorial, there is a strong chance you still won't be able to play the game effectively. Now, I don't mind teaching myself how to play a game, but as far as I'm concerned any rogue-like game that I can't get comfortable playing within the first 15 minutes should reconsider its place in the genre.Expanding on the utter lack of a real tutorial: The tutorial informs you of critical game mechanics...... that's it. At the start of the game you learn how to move, shoot, reload, and open doors/chests. It completely glosses over the 40+ controls/key bindings as well as basically neglecting to explain most of the UI, which is, by the way, and utter trainwreck.Looking past the lack of initial information, the level design is not well though out. At all. Most rooms are too small to have more than two of your squad comfortably occupy (since they are likely also completely filled with enemies). Sometimes you will start on a level in a room filled with enemies, sometimes the room doesn't have an exit, sometimes filled with enemies and also no exit. The 'rogue-likeness' of this game is sloppy at best and provides a purely annoying game environment, as opposed to that fresh feeling you get from ideally executed rogue-likes. It almost seems like the devs wanted to make a game that spanned as many genres as possible so they put in a crappy random number generator and called it a rogue-like.Suffice to say, this game is like Indian food, it tries very hard to be a lot of things, and looks enticing, but often leaves a bad taste in your mouth. After you play what you thought was supposed to be a turn-based squad combat, rogue-like sci-fi RPG, you realize that there is just too much going on and you were silly to think it would deliver everything you thought it would.
