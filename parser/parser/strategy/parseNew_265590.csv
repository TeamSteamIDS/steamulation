Early Access Review
								I'll skip the stuff about it beeing 8 player coop and sooo on and start talking about the stuff that might not be mentioned as often in short reviews:The game offers multiple difficulties.. however the base difficulty is intended to be rather challenging for Players. Which is definitly a good thing since it's all about improving your own skill and after many defeats rewarding yourself with your very first win... somewhat darksouls-esque.. ----Classes:So far there's a total of 8 classes and depending on what the player wishes to accomplish every class has one or more  distinctive roles.(Tank, Healer, DmgDealer,Scout....)List of the Classes:Demolitioner,Medic, Hellfire(aka.Firebat), Marksman, Terminator, Recon, Assault, Heavy Support----Playerstats/Rewards/Achievements:There are different ranks and medals you can unlock. However, while the high ranked players get stat bonuses and unlock new skills as reward, it's still very balanced:(stats of max Rank 25 player are probably 1.3-1.8 times as high as the stats of Rank 1 player) Boosters:You unlock boosters which are very similar to perks known from games like CoD4-6 increasing stats like ms, HP, Armor, XP... You can choose 3 Boosters per Game Session.----GameContentAmount >>> Randomness >>> Replayability:Each Class has a variety of modules(which if you pick them for a game each unlock 1 or multiple passive or active skills)Weapons:There is also a variety of weapons(which not only have different dmg stats but also different purposes e.g.  light weapons that reduce enemy armor vs. Heavy weapons with high Dmg output vs. explosive weapons vs. weapons with aoe dmg but limited range of usage or high ammo consumption/cooldown) Some Weapons can use Multiple Ammotypes(HollowPoint vs Piercing)Further one can also use the environment as weapon-> throwing explosive fuel Barrels or blowing up Toxic and Radioactive Canisters or Bombs planted by Insurgents.Damage Types:There is a number of Dmg TypesHollowPoint; Piercing; Fire; Toxic; Energy; Explosive; each and every one has their pros and cons, since some Zombies and Bosses have certain resistances towards specific Dmg TypesMissions:They are randomized to a somewhat high extend they may take place in different locations and feature different enemies and objectives e.g.: Defusing Bombs, stopping a Nuclear Meltdown, Hunting/Capturing Creatures and so on.Gamemodes:Besides the Main storyline theres a Number of additional gamemodes and modifiers you can mix them just the way you want it giving you control over difficulty and Playstyle of a GameSession:-Bunkermode(You're being Supplied with resource and have to protect a beacon)-Red Storm(When You're outside of buildings your armor gets depleted and you move slower unless the storm stops for a    brief time giving you the chance to safely change location to another building)-Swarm(Creatures Have less HP but there's a whole lot more of them coming towards you)-Hardcore(Additional Random Spawns of Bosses and Special Creeps/Events)----Stuff I did not mention in this review: Random Environment Settings/MapsAll these  factors provide a huge range of possibilities ensuring very high level of replayability. The Customisation options offer a level of control to the Gameplay, ultimatly providing a high level of balance resulting in hours of fun.Ofcourse I am biased nevertheless everybody looking for a challenge or just for some coop action should give the game a try( you check out the official website for a demo version).. but watch out if you manage to survive the first hour you might already be hooked ;-)			"

												Great game and you can tell by the hours put in that I got my $20 worth. I am unable to recommend this game due to the community however (there are a few great people that I had the pleasure of meeting). If you enjoy being forced to join Teamspeak and listen to others calling a newer player an ""idiot"" because of a simple mistake then the community may not bother you. I have been in sales/customer service most of my life so I deal with far worse day to day but I draw a line when people who pay to enjoy their free time are belittled. The only reason I now leave this review, which is soley my opinion, is due to receiving a permanent forum ban w/o breaking any of the Steam rules and guidelines. To those who put in time and effort to create this game; thank you for occupying approximately 40 days of my life.**EDIT**I am updating this review to show appreciate to a member of the developing team for extending an apology based on my experience. My review doesn't change due to the prime aspect (multiplayer) of the game being a difficult obstacle to overcome due to average players, learning curve, and annoyance of hazings (I can't speak of recent experience on this but you can look at the forum discussions and see mods continuously being rude with no reprecussion of their steam violations).To highlight the game itself. This game game me a sense of accomplishment at times. You work cooperatively (and voice comminucation certainly does make things easier but not necessarily impossible) in up to 8 player PvE.  The environment can be very challenging depending on difficulty and options selected. The main group generally stays tight and loots bigger buildings early while a person or two wander to areas less traveled late game. It's easy to become overwhelmed and gameover at almost any point early on. After a good tutor or 100-200 hours this is a memory except on higher difficulties. The time investment to have a grasp on roles, map coverage, wave tendencies is another slight barrier...but we all hope a game grasps our attention for much longer. Graphics are decent but you also need a machine to accomodate with larger waves and monster variations. I can't disregard the game itself...only speak on experience. The game isn't the only part of the picture for me to have an opinion on either.			"

												ok graphics were pretty decent, music was nice, gameplay wasn't too bad. but overall it was ok. maybe i might revisit one day.endless mobs don't bother me but some people might feel overwhelmed by it. one thing that i laughed at was some of the negative reviews because i thought they were just making things up about multiplayer. Then i decided to read posts in the discusions and it kinda of annoyed me to see mods treating people like garbage and noobs. with a small playerbase all they seem to wanna do is alienate people more. calling out people on new mistakes if they're new. i mean come on isn't that the point of being new? they will make mistakes but these people really seem to be toxic. now seeing people got bans it makes me wonder how toxic it really is. it just makes me dislike to even wanting to try. yes i know jerks are in every game but when i see mods being rude then it really makes me not want to try it and not like the game even more.isn't the whole idea of playing a game to bring in people not drive them off? just my opinion though			"

												I got involved with TRS after seeing it on Kickstarter and downloading the demo. I was vaguely familiar with the Blizzard mod (Night of the Dead) that it was based on but haven't really played anything like it since. That's because there hasn't been anything like it since! The Red Solstice is a hard as balls co-op survival game that is perfect for Steamworks and I was happy to help Ironward launch it on Early Access and grow the community as the game headed toward a full release. Now the game is out of Early Access and is better than ever. Single player and tactical mode are awesome and the co-op is tighter than ever. So proud of the team at Ironward for showing how you do an Early Access game RIGHT on Steam.Move it, marine!			"

												I must admit, this game can be worth the time, but that is a big ""if"".Since the game player ""elites"" punishes many rookies and do not accept people being new.There is this guy in the elite ranks who kills people off in mid game, and untill that moment, he trash talks to them. And if they do not react within 4 secs of what they are being told they get wiped out.and i quote him ""making a tough choice"", which is direct lie, and some of the other ""elites"" seems to accept his stupid behavoir, which result in new players do never return to the game.The worse part is that it seems like this guy (better?) is friends with the developer and therefore continue this cancerous behavoir.This makes the community very small, and shrinking by the day.I have been hosting alot of games, and trying to learn new people up, answering questions (even though it is normally the same ones). as also trying to lead the team to victory (low success rate) and yet i can enjoy myself.I will never enjoy playing with the ""elites"" since most acts like a bunch of spoiled brats, but even though of all the negative the game is repeatly enjoyable.I recommend only because of the game itself, but hanging on a thin string towards not doing so, since the elite community is not very forgiving or accepting new gamers in.

												Got into it quite early in the Beta, when it was still a bit of a buggy mess. You still played it, because it was fun. The learning curve is nothing to laugh about, and it is not exactly the noobfriendliest of communities, especially some of the first players sometimes lack the nerves to deal with new players. Once you get into it though, you will have an awesome experience. Highly tactical, once you get off ""Soldier""-difficulty, relies 100% on each teammate. By now the game has several different maps, playable on 4 difficulties and a handful of different modes that change up the experience like the ""Red Storm"" mode where you are weak when outside of buildings, but stronger inside, or swarm and fast modes that increase the pressure on your squad. All with 8 different classes, completely customizable with different weapons and abilities, that have to be utilized harmoniously to win.Protip: Get a mic. Theres a central TRS teamspeak server, that anyone in the game lobby can give you, and coordinating an 8 man team is just so much easier with voice. Learning the game and getting taught will be 10 times faster if you go on ts with one or two of your squadmates.The best way to get into it would be to grab a few freinds, put it on easy, and just jump into it. You will die. A LOT. but thats fine, and you will have fun getting to know all the different abilities and weapons before getting on with the pros who might be more interested in winning than teaching.Sadly, this game has a very small player base, so don't expect to play 8 man games 24/7. There are high times each day, where there are usually 2-4 different games going on, but expect to do some waiting in lobby for members. However, this means that you get to know people very quickly, and if you are somewhat nice and don't harass people, you will be welcomed in the community.			"

Early Access Review
								I played The Red Solstice a lot during the alpha test, and wrote up an alpha hands-on that explains why I like this game.  Here is the link just in case anyone might find it useful since much of it still applies to the early access test:http://www.deathbybeta.com/2014/04/09/the-red-solstice-alpha-hands-on/What was great about the game then is still great now, and things will improve over time during the early access test.  TRS is a challenging co-op game that pulls no punches.  You will die a lot, and it can be frustrating.  But, at the same time, it can extremely satisfying when your team pulls off a successful run.  Not for the faint of heart or easily frustrated, but highly recommended if you like hectic co-op isometric tactical shooters.In addition, there is a lot of tactical depth to the game that isn't apparent at first glance.  Having eight classes, each with their own skills, means that team composition can vary widely and be tailored to the strategy.  Faster marines for highly mobile teams and scouting, or slow but heavily armed marines for hunkering down.  Each class shares a global XP rank that benefits all classes, but then has its own XP rank for just that class.  This means that specializing can really pay off in the long run.In game there is a large number of items that can be found and used (mines, turrets, medical supplies, ammo, tac-nukes, and so on), and proper use of these can also greatly affect the tactics.  All in all, a very exciting nail-biting game.  The early access build is not without some glitches, and it is missing a lot of content, SO KEEP THAT IN MIND before purcahsing the game right now.  Nonetheless I am very much enjoying the game just as much as I did during the alpha.			"

												Been playing this for a while now but only casually.  If you're happy to be a follower and support the team it doesn't get too complicated but if you want to master any particular character it can become a much more rewarding experience albeit frustrating at times.  My main concern is there will always be players who will put unnecessary pressure/blame when things go pair shaped - ignore these bullies and just play for enjoyment.The more I play the more I enjoy the team work necessary to survive, each character has a roll and must contribute to the team.  Once you master one character and find a good setup (yet to really do as I'm not a perfectionist) just swap and start experimenting with another character as you can definitely put in plenty of hours levelling up each character and get a different experience with each.

												---Review updated as of 5/14/16Recently i've been told that veterans of this game have been told to delete their reviews and repost them to try to bury this review.  Apparently no-one listened and the devs were called out on it.  I'd like to thank all the players who stood up to the circle-jerk and refused to bury my review.  The original review can be seen below.---Great game marred by a terrible comunity, recent tournament was a total scam.  Winners got 2nd place because they weren't part of the Wrecker/Syrus/SgtKeller/Stylo circlejerk.  Giveaways during the event were a scam because winners weren't part of the aforementioned circlejerk.  If this is how you promote your game, I can only give a negative review.

												I feel bad writing this review, because even with a thumbs up, I feel like I'll be cutting the game off at the knees. But better you know the truth, I guess.First off, the game is based on a WC3 custom map called Night of the Dead. You are space marines prancing around a Mars colony full of zombies. You select a suit (read: class), a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, 4 suit components (read: skill...not trees. Paths, maybe? 5 sequential, mostly passive abilities), up to 3 powerups (which add some bonuses at the cost of other penalties), and you go off to try and survive a ~1 hour long match. You find items and accomplish objectives which will strengthen your team, while endless waves of zombies try to murder you to death. The customization isn't that deep, but you'll find plenty to tinker with if you're the fiddy sort. I enjoy it greatly.Singleplayer exists, but it's not the focus. You control 4 marines and run around doing the same kind of stuff. It's fun. Probably not full price fun, but fun nonetheless.Multiplayer is the real heart of the game. In order to stand any chance, each player must possess basic tactical acumen and practice it for the entirety of the hour. Further, you have to possess some expertise in your class and use the right abilities at the right times, and understand the flow and structure of the game. Put simply, you are going to lose. You're going to lose a lot. It's a very hard game. Some vets will come and say ""oh, no, it's not hard, just git gud"". Well, fair enough, but the game has a very steep learning curve. It's simple to play, very difficult to master. That's a good thing, I think. But still, expect to lose a crap ton.There is a meta-progression, where you increase in rank (which unlocks stuff, and gives some very minor bonuses) and suit rank (gives very minor bonuses to a particular class when you play it), and medals (also small, but welcome bonuses to individual suits). It starts off fast, but becomes extraordinarily grindy to max. But that's OKAY. When I say very minor bonuses, I mean it. The game is much like Left 4 Dead, or Vermintide in that the game is almost entirely about good teamwork, and somewhat about individual skill, and very little about raw stats or xp. About 70% of winning is teamwork, 20% is individual competence, 9% is having enough xp to play the classes you need, and 1% is xp-rewarded stat bonuses. On top of all that, you can prestige (yes, lose one full 0 to max xp amount) in order to get even more tiny bonuses. That said, unless you're a total no-lifer, don't expect to max anything here.Now let's talk about the community. In order to accomplish anything, you will need to bring friends or make friends. I was able to take my little gaming collective of 3 into the game and we died a bunch, but we were able to improve considerably and also not hate or ruin the game for each other. That's pretty ideal. If you can't bring your own friends, you'll probably need to find a few veterans on the forums. The community is incredibly small, and if you just join a public game, you will get 5 minutes in, and then die, and everyone else will die, and everyone will swear a lot and blame each other. You will swear that nobody else in the world but you knows how to play the game better than a chimpanzee with a congenital learning disability. You will rage that it will take you 9650 games to reach the next rank if you keep dying on wave 2. You will go out into the darkness, and there will be a great wailing and gnashing of teeth. Sometimes, you'll sit in the lobby and there won't be enough people to form one lousy game.Yeah. You need to either bring your own community to this game, or else ingratiate yourself to the crusty old veterans who've solved this puzzle ages ago.But overall, I recommend this game as everything about it is a labor of love. They adapted Night of the Dead from Warcraft 3 to bring the game to its fullest potential, to introduce it to new people, many of whom don't even own Warcraft 3. It's certainly not for the money, given the sad state of the community. And the players work on it out of passion too. I see more and higher quality guides for Red Solstice than I see for most AA games these days. The people who make and play this game obviously care about it a lot. There is some talk about how to strengthen the community, but the fact of the matter is, in my opinion, you just can't. It's a niche game, it's a difficult game, it has virtually no marketing, and the story is the narrative version of a toupee. 99% of gamers would take one look at it and turn right around. Red Solstice is a hidden co-op gem, on the same level as AI War. It's a very rare taste. It'll never be very popular, and that's fine, because it doesn't need to be. It's just fun. I like it a lot.One last note: expect to do a lot of research. Many of the deeper mechanics are buried within documentation that exists only on the forum, or one guy's steam guide, and some haven't been written down at all.			"

												I love this game.If you played the Warcraft 3 Custom Map Night of the Dead ( NotD ) or the various versions of it in SC2, you will feel pleasantly reminded of them once playing this game. It is very much so inspired by them and the gameplay is similar, but also fleshed out and this game incorporates many new aspects, such as the leveling system, the various skills, and the ability to create your class before ""dropping"" into a mission/map.Teamplay is key in multiplayer, but you can enjoy the Solo-Mode as well and the game seems to adjust automatically to the amount of players, making it possible to play it with only a handful of friends or even just two player CO-OP.If you like cooperative missions with great atmosphere ? Get this game !10/10			"

												I give this game a thumbs up for elitists whom play the game like their life depended on it, good job you salty scrubs lolnow for the game:In all honesty Its a good game but the community (specifically the highest rankers) are a bunch of children when it comes to one person doing something they dont find ""suitable"", that goes for me too, I am also a high rank scrub but I dont ♥♥♥♥♥ or complain about it. Do yourselves a favor, dont listen to them, if its your first time, I encourage you to play it by yourself through campaign and solo multiplayer with 3 npc bot teammates (if you decide to use npc bot teammates dont let another person join) for the first time with the npc player bots alone. Otherwise you wont learn anything, or if not alone then maybe a few friends can join you, either way you'll have fun. Dont forget to read the descriptions of items and the skills you can choose.8.5/10 its not perfect but its a good game3/10 community is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥, though not all people are asshats			"

Early Access Review
								One of the best tactical shooter games on steam, and it's still in alpha. The scope for different strategies is massive, think alien swarm; but with more players, more classes, more weapons/drops and far more interactive maps. As of now I have only played the survival mode but am already hooked. The Devs are also ridiculously dedicated, and responded to questions asked (on the day of release of all times!) immediatly. It is a game which will most likely grow to have a brilliant, friendly community like other stratgey based games. Couldn't recommend it enough.			"

												The game itself is fantastic. Cool story (well you already know it, sort of) decent graphics, even on my old 4850 GPU, and matching music and sfx.BUT...The devs need to clean up a lot of bugs, it is only playable 3 out of 5 times due to these randomly interfering errors:(pick at least any two - list may not be complete)[ ] Game does not allow for switching to tactical mode aka ""bullet time"" (makes it unplayable, you need this) - edit: In certain game modes this option has to be manually activated during game setup.[ ] Bot Team members stop following the ""follow"" order - edit: in some game modes this requires an alternative key sequence. C'm on !?[ ] Placed explosives cannot be selected and detonated, they simply won't focus any more IF they were placed before reaching a checkpoint and after rewinding to that checkpoint. The whole checkpoint thing does not work, as you are set back in time, yes, but supplies are just as low as in the moment before you rewound. So rewinding to a checkpoint is just pointless.[ ] Health and armor bars vanish from the overview[ ] Minimap is obscured by some key binding hints that just wont go away - edit: that seems to be so on purpose. Even more annoying.[ ] Item capacity in inventory gets over exploited (i.e. ""you have 15 of 10"") - that one I don't mind :)[ ] There are possibly some more, I have played it only for a couple of hours.However the missions are of varying difficulty, some are absurdly difficult - even in rookie mode.This game could do much better and I would really join in on all the praise I read here, if the devs fixed it.The way the game comes now is frustrating, as the glitches really ruin the fun, especially when you have an otherwise good run and have to quit it, just because. There are no save slots.However I may not have gotten down to every aspect of it, as it is an extremely complex game.You really need to read a lot, to get into.Edit: my edits were added after I got a bit deeper into it. So this game is mainly multi player, but has a single story mode. That one I was refering to in my first version of the review.Multiplayer is way more fun. BUT I have never seen more than 10 ppl online at the same time.In multiplayer there is a wide gap as to what you can do as rookie player compared to the pros, so expect to die a lot (and spend the rest of the mission watching) when you do not have a maxed out setup. And that takes sooooome time: There are 8 classes to be played, each has a specific level of 0 to 10 while you as the player have another level of 0 to 25 (that rises with any class). Some clases only become available after you have a certain amount of XP earned with others. This concept is quite cool as personal and class-individual bonuses stack. So once you have risen to a certain personal level (you advance both level types during play), this makes switching to a new class not as frustrating as starting at square one.So, you may have guessed it. This is obviously for ppl that have time to spare and really wanna get into it. Then again I think it's not that captivating (the story is always pretty much the same), but that is up to you. The mission items and objectives are not as dull as in some other games, but, well, after some time... they are pretty much the same.The same in all games to be honest. Yeah, you may switch the map, but the story unfolds all the same.The last paragraph containes the word ""same"" at least four times. That pretty much summs it up.To me this looks more like a decent beta version than a real game.I'll kook into this after some time.I am not convinced.And apart from saying so, it just has nothing to do with mars. It's just for the story.Tested version was 1.175			"

												Release review. Well its been a year and the game has improve with more polish. It now comes with a Single player Story mode and a Single player roaming game. But the bread and butter of this game is Mulitplayer. So for this game to do well is pretty much the community doing its part teaching new players that want to play and teach them with patiences. There is always one or two fools that just won't jive with the group but its only one game. So what to come down to it is... Prepare to die and die some more . At the end of your first victory you be hook on the drug 8 play co-op game  call TRS. Btw i have about 1300hrs in.. so yea** Early Acess Review as of 12-20-2014**8 Player Co-OP. If your a fan of the War3 mod or the SC2 where teamwork is key to survive the game then look no futher. The game is fun and addictive but has a moderate learning curve. The grind for skills isn't that bad since most of the major skill a player would use in any classes could be attain in 5-6 games depending on ability to play the game. *Playing mode* There are as 2 maps playable and a 3rd one in testing. This is all for CO-OP. There is no single player at this moment but should be added but no time table for it. To me this game primary focus is the CO-OP aspect to create a growing community and hope for an editor to come out to provide user created content soon!!You can ask your questions here and I will try to answer them correctly to the best of my ability. The developers are active and particpate with the community on daily bases and patches come frequent enough with fixes and new content. The community with is still growing but are open to new people to joining everyday. You will meet people all over the world with one goal in common to kill zombies and spray lead till they stop moving. *****TLDR*****Pro-- Good game, Growing community, Responsive Developers, CO-OP fun.Con-- Growing community, Lack of Single Player for some people atm, Moderate learning curve *note*I play this game for about 700hrs so my POV is over the progress from the start of the game till now.Ask questions if you like.

												I cannot recommend this game to most people. My issue with The Red Solstice is that it feels flawed and incomplete, it is plauged by questionable design decisions and poor balancing combined with a steep learning curve. All that being said the game can be quite fun when playing with a few friends of similar experience level and if you have a group of four or more to play and learn this game with you may find something enjoyable here, but for everyone else I would advise staying away. The single player campaign is serviceable but quickly gets rote, and the multiplayer component is dissapointing due to many questionable design choices and poor balancing that is made worse by the experience gap new players will face when joining a lobby with veteran players. You'll find yourself confused and more or less useless for a number of hours before being able to contribute to the team, and once you learn how to properly play the game you'll likely find the experience is not at all what you wanted in the first place. The game works against itself in a number of ways that inhibit strategy and interdependence of the classes. The demolitions class for instance will be made almost entirely useless due to the abundance of lootable explosives IF the team even decides to rely on these devices, but more importantly you can beat the game without ever placing a single explosive or launching a single rocket. Indeed most players merely circle the map with auto-fire on while the faster classes loot ammo. There is never really a need to set up static defense, and on the higher difficulties where it would potentially be viable, the cooldown on such abilities makes it impossible anyway. On top of this few teams will think about their location in relation to enemy units and often times are in the line of fire of heavy ordinance which makes it impossible to use without killing a friendly. The depth of the class system is diminished by the nature of the game.The other big problem The Red Solstice has is it's pacing. It encourages players to never stop moving. The looting, securing objectives, activating power nodes, etc all happen while on the run. Setting up a static defense is simply not supported, there is no way to lockdown doors, and even items like barricades are useless... not as in poorly implimented, as in the developers never bothered to apply collision detection to them so enemies walk right through these barricades. All slower, and defense oriented classes fail to play as one would expect as a result of this, and indeed the game becomes about patroling the map rather than each class utilizing it's niche focus to support the team. The game really only feels like it has 3 classes, the Medic, and then the rest being a DPS varient, with one acting as a fast looter. This game would be far better if it allowed for setting up actual fortifcations to secure areas and encouraged players to balance offense and defense tactics by establishing a zone of control and having mobile members fetch and secure objectives and luring hordes and large enemies into the heavy fire of your static defense. It would be far better if large enemies required explossive damage to make them vulnerable to small arms fire, it would be far better if it encouraged thinking and planning over running and gunning, especially because the game does not control like a run and gun game. It controls like an RTS, but other than presenting the facade of a strategy game, there is litle strategy to be found. I would have liked to have seen the game rely less on bullet sponge enemies and more on forcing players to manage proper firing arcs or face the deadly consequences. Instead the marine behaves in typical rts faction and spins and shoots incoming enemies automatically. The game does provide a manual aim, but it is poorly communicated to the player and the ui for it is terrible. There is no tactical advance in this game, there is no managing firing arcs, there is no establishing a base of operations, there is no flexibility. Like an rts, you group up and blob the enemy and that is a damn shame.This sort of gameplay was acceptable when it was a modifcation for a 2003 strategy game, it is not acceptable as a stand alone title, and rather than evolve the concept they ripped it almost unchanged from the mod which inspired it. I am hopeful that with the next game in this franchise they are able to get things right, but from the looks of it so far it appears to be a less interesting alien swarm. I would advise the developers to look at titles like full spectrum warrior which required establishing firing arcs and moving the squad tactically. Translated to the rts perspective something like that could work well and better define the pace and balance of gameplay.As a stand alone genre this type of game is still new, and with that comes some hiccups. I applaud these developers for trying to establish this genre, unfortunately the title is too bogged down by the mods that inspired it.			"

												EDIT: TL; DR: You like true 8 player co-op? Survival? A challenge that can go to really high difficulties? Leadership and class responsability? This game is for you. Long version: This is by far the most addicting game I've ever played, due to great community, great challenge and great gameplay. I've always liked survival games and good communities. This game has both. It has people willing to teach, people willing to laugh, people willing to play as a team, and now it has lots of new people willing to learn.Each of the unique 8 classes has a role that will make surviving the hell on mars easier. And each with its own unique style of play, strenght an weaknesses.The game has big replayability, randomized missions, locations, monster spawns, bosses, everything to make every single dollar spent on it worth it. Even 1000h+ veterans still get surprised by what the game can show. And constant updates and support from the devs keep the game balanced and fresh.Seriously what are you waiting to buy this game?My review on Early access:This Game is wonderful, I've been part of the community Since Late Notd 2 And then Notd: Spec Ops. The makers of this game worked their asses off during lots of years and they deserved this final result. A true co-op survival game with good tactics and randomization. Threats that will require skill and cooperation of your teammates so you can survive. It's also possible to play alone if you're feeling pro, and the game allows you to have some bonus as you play, it's really rewarding to see your characters getting new modules and getting better stats. It's also awesome to kill big bosses or help your team to do it, and the best part is to evac with your team knowing you did your job properly, and trust me it wont be by evacing before you get to see some nasty awesome monsters.Its on early access and the game depends on people playing but really, if you're active you'll always find games and help people find games aswell. The more people that have the game, the more activity it will have, so get it! Be part of this growing community!			"

												The Red Solstice is a gamer killer game. :)Hard, tense, with atmospheric soundtrack, this one is equally good in single player and multiplayer. But there's nothing better than running around with friends, trying to survive on harsh Mars terrain with so many enemies zerging on you. This reminds me on Dead Nation game that I loved playing in co-op but TRS is much bigger and better. Highly recommended. I bought it back in Early Access so the price was lower but there was no singleplayer at the time. Now it's a complete game with fantastic and responsive dev team and I hope it will get all the attention it deserves. Not to mention really good price! :) Graphics:  ★★★★☆ Sound:  ★★★★★ Gameplay:  ★★★★☆ Overall:  ★★★★☆ "

Early Access Review
								I found this game by searching for the multi-player co-op tags on steam.  If you're looking for that kind of experience, and like challenging games, then this game is for you.  They are reportedly working on a single player mode, but cooperative-multiplayer is where the heart of this game is.The game IS challenging.  If you are playing at the correct difficulty for your team, you will lose more often then you will win.  Even though it's early access, the game is very playable.  They've had some buggy patches but they tend to fix them pretty quick.  The devs are on a fast-release cycle and they listen to the community as to what is and isn't working, what's fun and isn't fun, and they participate in the forums.  Now that the game is more stable, the dev's have been focusing on adding more content (maps, bosses, missions, skills, etc) which is keeping the game fresh and challenging.If you can get this game on sale, or money isn't a big deal,  I'd definitely recommend the early access version.  If you are on a tight budget, you may want to wait for release.  I have ~500hours on record so far for a $20 game.  So I'm very happy with the value I'm getting.			"

												Awesome game! Heavily inspired by the funmap ""Night of the Dead"" from Warcraft 3. Contains a interesting solo-campaign where you control yourself and partly your 3 bot party-members and a Co-Op multiplayer which can be played with up to 7 friends. You get stronger with each round you play - the game is challenging and you will fail, but you feel the progress and it's fun to get further and further and eventually ""beat"" it by surviving, but even then you haven't done and accomplished everything.

								Oh jeez where to start? At first this game was very difficult for myself and others to play before steam. The Devs are actually not just active, but even play along with players! Amazing that they do their own testing and are actually willing to listen to players when they have something to say about certain things.1 - This game has completely topped my list.2 - I've quit nearly every other game because of this one being so addicting.3 - If you're looking for a game that gives you reason to come home to play something, THIS IS YOUR GAME.Best way to get in a group even for newer players - wait around, keep in mind that it is a smaller player base, but there will be a game popping up, or even hop in the Teamspeak 3 server with us! ts.game-com.de - We're always looking to help out newer players and to get the number of people higher!Wanting to see more people in this game, would be great! Community is awesome!Steep learning curve, but it can be done!Keep up the good work guys! :] "

												The red clouds part, the dropship lands at an unknown location; and 8 marines set down on the Tharsis colony. I've been one of those marines a few hundred times, and none of those drops went as planned.Your team will spend the next hour gathering items and supplies, weathering a constant flow of monsters as they roam the colony. This process begins slow, building to a crescendo as the game progresses. During the last third of the round, the danger's so intense: it requires the entire team working together to survive. This formula produces a unique and often panicked rush back to the dropship as the team tries to evacuate.There are two kinds of marines: the ones that make it back to the dropship, and the ones left behind. If you're looking for a game with deep mechanics, replayability, and a challenge, look no further.			"

								Essentially a Warcraft based mod givi form much like Dota or league. Red Solstice is a squad based game that can be played solo or in multiplayer, both of which are a lot of fun. You get to blast zombies, bugs, insane people all kindes of stuff. Their is a lot of variety in this game, multiple classes, with multiple abilitites. Even though the armory loadout is not the largest each gun is useful in its own way.I personally do not like multiplayer games which is what this game is designed for, however it does have a pretty niffty campaign, as well as a solo ""Skirmish"" kinda game where you and 3 bots you can issue orders to fight through lite-generated missions on various maps.Overall the game is pretty good, I have had few issues playing this game.Note is that the game has a very small community so multiplayer might varry for everyone but if you enjoy solo play as I do there is a lot for you to do.

								First time i played a game like this was in the warcraft online games dawn of the dead (DOTD) i freakin loved this game i had paper everywhere with my saved experience codes which looked something like this (5tyn-7dyhn-ghdj8-sh009) but it dissapeared... I always was complaining to my friends that no one made a game like the one i had i my head and now i DO!Very satisfying game when you choose your marine you become part of a team. You need them and they need you it is very fulfilling knowing that games can be won and lost by your decisions. You have people here that have a bachelor in TRS game physics and mechanics and will figure out all the math eqautions for each and every skill and booster then people like me who get the big gun and shoot stuff. Pretty much found my retirement game here so i am a happy man. Albeit game is not for everyone but everyone that plays is hardcore for the game. Really does bring people around the world together in a common goal to stay frosty and kill zombies.			"

Sadly, the community is very tiny, but with the recent improvements to singleplayer, no longer a big problem. If you gather a group of friends, even better! I was a kickstarter backer, as well as a huge fan of the Night of the Dead II custom map for Warcraft 3 that this game is based on, and I've put in quite a bit of time on various tactics games, but this is still one of my favorites. Thumbs up!			"

								When you're first starting out, the game is really hard even on the easiest difficulty setting. I HIGHLY recommend reading the player guides if you want to get any good at this game. Once you know what you're doing and have a coordinated team, beating the game on easy and normal difficulty is a piece of cake. In that case, you might want to try hard or nightmare difficulty, both of which are extremely brtual.The community here is quite small. The veterans are quite welcoming if you're willing to learn, follow directions and get teamspeak. You don't have to talk on TS if you don't want to. As long as you can hear everyone else, then it's okay.			"

This game is trying to capture that, in my opinion.  All of the characters are fun and the weapon choices/loadouts are good as well. The only problem is  two things. 1. The user base...the amount of players that currently play this is slim to none :( so it makes it a bit lack luster when you want to play it because you need help on missions and just all around fun. 2. The price tag. 20$ is a little steep for most people for a early access game with no user base. I got mine on sale thankfully but deters people for buying. 10/10 for gameplay and such.			"

												An awesome game made by an awesome studio as ever (based on v1.000).(下面有中文)As a member of special corps elite, your squad has been assigned to an investigation on Mars - which the colony lost contact not long after a storm dubbed ""The Red Solstice"".You will have to manage to survive the harsh environments and fulfill various tasks during the storm by squad-based unified action. It would be better and necessary planning your course of action ahead, trusting your teammates, coordinating with them, and sharing supplies you find along the road.Sounds a bit familiar? Yes! If you love NotD(SO/Aftermath) on WC3 or Undead Assault 3 on SC2, then this is definitely the game for you (finally), and with tons of enhancements you will find in game, love the well-made soundtracks for example.Well, if you haven't heard or (unfortunately) hate those games due to the moderate learning curve before, then you should better not miss TRS this time. There is a brand new Single Player mode for everyone to enjoy, meanwhile, you will be familiar with the gameplay, which is challenging and worth playing.For multiplayer games, it's the meaning of this game, charming and fascinating, especially cooperating with some experienced players (eg. Diode, eL gRingo, Yegor, quzexe12... too many superb players, have no luck yet to play with you all sorry).Also you can just start a Survival game which is some sort of multiplayer but just you landing with 3 bots under your command, which is a highly efficient way to master the map you’re playing with at this moment.Anyway, it's a style of easy to learn, challenging to master co-op game, yet eventually skilled players will have the feeling of satisfaction from the heart. It's something about trust, co-ops and fighting for survival.So marines, cheer up! Welcome aboard and good luck out there, you'll need it :)In a word, an addictive game and no doubt worth having. 9.5/10 (personally)Thanks to everybody in the studio and devs online as Syrus and others too, we finally have this baby given birth today because of your hard work.Thanks to everyone in the community that firmly supported this baby in the past days, we all have made our common dreams come true.In fact, in this respect, I'm sure senior member Commander Wrecker is doing better ;)http://steamcommunity.com/app/265590/discussions/0/530646715637543149/Salute,cheers! ;)----------------------------------------这款确是极好的，Ironward工作室的又一款高逼格作品。地点：火星。在一次席卷大洲的腥红风暴后不久，整个火星殖民地的通讯陷入了沉寂。作为特种陆战队中的一员精英，你的小队被指派前往调查。然而在着陆后不久你们便发现，将要对抗的（又）是潮水般不知疲倦的亡者大军。根据以往的经验，你们尝试计划行进路线，并默契地交叉掩护，时而全开火力，时而奔命街头， 分享利用着有限的物资补给。似乎你们在这场疯狂中生存了下来……听着很耳熟？没错！如果你钟爱魔兽3的亡者之夜（特别行动/余波）系列，或者星际2的不死突袭3，那无疑这就是你的菜。这款续作在职业可塑性、游戏可玩体验、易操作度、团队沟通便利度，以及该系列故作（死）高（不）大（悔）上（改）的新兵非友善向方面等等等等，都有着诚意十足的良心改进。如果你还未听说过这个系列或者很不幸的一直操作苦手，那你不应该错过这款续作，""The Red Solstice""。游戏里加入了全新的单人剧情模式，在享受乐趣的同时，你已经成为了半个老鸟。据（无责任）小道消息，仅单人剧情便具有很高的挑战性和可玩性。好了大兵，准备好了吗？多人大厅随时等待你的加入，来这里我们一起战个痛快。友情提示：小心上瘾。个人给9.5/10分			"

												     There is alot to like about this game, but I'm not sure the bad outweigh the good.  Some of the biggest problems are the controls, game difficulty, and the beta state of the game.     The controls are an absolute pain.  You will constantly default to the team leader when you change control modes.  Autofire will turn on when you select another team member.  Sometimes your team will follow you, sometimes the game will toggle off autofollow.  Sometimes you will put out a squad in tactical mode, then the team will assemble on the leader immediatly on leaving the mode.  All these things feel intentional, however and only make the game feel clunky by design.  Other games might get away with it but as frantic as the later levels can get, you will see your team wipe due to this.       I laughed when I saw a note at the start of one level, saying the waves of enemies are NOT endless.  They did feel endless at many points, and that indicates the difficulty.  Too much is not explained, or poorly explained in the game.  Some levels are purely trial and error.  Save points are fairly far between.  At first the game comes across as a frantic, tactical game.  After a few levels it feels like a forced rush to finsh quickly.  Some levels you can slow down and think it out, others you have a set path to victory that is explained in no way, except dont die.     So much is odd about this game.  The skill discriptions that say ""Discription Not Found"".  The story explained in a text block in the options.  No idea how to gain experience.  I found a few guides that said you gained experience from looting lockers (???).  Alot of this feels like new ideas, and if it was explained in some way I'd give the devs the benefit of the doubt, but it feels lazy and half finished.  Also, I will mention the hoops you need to jump through to get it to run is staggering.  I spent a few days trying to get it to run, just to give up in frustration.  6 months later I tried on a new PC, and it started up without a hitch.       The game has some really cool moments and is addictive to a point.  That point is when you realize its nearly broken in difficulty at certain points.  I'm not really sure the game is worth the purchase price, whatever it is, considering its a dice roll to get it to run.  If you enjoy zombie games, and tactical shooters, it might be worth a look.

												The Red Solstice is an awesome RTS set on a futuristic Mars colony. You are the leader of a marine squadron sent to investigate the derelict Tharsis colony. As the game progresses, you will be taught new things about the game mechanics and be forced to use everything you learned about the old ones. You will die though. A lot. One second I was happily following mission objectives and the next 2 of my squad members were down and I was being swarmed by enemies. The game also features Tactical Mode, which allows you to slow down the action and make tactical decisions to take down enemies. Squad Management is deep but surprisngly easy to use, allowing you to customize nearly every aspect of each marine such as bullet type, weapons, suits, abilities, you name it. The music is amazing and does a spectacular job of immersing you in the action. Enemies are plentiful and exploits are few, so be prepared for a fun, exciting, and challenging experience.			"

												Did you ever play the Warcraft 3 custom game Night of the Living dead? That's this game. If not, well it was a blast, unfortunately the save system for reloading your character was....unreliable at best and now is no longer a problem in this game.  Now if you haven't played any WC3 mod games, then you're in for a treat, especially if you have a few friends to roll with you. You will have a top down perspective of one squad that will navigate an colony that has been infected with a goofy named virus that turns them all shapes and sizes. You have to get your squad from point A to point B.If you're rolling solo, then you will be able to control your squad individually and give them orders with the tap of the space bar that does not interupt game play, only slowing it which can be useful in♥♥♥♥♥♥situations. Over all, if you wanna wait for it to go on sale, and try it out, not a bad idea, but if you like the WC3 NOTLD mod then check it out.			"

												I haven't put much time in this but watched quite a few streams and the devs are extremely passionate with their work.  I have played about 4hrs in co-op and the rest was just going through settings and getting comfy with controls.  I have to say, this requires a lot of teamwork if you want to enjoy max fun value.  Lots to learn as this is no cakewalk.  I am recommending that people who enjoy some RTS strategy objective-based gaming in a sci-fi environment should grab this.  They just implemented a solo version in it as well to help you learn your classes.  But the major focus seems to be around co-op play.  As you gain experience and rank up, you can increase your weapon functionality and become a better soldier.  Im sure there are better reviews than this so keep reading other posts.  All in all, this game has a lot of promise and the devs have a lot of experience in co-op gameplay and you will see for yourself this heavily influences their ideals.			"

												For anyone who missed something anywhere near the lines of Alien Swarm, this is something that at least hits the lines of ""Similar."" Meaning that this is a highly team based overhead style game where classes actually seem to matter with a sickening amount of fine tuning options available to each of the eight classes. Up to eight players are allowed in a game, though there are specific limitations on how many instances of each class allowed typically either 4, (Assault) 2, (Heavy Support, Medics, etc) or only 1 (Hellfires, Terminators, Etc.) Though as there isn't a infinite ammunition system and a toss mag reload (Meaning anything left in the magazine when reloaded is ""Tossed"" or simply lost.) ammunition can quickly become sparse.The voice acting in the single player game is terrible and it feels, clunky especially in the beggining levels, so I spent most of my time on multiplayer scenarios.Upon which comes my biggest lament with the game. Characters are allowed two weapons, a primary weapon and a secondary. Of the secondary weapons available there is a handgun or pistol. For whatever reason this uses primary weapon ammunition regardless of if it happens to be napalm, full metal jacket, or hollowpoint. Which renders it's overall effectiveness somewhat questionable compared to a grenade launcher, Rocket launcher, or even shotgun which use their own ammunition pool and have vast room clearing capacities compared to a pistol. Granted, a Hellfire can replenish their GAR (Gauss Assault Rifle) from a fuel barrel in this so maybe the point is moot... If one enjoyes wave/endless monsters trying to claw their jibblies while trying to complete objectives in a story-esque fashion and all the chaos involved with it, especially with up to eight friends... then your likely going to sink much more time into this than you had origionally planned. The mechanics of the game are good (With the occasional wall where explosives may pass through) the only failing point so far is to make a truly engaging story singleplayer. Having a bad voice acter (Think like a B movie commando that can no where near sell it or a solid snake impersonator) whom the player is FORCED to listen to quickly ruins any immersion and saps the will to continue. My reccomendation is to play it how it seems to be meant to. As multiplayer. Grab your guns, and your comrades, and never stop firing, otherwise your going to be picking claws out of your backside.

												Don't get discouraged by reviews of people who get frustrated by dying early. This is a game that doesn't hold your hand, has a complex system and has quite a learning curve. it is advised for new squads to do easy difficulty first to familiarize. It shines on multiplayer but you have to do your due diligence (i.e. Go through single player, familiarize with items etc.) This game is not about grinding through the ranks. A team of 8 who knows the game  can create new accounts and beat the game while they're all at rank 1. It's about teamwork, respecting the enemies (why most new players die is they don't respect the swarm), achieving goals as a team, and playing your role (as medic, tank, dps/carry, utility, scout, forward observer etc.).  If you are a fan of the old top down squad games like Night of the Dead, Undead Assault and its ilk, this game is for you. If you want a challenging/complex game that requires teamwork and has hero-based system, you'll like this game.CONS:- Single player can only give you 10 to 20 hours of fun. Most of the fun is in multiplayer.- Only a few maps to go through. I believe the devs can create a random map generator. There is a tactical advantage though of knowing the map.- high difficulty. This is a team game. If the healer doesn't know what to do, or the tank, then the squad will most likely fall. There is a need for a good leader at higher difficulties.- medium to steep learning curve, depending on how good you want to be.- if you die early, you will be automatically revived if you are new to the game. However, after a few ranks, there will no longer be an automatic revive. A medic or a mission can revive you, but you will have to wait.PROS- Team game. I've played with Europeans, Chinese, Canadians and Americans. A good world we are in. At higher difficulties, you need to talk, so teamspeak would be necessary. There's a different sense of achievement when you defeat a game as a team.- Hero-based system. You control one character, customize it and change its load out. There are 8 classes that each have a role to play. Mastery of a class is a journey and there are different ways to build a single class.- Squadron tactics. You have an enemy sniper shooting at 124m away while a swarm is constantly flowing to your team, what do you do? 3 big fatties chasing you? Fast dogs gnawing at one of your team? Some military squad tactics apply, like leapfrog movements, defensive positions, buddy system etc. The squad leaer has a large impact and responsibility.- Random missions and enemies. Every game is different depending on the mission, the boss spawn etc.			"

												Incredible....absolutely incredible.So insanely underrated it is disgusting. It actually sickens me to see this anywhere but on the top 5 list.A fantasticly constructed team oriented survival type game. Filled with tons of room for progression. Supports up to 8 players in a single game, grab your friends, and get them on Teamspeak or w.e you use. I promise you will all have a great time playing this game.For those of you who played those Warcraft 3 Marine/Zombie maps...this will bring back a lot of great memories.			"

												Ever since playing the indoor missions of the original Starcraft campaign I hoped for a standalone game focussing on this setting. And here it is.TRS combines the looks and feel of Starcraft, blends in some DOTA-like micro control but has the players act cooperatively against waves of zombies and alien monsters a bit like Left For Dead.However, this blend of threats and mission makes you realize quickly that you need to know your way around before succeeding. By the setting and enemy waves alone, the game is substantially more difficult to master than many of today's games. The difficulty adds to the addictive character of the game - lots of replayability.The developers continuously keep on improving the game and gameplay. Additionally, they are always open for your suggestions and eager to receive your crash reports. There is a close connection between game community and  developers.RTS is multiplayer focussed and purely cooperative so be on the lookout for a decent team / squad. At the moment the RTS community is rather small so at times it might be frustrating not to find enough players for your match. This is the only drawback I see and it might become resolved soon once there is a bigger community.			"

												The Red Solstice has become my favorite game on steam. I followed it through early access and have been waiting for the relase to write a proper review. Most early access games that I have bought have been an extreme dissapointment upon relase. I usually won't even buy early access games anymore. However, seeing The Red Solstice blossom into one of the most amazing and challenging tatical co-op games that I have ever played was entirely worth my money. Pros-Best community I have ever played with. (You can join us on Team Speak  ts.game-com.de-There is a lot of replayability-There are 6 giant maps (the only one I know by heart after all this time is central)-There are 8 classes that are very well balanced-Randomly generated missions (also randome bosses if you chose ;)-The Soloplayer missions are fun for people who like real time strageties-The Devs are always updating the game and willing to play with new playersCons-The Red Solstice is very chalenging (could be a good thing if your a masochist like me XD-There is a steep learning curve- Requires some micro-management of skills -Team killing can occur from explosives.

								This is a tactical shooter in an isometric view. There is fast-paced action, strategic depth, a ton of character upgrades and customization. In this game, you face off against zombie-like creatures on Mars. The highlight here is multiplayer, but there is also a single player campaign with a very interesting tactical mode that lets you slow time to give orders to your squad.If you have an interest in this game, you can check out an ongoing pre-release candidate single player campaign on my channel at:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAiw8_ntE99mje-JMlhcqiTo7jKl7UMUS "

								Let me tell you something straightaway: you're going to die, no two ways about it; either it'll be some jackaloon in your squad with an itchy trigger finger and a grenade launcher, or it'll be a bio-engineered thunderbeast from the seventieth dimension of Hentai Mountain using its tentacles on you in ways it's best not to describe in polite company. Your death is more or less inevitable.The question is: How are you going to face that death?Crying like a coward and blaming your teammates for leaving you stranded in a distant corner because you wanted that shiny little +5% to weapon damage, the legion of GWAR fans on your tail be damned?Laughing at the ludicrous nature of the spiky-humpbeast which is making your backside its domain?Screaming bloody murder as you drop a SHIVA TacNuke device on your now overrun position?Staring in mute amazement, your head ripped clean off and sailing through the air, as that jackass whose been surviving alone the entire game activates the Evac and then gets there first, spawning wave after wave of the gigantic 'hatchlings' which have just de-crowned you?Sobbing deeply and sadly as your small, insignificant life snuffed out before it even began, kicked at random by lobby host after lobby host for no reason other than the fact that they like skulls and your name had one next to it? You will die, it's as simple and indifferent as that. But how you face that death? That choice is yours. 1/10 Team AI sucks.11/10 Rock and Roll Music when bad things are happening.5/10 ""Easy"" is just a codeword for 'slightly (1%) less tentacles'10/10 Getting into an Evac before the entire team and being the only one to survive, Would do again.0/10 Lack of mustaches on Marines.

Playing in multiplayer with friends is fun, you can also play Survival mode with bots and go through Single Player.Anyway, I can recommend it not just because it's a good game, but bexause devs are really responsive and active on the forums, engaged with the communty and I respect that and support that.

												The Red Solstice is pretty much the Aliens: Colonial Marines simulation I have always wanted. My search started way back when Alien Swarm was still a thing, but every game I tried lacked something, you know? Well, I for one am glad to have found this game! I've clocked in over 200 hours of game play and I don't think I have play a game for that many hours besides WOW. Defiantly spend your money on this title ladies and gents. I haven't seen a game do this genre justice in a very long timeI came for alien shooter genre, but I stayed for in depth game play mechanics. This game has got it all for sure. Inventory management, intense team work, tactical over shooting, mutant monsters, an over-run colony, nukes, drop ships, flame throwers, knives, sharp sticks...you get the picture. I could go own and list all the features, but that would be better served by playing The Red Solstice (TRS).So here are a few important things to know about TRS. TRS is freaking HARD! It doesn't do a whole lot of hand holding and rarely pulls it punches. If you make a stupid play or think this game is a solo Rambo action game, the monsters will feast on your stupid corpse, and more importantly, they'll eat your friends while they are still alive. How do I not be stupid you ask? Well learning how to play the game better that's how. And how you do that is by dying...A LOT. Get use to the game over screen because you will see it ever day you play. Don't get discouraged though, it's part of the learning experience. Even death you still serve, um, I mean you gain XP for rank and speicalist XP for your class that your playing. The more waves and missions you complete the more XP you gain. And of course you'll get better at the game  and you'll no longer do silly things like trying to figure out how to use a satchel charge in the middle of a huge wave of monster while your whole team is in the blast radius (yes I was that dumb once). Enough of my rambling. I'll see in the elevator to hell, going down!			"

												The Red Solstice starts as a pretty typical ""lone squad must defeat hordes of horrific creatures overrunning the colony"" plot, but manages to throw in several twists both in the game and in the plot to make things interesting. While the game can be played as a regular RTS, where you guide the squad and let them shoot anything in sight, by mission 4 or 5 you get curveballs, such as enemies that doesn't appear on sensors (so auto-aim doesn't work) but manual aimming does. Then you get into HUGE enemies (7500 hp!) that basically forces you to utilize each soldier's specialty power, such as gunship strafing, artillery beacon, grenade launcher, HE shells, so you can survive the fight. Gunship strafings can take out a large group of enemies, while artillery beacon can be placed then enemy lead over it so the barrage clean them out. Explosives can be placed, mines can be set, and so on. On the other hand, your soldiers can be seriously hit including poison, broken bones, septic wound, and more. Each soldier can only carry 6 items (some of which can have QTY > 1) so item management can be important as no one can carry everything. In RTS mode, movement controls are limited, but once you enter tactical mode, you can move soldiers about and give more individualized orders. Time also slows down tremendously, giving you time to give precise orders, like go here and kill that (and stay there).  My main gripe with the game is difficulty in accessing all four members of the team, as usually you can only access the team leader. Only in tactical mode can you access all four members. This makes for a very awkward interface when you're the kind of guy that goes after every locker, where you could find inventory from bandages to explosvies.  These are the ""crates"" in this universe. But the increased reaction time makes entire mess actually doable. All in all, the tactical mode needs a bit polishing, otherwise it's one fun game.			"

												Red Solstice is the type of game I hate to love. The concept is cool, the gameplay feels solid, and its co-op to boot. Except, the atmosphere is different. Back when the game first released and everyone was lvl 1, there were no hard set strategies or metas, just groups of eight strangers yoloing through an unforgiving environment with not a care in the world. When I came back to the game after a yearish hiatus, everyone expected me to min-max one specific character class, or take a hike. Classes like the recon were shunned like the plague, because their dps was less than stellar. I understand the desire to succeed (and I don't fault others for it), but playing one class with one set build for 40+ hours the same exact way is not how I have fun. To each their own, I guess. Unless 7 other people with the exact same schedule want to hang out with a meta noob, I don't plan on returning to this game any time soon.TL;DR Friends are great, metas are not.Edit: Thank you Ironward, Thank you. After another break from this game, I came back to find that the mp bots are actual characters that can be customized and leveled, just like a regular player character. Combined with the tactical mode's slow motion, I can play a mp match solo. Wish I didn't have to play mp matches solo in the first place, but this is the next best thing. I will gladly reccomend this game now.			"

												It's hard to give this game a thumbs down, but I will because simply this game has no players. And for a game that is supposed to be a ""team"" tactical online game you have to be on at peak hours just to get more than 12 people online. I just logged on a couple hours ago just to see if I could join a multi-player game (online) and only 4 people are online. I don't have crazy hours put into this game because me and my friends played it for about a week together and what I will say about the game is it fun with friends, with online players its pretty Meh without using Teamspeak. The gameplay itself is alright, nothing special. It is a very difficult game, no easy breezy kill zombies/aliens and win (even on the easiest mode its hard). I would rather get my buddies together and play some warcraft3 undead assault or dawn of the dead.Honestly if I had the choice I would not buy this game again, even though it was fun for a while, it lost its sparkle and I would rather put time into other games.

Product received for free
												I played this game when it first came out and I immediately fell in love with it. It's a slick tactical shooter. With hordes of alien zombies trying to kill you. Meanwhile your team of husky voiced men attempt to complete your objectives.Again it's a great game. I stopped playing it for some time and decided to get back into it and immediately fell back in love.Great set of classes Assault-great all rounder very good beginner class. he's  great with light weapons and rifles and he even smokes a cigar. Do you want to live forever?Hellfire-your typical tank takes the beating while keeping your men safe he also has a giant flamethrower pyromaniacs special delightMedic-takes the role of making sure your teamates don't die and in this game that happens A LOT. It's only a flesh woundDemolition- if you like to watch things go boom and enjoy massive exsplosions this is your guy. Larger skill cap but if you can master it the doorway for badassness is endless. Other warning high team kill ratio.Recon- very slick scouting class this guy generally works very well with a marksmen but also has the ability to call in support whether it be drone strikes or artillery barrages. Heavy support- big hulking man carries around giant minigun waylaying death in the sound of thousands of rounds being expended. This guy is a general buffer to your teamates and also can assist in slowing enemy advances in the use of suppressive fireMarksman-  you ever run into a situation where a giant monster is about to kill you and all the sudden it dies in one hit? Well this guy is a special at it. He excels at far range sniping and is excellent at cover fire. He's a little slower then his other comrades but dam he makes up for it with stopping powerTerminator- here's your wild card he carries a giant prototype energy based weapon called the vindicator. He can teleport and overload his weapon to annihlate everything including your teamates. The maps range from massive to slightly large and offer a good variety for strategyThey also have a good range of difficulties from recruit to aetriden  If you decide to purchase this game I will warn you the community is smaller than it used to be and if you purchase this game learn the mechanics and controls before jumping into a hard mode group because you will be left behind not in a mean nasty way but generally one big rule of thumb is stay with the pack.And all the reviews stating it has an elitist community I will say it does and it doesn't the thing people have to understand is this game is so reliant on all eight players working together if one guy makes an error it effects the entire team *on high end difficulties* on casual difficulties  The game is far more forgiving but is still no pushoverAsk for help and you will receive and look up some guidesThey even made a discord channelThat also being said if you liked NOTD for Warcraft/Starcraft download the $/,!ing gameThis game will always have a special place and you should give it a try. A special shoutout to the developers who created this gem thank you :)DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER MARINES!!!?!?!			"

												Gotta say I like the game very much. Scratches that powerarmor marines vs the Xenos itch, feels very WH40kish which is IMO a good thing. I don't usually write reviews for games but this one is deserving of a positive review. It's kind of rough around the edges but it's still the most fun Ive had with coop in a looong time. Word of warning though, the game is insanely hard and the multiplayer is a whole different ballgame to the singleplayer campaign and also where the game shines the brightest. Unfortunately there are not very many people playing the game online and this is also it's biggest drawback. Sometimes it takes a while to find a decent game lobby and for it to fill up with people, but thats a good time to ask questions of the more experienced players and to think about builds of which there seem be quite a few combinations. 8/10			"

												squadbased, tactical, coop-fun at ot`s best. you get an extensive singelplayermode, featured with an allright story (the voice-work is dodgy), but an excellent athmosphere (reminds me more of Warhammer than Star Craft -> which is a good thing), great sound-design and even more imprtant fantastic squadcontrol. you always fell in charge of your little marine-troop and the immersion is great.where the game realy shines is the multiplayermode, progression is engaging, running around with a full squad of marines always fearing to be overrun, while completing a pletora of different side and main targets is amazing. working together is way more important than you realize at first glanze. sharing items, giving each other cover-fire and support is what makes or brakes most maches. when you first start TRS up you might just see the somewhat dated grafics, or get overwhelmed by the scenario and feel somehwat at a loss in the mp-mode, but when you stick around to understand what`s going on you will have a blast. the heavy emphasis on cooperation is amazing and where many FPS games fail in this scenario TRS shines.

								If you liked or know of NOTD from war3 or SC2, then this game is for you.If you don't know what those are, then continue to read. A team based survival game with objectives that can vary as does the difficulty. The game never feels the exact same on each playthrough, with different items and everything each time. Very fun, and a great way to spend some time.			"

								This game has the chance to be a premier ""tactical co-op"" experience. Playing as a squad of marines desperately trying to push back the stem of undead/mutants that are threatening man kind on mars, players will have to work together or perish alone. That said, the game is extremely hard, with many retries required to win a game. A single mistake or bad decision can be the difference between success and a squad wipe.In the current state, the game is quite buggy, crashes often (once every couple of games), desync causes many issues. The playerbase is plagued with elitist people (including myself, I must admit), and new players can easily find themselves lost in the steep learning curve and bashed by the more experienced. But if people are willing to stick with it, they may end up enjoying it.My best advice, do not be afraid of asking questions, people would rather help you than scorn you if you atleast ask before doing something. Newbies are treated as something to be cared about, even if they tend to do some stupid stuff.The developers are friendly, they respond to questions and bug reports, and interact with the playerbase. In time, the game should hopefully be bug free and play like a dream, we can hope at least.For early access, this is definitely a game with promise, and even in its current state, an excellent game in my opinion.

												I wanted to put a couple hours into the game before I wrote a good review so here it goes. TRS is a different kind of game, that goes unsaid, if you are not into working with a team via a Chat client (Teamspeak, mumble, etc) you may see some real let downs come gameplay time. Like any other stragety game knowing what the game plan is for your team is important and without a solid communication system you will see teams in public lobbies fall before wave 10. Good news is that there is a teamspeak server dedicated to TRS (ts.game-com.de) and as a new player to the game I can say my experience went from crappy, to excellent the moment I signed on there and began playing with people. Not only do you learn a lot from more experienced players (Veterans) but you get to learn a lot of things you wouldn't find out by playing in random lobbies with random people. ""But Dagnome, there is a in game chat""True, but like most games with built in VOIP it isn't very good or used at all. To sum up, if you are looking for a great team game to play with your friends then TRS will hit that sweet tooth, it can be frustrating because on teammate can screw up the whole game, but it can also be very rewarding like the time me (Medic) and an assault survived together after our team was slaughtered and evaced to safety (http://www.twitch.tv/dagnom/v/7696891).

There is a ton of depth to each character's traits and so much to do within the game. The game is truly brilliant. Join up with friends or go it alone its pretty darn insane!

 GAME PLAY The Red Solstice is a game of three modes, and while the core mechanics are the same, placing the title square in the real-time tactics genre with shooter elements, the way the player approaches each of the three is pretty different.Gamers take on the role of one of the marines who are sent to investigate the events surrounding the massive storm and the damage it has caused, and they will have to carefully use their weapons, movement, placement, special abilities, and other items found in the level to stay alive either to reach their goals or to get extracted.The single player created by developer Ironward is made up of ten missions and asks gamers to carefully control main character Tyler Hunt but also his squad mates, moving around the locations and achieving objectives.The Red Solstice offers a different challenge for each new level, and because the squad companions evolve from one to the next, it's important to develop them carefully and make sure that the entire group is prepared for the task ahead.

												So where do i start?I discovered The Red S0lstice about 2,5 years ago,asked if i could help out testing and BAm i was in.Man this game was so hard but it feelt so rewarding once you do manage to win :DThe Game did come a long path countles of changes hundreds of patches some of them good ,some of them bad but non the less the game evolved into something better.The game itself is not easy at the beginning everything is new, you get lost quiet often and wellyou die from time to time"" Snatcher anyone?"".But once you figure out how stuff works (there are plenty of guides from the community) the game gets easyer.You will have plenty of gamemodes and difficults to chose from also there are around 6 maps by now thats plenty of stuff to mess around with.Just keep going you wont regret it.I had an awesome time with the community and also the devs of this game and that seems kinda rare today in other games sadly.If you are looking for an hardcore game that req. hard teamwork and ambition in order to win and have no problem with failing a few times than this game is totaly the right one to pick.The singleplayer is in aswell you will have up to 10 missions that take you through the story and explain certain game mechanics overall for a 20$ price tag this game is awesome.Stay Frosty :)			"

								This game is epic, and only in early access.Ignore the really bad voice acting at the start, and jump in. At first you'll be thinking what the hecks going on, not enough ammo, getting swarmed by the creeps and dying fast, but stick with it for a couple of rounds multiplayer, and buddy up to a vet and a whole world will open up to you. It has good progression after the initial steep learning start, and enough different builds of skills, classes and gear to keep you going.This game is true co-op, you go it alone you die, you need your team mates, and they need you. As with all multiplayer games there are a group of jerks out there who aren't worth playing with, but just avoid them and find a good squad to run with.Mechanics are a sci-fi diablo esq, but with much more options in build and pick-upable equipment, including changing fire modes on rifle (single, burst, full auto)			"

												Recon is love, Recon is life.Edit: This game always needs a recon, without a recon how the hell can you funnel Hordes of zombie's into a small area for the big BOOMS to go off! Recon is a Primary class which should always be had, it is an essential even more then a damn demolition expert. You all know its true. The radars, SMG's and espcially the speed with the awesome ability to be a total pleb and have avoidance on and not do a thing while your near your teamamtes in which makes you almost invisible as casper the ghost. Therefore, Recon Recon Recon.-HeyThereKarmaPS: Try out this game mode called ""Nuke Run"".Nuke run is basically locating and grabbing the nuke.. then finding your team and firing the nuke inbetween all the marines and see how many of your fellow comrades survive.PPS: Try out ""Nuke run 2.0"".Obtain two nukes for you and your friend to fire... once you get into a 4 way street, Fire one of the nukes inbetween your comrades as like in the Original Nuke Run, but fire the Second Nuke at the group in which has dispereserd with a more favorable amount of players! This is espically fun with pre started Barrages!			"

Nice little strategy gameThe game offers a small team based strategy experience with zombies/monsters to kill and experience, unlockables and leveling system, so it should keep you playing for hours just to unlock things that you want to get. I first heard about the game on its full release but it seems to have been around longer so i wich i would had found it sooner since i really love the gameplay.Good: Good Combat/Strategy elements Wide variety of loadouts/Setups Challenging but not too difficult Keeps you playing for hours Muliplayer/CoOpBad: Repeative (After around 10 hours the game seems kind of too similar with the missions to do in Survival/Multiplayer, however there is few different maps to play on that adds to the variety a little)I really cant say much bad about the game since its really solid and good as for a simple strategy shooter game. I did read that peoples said they got the idea for this game from ""Starcraft"" custom maps wich kind of makes sence, but i still think there is enough content here to make you want to get it even if you own starcraft or love RTS or Moba type of games.For anyone that is interested i higly recommend looking into the game.

												I decided to write a review on this game considering how many hours I've put into it and that It's finally out of Early Access. Personally, I think that this game is very fun and a good way to kill some time. I've never played a game with overhead and click-to-move game mechanics before; I don't prefer them. I make an exception for this game, however. The Singleplayer mode has an interesting plot and fun missions that make you think on your feet and keep you entertained while doing it. The Multiplayer always has something to do and can always be a challenge. No matter how good you get at The Red Solstice, you can never win by yourself. Using varying combat suits, skills, power ups, weapons, basically your own unique builds, you're going to have to work with your team to complete objectives and take down the big threats. I've owned this game since it first came to Steam and it certainly wasn't a purchase I regret. Get in, learn the ropes, and get ready for a slaughter. Just make sure you don't blow up your team...

												First of all, i was bought on a trailer of Chronicles - it was fun, it was dynamic, it was pretty nice looking - and decided to buy Red Solstice.After almost 24 hours of playing:I don't like the game in this state at all. It had a great potential but it's all lost. - It's ridiculously slow while the tactical component is very weak.- It's repetitive in a bad way.- It lacks in-gameplay char developement almost completely (upgrades are so small variative in their effectiveness that i can't stand to critisize)- It's hardscripted in control points of events, and hardscripted in the way it's played- i played some campaign but i can't see major differences with survival which shows the face of the game- I wouldn't comment on some stupid UI solutions like lack of proper status notifications, incomprehencible status appliance from mobs, spacebar unit control, etc etc etc. Tons of ambiguous UI/UX solution.All the play scenarios is the same - you run slowly through the map entering buildings that almost all the time big and has one enterance. And then you go round the corner. For one f#$% minute. Because all characters has movement speed of an injured snail. And with that speed you ran through the whole map for five-six stupid locations, settled in the different ends of the map because devs wanted to annoy you. While being bothered with weak mobs. And after  30 minutes of clueless running(have i mentioned that quests give you nothing? and in the half game you maxed out your level?) they show the big mobs that spawns randomly and overwhelms you. While you can't effectively nether destroy the spawn points nor have any strategic solutiotions that doesnt involve building baricades from small crates you've found. And you have a EVAC module in your inventory that says ""emergency EVAC"" but you couldnt activate it and it's not explained why - certainly who the %^&$ needs the EVAC protocol description when it's only way to win the game. Nice work.So summarize above said there're a LOT of things to do for devs because now it plays like very badly optimized alpha version of the game.			"

												That's what I wanted!I remember myself playing a Warcraft III map called ""Dawn of the Dead"", that was long ago. Years passed by, but there was no such game released (at least, I never seen anything that would feel the same). And, finally, they brought The Red Solstice!While it's still Early Access, it already feels exactly like it should. You're out in an urban area, which is full of zombies and other creatures that thirst for your blood. You only have your squad and your skills, and you have to learn the ropes all along. Ammo's running out, people get poisoned and wounded, and enemies become stronger wave after wave. Perfect!..It doesn't really matter how many times your squad gets terminated in the game. What actually matters is your experience behind that. Failure is the foundation of success. Soon you learn to use barricades to block enemy routes. You get to count your shots carefully, and to help out your fellow teammates who are out of mags. Wave after wave, you learn more tactics and, ultimately, achieve the goal.Really looking forward to play it, big thanks to devs! Recommended for all those who like tactical and hardcore games.			"

								This is a fun game with a lot going for it. Its still in EA and has bugs and optimumisation issues etc but the overall platform is stable enough for several hour sessions with no real game breakers.Gameplay is similar to DoW2 Last Stand and other games of this ilk. Players control their own characters and pick the abilities for themselves but are reliant upon the whole team (upto 8player co-op comp stomp)  trying to achieve a series of objectives while surving progessively stronger waves of enemy.There are several game option variants currently playable with more under development including the single player which hasn't yet been implemented.Controls require some familiarity but are acceptable, chat is text based at the moment but co-ordination is improved by waypoints, markers and map pings available to the 2 leaders chosen before the match. A basic objective compass is in effect throughout for everyone.When you die in match you remain a spectator with full access to the map and text to continue participating and there a re several methods of getting back into the match but nothing so simple as a ""quick"" pick me up by a team mate.The game won't hold your hand and is definietly challanging enough to retain interest.Summary: ""Just one more match"" type of fun.

												This game remainds me of a Warcraft III Frozen Throne custom scenario called SWAT Aftermath. It is also similar to modern titles like Xcom. It is not turn based, but it keeps to the small team with a variety of classes, equipment, and skills. Skills are unique to the classes, and are powered up individually. That's everything I felt this game does well. If you are interested in this title, I would say wait for it to go on sale for 75% off.A few points that really made this a foul game to me:Exploration of the maps takes hours of gameplay in the single player campaign.During exploration you are constantly swarmed by enemies; there are no waves, just a steady and annoying flow.The sprint hardly increases your move speed (enemies will still catch you), and has a long cooldown.All of this makes me want to skip exploring, but almost all of the equipment and skills are discovered by exploring.Unit statistics, like evade and AR res (armor resist), are not explained, but critical to gameplay.It works, but has a few serious bugs (like enemies shooting at you through walls and hitting).

								The Red Solstice is a much needed addition to any tactician or squad-based lover's game library. In it, you and up to 7 other Marines battle your way through a rather relentless horde of aliens, moving around a large map to try and complete various objectives before ultimately being overrun and forced to evacuate, or making a courageous last stand. Though there are a couple performance issues (namely clicks and keypresses not always registering when there is a full roster of players) the game is the only I've seen lately that delivers such an in-depth and tactical approach to multiplayer class-based combat. Every class is vastlly different from the others, but no single role is mandatory to a successful squad. Within certain parameters (Elysium Corp won't let you take 8 medics) the squad design is very adaptable, as is each class based on your playstyle.Tactically, the game pretty rapidly snuffs out heroes who stay away from the cluster too long, but is not unrewarding to a team that can cowardinate an effective division of tasks. Leaders of the squad can issue orders, and set waypoints for the team to follow. Rather than just relying on good communication, your team can physically see where you want them to move to. I have yet to see a game that is so rewarding to good communication and planning. It is brutally hard, and the developer holds no punches, but if you can gather a strong group of quick thinkers and loyal marines, you might just save Mars Colony.The impecable sounds, the unrivaled gameplay, and the immense tactical immersion earn this game a 10 out of 10 from ReaperEDIT: Out of Early Access for a while. Still love the game.			"

												This game is.. interesting enough to warrant some kind of recommendation. There are some annoyances and the game is probably not worth 20€ but overall the game seems to be solid in design and nothing really feels half-arsed. In single player the 'bots' helping you park their arses to hold their ground a bit too eagerly and in some situations that is quite bad indeed, but at least they do not wander off and generally speaking they follow orders just fine. I think there is room for expansion in this game to many directions but that is a different story. This game is missing some flaws I would expect in a game like this and that is a good thing. But as noted, the 20€ price may be a tad high especially if you are playing alone.			"

To get the most out of this game you need to play with people, whether joining a public game or playing with friends. There are various game modes and maps that change the difficulty from tough to downright suicidal. There is a reasonable amount of customisation for each class and quite a few to choose from with different pros and cons to them. There is a lot to this game, it's really challenging and when things go well you really feel like you've accomplished something.Not for the faint of heart.			"

I highly recommend this top down view shooter game to those who like to really get into their specific roles and survive hordes of enemys while trying to complete the mission at hand. This game also has a pretty decent community Teamspeak which is great for getting into games and having seasoned people around who are typically more than willing to help newbs become not so newb anymore haha I myself am always trying to learn new stuff and roles/builds for each suit/class that is available. Typical games last around 30 min - 1 hr depending on the settings/dfficulty. "

												This is definitely a game one should go for if you like a challenge. I will only speak for the multiplayer aspect of the game since I haven't play much of Single Player.This game is an upgrade for those who played the NotD series (NotD, NotD:AM and NotD:SO) during the Warcraft 3 golden days. It is just as punishing and challenging, and being able to kill off your teammates if you are not careful. However, this game definitely rewards well to those who complete those challenges. In multiplayer, you definitely need alot of communication among your team (they have a Teamspeak server at join.ts4gamer.com for that), and alot of teamwork. Sharing the upgrades to the respective classes and the weapons each people are using, as well as sharing your items is a key for your survival.The game definitely requires experience to learn and to push to the higher difficulties, so joining the Teamspeak server is probably the best advice for the newer players, as the veterans usually explain and advice there.

												First of all, this is not the usual twin-stick top-down shooter you might think it is!The Red Solstice has (especially in multiplayer) way more depth than you can imagine from a first look at the store page.The game lore pretty much feels like a threesome between Warhammer 40k, Starcraft and Starship troopers. A comfortable couch zone for the typical sci-fi nerd like me with no big suprises.It has a solid singleplayer experience where you can get a grasp of the core game mechanics, the different classes, weapons, perks and the inventory managment. Also only in the singleplayer part you can activate a tactical ""bullet time"" where you can control all of your 3 squad members in detail. The game is intended to be pretty hard and unforgiving, so even on the lowest diffuculty you can expect a hard time even as a seasoned gamer.Where it shines most in my opinion is the multiplayer part though. The mainly played mission mode ties story wise in the singleplayer campaign with different outcomes and procedual generated objectives and different bossfights. While playing you are under constant pressure from the enemy and you have to be on the move the whole time while looting and managing different important rescources like ammo, medkits and explosives for roughly 45 minutes if u dont die before that. That experience (especially while playing with a good group of 8 ppl) is a BLAST.There are also plenty of other modes to mix up your experience once a while like a defense mode or KotH.I really recommend the game for people that are looking for a very tactical approach on a top-down shooter that recquires tons of teamplay with a very tough difficulty.The only two downsides for me are:It takes plenty of time to ""learn the ropes"" due to the lack of a good tutorial. You are pretty much required to ask other players for good class setups and fitting playstyles. It took my about a dozen times with some random teammates to see the victory screen the first time.The second one is no fault of the game and the reason for me to write that review: The Red Solstice has a pretty low player base and you can be sitting in the lobby for 15 minutes untill you find a game. I hope the playerbase grows stronger over time.The upside of that is a very nice and patient playerbase though.			"

								This is a full-game version of the highly-rated Undead Assault games from the Starcraft II Arcade. Overall pretty fun, with lots of marines, missions, and monsters. If you haven't played UA, the premise is basically a squad-based survival horror. You run around, collect items, ammo, and weapons, and try to survive the onslaught of monsters while completing missions and helping your team mates. Solid overall premise and good execution here.The community seems pretty quiet lately, though, and it's hard to get a full game together at times. I think this title would probably work better as F2P with a well thought out microtransaction model and some weekly events, since there would be more people online.			"

								When I first bought this game months ago, I will admit that it was in bad shape. Poor graphics optimization made the game nearly unplayable, with frame rates regularly reaching intolerable lows.Fast forward to today, and things have greatly improved. The game is a satisfying blend of RTS and action, and it really does perfectly capture that sort of panicky scoot-and-shoot flavor of sci-fi horror films in a way that other more visible/mainstream games haven't. Team-work is essential, but not forced.Currently the game is facing a major problem, though. In order to complete a scenario (that is, not die while frantically holing up in a building/deathtrap as ammo supplies dwindle) and complete objectives, you really do need a team of 6-8 players. And, sadly, the game is dying. Which is a real shame because it's fun and has greatly improved since its early mis-steps.If this goes on sale for anything 15.00 or lower, consider buying this game. It really is a unique and action-packed romp. It is in need of some more polishing which, if the player base doesn't completely dry up, will no doubt come along.			"

								A thinking man's top-down survival/shooter.I heavily recommend that this game be played by friends/people willing to voice chat with each other, as coordination (establishing ""supply depots"", sharing ammo/items, maintaining fire discipline [ammo is freaking SCARCE except in bunker defense], designating runners for objectives/activating turrets/points) is absolutely VITAL.While the learning curve is certaintly comparable with Dark Souls (I'm being serious, it's easy once you know what to do but one hell of a struggle to getting there), it is just as fun once you get into it. Unlike Dark Souls, I actually recommend looking up a few guides on basic strategy (target in light = good, target in dark = good luck hitting the broadside of a barn), as the game is not enjoyable if the player has no clue what to do (in which case they can very well drag down the entire team)			"

								The game is pretty good. You will be running in the whole time and it all matter of team work. I don't like the sound when you open the game. The way they move screen is not really good. It use WASD key to move your game screen instead move your mouse to the edge of game screen ( like warcraft III, Dota 2, etc). Currently, the game still have few bug. I don't see bug in the game at this moment. Mostly are user interface bug. Other than those, the game still pretty good and I think it can get better!			"

												UPDATE 9/21/2015: I played this game a few weeks ago after quite some time, and was really pleased to find that they'd improved it. It's still incredibly hard, but that just makes winning even sweeter once you finally manage to do it. At only 20 bucks, I'd definitely reccommend this game. Unfortunately, I don't have any actual friends to play this with, so I'm left having to find pubs, but when I last played, there seemed to still be a pretty decent player base, and I only encountered one or two really trolly players. There seems to have been a clear movement towards discouraging people from going all Platoon on each other, which I personally really appreciate.9/10___________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW:I can't wait to see the finished product this game turns into; I've really enjoyed myself in the missions available so far. While there isn't a lot of story or maps, yet, this game shows incredible promise. It's got a bit of a learning curve at first, and the difficulty continues to ramp up pretty consistently, but if you enjoyed Dawn of War, I think this may be a game for you. You only get control of one character, but the customization is pretty decent. The game could definitely benefit from added weapons or some kind of weapon-mod system, but there's a pretty good variety so far. All in all, I'd give the game about a 7/10 right now, if it were completed. Taking into consideration it's an early access game, I'd have to ammend that score to a 9/10. With a few improvments/additions, I'd be too busy playing this game to even write this review.			"

												I'm 3.7 hours into Red Solstice and the more I play, the more I like it. Not exactly an easy learning curve, and I was very close to going for a refund a couple times during the first mission.  Tutorial wasn't bad, but didn't cover many things that would have been pretty helpful as a newbie, things that I had to discover on my own.  Now, having done that I'm greatly enjoying it and would probably rate it an 8 out of 10 at this point. Still, having been a computer gamer for many years, I've learned that one doesn't really know the true 'staying power' of any game until you've played it for a week or two.  I would encourage anyone who gets frustrated in the early going to keep at it. You absolutely need to use the Tactical Mode a LOT to keep yourself alive.  In Tactical mode you can gain true control over your team, so, for example, you can give direct orders for 3 of your team to cover the one who's deploying satchels or resonators instead of relying on autoaim to protect you.  You can manuever much more effectively, and you also get a more personal feeling about each of your teammates when you're controlling them directly. One key thing (at least for me) that I didn't figure out until my third attempt at the first mission is that the GDD device not only points you to nearby monster spawn sites, it also points you to nearby resonators, which you must have to destroy the spawn sites. Without a resonator when you need it, the spawn sites will just continually churn out mobs, and the more functioning spawn sites, the more mobs until eventually you die a horrid, screaming death.So use the GDD to find the resonators and you'll find survival isn't really impossible.Good luck, and if this has the kind of staying power I think it will, my only complaint may be that there aren't enough single player missions to keep me happy, so I'll hope for some DLC in the not too distant future.

								Ever heard of SWAT:Aftermath? No? How about Starcraft 1 custom maps? No? ... then darn I'll have to explain if not I've probably already sold it to you.if you've never heard of SWAT:Aftermath or never played those Starcraft1 custom maps you might've missed out. However this is reminiscent of a future more developed version of that.(with greater technology of course!) Where you get to play as certain classes with certain skills and attributes utilizing different weapons and strategies you go around a huge map exploration-wide with buildings you can enter and exit along with power systems that can be activated or simply go looting around and making sure you destroy ""radiation"" blobs around the map or activating radar sensors and setting up fort for an oncoming onslaught upon your squad and simply surviving until rescue or you're overrun and slaughtered. There are of course other game modes like mission mode completing a series of missions storyline based or just task based. Another mode would be bunker mode which is defending a fort area. Survival is simply try to do the main missions in time, get out alive within 15 waves, brutally hard and requires quite a bit of coordination.And by squad I mean you and your friends. This game is thrilling with friends and co-op is abundant. What's better is your classes can level up there's equipment to unlock, and multiple difficulties and game modes being developed. The graphics are nice and I can't wait for further updates.There is no single player campaign quite yet due to it being in development, however multiplayer and the prologue mission is available and there's quite a bit to do already.Enemies range anywhere from parasites to gargantuan behemoths the size of a building.This is written during the game's alpha.

								Ok so .. The Red Solstice .. apart from the really not great lobby and the 'we shall disconnect and crash the game - also for fun please redo the tutorial level before you're allowed to play multiplayer' problem, this is hard to fault. Think of space marines in any the following flavours: Warhammer/AVP/StarCraft and you'll be close to the kind of trooper feel the game has. You play one character and gain XP in 3 areas. The first is your XP (your account XP maybe) which gives you greater access to classes, weapons and perks as you progress. The second is your class XP - thus if you play medic alot you will unlock class specific 'powers'. The third is in-game XP - you start at the same basic level each new match and level within that match in a fashion similar to Dota or LoL etc. At the end of the match you lose that progression, but hey it's all good.Within the match there are items to be found. You only have 6 inventory slots so choose well and ammo is in short supply so it pays to grab it when you can and share with your team. Visually the game owes a lot to the Diablo 2 / Titans Quest / Warhammer view and it does look great, plus there is a lot of screen you cannot see due to poor lighting. Within buildings there are consoles which activate lights and flares which can be fired or dropped to help further. Also there are ad hoc sentry gun positions you can activate and within bunker mode, the option to deploy 'reinforcement' sentry turrets periodically.think i have done all i can to describe this game - noe go watch a youtube video on it			"

Review On the store page you'll read ""Survive on Mars. Or die trying.""Well, get ready to die. A lot.The planet Earth has been decimated and part of the human race is trying to survive on Mars.After a storm called ""The Red Solstice"", the Tharsis colony has lost communication with the other humanc olonies of Mars. A squad of marines is sent to find out what happened to the colony.The Red Solstice is a top-down, tactical, squad based survival shooter video game with RPG elements.There are three game modes: Single-player (Campaing), Survival and Multiplayer.On Single-player (Campaing) you control a squad of 4 marines through 10 missions. The first two missions serve as a tutorial, teaching you the basic controls and how to play.There are 4 difficulty levels.At the beginning of each mission you can choose the class of your marine, his primary and secondary weapon and up to 4 skills. However, you start with the Assault class only. The other classes and weapons will be unlocked as you progress on single-player missions.The game has a good variety of enemies and weapons.While playing solo you can use the Tactical Mode, where you press a button and the game runs 90% slower so you can issue orders/change the strategy/change the players position.In the beginning it's important to focus in one or two skills. Don't try to keep all of the skills at the same level.Also, it's important to have a balanced squad of various classes.And get ready to die. It's possible to revive a dead squad member, but if all of them die, you'll have to restart from the last checkpoint.The Survival mode it's like the multiplayer mode, but you play with bots, just like in single-player.There are random missions and events, 6 different maps, you can also level up and unlock new classes and abilities.In the Multiplayer mode you can play co-op with up to 8 players, in random missions and events, 6 different maps, you can also level up and unlock new classes and abilities.Currently there are few people playing this mode, so it may be hard to find someone to play with.Rating:9/10For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

								Okay I was genuinely surprised just how polished this game is for an Early Access game. It's certainly more refined then some actual completed games, although there are obvious places where the game is incomplete such as the single player being nonexistant and some modes not being unavailable. The appeal is obvious, and it certainly delivers. My main complaint is honestly just the meh lobby and community interface. The rest of the actual game itself is fairly decently done so far, and the randomness keeps it interesting. I'm looking forward to when it's actually complete.			"

								Easily one of the most addictive games, despite being in early access. Currently has a small but (mostly) helpful and friendly community who all watch, learn and help improve this game into one of the few coop masterpieces of 2014.Currently the early access version has access to most of the class skills, weapons and 2 different maps with wildly varying playstyles, but a refreshing aspect that keeps this game from getting boring is the random location mechanic and varying side and main missions, making nearly every game played a unique experience with fluid results.I could go a lot more into detail about the strong and weak points of this game, but i feel that for an early access title, the overall verdict is Pretty damn impressiveI'd suggest keeping an eye on this, because by the looks of it, it's going to take off very well and there's no telling how far this thing can go at this point, but it all points towards the good kind of game you hardly ever see these days.

								If you ever enjoyed a NotD map on SC I/II this is a game for you. If you didn't, the one thing you should know is it's coop heavy. You need your teammates and they need you. Not everybody gets the point, leading to frustrating public games. Better go at it with friends if you can. From my experience, in that particular case, three people (8 max) is enough as long as they work together.However, you might want to wait a bit, right now it crashes so much it gets quickly annoying. On the bright side the updates are frequent, I believe it will soon be a lot more stable and that is why I still recommend it.			"

The Red SolsticeThe Red Solstice is an isometric sci-fi tactical shooter.The story revolves around a group of four space marines deployed to an area of Mars that has basically gone dark and seems to be attacked by unknown forces.Upon arrival they find an infestation of aggresives aliens and other problems that have decimated the area.Your job is to lead the squad to find out what is happening and put a stop to it.GRAPHICSGraphically the game is nothing to write home about.A lot of areas are very dark and the general quality of the graphics feel a couple generations old.While the gunfire effects are pretty nice and vivid, everything else, from explosions to hit effects and lighting feels very low rent and subpar.This looks like a game that would have been high-end graphically maybe 10 years ago at best.Animations aren't as fluid as they could be and the entire graphical experience feels like a game made with a indie gamemaker tool and does not compete with similair games of the genre.GAMEPLAYGameplay is keyboard and mouse control.Right click to move, left to fire/activate/etc.The gameplay is split into realtime mode, where you control one squad member, and tactical mode which is a super slowed down (90% slower) mode where you can control any of the squad members, give them commands, and upgrade their functions. Control of your squad is very basic.Follow, Fire and Stay Put are basically what you have to work with.Although each squad member has his own upgradable paths, they are all the same options and  they don't seem to be very varied regardless and the game does a poor job at explaining what each option does.The small text over each upgrade option only gives a very basic idea of what the upgrade is for and makes it hard to decide if you should bother using the upgrade points on each selection.There is a way to directly control the main guy you start with by holding down (SHIFT), you can point and click at an object and fire.However, no matter how accurate it said my shot would be, it was very random as to how effective my shot actually was.The whole manual control is made pointless by an Auto-Aim mode that is activated by hitting E in realtime mode.Basically auto-aim has each squad member (yourself included) automatically aim and fire on any threat.I feel the auto-aim feature is way too powerful as it takes 80% of the gameplay out of the players hands and the manual mode isn't a good answer as it is too unperdictable to use effectivivly.There needs to be more control in shooting.Hitting a bad guy in the head should be devasting, rather than it is now where you just spray and pray and hitting a guy 15 times in the foot is just as effective as 15 times in the gut or the head.The shooting feels weak and inconsitant and enemies are massive bullet sponges.The rest of the gameplay is your cliched sci-fi something-has-gone-wrong-at-station-blah-blah-blag fetch quest.Go here, activate or find this, go there and do that and then fight off the wave of enemies that pop-up as you enter a new area. Rinse and repeat.The tactical mode is the only real ray of sunshine in an otherwise dull twinstick style shooter.By placing your units in key areas they act as defensive lineman to guard areas you need covered while you flip switches and read PDA logs.AUDIOAudio is pretty standard audio, with a macho sounding guy telling his other squadies what they need to do, and how they go about doing it.None of the audio logs have any voice overs, and other than ingame cutscenes, your character is the only one that makes much noise.Your squadmate characters are forgettable as they never speak and you know virtually nothing about them other than their upgrade stats.PROSThe ""tactical"" mode is a nice idea.Slowing down time by 90% and giving you control of all members is great for this type of game and is the only thing about the game I could really find to enjoy.CONSBeing an isometric game, there are times when things are hidden behind objects, I could not find a way to rotate the screen and objects would be hard to see because of a blocking wall or debris.If you are going to make your screen none rotatable, don't hide stuff behind other objects or near the edge of blocking walls!Graphically game is sub-par and feels generations behind other offerings in the genre.The story is a cliche ""super soldiers sent to planet x because: aliens"" trope and feels flimsy.The player doesn't have much direct control and the game feels like it plays itself most of the time.RATINGRating in this Genre is a 5 out of 10.A very basic attempt with it's only saving grace is the tactical mode.Rating for games in general is a 4 out of 10.For the asking price of this game, there are many other choices out there that will give a better experience.If the game was 75% off or better I would say ""maybe"", otherwise, it is not worth the retail asking price by a long shot.FINAL THOUGHTSI love the idea of a keyboard and mouse isometric shooter, and the tactical slow mode is a nice feature, but the shooting and feeling of any control based on player skill just isn't there.There doesn't seem to be any robustness to the gunplay either.After awhile each encounter with an enemy just feels like an annoyance as your squad mates just automatically do the most appropriate thing and easily dispatch the enemy while you run around fetching supplies or pushing buttons.I had to try really hard to fail (on normal difficulty).There is very little strategy, other than placing your squad mates in the right spot to take out incoming enemies, there isn't much else to it.The story just feels old and overdone and I quickly lost interest it what I was there for.Bad guys here, go kill them, then flip a switch is basically what it boils down to in the end, which can be fun if done right.If the gameplay itself is fun, it can trump the story, but if both are medicore, then you have a problem.Take the 2016 DOOM reboot as an example.Sure, the story there has been done a thousand times, but the polish and the meat of the combat felt good and solid.Here, everything feels weak and unpolished.There is just nothing new or novel about any of this game other than the slowed down tactical mode which is not enough to save this game.

Early Access Review
								I picked up my rifle and stepped out of the dropship into the dark unknown, my boots caked in red dust and dried blood. The corpses of the team sent here before us were strewn all over the area. I could already tell, this was going to be a long mission.If it’s not demons plaguing your usual trip to the Red Planet, then it must be aliens. Welcome to The Red Solstice, a Steam Early Access title developed by Ironward and published by Nkidu Games, Inc. The Red Solstice is a tactical top-down action shooter with an emphasis on teamwork and survival. The general story revolves around you and your team of space marines exploring what remains of human civilization on Mars after a massive storm (named the “Red Solstice”) has nearly wiped out all power and communications on the planet. At the same time, a large collection of alien lifeforms have emerged seeking to kill everything they see. Graphically, it seemed okay. The art design depicted a very dark and gritty sci-fi world, which I liked. What annoyed me slightly was just dark some of the levels were, though. At times, it became slightly difficult to see where exactly I was going. On another note, the various types of aliens you fight looked pretty cool. My main concern though, lies once again in the controls, namely, the camera.In Red Solstice, the camera has a bad habit of not following your player at all, meaning you have to not only constantly direct your character on where to go, but you also need to manage keeping the camera on them at all times. Combine that with the fact that you and your allies will be getting attacked constantly by enemies, and things can get hectic pretty quickly. To make matters worse, the camera isn’t locked to the application’s window. So, if you happen to be playing in windowed mode (like I was), and your cursor happens to drift outside of the game for a second or two by accident, the camera will end up showing you what’s going on about five miles to your left instead of what’s currently gnawing your kneecaps off.Multiplayer has some interesting class choices, ranging from your standard assault troopers with machine guns, to people who go around wielding flamethrowers, looking to make a quick barbeque dinner out of their enemies. It also seems to contain its own separate campaign missions, which is pretty cool.At the time of writing, there are seven available game modes. Hardcore Mode spawns boss monsters randomly with each wave, and you gain a bit more XP with each kill. The Primary and Secondary Missions modes are the story missions for multiplayer. Fast Mode makes all of the enemies significantly faster, though slightly weaker. Red Storm mode reduces your armor over time, and you’re noticeably slower when not inside buildings. You also take more damage from bullets while inside buildings. You do get a nice chunk of extra XP for your trouble, though. With Swarm mode, you get a bit of zombie apocalypse thrown in with your alien infestation, as there are a LOT more zombies. Thankfully, they’re also slightly weaker than normal. Finally, there is the currently being worked on “Bunker” mode, where players must protect some sort of object known as the Orbital Beacon. There are two other modes, but they are currently greyed out, so I assume they’re not ready yet. For the sake of trying to explain what they might be, I’m just going to go off of what they’re described as in-game. “Random Waves” mode features “completely randomized waves based on pre-defined types of wave groups,” and “Point Capture” mode involves the players capturing a series of points inside the map by defending the points from oncoming waves of enemies.There is also a nice levelling system implemented, with there being a maximum of 25 achievable ranks, complete with unlockable weapons and perks. As you gain higher ranks, the stats of your character also increase over time. Weapons are pretty standard as well for a sci-fi game. Machine guns, energy pulse rifles, flamethrowers, shotguns, grenade launchers. Nothing too out of the ordinary. You can also add small, but balanced power-ups to your characters fully customizable load-out, which allow you to do things like reload your weapon faster, make your armor stronger, or do more damage. On top of everything, the game also seems to hold future promises of a singleplayer campaign, which I think could be pretty interesting.As for the sound, much like the graphics, there isn’t much to say. Guns go bang, aliens screech and growl. It’s all pretty standard stuff. The voice acting was also pretty average. One very minor complaint here, adjusting the volume levels in the settings seemed a little weird. You don’t actually hear any changes you make until AFTER you’ve saved and left the menu.Personally, I found this game to be a little too run-of-the-mill for me. It’s by no means a bad game, but right now there really isn’t anything to it that makes it stand out from anything else to me. But, if this looks like a game you would be interested in, then by all means check it out. The Red Solstice is currently available for purchase on Steam for $19.99.http://wtbfun.com/the-red-solstice-an-early-look/ "

												It’s been two years, so I figured I’d take another crack at what there is to say about The Red Solstice…This kickstarter game, birthed from Starcraft and Warcraft mods, NOTD or Night Of The Dead has come a long way. It's a top down, action based, strategy, horror, survival game, where you control a single soldier, in a group of 1-8 players fighting against waves of monstrous AI controlled enemies. There are options to play with a player controlled team of 3 semi-intelligent marines, but the meat of the game comes from the live co-op play. Over the past few months of playing, I can clearly see that the game has gotten a lot better. I’ve tried to touch on the major categories that I personally feel like need to be addressed in this follow up review of the game, specifically the balance, the community, the controls, and the content. This review is critical and doesn’t cover all of the better points of the game, but addresses many of the issues that were the major detractors of the game upon my first review.  BALANCEThe difficulty rankings have four stages from an easy mode for new players,to the bleeding edge hard mode for those who have sunk in well over 200 hours of gameplay with maxed out suits. The game balancing has been tweaked to make playing the game reasonable at entry level, but maintains a challenge into the harder modes. Regardless, without a solid team, the chance of survival on normal (soldier) difficulty is still pretty low. The learning curve in the game is steep!  Developing 'run away skills' and learning from tactical errors (death), comes with time - more objectives completed, enemies killed and a successfully evac results in appropriate bonuses. There are no dead weight classes once you become proficient, which is nice to see as well. Some vets and more experienced players may try to build specific teams to their meta, but there are no classes that are never worth taking, which brings me to my next topic.COMMUNITYThis really needs to be addressed based on the very small player base of this game. There are a few great players that are helpful, nice and can make the game great to play. Without naming any names, there was one community member with over a thousand hours who found me when I re-joined the game and was very forward in wanting to provide a positive experience coming back into the game. I have seen a select few work towards raising up new players and helping them with their suit builds and laying out a plan in game to win. They lead by example and remain positive providing a genuinely high quality experience. That being said, some people are cancer. A few veteran players in particular are unchecked malignant growths that have been hanging on for far too long. One example in particular, let’s call him “Lord D-Bag” intentionally fragged a team member without warning because he believed that the team member wasn’t playing to Lord D-Bag’s chosen meta. What followed was a verbal fight and unapologetically run the team into the ground ending in a team loss.This behavior is unacceptable. Veteran players who dictate instead of leading has been a serious problem with the game since the game’s inception. I was happy to see a few friends who I used to play with re-join to have players like Lord D-Bag rudely talk down to them without insight, resulting in a lost player. This mentality of “my house, my rules” has created a small player base, and has limited the game since it's inception. I have to say, fortunately, that these players are now in the minority, but it is something to be aware of and to avoid. If you’ve ever played a game online late in the life cycle, none of this is new, but remember!: Positivity breeds positivity. CONTROLSI tell people, whenever I try to explain this game, that TRS is very reminiscent of StarCraft. It’s like taking a Terran Marine and stripping away all of the base building and having a lone marine weather the Zerg. For those who don’t understand the reference, it’s a game of precision. Many slight movements with precise clicks can make all of the difference. A self induced death is just as easy as getting killed by an enemy with a poorly placed explosive, or a missed healing. The skill hotkeys and team movement commands are straightforward. The issues come from the crappy hotkeys for the game items in your character's inventory and trying to control an AI team. When things get heated, you don’t want to accidentally hit the wrong hotkey combination and deploy a tactical nuke instead of a medkit, and it’s startlingly easy to do. This leads to having to click in the inventory to use every item. That’s not the worst thing, but it’s far from convenient. When it comes to controlling AI when you’re playing a solo game, the controls are the same as setting guidelines for a team in multiplayer. You can press the spacebar to go into a “tactical mode” which slows down time and allows you to click on the other character’s banner to directly control them like you would your own character. The problem comes from trying to control the other semi-AI characters when you have another player. The standard controls completely change for whatever reason. Without getting into the details of all of the flaws, let's just say the semi-AI requires a lot of micromanagement, with the memory of a goldfish and no tactical mode to help sort it out. This is exceptionally difficult to manage when you’re in the heat of battle and you need to precision to stay alive. This underlines the requirement playing multiplayer with people ONLY, or singleplayer survival with the AI team ONLY. Difficult.CONTENTThe amount of content in the game has increased quite a bit in the past few years. Now it has a story driven single-player mode which is focused on plot events leading up to the story of the multiplayer mode. After a single pass on story mode, (which is all you’ll want to do) the game will boil down to its multi-player focus. There are a decent number of maps to play on, which are decently well designed and balanced with their own individual perks and difficulties. There are a lot of customizable multiplayer modes including defending a bunker, killing insurgents, collecting data entries, destroying alien pods and others, with additional modifiers. All of these come  on the back of a waved survival mode. There are also a hand full of different suits your character can wear including a few stand outs like a marksman who has a extremely potent rail gun, a heavily armed demolition class, energy weapon / teleportation specialist terminator and others. They are all unique and have their own perks and uses, though some skills feel underpowered while others are must haves. As stated in the community portion, some players will tell you to change if they find that your build isn't what they want, but in the end, it’s all based on how you like to play, and there are plenty of options to cater to your whim.CONCLUSIONThough this game has some flaws, I personally enjoy the game. I've put in 360+ hours at the time of this review, over 150 more since my first. At this time I’ve maxed out all of my suits abilities and am able to reach the final wave of survival by myself, but I still haven’t maxed out my maximum proficiency (rank). I still have awards to win and higher goals to conquer. As a new player, online guides are available to help get you started, and there are helpful players who can get you proficient in no time. It’s also nice to see that the developers are still on board, hosting Tournaments and keeping the community live! I am happy to recommend this game to my friends and get them engaged. I think it would be great to bring in new players and breathe some new life into this game.			"

												Save your Money! The campaign sucked and the multiplayer is boring and repetative. If your the kind of person who has all day to wait for a boring match and dont mind being microed, teamkilled or kicked for being new or even just playing on someone elses server, then you might enjoy. But I cannot recommend this game for normal people. The tiny cancerous community makes this already lame game unplayable.			"

												So being that I was a fan of Alien Swarm, I decided to pick this game up. So far I have been very pleasantly surprised about every aspect of the game.Graphics-wise it isn't the best, but it doesn't look so bad that it is unplayable. It isn't anything like modded Skyrim, but it has it's charms. There is in-game physics, though it doesn't affect gameplay. If your marine walks across something that should be ""kickable"" it will move. Kind of impressive in my own opinion.Gameplay is where this game shines. It seems fairly straightforward at first, but I think it combines the best micro of a MOBA with the frantic pace of Left 4 Dead. There are times at the end of a game where you are running away in a panic as you are being pursued by far too many enemies to fight, but if you are smart and quick you may be able to pull off a victory. In addition the customization offered in character selection is surprisingly in depth. There are 8 distinct classes, plenty of weapons, different selectable abilities for each class, and small modifiers that make feeling your own particular play style out a necessity. Guides may offer a helpful nudge towards success, but ultimately you can play pretty much any way you want and still be successful, as long as you work well with your team.Finally the community. There aren't that many people online as of right now (July 14, 2015). One would think this might create a barrier to playing, but everyone seems super friendly and helpful. There are games starting up every 30 seconds or so, and while you may not have that many to choose from right now you shouldn't have any problems with a pickup game. In addition the dev team is very active with the community. My second night playing multiplayer I saw a game titled ""dev game"" or something like that. I hopped in not expecting much, but the damn main developer of the game was the host. He was consistently asking players if they were having any problems with a recent patch, and seemed to really care about making a game that was good, not just a game that will make a profit.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone on Steam. Not just because it is fun, but because the people involved with it actually give a damn about making games. If you care about the PC gaming industry, this is the type of game you need to support.9.9/10 There is always room for improvement.			"

												what can i say about this game bought it cause the cover was cool and the gameplay videos looked good now that i have played it a bit like 3 days worth of non stop playing i can say it is awesome to me its feel like a really good sqaud base rpg you go online and select one of the classes which are like your all round soilder and a medic and more. each class if played right can mean the differnce between completing a mission and failing. the single player is really good and the stroy is fun and good and pulled off great. the multiplayer is awesome when you can find people to play with.in short this game is one of them games that is hard as hell to finish a full mission and makes you its play thing but belive me its worth it you feel like your the unit with little ammo holding off hordes of enemies and it pulls you in trying to surive well sreaching for the objectives i belive that if more people gave this game a decent shot it would become as big as dark souls but for team survial. so please give it a shoot it really is a diamond in the rough  "

The tutorial is helpful in guiding you through the course. I made it to the second level without loss of life.  Power ups and ammo are available along the travels. It gets more challenging as your squad proceeds on it's mission.  I like it!			"

												This is a great game, but not for everyone. I have only played the MP mode, and the game shows a lot of replayability, intensity, and teamwork moments. In MP, you control a single marine (usually) as you complete random missions with teammates. The point of the game is to complete as many missions and objectives as possible and then call for EVAC - before getting overrun. There can be up to 8 players in a single game, and each player can select the type of suit (class) and equipment they are taking on the mission. Classes range from Marksman, which is a sniper type of role, to Medics, Demolitions, Flamethrower, etc. The classes are varied, and have different upgrades which allows them to fulfill different roles.And that is what the game is all about - cooperation! As time goes on the enemy gets stronger and more numerous, supplies will run low, and people will start to die. Every moment becomes a tactical decision, and the smallest misstep can spell doom.  The enemy AI is not particularly clever, which is important because funnelling enemies into explosive death traps becomes very important, specially when you are facing one of the game's bosses.Death is painful, because there is no respawns - except for new players. If you are not a new player (determined by some threshold of character XP), then you stay dead until a medic can revive you or a special mission (""Reinforcements"") is completed by the team. (This mission becomes available about halfway through the game, and its availability by no means guarantees that you will be able to complete it!)The graphics and sounds are mediocre at best, functional at least. The music is slightly better. They will not turn you away from the game, but the game wont win any awards for any of these.Playing with friends is where its at - the game has a lot to explore, and that means a lot of death and discovery as you come to grips with the game. The game does have built in voice, and there is also a public TeamSpeak server which sees a lot of action. The community is friendly overall, and it is tight knight as is common with communities that form around hidden gems like this game.There seems to be a good amount of replayability - first because the game is HARD, second because of how missions are randomized. There are I think 6 maps total, but everyone is still playing the first (and easiest!) of these. I actually thought at first that there was only one map and that it was randomly generated. And this is because the maps are very large, and there is so much going on, that it took a few days before I realized map is not random.I got the game 48 hours ago and have not been able to stop playing it. It is a real nail-biting experience, the cooperative aspects works really well, and the community is there to support it and help it grow.All we need is you now!			"

												I consider myself a veteran of many ""squad-based run-and-gun shooters"" like this one. After all, The Red Solstice is based off of games like Night of the Dead and Undead Assault II, which are some notable maps/mods for another game called Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne -- a title I've sunk more than 8 years of my time into.With such a ""veteran's perspective"" on the genre, does The Red Solstice live up to the hype? In my opinion, yes, it actually does. The developers have succeeded in making an enjoyable game that stays faithful to the source material that inspired it, while doing plenty to make it stand out from the crowd. Let me just give you a short and sweet rundown on some of the core features that interested me:-----1.) A light system. Whether it be due to the titular storm that is the game's namesake, or simply that your mission takes place at night, every playable map in the game is cast in darkness, broken by streetlights, burning flares left by your team, fires from ignited fuel barrels, and interior lights that you have to reactivate by finding their central power stations in different buildings. If you are shooting at a target in dim or no light, you are penalized with a substantial chance for your bullet to miss and be wasted. If firing on enemies in bright light, like the brilliant radiance of a Flare Gun item, you can expect near-100% accuracy (if you're standing still and shooting).And sometimes? Sometimes, by random event or by a failed mission, the lights in your sector will go dark. That makes it a damn inconvenient time to have to fight off a wave of mutants threatening to chew your face off, because the lights emitted by your suit only extend a few meters in a circle around you. If the light isn't enough to make out enemies approaching you, all you will see in the shadows is rapidly-moving shapes, accentuated by guttural roars from the beasts who can track you like a lantern in a coal mine. Without adequate light, your ammo efficiency, accuracy, and overall combat effectiveness will drop like a lead brick.2.) A leader/officer system. At the start of the game, you get to designate a maximum of 2 players (from an 8-player squad) to be Leaders. These players get access to special key commands that let them set waypoints and routes for the team, which show up as bright yellow lines on the minimap that are easily followed. Leaders are also the only ones who can access certain game-changing items and features, like the Safety Zone, which is a beacon that calls down fresh ammo and supplies, as well as a sustained orbital artillery barrage in a circle around the beacon while leaving the beacon itself (and, hopefully, you) untouched. Thus, you won't have to worry about some trolling player activating a full-charge Safety Zone without the rest of their team, or running ahead and turning it on and getting the team killed by artillery.3.) Throwable explosive barrels. No, I am not kidding. Each player has the ability to right-click fuel or toxic material barrels, have their marine/character pick them up, and then hurl them about twenty meters wherever you left-click the mouse. This is AMAZING for area denial, as chucking a few barrels into a narrow corridor can wipe out hordes of zombies with the damage-over-time fire patches or toxin clouds they leave when they explode. Doing this does cost you 30 armor points (you start with ~100 but can get more), though, so you should make sure your shots count.NOTE:  There is a flamethrower-using class in this game that gets an ability which lets him use fuel and toxin barrels to provide ammo for his weapon. Not only that, it juices his flamer to where it now leaves the same clouds the exploding barrels do. xD4.) Dismountable turrets. Sentry turrets exist around the map, which you can either spend time activating one-by-one or, if you're lucky, find a central terminal that'll turn them all on. Once active you can ""disarm"" them (with the right tools/skills), turning them into a dismounted turret that you can then place virtually anywhere on the ground you please. So not only do you get to save turrets in a bad spot from certain destruction, you also get to use them to build your own defensive positions! ^^5.) A nice, streamlined explosives system. A good percentage of the items you'll find throughout a given game will be satchel charges, incendiaries, claymore mines, plasma bombs, and directional primer charges. In case you don't know what the latter is, it's a ""leap bomb"" that scatters a shotgun-like cone-shaped blast of high explosives in whatever direction it's pointed, which is helpfully indicated by red lines so you don't blow your team up by accident. Very lethal to tight groups charging down a narrow hallway.Anyway, the system. Many explosives in this game are external-source-only, which means you have to supply an initial explosion (like a grenade or rocket) to set them off. Some are radio-detonated, like satchel charges or the aforementioned directional primer charges, and need only a quick double-tap of the ""G"" key (by default) to set off. You can disarm most explosives at will if you need to move them or just don't want them anymore, as long as you have the right tools or skills available (the Demolitions class is the best at this). Since you really need the firepower of high explosives to have any real hope of surviving the late-game waves of tough enemies (I nearly got overrun even after dropping a tactical nuke on half a wave), it's really nice to have a system that demands so little micromanagement. You don't have to click the bomb or anything like you might in some other games.-----The Red Solstice does have its own fair share of issues, like some wireframe-y animations on certain enemies when they attack, and poor or outright inaccurate documentation on weapons and abilities, but nothing that really turns me off or makes it so that it's chafing to play the game. I mean, I come from Warcraft 3, and that game is old as dirt by comparison to today's titles, so a few little things like that actually endear me to the game even more. The Red Solstice has a pretty respectable soundtrack, too, with solid themes all the way from the main menu to the combat suit selection screen to the final, desperate run for the evacuation dropship while the area is crawling with monsters at the end of the mission.All in all? Yes, I think The Red Solstice might just be a winner. If you like fast-paced, run-and-gun squad-based gameplay, or want to feel like you're Space Marines from Warhammer 40k fighting off a Tyranid infestation, this will find a welcome home on your shelf.I give The Red Solstice a solid 8.5/10! The reason it's not higher is because the documentation for the game really is that bad -- they neglect to mention that the Precise Fire skill passively increases your movement speed, NOT your health regeneration, for example. I'm trying to fix that by editing the unofficial Red Solstice wiki, but in-game, you just kinda have to play for a while to figure this stuff out. Still, recommended!			"

												""Real-time X-Com"" is an apt description.Bought it for the mp, but the single-player campaign is extremely well done.  In mp you only control one character while giving simple follow/stay commands to rescued AI marines.  In single-player you utilize bullet-time pause to fully control squads.  You'll decide which characters to bring with you on a mission, outfit them, and level them.  The degree of replayability is high, since each character levels separetely, while belonging to one of eight classes.  You're encouraged to attempt missions with different class combos, which will completely change your tactics and playstyle - this keeps things fresh.Two characters of the same class can be built differently by altering their stats, powerups, abilities and gear (all of which you find as loot during missions).  I have one assault character built as a speedy, evasive, melee expert, used for hit-run bombing alien spawn tunnels.  I have another specializing in grenade AOE support, and another as a pseudo-sniper marksman who holds the mid-line.SP feels a lot like Dawn of War 2's campaigns during realtime, but the slo-mo pause gives it a tactical X-com feel. You'll also get overrun and die easily even on normal difficulty, just like classic X-com. Even though you only control one character in MP, things are even hairier than they are in SP, since there's no pause. The easiest ""recruit"" difficulty will slaughter many players.  I just finished my first ""recruit"" difficulty multiplayer mission at 27h (though much of it was spent in single-player).I'm having a blast with it.			"

But if you're a lone wolf, don't buy it unless you want to support it. The concept is there but the game still needs a lot of work imo. The biggest drawback is how complicated it is to win.

								This game is really cool and difficult. And this game is fun.When you first start the game - well, you die... and die some more times. And then some more. When you see big enemies' level of HP for the first time you think ""Holy cow! We are never gonna be able to kill this"". And you die. And yet you enjoy it ) You want to survive, to find a way to finally beat the mission, to save the day.Today was the first time for me when team was able to fully finish the mission. First time in 11,5 hours of gameplay. And this victory feels really good, even taking into accont the fact that I died at the the very end of mission. (Remember - you die at every corner!  One mistake - and you are dead meat! )So - try this game )To other aspects:This game is still early access and not all options, missions and features are available. :-( controls take some time to get used to. :-\Game community is really small :-( , but nice and helpfull :-) . You can easily join a team with experienced players, get advice and experience nice teamwork. :-) Nowadays there are rarely more than two of three teams assembling to play at any time. Sometimes there are only 10 people or less in lobby. :-( "

								This game is fun to play and I would highly recommend it to anyone reading this post. The game overall puts you in a post apocalyptic setting that is controlled by aliens that have took control of a Mars colony. You objective is to elimate the threat and then evacuate your crew and any survivors to successfully complete the mission. This is hard to do when your team gets seperated, runs low on ammo, becomes swarmed, or if you accidently blow up half your squad like I did. This game is still in developement and is showing great advancements to say the least.			"

												IMHOthis is one of the most underrated games ever!Just picked it up a few days ago when it was on sale with close to no expectations.After the first few story missions i just went straight for the survival mode and was intrigued.And after the first time i played multiplayer with seven other players i just was blown away how much there is about this game. Now i'm addicted :)Pros:8 Classes, each with 11 different skills to choose, each class has 6-7 different primary weapons and another 5-6 different secondary weaponseach solder can equip 3 booster (perks) and there are 12 different booster types (perks) different types of ammomakeing use of environmentteamwork is king u wont live long as lonewolf unless ur high level and a very good/smart playerWH:40k - its obvious the dev's where inspired by WH:40k and games like ""spacehulk"" but brought it to realtimeCons: low player base sometimes its hard to find people to play with but single player survival is also alot of fun and challengingcan be frustrating if u dont like challenging games just dont expect the game to be won right away its more like a ""how far can i get"" there are so many key bindings that it may confuse new players and old ones alike :)if u fill ur group in multiplayer with bots its very hard to control them, in singleplayer its ok thx to tactical mode "

								So I haven't beaten the first map yet, in 24 hours of playing. Do I recommend it? **ck yeah!First things first, I still consider myself as a noob at this because I very rarely (if at all) play comparable games. To me, the game was very overwhelming at first (in a bad way). I was confused by the fairly complex game mechanic and the very stiff learning curve. I didn't know what to do and when I learned what I had to do, I didn't know how.On the one hand that might be because of my lack of experience with games like this and on the other hand because of the lack of a decent tutorial (which is an issue the devs want to work on). There is a small one but it does only explain the very basics. Further more you need a capable team.But if you keep playing despite of that, you'll start enjoying this game a lot. You rank up in total and additionally with each class. Promotions in any of those two ranks unlock new gear, components (skills) and passive bonuses (Even if you do not win the map or finish all missions... or get to the emergency evac). I played only medic so far and didn't reached the highest rank with it yet, and there are about 8 classes to rank up with, so that keeps you motivated for a while if you are into stuff like that.Once you learned about controls, enemies, missions, gear, friendly fire and classes you will become usefull for your team, which is great. It is fun to see your own progress and reaching higher waves and more difficult goals while getting better. And even if don't make it, you still made progress, because you earned xp and unlocked new stuff, which will make it easer the next time.On the downside we have the fact of TRS being in early access, which means you will run into bugs every now and then. So far I didn't had any that were too troubling, nothing that can't be fixt or made me stop playing. The community is yet small. You may not always find regional game lobbies but I was always able to find some games in the global lobby. Also does the game not offer that much for graphic enthusiasts. But as I said, I do recommend the game. After I got the hang of it I started to enjoy the helping, covering and healing, sharing of ammunition, in short: the teamwork.And despite of that, who is going to stop the horrors of mars, if not YOU(!)?I'm doing my part! What about YOU? You wanna live forever?!			"

								I enjoy this game a whole lot, and I feel like I will always enjoy and appreciate it more than people who just pick it up as a ""cool looking game"" due to the fact that it is basically a remake of the ye olde WarCraft 3 and StarCraft/StarCraft Broodwar survival custom maps you'd see on Battle.Net from time to time. The multiplayer for this one currently reminds me more of the Night of the Living Dead custom map from WarCraft 3, and let me tell you, they did a damn good job of it.It would be nice if the game locked the window to the screen though, often I find myself right clicking off on to my second monitor in intense situations which gets pretty frustrating (so locking to the primary monitor in use would be a nice feature devs <3 ), but aside from that and some controls that sometimes feel a little clunky (hey it's early access though so that isn't really a complaining point for me unless it doesnt get better at all with final release), this game is pretty amazing. I love the fact that they replicated even the small details, back in WarCraft 3 your group had it's own AI-like dialogue where when a character would say something their name and their ingame progression/rank would come up as who says it, and this game does it just perfectly, so for example, when an event occurs and my character talks it'll say ""Private P-sychotic:"" and then whatever dialogue is triggered via event. It might just be me feeling all nostalgic over WarCraft 3 Battle.net days, but I love that they've added this.Anyway regardless of this being an Early Access review, I would still rate it worth buying and immensely enjoyable, and somewhat nostalgic for the custom Battle.net map players out there. Currently there is only a prologue which is essentially a tutorial, and only multiplayer with the promise of singleplayer later on.			"

								This game is difficult. Sure, you will get a few mission objectives.  And yes, you will kill a few dozen monsters.Around wave 3 the aliens might get lucky and catch your friend alone and/or unaware.You'll try to save him of course.  No man left behind.  But it was to late, and deep down you knew it.By wave 5 the aliens step up the challenge, sending giants after you.  It will break a team mate's leg and they will tell you to leave them behind.  He'll hold them off while you run.  You can hear his death cry as you leave him to die.Then, they will By wave 7 the stress is getting to you and the remainder of your team.  The aliens come in swarms now, the pack no longer strong enough.  The turrets are helping, but for how much longer?Wave 9 arrives.  You are low on ammo, medical supplies are scarce, and the objective is on the other side of the city.What member of your team goes next?  Is it you?  The heavy support?  The hellfire maybe?  Will someone sacrifice themselves to slow down the horde?  Will the horde even slow down as the few overtake and devour its next victim?Don't die with the weight of your last mistake on your soul.  Everyone makes mistakes.  And even if you do it perfectly, you are just a single part in a chain of events.  Who is to say that it was you directly that caused your entire team will die.... Do I recommend this game?  Yes.  Yes I do.  For now.  Early access is a far cry from the end product.The AI could use some fixes.  The monster ability to track you from anyplace to anyplace is a little annoying.  This means that they always know where you are.  You can't hide or lose them.  And they don't have to search for you to start with.The loot table could use a little fix too, some more ammo would be useful because they always know where you are.  Medical supplies seem ok for now, but I play with people who can drop supplies. "

												Overall great game, although TRS relies heavily on teamwork and strategy. There is no room for people who refuse to take advice and help others, mistakes can cost the entire teams life.But don't let that put you off.A fast paste top down co-op rpg, with a decent single player campaign on solo survival mode where you can control up to 4 characters at once.If you don't like steep learning curves then I suggest looking elsewhere.8 player co-op really brings it home for the fora small group of friends starting out to the higher difficulties, with a fully dedicated community teamspeak server, that improves gameplay and helps makes new friends.Small but growing community, the veteran players are always willing to help.""Watch out for the Levi-bush, he's a sneaky one.""

								EARLY ACCESS THOUGHTS.Do you remember this map in Warcraft 3? Where you and other people play as a marine trying to survive in a city? Yeah, this game is basicly it on a new level. The game is good and decently optimized.But devs need to solve one thing ASAP: they need to figure out how to hold players in this game.Hear me out here. With this game in it current state devs will never be able to hold an average player for more than a 5-10 hours. And the rotation of players will be too small for this game to be populated. Devs need to make something for players to come back for, make game as random as possible.Best solution i see is making more random events. Making more rewards. Making more progression trackers. Making map being random or semi-random on each new play. Add more winning conditions, so players losing every game will not feel themselves drained and abandoned.I played 10 hours and i don't think there is something to come back for. Maybe once a week with a friend. Maybe. But thats not enough. How will they keep money flowing? I don not know. I just hope they will figure this out. Microtransactions on customization is something i could easily accept.			"

								As yet another NotD player, my review is obviously biaised. But listen on.TRS brings to the masses a genre in itself : Tactical Survival.If you think from the screenshots it looks like Alien Swarm or something, think again.It's not a game about being a gun-and-kite wizz -- you've got to keep thinking at every second or bad things will happen.Teamwork is at every corner: unless you know what you're doing, you /will/ die if you even split up the team.Everything goes down too fast for words: eventually a team of skilled players reach a symbiosis where just moving is enough to communicate.An armored rushes your team. Whole team spreads out. The flamer moves forward to protect. Move behind him. He's out of ammo and starts moving away. Move on the side and start firing to kite. The demolitions leader orders the team to move away. Sprint off in an arc toward them, Devourer tailing you. The Demo fires off his rocket launcher, missing you by half a meter and killing it. It's fine, he knows what he's doing. Move on.While not as hardcore as the old NotD maps (i highly recommend the SC2 remake of Spec Ops which is still almost better than TRS... hopefully not for long!), this game is still pretty hard. You will die, and die, and die again. Unless most of the team knows what to do. And even then, one person can screw up : and you'll be that person at some point. Learn. Retry.And as you get better and better, leveling up and stacking bonuses, you'll find the game itself gets harder. New things appear, sometimes subtle, but enough to make a big difference.All in all, if you like Zombies, Hardcore, fast-paced games, and Teamwork, i can only recommend this. The price might be a bit steep, and it takes a while to get used to -- but once you do, it's totally worth it.			"

								This is a really interesting tactical game. First of all, I don't recall playing a 8 players CO-OP in a long long time, so seeing a game that can accommodate a large group of friends together is almost an instant win.This game reminds me to Starcraft, well basically you control some Marines, but the top-view camera really does a good job to bring Starcraft memories to my head. NO just that!! after a few minutes you will be immerse in a mix of Shadowgrounds/Aliens/Alien Swarm/Warhammer 4K... really really interesting. The game require a lot of teamwork, since is really easy to get lost in the map and overrun by aliens, but the addition to marines classes helps a lot to maintain the troops alive.Controls are something that you need to get use to it, but is not anything from the other world, so in a few games you will be able to control your marine movements and shoot without any issues.Also there are perks and auto-aim that you can use, but everything comes with a cost, because you may need to sacrifice something in order to get that bonus. For example if you use Auto-aim for a few, during that time the character will move 20% slower. This is a really interesting aspect in the game, and make the customization of your character, before every mission, critical.I would recommend this game to anybody who loves games like Alien Swarm and enjoy tactical games.KAZ verdict:  7 out of 10			"

												At a whopping 1 hour played, I can say that I do like the game, but would like it infinitely more if you could move with WASD keys. The fact that you cant is kind of gross. Trying to move and shoot while manually aiming is pretty frustrating. There are plenty of weapons to keep me entertained, and there are a lot of classes which is pretty cool. The graphics are fine. Nothing impressive or mindblowing. Pretty much zero adjustments, so what you see is what you get. The shooting feels kind of laggy. Like I've got no idea what the cadence is for some of the guns. Maybe the server was lagging, I don't really know. 7/10. Worth the 10 bucks I paid for it.			"

								10.1.2015 Early Access. As a friend of this genre, and a huge fan of NOTD. This is the game, also nice that the devs play with us, its mostly stable. Patches seem to be rolling in atleast once a week. Starting a game takes a bit patience, like 15minutes or so. Extremely challenging even for high rank players. hard difficulty is already totally insane. And there is Nightmare difficulty after that.Its starter friendly in every way, until you hit Rank8. There is some bugs and undeveloped systems, but not any gamebreakers. Mostly you get used to them and stop noticing them. 80% of the players i have played with are helpful and friendly. Learning not to die, playing as a team, micromanage your every move is the key to victory. There is two methods you can play and switch any time. Automove (or follow) + autofire, will cause you sometimes miss, reducing total DPS, but your instincts and reactions are sharp as a bot, Then there is manual mode. Swapping primary to secondary weapon you run 25% faster, switching from autofire mode to burstfire will enable you move fast between high damage shots. and Manually aiming your gun completely will give you +40% damage, but its up to your own instincts to react to targets approaching you.All the classes provide very good variety, if you got bored in one class you will find completely diffirent playstyle from another class. I love the RPG system. There are weapons & class specific skills to unlock for the first 50hours of the game (and its still a very, very long way to maximum rank). Playing a certain class gives statistical bonus to that class via Specialization rank. There is three diffirent maps you can play, and every game you can choose from 7 diffirent game modes ( popular are ""Fast Mode"" and ""Bunker Mode""). I would give 2 recommendations to this game if I could.			"

Stick with your group, running off solo will get you killed quickly, and less teammates just equates to a more difficult time to manage through the map.  Teamwork is key, as many have mentioned already.I don't usually take a shot at an Early Access game but this one was worth it.Modeled after a Use Map Setting game (NoTD) that was quite popular in SC / WC3.

Your experience/rank gained with a certain class and through your overall career contribute to what is available to you allowing people to work towards new and interesting additions to their arsenals.If you enjoyed Alien Swarm or any of the X-Com games you may be looking for something like this: it's real time, it's visceral, and it's frantic fun.

It plays just like the starcraft/warcraft night of the living dead mods but looks and feels like the original alien swarm mod. Game is a lot of fun, requires team work to win and new players usually need a few matches to get their bearings. The game doesn't hold your hand (thank you!) but most players will look after you as long as you add somthing to the team (aka be a medic and keep them alive until you figure it all out). Community is going strong so far and the game is in really good shape (rare for early access). For the price and its current state I'd say buy it.

								First and foremost i would like to say that, this is a great game and everyone should really try it especially those who love challenging games and have fun in a co-op game unlike most AAA titles out there.To begin with, most NOTD (Night of the Dead) veterans from warcraft 3 era can slot in and play this game right away without much hassle. For new players the learning curve might be abit high but with the amout of veterans i see in here there wouldnt be any problem (NA/EU) besides SEA players (South East Asia)The game is freakishly hard to begin with, imagine playing Demon/Dark souls on new game ++++ on easy difficulty. The + goes up with higher difficulty.Most pub games rarely get to wave 15 (which is the intended final boss wave) and that just shows how hard it is.If you like the chllange go and get it. Bugs wise theres only a few i can see but being early access this will hopefully be rectify soon and most of em arent even gamebreaking. "

								Nice game. Has a bit of NOTD and a bit of Alien Swarm. The gameplay could use some touching up, granted, but its still in early access beta. Overall this game should be sucessful on the route they are taking it.			"

								Picked up The Red Solstice thanks to my hubs.Not having actually played the original Warcraft 3 mod of this, I'd have to say it's a really solid game!I especially like how difficult it is, without being too overwhelming.Did I mention that it's Co-op? It is. Eight players altogether. EIGHT.It's essentially Killing Floor meets XCOM...And I can't wait to play some more!MEDIC 4 EVA "

								Type of Game:Third Person Tactical Real-Time ShooterVersion Played:Early Access PC version through SteamSimilar Games:Warcraft 3: Night of the Dead mod, XCOM, and to a lesser degree Left 4 DeadThe Good:One of few games that offers 8 player coop over a non-local environment!Multiple classes to choose from, with unique abilities and loadouts that run the whole gamut of shooter/MOBA tacticsAssault, Heavy Support, Recon, Marksman, Demolition, Terminator, Hellfire, and MedicRandomly generated map content helps make every gaming session different and unpredictableRandomized missions also offer different objectives and locations that add to the replayability Also adding to the longevity of the game are the handful of different gametypes that place different changes to the setting and difficulty levelsA wide variety of weapons, which feature numerous stats that determined their purpose in varying combat scenariosThe music and sound effects are well done and aptly convey a sense of dread and suspenseThe story line and lore is complex and deep, which can assist with the player’s ability to immerse themselves in the gameThe game rewards great teamwork which is important to have in a tactical shooterVery few bugs and glitches for an early access title, especially considering the massive amount of content offeredThe plethora of achievements and rank unlocks help encourage game progressionThe Bad:Overall presentation is not very polished and doesn’t help market the immensely deep game underneath. A serious example of making sure not to judge a book (game) by its cover (presentation)The voice over during the beginning cutscene is atrocious and immediately puts the players expectations lowThe complex user interface and menus are also off putting and require putting time into the tutorial to fully understandWhile the tactics keep the gameplay varied, the actual gunplay can get repetitive though this can be said of most shootersThat said, if you aren’t a fan of shooters this won’t change your mind or opinionCan you play it while the children are awake?There is quite a lot of gun and other weapon-based violence. There, at least in my time with the game, is no profanity. I’d say it would be fine for children 8+, but that of course can vary depending on the child.Did I make time to complete it?This is primarily a multiplayer game, so completing it is not an option. I did, however, put numerous hours into it.Redlight or Greenlight?This game is currently at a greenlight.The content that is currently offered is well worth the asking price of $19.99. In fact, the amount of content is beyond most shooters that currently available as completed titles. I will say that I was interested in this game due to the RPG and progression elements, but I am typically not a fan of shooters. The last statement of the cons rings true for me as this game did not change my poor opinion of shooters. If you are a fan of the genre, however, you will find PLENTY to enjoy in The Red Solstice.A Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buyhttp://www.gamersglance.com "

								An enjoyable tactical shooter. Crisp graphics and responsive gameplay, combined with a reliance on working as a team. It's a strategist's dream, and can also result in many funny/sad situations. One example would be tossing a grenade to kill a large alien beastie... killing two of your squad in the process. Oops.It has a couple of bugs, but nothing that will adversely affect your gameplay experience.If you like co-op, big guns, and blowing up the alien menace, buy now.			"

												Tried to play it in Multiplayer, 1 server in peak time, name of the server was called ""Team Speak Required"". I don't have a mic and I am sure as not installing more programs for some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who likes his own voice. I started my own server and got the percentage that was'nt allowed in the only other server, a whole team. Problem was some of the douches who outted me on the previous server came in, hogged ammo, went ahead, did not explain things and failed the mission by going on a reap all you can. Not a good community online, the only help I got was vets pruning and gearing themselves.Individual players like ""XinjaX"" and ""Hey Buddy"" just troll other lower players for equipment and don't clarify clearly in chat, it is a really lame effort for vets to pick on lower newcomers. Devs seem to favour these players. This game would be good if the community was not so small and ignorant to new players. Gave it so many chances, uninstalled for good, wish I could get my money back.			"

			Views: 6,406		

			Cosmic reviews The Red Solstice an indie 8 man co-op tactical shooter developed by Ironward and published by Nikdu Games. This game was provided free of charge for the purpose of critique.		

Inspired by Warcraft 3 mods like Night of the Dead. The Red Solstice is a well-made 8 man co-op isometric tactical shooter that caters to fans of multiplayer games. The mechanics are solid, promote team work and the game can be very fun and frustrating in equal measure. It has a few bugs and quirks here and there and it’s not particular pleasant to look at but it retains a multiplayer experience that is difficult to find, It's worth a look.			"

												Don't give a frak about MP and get pretty irritated with games who diss the SP part in favor of making things rediculous in SP. In the age of 5000 MP only games  where they mostly all fail eventually due to ignoring their SP to ive the game reason to at least be purchased long after the MP is dead. This is one that at least makes sure there's some SP there for those who do not care to deal with MP ommunties which usually = headache and idiocy..lmao First off, the game is based on a WC3 custom map called Night of the Dead. You are space marines prancing around a Mars colony full of zombies. You select a suit (read: class), a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, 4 suit components (read: skill...not trees. Paths, maybe? 5 sequential, mostly passive abilities), up to 3 powerups (which add some bonuses at the cost of other penalties), and you go off to try and survive a ~1 hour long match. You find items and accomplish objectives which will strengthen your team, while endless waves of zombies try to murder you to death. The customization isn't that deep, but you'll find plenty to tinker with if you're the fiddy sort. I enjoy it greatly. Worth the time and Dev support , even for just SP.			"

Early Access Review
								Genre - Co-op Squad based survivalOn paper this game sounds great to me. You are part of a squad of marines have to complete missions and protect each other from alien hordes. There are different classes with their own perks and unlocks as you play through the game. However, it doesn't quite work at the moment. The objectives are not clear and a lot of players tend to play bunker, which seems to involve staying in one place and killing endless swarms of aliens. When you do get into fighting the inventory is difficult to navigate and it is not clear what the stuff does. The shooting seems to just involve selecting auto aim and reloading when needed. Really wish I had invested in another early access game as think there is too much that needs changing here to make this game enjoyable, although I could be wrong...please prove me wrong developers!

												Fun, addictive, its not so easy to master so it takes time to be really good, how to read guides and get practice alot to be good for harder levels. But even easy and normal mode are really fun to play! The game makes you wanna play all classes no matter you dont like some class,but every class is needed to survive and win,what is a great thing,you have a job in a mission,not just random shooting mobs. Some classes are really hard to master and takes time (like demolition), and some are easy and just click and shoot (assault).Cant wait every day to log in and test new weapon with some class, or new class in general, or a skill with a class :) Only a bit problem is without a expirienced player in a game or a good leader there is like no chance of winning or finishing it to the end, random players without a leader= no win. 9/10			"

												My review is different from many of the other recent reviews.  I don't mind the single-player campaign.  It gets tough but I enjoy micro-managing the 4 units and upgrading each one.  You go into tactical mode and move each one, use their abilities etc.  I have no crashes on my Nvidia 780 with latest drivers.As for multiplayer, I've only tried a few times to get into games because I want to finish the campaign first.  I'm about half way through campaign with 8.5 hours played.  When I did join multiplayer, there were 2 games going and I had no issue getting into them.  From what I see, there is a diehard core group of players from Europe and US that play.  I can't really speak to much more of it than that.There is a tutorial level, and once you 'unlock' tactical mode, you realize that you can control each trooper and really set up some tactical advantages.  There's lots of places to look for crates/loot to help with your mission.  I usually have tons left over.  The spawns aren't endless, but watch your ammo.  There are devices that seal up some of the 'creature' holes so you can start taking back some of the maps and assist your missions.It's a game like Alien Swarm, if you could slow down alien swarm and micro manage each trooper.  Also kind of like Breach and Clear but with a lot more granularity.It's $8 on sale right now, which I feel is a REALLY good price.  At $20, I'd say try it, get through the first mission where you learn everything, and wait for the tactical mode lesson because that's the real mechanic to this game for singleplayer.  If you get through it, you should still be under your 2 hours, refund it.  It is still under active development, the devs just released a new game mode last week (2/1/17).			"

												Top GameSingle Player:I don't finished the single player mode so i can't tell you if the end is fine but first few missions i played were well created and good balanced within the difficulty levels. Single Player have one feature that technically can't be in CoOp, slow Motion for tactics.Co-op:The best part of the game. I needed some time to realize that you really need a tactic and it is not possible to go straight throw the map and bam bam. Try to find a few people and play with them, look what class the others take and choose yours. Join the official TeamSpeak Server and talk. If don't talk and think you can make your own thing then the chance that you die is more than 98%. (On higher difficulty levels)There is a living multilingual community which always help.Also there are a lot good guides written by the community that what i have seen are mostly actual.Had a few great evenings while trying to beat some Fluffys.

												I have mixed feelings about this game.because at times its fun and at times it can be boring.This game has a singleplayer which is done in a rush and its just there for pople who wants to know the story. So in short the singleplayer is nothing special. Then you have the multiplayer, which is fun, you can play with 8 players on 6 diffrent maps (the maps looks the same only the structures are in diffrent locations) and many diffrent difficulty modes. There are 15 waves and each wave has diffrent enemy types which spawn  at 5 diffrent locations on the map. So if you dont stick to your group you can get overrun by the mobs of creatures.So when you play all the maps and done most of the modes then it can get boring. There are poeple who love it but for some people it has not enough content to keep them intrested. The game is hard at times but nothing unbeatable whit a good team.PROSCreates tense moments.Nice skills and classes to choose from.Relies on teamwork (which is nice)CONSCan get boring at times.Needs more diffent contentI really dont know if i liked this game or disliked it, its just a mixed feeling that i have of this game.6.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								Writing this review, I'll assume noone has played, ""Night of the Dead"", the Warcraft III mod this game was based on. The game in general plays like your average isometric shooter, with a bit of Dota thrown in. You start by choosing one of eight customizable classes, and then their loadout, including their primary and secondary weapon, the ammunition type they fire, up to four active/passive abilities, and 3 perks. As you rank up, the amount of each of these interchangable things you can use increases. Once your set, you can join a match with your customized soldier, and drop with up to 8 squad mates. The combat is fairly  simple. You move with right mouse click, and select targets and fire with the left. You can also allow your soldier to snap shot at targets automatically(aimbot) at the expense of accuracy. Your weapons use ammunition quickly, and unless you manage it carefully, you'll find yourself unarmed halfway through a match. Due to this, you have to scourage the environment for supplies, which you'll often find inside buildings, or on corpses. Once you find something, you can equip it into one of 6 item slots. The things you can find vary wildly, but they generally consist of explosives, medical supplies, ammunition, passive weapon upgrades, barricades, etc. Throughout this whole ordeal, you and your entire squad are trying to survive waves upon waves of hideous creatures trying to eat you, all the while trying to complete randomized objectives. At first glance this may seem fairly tame, but the enemy types vary wildly, from zombies, to giant bat demons, and they come from the darkness as the maps take place at night. To make matters worse, most often apply negative status effects to your soldiers. From bleeding wounds, bone fractures, and crippling toxins, you'll soon find yourself ravaged and left to die if you're not careful about patching yourself up and staying togethor with your teamates. As for game modes, the title currently has a tutorial, and online play with up to 8 player coop.The game is brutally difficult, even on the easier difficulties, but if you give it a shot, you'll find its highly addicting.

			Views: 97		

			I just found a BONUS copy of this game in my Steam Inventory. It's a gift copy with bonus copy of the game. So I'm going to pick another winner from the original comments below!		

Basically it's a rock-hard 8 player co-op survival game set in the distant future. It's not a game for the faint-hearted as you will die a lot. I've never played NoTD so this was all new to me. It felt like an isometric Killing Floor, and we all know how awesome Killing Floor is!  The game does have a solo mode, which is not available yet but the multiplayer is very polished and a sheer joy to play. I didn't have any problems finding groups to play with. - Highly Recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								This is a tactical survival game where your (up to) 8 person team must complete missions while surviving waves of zombie like creatures. Also, there is permanent death with only a few chances at revival. If your team survives until the end, then a match can last about 60-70ish minutes, but there is an option to call an early EVAC (if it is not lost or destroyed). There are multiple classes to choose from and each have their own set of abilities. Each class is fun to use, provides something different that is useful to the team, and there are limits on how many of the same type can be in a group, so I would say it's rather balanced in that regard. Also, playing as the medic (healer) is enjoyable, since they are constantly active and are seldom blamed for deaths. In game the abilities can be upgraded and downgraded, so that you can switch between for the task at hand.The current game is fun and replayable with the developers working to add more features for the final release. By the mid to end point in a game teamwork becomes key and each person gets to add to the effort whatever their class does.Now I will list some of the cons. Note that I am reviewing this game in it's beta state. - A lot of info about items and features in the game is not stated. This con is the first con because updating text is an easy fix and they have not. - There are some random crashes. Usually only a small amount of games crash so it is still quite playable, but after a patch it sometimes crashes much more often. - The community overall is fun to play with, but there is a bit of an issue with some people being jerks, such as telling you to pick this class with these skills and do exactly what they tell you to do the entire game or you're a ****ing noob. - At current there not as many players, but I think that stems from the two issues stated above (lack of needed info and people being jerks). This results in a longer time in queue, but not too bad.			"

												This is a great game for its price. This is essenentially a squad based RTS game where you follow the story of Tyler  Hunt and some other marines to discover what happened to a colony on Mars. The story itself isn't what drew me in to really like this game though. I haven't even finished the story yet because I have been having such a good time just playing the multiplayer with the stellar community.Now I'v played the multiplayer for about 50 hours at this point and that is primarily playing as only one of seven classes available. In multiplayer you and 7 other members of your team work to complete missions and fight off hordes of monsters as you travel across a large map discovering what happened to Tyler Hunt and finding valuable loot to make you or your team stronger. Each multiplayer mission lasts about 40-50 minutes assuming your squad doesn't all die earlier in the mission. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a co-op squad based RTS experience because the multiplayer is where this game really shines.			"

								Early Access Review (Subject to change) *videos coming up tomrrow*The game is a 8 player coop mission/objective rts style shooter with marines shooting down enemies that are infected with a virus, The gameplay is very similar to past mods from warcraft/starcraft called night of the dead except it is a very well done and solid carbon copy with a few bugs here and there that will need polishing up of course.This game is fun with 8 friends if you have them but is challenging and still as much fun with 8 random competent people. Communication is the key to survival in this game using skype or teamspeak whatever you can, or if you have a leader that actually can lead the entire group by giving directions and having the team listen. Hopefully a public voice chat of some kind is included in the future. The game offers at the moment one map with 2 different mode, the story mode with objectives and missions which are all randomized content where you'll want to complete as much as possible surviving on just one life  before you the timer which is about an hour hits 0 and your group gets overrun, also included is bunker mode where you'll defend a beacon and if it gets destroyed its game over however you can respawn every 30 seconds. The game also has 8 classes at the moment with a leveling system to unlock each one. Also each class has different abilities, skills, and weapons that you will want to use to your advantage. (as a group we've yet to beat the game yet lol but we are working on it)When starting up, players are introduced with a prologue  tutorial that teaches the player to the nice and clean interface along with how to use your abilities, levleing up, and your bread and butter skills which is flare, running, and autoaim. Very easy to learn if you have any hands on Rts at all.There are plenty of destructable objects in the environments with plenty of stuff to loot, generators to turn on and enemies to gun down. The game also has friendly fire with certain skills and explosives  so be careful where you call those napalm strikes or blowing up certain things because you might accidently shoot your teamate down. You'll be required to work together with those skills and passives to work on turning on radar, disabling enemy artillery from insurgents, or killing boss infecteds while conserving ammo by looting and exploring  and doing your best to use all items to your advantage from mines to rockets, to even turrets you can turn on or placeOther than that the bugs we discovered so far are not game breaking and the game plays pretty fun and solid for the time being. I found the game very exciting with a group of friends over teamspeak where we were trying to learn it and died to such dumb little things but this game is hard, REAL HARD even with the difficulty at easy so prepare yourself! We picked up plenty of pugs and had fun+ Massive hands on by the dev, Great interaction between dev and community+ This game isn't easy, I LOVE IT, prepare to get owned.+ Decent voice acting to give you the immersion and story of whats going on.+ Nicely done tutorial to introduce new players+ The gameplay is very fun especially when you have the right group+ A decent array of weapons and skills during set up phase (Need some polishing)+ Graphics is quite decent+  sound and music when you do hear it, gets you pumped for some of the action at the right time.+ A decent array of abilities for the classes that you can put points in during battle or reinvest.- Friendly Fire can be a dangerous thing, especially if someone goes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and wants to wipe the entire group out lol. A rep system would be nice.- Not really game breaking bugs but just wanted to put it here they exist so game needs a bit polish- Needs some polishing on class skills and balance.- A nice tune during the game so that it isnt completely silent the entire game, not too loud though lol- More maps!, Other planets, underground facilities and open areas. Can't wait to see what you guys come up with- Public mic communication would be nice!- Some type of drop in the game system so others can join while game is in session perhaps?*Gameplay Videos - working on it**Video review - Reserved till full game is released			"

								If you've played NOTD or SWAT for Warcraft 3, you should find yourself at home with this difficult yet rewarding team survival title.If you haven't, you're going to die. Alot. And that's okay, the game is very much about sticking together, learning together and more often than not, dying together. This is a coop experience through and through.The bugs aren't gamebreaking and the devs keep the community relatively up to date on patches and upcoming changes. The controls, while complicated at first, become quite intuitive. You'll see what I mean when you've got a swarm of baddies on your squad's♥♥♥♥♥and your only recourse is a well placed satchel. When there's nothing left behind you except a pile of burning, dismembered alien corpses, you'll know that that sticking, learning and dying together paid off. And your squadmates will remember you for it.			"

												Very fun game alot of replayability for the price.  The game has a top down perspective with a rotatable camera, and is played via hot keys and issuing move and shoot commands via the mouse.  It plays akin to some custom games from war 3, and is reminiscent in how it feels playing to some of the old action games of the past like gauntlet and the like.  This game is hyper focused on team work, while certain classes and loadouts can get by soloing for a bit, everyone ends up having to group for surival.  Managing your ammo, explosives, CDs, and working as a team are the keys to this game.  Failing at any of those means death.  Game truly shines in multiplayer but the singleplayer isn't bad and helps you get used to the game via its tactical mode that lets your slow everything down.  Multiplayer of course doesn't use that though.  There are of course some negatives, the voice acting work in this game is really really bad, thankfully there isn't much of it.  There are also some poor ability descriptions leading to easy misunderstanding of how some things function.  There are also a few bugs (currently) that while not game breaking can be a slight annoyance.Still though I would reccomend picking this game up, its not an expensive game, and its certainly worth the cost for the hours you will get out of it.

												I have been cheking on this game for a while. Then I bought it on a sale.. And after like half an hour of playing I realized that I have found something I have been looking for for many years.Remember Alien Swarm, Alien Breed, etc.? Ever felt like it would be nice to just shoot monsters in a sci-fi NON FPS setting? Have some co-op fun with friends or strangers?Well this is the answer.I have not played the spiritual predecessors. But man! It took me hours of playing and some reading to find out that this game is brilliant. A big map with lots of different enemies, loot, skills, character customization, quests, mini quests.. and all put together in a fitting frame. And at last it is challenging enough to keep you playing.Did I mention optional bots, followers, side quests, different game modes?TBH I expected less than half that it offers, and I could have settled for even less. I am still kinda surprised.Did I mention bosses? Or legendary item drops?Point is that there is everything you ever wanted or found out for a game like this. And a lot more.Did I mention they are just testing to add a new weapon for more cutomization? And that there are more maps than I care to try. I didn't even expect to play on more than one since it is like a sandbox frame, the replayability is already there with that one single map.There is only one downside.. not too many people. I manage to get full groups going in a few mins but still. Good thing it is fun to play with 2-3 ppl as well;) [Did I mention co-op Bots?]It is the very best there is in the genre. If you are into this kind of game so much to♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself to read my review than you really should do yourself the favor and buy it.Did I mention that the community is strangely enough pretty good, and the learning curve is very rewarding even if you die a few times early in the game first?10/10 Have not seen anything near as good as this game since C64 that is comparable in terms of gameplay.

												This game is one of the most difficult games I have played so far. It features immense tactical depth and requires constant communication with your teammates (so Teamspeak or anything similar is almost mandatory).While the above may be harsh and frustrating sometimes it becomes incredibly rewarding, should you manage to finish a mission with zero casualties and all objectives completed.Would I recommend this game? AbsolutelyAre there any downsides? Well, the controls take a while to get used to and the playerbase is not the biggest there is. Nonetheless I always manage to find an open lobby and the community is very friendly towards new players.			"

For that niche group looking for tactical/ sci-fi, think of Breach & Clear meets Alien Swarm (idk you might have to be fairly niche to have played either of those games). There is nothing more erotic than setting up and watching my squad of power-armored space SOF conducting bounding overwatch, or hook-cross clearing room, while firing at hordes of zombie-alien things in slo-mo.

												Since there are plenty reviews explain game's mechanic, I'll try to keep this short. Overall, TRS is a solid top down tactical survial shooting game. Due to the ""tactical"" element and a steep learning curve, the best gaming experience you get from this game is the fruition of the ability to cooperate, adapt, follow and understand the ""order"" of the team leader (experienced vet).TRS is quiet unforgiving for rookies, so the willingness to learn and stick with the game is a necessity. In order to prevent the unfair random-kicking in multiplayer mode and the risk of losing game due to the lack of knowledge on game's mechanic, I wholeheartedly recommend everyone (intent to play---casually playing----intent to be a pro):-Try the single player mode (for the tutorial mainly). It has a pretty good storyline.-Read those ""Everything"" guides by Bonzai101, Valore and Grizzly. (You're gonna be surprised by the amount of knowledge you may learn/miss out). Check out those in-depths about classes and game mechanics (leadership).-Get TeamSpeak (an app similar to RaidCall). ""Why"", you asked? Well, the best way to learn a game is by playing it. And it's good to have somebody with experience to explain/help through the preparation and ingame if you decide to skip reading the guides. Mic is not required, vet only need you to listen and understand.The code to the TRS community server is: ts.com-game.de+ Inevitably, there are good and bad players. Some will assist you, some just downright ignore or troll you to oblivion; but the majority of the player base will help you with welcome arms.-One last thing, invite your friend or introduce it to somebody closed to you. The biggest problem with TRS right now is lack of player. The community is too small at the moment.Well, That's all I have to say. I mostly play as Heavy Support, never get around to learn being a leader, cuz i enjoy being a slow♥♥♥♥♥supportive follower using a minigun to slow♥♥♥♥♥♥down and let people do the rest. And I'm still pretty ""new""to the game, despite 100+ hrs clock-in.			"

												The Red Solstice is a top down, strategy shooter that plays like a blend of quality custom Starcraft 2 maps and Alien Swarm. It pits you and up to 7 other Human controlled marines against hordes of the monstrosities created by the STROL virus. To survive and complete your objective you must work with your teamates,scavenging materials, making plans for the hectic closing moments of a match, and dispatching the various dangers you will encounter during your stay at Tharsis colony. A Typical match of The Red Solstice can last around an hour, so do not expect the typical drop in drop out style multiplayer that many games today utilize. keep this in mind when you put aside time to play the game.I would like to mention that this game is hard, and can be incredibly brutal at times. Excpect to die quite often as a new player, so don't feel put off by it, it happens to everyone. Despite the difficulty, failure still nets class and account experience for you rendering even a loss into meaningful progress of both in game XP as well as real life player skill. To help alleviate the difficulty for newcomers, a certain ammount of free automatic respawns are granted to players below a certain rank. Additionally, players seeking assistance can ask both the developers and the community for advice as this game has some of the most active devs and most helpful community members of any game I have ever played. The community has also prepared a variety of guides that cover almost every aspect of the game with an incredible ammount of detail, I highly recommend new players look over these.In conclusion, The Red Solstice is a very unique, and very fun game. It offers a large ammount of replayabillity in the multiplayer modes and a good ammount of content aimed at those who prefer single player activities. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone willing to give it the modicum of patience required to learn its particular nuances.			"

												Review Edit.So Red Solstice what is it? It's a top down against all odds genre. Think Alien Swarm with RPG mechanics thrown into it. You get some pretty interesting ""Weapons and class's to choose from""And the skills seem to have a designed sense of purpose not like alot of other games where you mash the keyboard when hell breaks lose and somehow you survive.This game isnt that game you need to choose your kit wisely, and you also need to get familiar with the levels, tactics and your class what limitations are in place for each class and weapon to have a successful outcome.The game is has a learning curve, but once you pick up the basics it keeps you locked in for a many hours. You do however want to be aware that since this game doesn't seem to have a huge following yet it is recommended you have friends play with you or buy the game as to be honest you can spend a bit of time waiting for matches.But if you're like me and you have some note worthy friends who enjoy dying often then yes this game is for you.Is it worth 20$ i'd have to yes they update often and they developers stay true to the concept and are constantly balancing and tweaking various game mechanics to keep the game fun. Also they have some pretty interesting holiday events like SANTACLAWS?.			"

												An offspring of the original NOTD:AM,SO,SWAT game in Warcraft 3. The Red Solstice is an 8 player tactical, co-op objective based top down shooter. You are one of the black ops unit send in to Mars to investigate and contain a virus outbreak. You'll be pitted against hordes of infected on a desolate planet scouring for ammo, weapons, medical supplies while racing against time to complete your mission objectives and boss fights.The game features a variety of combat classes to choose from such as assault, heavy support, recon, demolition, medic, terminator, marksman & hellfire. Players are able to level up their classes to gain additional skills & stats as they progress further into the game. If you're a fan of Alien Swarm or NOTD get this game. Word of warning though this game is extremely challenging and requires quite a bit of strategic planning and teamwork if you wish to survive.			"

												Personally I really enjoy this game when playing with a group of serious players on the hardest difficulty.Is this game for you?To really enjoy this game, you need to be a team player. When you start playing, you need to listen to more experienced people and learn from them. This is not a game for you to run around trying to be a hero, you will die, and get people killed.This game does have lots of little tips and tricks you learn that are the difference between clutching a victory on Soldier difficulty (2/4) and breezing a a win on Aetriden difficulty(4/4). The people running around in circles on autofire are the ones doomed to soldier forever, then they get made at the game for requiring they actually learn something to win.The game is somewhat repetative, there are 6 maps, ranging in difficultly and layout, with more planned as free content expansions, none of this paid dlc stuff. There are two primary storylines that can spawn, and a dozen or so secondary missions that spawn randomly through out each play through, certain secondaries are locked until your are in a group that is higher rank as they are more difficult, such as the Eye of the Storm mission. However the replayability comes from this random element, as well as trying to beat the game's current most difficult map, Military sector on Aetriden difficulty, which has currently only been beaten once!Some people complain about the 'toxic' community on this game, well I believe I am one of those 'toxic' players apparently, because I require people in my games to be on teamspeak. The reason for this is simple, I play higher difficulty games and there is no time to type everything I need to tell you through out the game. Winning Veteran+ difficulty is extremely unlikely when not on teamspeak because not being able to hear the leaders instructions leads to small mistakes, which lead to deaths. As for the moderation of TS, I've seen 1 ban in the last 2 months, and that was someone trying to be disruptive and harassing the community.The game has a few problems, desync is an issue sometimes, there are some other glitches too, however the developers are highly active within the community, to the point one is online on teamspeak almost every day listening to feedback, and if anyone is having any issues. Some bugs were creating in recent patches, and fixed almost immediately. Others have been around longer but are much more complicated issues that are hard to fix without breaking everything around it, or are inconsistent and difficult to replicate and pinpoint.All in all, I'd give TRS an 8/10 as it stands right now, and that's trying to be highly critical of it. Most games I see coming out would be lucky to reach 6+. However, this game is not worth you buying it if you don't want to invest time and effort into learning it and getting good, you'll just end up out of pocket, upset and writing a bad review here or being an actual toxic player within the community. If you are willing to invest into this game however, endless hours of sweat, tears and laughter await you, just beware the levi in the bush!			"

								This game is very promissing and  could develop to a realy nice team-play game. Still it is an alpha and because of that it kind of lacks people who play it sometimes. So it might be difficult to find a game with a good ping. However, i would recommend playing it and helping the devs to improve the game further and hope that the player base grows.			"

												Playing @ lvl1 is about as much fun as watching paint dry.As the newbie, you are the slowest, that's why you die first and then you get to sit and watch for the rest of the ""game"".You also need a lot of pre-knowledge about every single piece of equipment, because if you take your time to read the description desperately trying to find out how to use obscure explosive item #352 you are already dead.Despite all that crap, you are a masochist and like to tear down walls by bashing your head against it?Get ready for 25 levels of grind.Plus another 10 levels of grind per class.Just find a game, get killed and let the ""game"" run in the background.It's the best screensaver you have ever bought.

												I can only review this from the standpoint of somebody just looking for some pick-up and play fun and sadly it did not provide that.I'm sure if you absolutely live for top-down space shooters like this then it will be for you but personally I would say this game isn't in the same league as something like the fantastic Alien Swarm (which is free!).

								All i can say is that this game kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ :) though thats what i hear is its ""thing"" its meant to be hard.. and they did a good job at that.. I wouldnt play it online with people i dont know, or with a buddy, but if you have 4-8 buddies online you can coordinate with, it would be a great tactical top-down shooter.. Im going to not put it on recommendation for the fact that you do need a pre-set group.. not because its a bad game, but just because it will be hard for a casual player to hop in and out			"

								*****ALERT! THIS USER IS NOT A ENGLISH SPEAKER! SORRY FOR ANY BAD ENGLISH*****There is no attribute points or skill points that you can spend if you ""level up"" in this game. The game is more likely a sci-fri version of LOL (league of legends) with a lot fewer heros. Well, you can spend your ""skill points"" in every round, but will be reset when round ended.  (THOUGH YOU CAN GET A PERMANENT ""RANK UP"" WHEN YOU GOT ENOUGH EXP, BUT IT ONLY INCREASE YOUR HP, SPEED,ETC. WHICH ARE FIXED.)And it doesn't like any rpg which by killing some random npc, you can get some loots. In this game, the statistic, the weapons, the armor, etc are fixed. That means that all player get the same look, same weapon, same stat, etc if  they choose the same class in the same level. I was expecting the game was at least similar to the DOW 2. (Warhammer 40k: DAWN OF WAR2)If you are expecting the game was similar to DIABLO with future weapon or Alien Swarm, just like what I thought, don't buy this game, and you will find it totally different. I come from Hong Kong and I find it is very difficult to find a server. The server room is always empty. If you are lucky, you may find a room, but in most case, I got kicked because my character's level is too low. And my character's level is low because I cannot find a room....... What is more, if you don't have many friends, like me, don't buy this game yet, save your money.This game may get better in the future, but I wouldn't recomend to buy it at this stage.(2014/8/21)			"

												The game is fun, simple to pick up and understand, takes some practice to effectively use the more complex or slower classes. the community is fairly serious, but not toxic as many claim. everyone should PLAY THE SINGLEPLAYER first, and be willing to communicate with your team in multiplayer, or it wil end VERY badly for you, and you may be blamed by your team, as it was likely largely the fault of anyone who treats it like a singleplayer game when playing multiplayer. so far everyone ive met trys multiple times to help new players; regardless of teamspeak (though they do try to get you to join it, and it makes it more enjoyable for all to be honest) the game and gameplay are quite fun, neat atmoshere and the people are alright by and large. great game.

Grab a 4-pack and 3 (or up to 7!) friends and enjoy, especially while it's 40% off.There's a lot of replayability and you're sure to find a class you like. I prefer medic and assault, myself. A decent amount of bugs 'cause it's alpha/beta, but that's to be expected and the devs are paying attention and looking into it! A challenging and enjoyable tactical co-op shooter.(Note: You can only play with 6 other people this patch due to a bug that kicks the 8th player out of the game lobby. I believe the devs have looked into it and are going to fix it next patch.)			"

												A fun little game.  Controls like an RTS so if you're a fan of games that control like League of Legends, Dota, or mods of other RTS games where you have one powerful hero, then you'll like it.  The voice acting is a bit flat and while a fun little game, I would recommend playing it with friends or other people rather than by yourself.  As the game can get a bit repetitive with just following waypoints and the occasional hold your ground segments.			"

								This game, is truelly amazing! It involves a lot of teamplay and skill, however it may not look like it at first sight.The game is about a marine squad that's exploring a planet, Mars (The Red Planet). And there they find out that there's an infestation going on, which probably is caused by a failed experiment, or succeeded one? Who knows?You are in a team of up to 8 marines, trying to stop it, by either doing, missions, which are divided in a primary questline, and side quests. There are lots of waves, each wave obviously is stronger. You might just as well die, or run out of ammo? For that not to happen, you must also loot a little, since you can loot buildings etc, for ammo, medkits, and other random supplies. When you don't think you can survive any longer, you can get an evac, from on a certain wave (The wave at which it gets available is different for each difficulty). The evac is an item you can find on the map, and when you've got it you can activate it to evacuate, then you'll have to protect the person who activated it for 2 minutes, (he/she can move). When the 2 minutes are over the Dropship comes in for evacuation after another minute, but then you'll no longer have to protect the person who was calling the evac. I hope this review is helpfulish.... SIdenote: This is more a summary really....			"

												Red Solstice is a game that encourages grinding and memorization of map objectives (and it does this even over teamwork) in order to succeed.Typical games result in 1k - 2k experience for your selected class, and it takes about 10-20k experience to gain one rank in the suit (1% speed, critical rating, that sort of thing). Considering the number of classes there are and there are like 10 ranks in each suit, that is a lot of grinding.Victory leads to 5k - 6k experience but if you're a new player that will come to you few and far between. And being that each game typically consumes 40 minutes or more, it will still take a considerable amount of time to max out the suit of your preference.Red Solstice CAN be fun, but the combat tends to be a little bit less entertaining than I was hoping for. I play with auto-targeting for the most part and that actually takes a lot of the fun out of the genre, but necessary, because manual targeting isn't effective enough to take out the swarming armies the AI decides to throw at you.Game has a tiny community, average at best. Multiiplayer games can take some time to fill (for a newish game).Art can be hit or miss (portraits). No major complaints, but there isn't enough emphasis on the ""cool"" element of manning state-of-the-art space marine body armor running around gunning or torching down alien zombies. I don't ""feel"" it. Far fetched hope that this will be fixed. "

												This is a squad based tactical game that is for a new player difficult to master. Get ready to die a lot while playing because it's extremely easy to die.  The nice thing is that when you finally beat this game you will feel a real sense of accomplishment.  Currently there aren't really that many players playing.  However if you have some patience and do get to jump into a game, you will play with some really great people.  Many of my friends list people are from this game.This game doesn't require a high APM at all. As I said earlier this is a team tactical game where each class contributes to the overall survival of your group.  Although if you do have a high APM the game will be easier to pick up.  I have personally been playing this game for over 2 years with (currently) about 700 hours played.  This has been my go to game for entertainment whenever I don't know what to play.  Each and every game is different from the last since you there are multiple game modes to play on with different maps.  Difficulties also change up the gameplay as well.  Many different classes to play that all do completely different things and plays different roles. Here's my latest gameplay video:

												Great game, just needs more people playing. Lots of modes and lots of unlocks. Zombie/Alien wave survival game.. Reminds me a lot of an old Warcraft III map I played all the time.Objective based for the most part, all the problems of multiplayer are still there. Games seem to take about 40 minutes to play, which isn't greeeeat but it makes for pretty epic battles.			"

												Having fixed my issue (related it seems to nVidia Optimus -- turned off, and now I can more reliably get into the game), I would recommend this game, though still with some reservations, as it is pretty buggy.The game, when running properly, is enjoyable, has a good skill tree, good balance of planning, strategy, and tactics.The game is also very challenging.  Playing Survival or Multiplayer maps, you can expect to lose, over and over again.  Team play is very important, and it takes a while to get the hang of proper tactics and skill usage.(As of August 2016)  The community is pretty tolerant, so when starting out in Multiplayer, just listen to the leader, follow the lines drawn, and (try to) fill your role, and you'll eventually get the hang of it.There do remain a number of detriments to the game, however.  In Survival (and in Multiplayer, if not filling a team with real people), you control one character, and can swap between characters.  For some reason, the key mapping for swapping and issuing commands is different between the single player storyline (where it starts with a basic tutorial of how to manage this) than it is from Survival/Multi.  Also, you can issue commands to multiple characters to carry out concurrently, just don't be surprised when the character you aren't currently swapped into decides to just wander off or stop halfway through his queued command.In addition, there are quite a few latency/sync bugs in multiplayer.  Be prepared to encounter unkillable enemies when what you're firing at isn't in sync with the server (though, of course, they can still damage you).  Also, skills sometimes just don't take effect.  (This bug I've noticed most with the Medic, which is pretty sucky, when you need health or to remove an ailment, and you simply can't.)So, if you can bear the (more than) occasional frustrations, or just plan to play through the single player campaign (which is good), then I would recommend this game.[Obsolete - Fixed now, in my case]However, the bulk of the game is Submit Crash Report.  It started that I would have to do multiple attempts to load the game, submitting 2 crash reports before finally getting in on the 3rd try.  That eventually degraded, to 4 or more attempts, and occasional reboots to get it working.After Windows 10 build update (from 8/2/2016), the game is more unstable than ever.  Before, once *finally* in, I could at least play.  Now that's not a given.  Enemies will sometimes render incorrectly, the game will sometimes crash out.[Obsolete - Fixed now, in my case]Since you have to grind XP to improve your characters, it becomes especially frustrating, as this means your reward for doing well is stolen XP and getting to look at your desktop again...

								You move by right-clicking on the spot, you left-click to attack, and it has an ""auto-fire"" option which will shoot at enemies automatically, with a small penalty.No campaign, no lobbies (so far, at least) leveling system seems to be circumventable by picking a different class. -BTW, no real way to make apparent that you CAN switch suits-I had to play the intro mission twice before I could realize that, no, the mission hadn't crashed and yes, I had beaten the mission.While I understand that the game is pre-release, I simply don't like the mechanics. I guess I was hoping for something closer to Alien Swarm, instead of a passive ""place marine here"".I feel that taking control away from the player to this degree on tactical and survival missions works against the idea. It might make the game more stable, but it also makes it mroe boring.Overall, it felt like a waste of money.			"

												I know that negative reviews are unpopular and it seems like everyone really likes this title a lot; but I just didn't have a very good time playing The Red Solstice. It looks really good graphics-wise, sounds great and has a lot of classes/weapons to choose from but the multiplayer campaign was just too long for me and I just didn't feel any connection to what my character was doing on the screen. When I died it was due to friendly fire (are you kidding me) and I had to sit the entire rest of the round out until everyone else wiped. This game absolutely is geared towards gamers that are big into long, technical campaigns and that is totally cool it has it's place I just don't think it's for everyone.It's still very much a pre-release title and maybe with some proper balancing and tweaks it could be more fun.I was provided press access to The Red Solstice and was not compensated any other way for my review. My opinions are my own.			"

								Could be fun but there are some major issues. There's barely any ammo to be found, and you start with almost none. Therefore, 99.9% of all your gameplay time is spent trying to race other players to whatever ammo there is to find, and good luck unless you have the proper class. For some reason if you reload you lose almost all your ammo. In addition, your teamates end up killing you about 1 out of 3 rounds. Not fun when you have to have a full squad or you have no hope of lasting more than a few minutes. And finally, steam will not allow you to buy another copy of this game to gift if you already own it. So much for treating your friends.			"

												I'm not sure how to write a review for this game. I like it. It's hard. It's easy to tell bad players from good ones. It's so hard that even good players have trouble completing games on the higher difficulties.The community is not as small as people are making it out to be. It has grown to the point where I would have no problems logging in and finding a game with very few players from my friend list in it.  The experienced players are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s - but, that's because ""you"" have 30 hours in the game, decided to join their Aetriden lobby, and proceeded to do whatever you wanted, getting the team wiped in the process.It goes back to my earlier point of this game being super hard (I'm emphasizing difficulty, cus this game is THAT FUKCKING HARD) Newbies who don't listen make it harder. I know, because I still AM ones of said newbies. looolAnyway 8.5/10Cheap game. Hard as ♥♥♥♥. Excellent atmosphere. "

								Where to start?Yes it's Beta, yes it's rough around the edges. It crashes every once in a while, the matchmaker is currently a tad instable but the developers made a game you want to play anyways.Like the Warhammer 40k feeling? Like Space Marines or ""Starship Troopers""? Like a challenging game? Like Teamplay? Remember Alien Swarm, Alien Breed or Space Siege?Then TRS is most likely for you.You:- get to choose from various classes and can save loadouts.- gain character and class experience.- you unlock classes, boosts, weapons and skills with your class level.- can take a few skills, a few boosts and various primary and secondary weapons with you on the battlefield.- loot tons of stuff on the map from barricades to nukes.- currently choose from multiple game settings, doing missions or bunker (defending a beacon) or mix it.- can command your squad with easy map commands.- die. mostly. either because the guy next to you felt it necessary to run with 10 ammo crates and watch you die out of ammo, or because you get blown up by team mates, or better yet, they deploy their drop-pods right on you :DOne note: There's no WSAD movement. It's click'n'run.At first it felt odd, but once you got your awesome dude running you got to switch weapons and firing modes, throw flares, use your skills, drop satchels and blow them and whatnot. After some hours on the clock I feel it was a good choise not to use WSAD. It lets you focus on the important stuff.YMMV.			"

												The Red Solstice struggles to make multiplayer reliably fun. The objectives are strung along to frustrate players into hoping they have enough gear, ammo, and patience to withstand a non-negotiable 45 minute bullet spam session. While a nearly hour long bullet frenzy is usually the hallmark of excellence in a tactical isometric view shooter, The Red Solstace does not cater to objective based play styles.Each objective is given with a real world time frame, which enhances a strong narrative. Sadly the game does not support those players who head directly to each objective and accomplishes each task as the game asked. It is a game for a generation of video gamer who get distracted by shiny new things, who want to clear the entire map before moving to the next waypoint, and who don't care that the waves of monsters increase in difficulty as the time dwindles.The Red Solstace becomes just another mindless shooter that ignores the very cool world that it tries to setup at the beginning of each mission. Run, shoot, survive should be the tagline - but instead it is more like meander, shoot, constantly fail because ♥♥♥♥ you. It does not care about how good a player is or how effectively and quickly a player may finish what the game asked it to do because it has another agenda as a moody shooter that wants to make a tactical horror shooter with scarce resources (while providing WAY too many resources).The Red Solstace doesn't know what it wants to be. It struggles to be a game while also failing to provide an immersive story experience. It has a genuinely great random mission generation system that is a thin veneer of reasons to drag players across each map and hope they die later with each play through. The Red Solstace is, ultimately, a very well polished frustration engine that just wants your $20 and a few hours of your time so you can infect your friends' Steam Libraries with this awful piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This game was okay, but that's all it was. It wasn't excellent nor was it bad, but the reason I wouldn't recommend this game is because I have already played this. On Starcraft 2. This game is based on The Rising Dead custom map from the arcade section on the popular RTS, but like the game its based on -- the same problem persists: low player base. Not only that, but this felt like a reiteration of the game on a different engine, standalone, with a singleplayer campaign and a few nifty things added. There is the vision concept where its harder to shoot in the dark which is neat. The manual aiming was also neat with the bonus damage it gave, but was a little iffy in that you had to aim a little bit more up to compensate for the slightly angled top-down view.Sadly, these things aren't enough to distinguish itself as a separate game, and in all honesty, I would rather refund this game and play the Starcraft 2 version where the character movements aren't as stiff.

								This game has been a huge surprise for me.I am a huge fan of cooperative games, i bought this game during early access because it looked promising.I forgot about it until was fully released and this has been a blast.-It has a strong Space meuhrins feel.-many classes that all contribute to victory in their own way, and they are fairly balanced.-The game seemed simple at first but it is actually incredibly deep, one of the deepest coop game i know of.-The Ai is unforgiving and you will get a good challenge even on normal difficulty.-It has many skill to choose from for each class and kind of a dota way of leveling up.-You get 15 level max while you are playing and you have to attribute point carefully in each of your 4 skills with 5 points max in each, some are passive some are active, and hallow you to play exactly the way you want.-The online is one of the best i know of, most people are friendly and most veteran will not mind giving you some advice.In 50 hours of gameplay i have yet to find any troll.The only downside i can see is that the game can seem overwhelming at first, the learning curve is steep and the RTS view will not be to everyone's liking, except that it is a masterpiece and i strongly recommend this game.

http://steamcharts.com/app/265590The game has single player modes now so at least you can enjoy the game somewhat when you cant find anyone online playing. Which sadly is more then half the time for me, despite the fact that the game launched this month. At least click the steam chart above and get an idea of what you are getting into. The game can be fun, but unless the community grows I just could not recomend it, I am hopefull though. In a side note, I came back to play this for a few hours last week after playing a game called helldivers that weekend. And ultimatly asked myself if the potential of the red solstice outweighed the amazing, and fun filled hours I had playing HellDivers. And the games are similar enough to me that less then a minute into this question I uninstalled TRS. I would like to say I might come back one day but the sad reality is. I found another game that scratches the same itch this one does, only better, is alot more fun for me, is 5 bucks cheaper, and I think has more potential...either way its a hell of alot more fun. I wish the devs and the small community well though, I think you guys are going to need it.			"

												My first refund of a game. It is a genre I would be able to get into if the RPG elements were different. What ended the game's interest for me was seeing the inactivity of cooperative gameplay. I was most moved by a classic-styled game I  could play with others but I haven't been able to find people to play with.It hearkens back to the Warcraft/Starcraft classics, love em but I can't get into them the way I could years ago. If that's what you're looking for and you go in on it with some friends especially, you will not be disappointed!			"

												This game is awful.  The interface is counterintuitive, and the gameplay is so robo-driven that you're really not DOING anything.  Ammo is scarce, yet enemies spawn infinitely.  The objectives are unclear especially towards the end of the mission when we are often killed by a falling meteor and have no idea what we did wrong.  We had accomplished every objective in a fairly timely fashion.			"

												It may not be the prettiest/best sounding/polished game out there, but it is still one of my favorite games that I have played and will most likely continue playing it for some time. Most games these days lack depth, difficulty, and other elements that exist in The Red Solstice, which is what I’m looking for in games.While the survival mode of the game is fun to play over and over, the single player story mode campaign needs some work. As I played through it, it felt like the developers kept getting lazier and lazier with the level designs, and it didn’t help that it was comprised of repurposed survival mode maps. The main thing that I didn’t like was that most levels had equipment and weapons hidden in areas that would unlock them for future missions, and while looking for and finding them were fun, the design of maps didn’t work well for this. Many maps were too big and, while most areas were zoned off so you couldn’t explore the entirety of large maps, some weren’t blocked off so I didn’t know if it was a mistake or I should waste hours going around and searching every single building since there might be something in one of them. There are no indicators of whether you’ve found everything in a map, so you either have to look it up online somewhere or search every mission over and over until you find everything.Another thing that I would like to see getting some polish is making the AI characters do more than just follow you around. It is nice to completely control them, but at the same time they need to be able to do more on their own than just follow you and shoot. Sometimes they won’t even shoot at enemies, especially when you tell them to go pick up and item or do something else.Video of some gameplay:

								It's fun but at the moment I cannot say I recommend this because it's a little user unfriendly and it's unstable to the point where various actions (starting it up, changing settings, leaving a game, and refreshing the game list) cause the game to crash. Hold off a few months if you're thinking about buying this to see if the crashes get fixed and the UI is better.			"

												The Red Solstice is a tactical, squad-based survival game set in the distant future on Mars, playable in single-player or with up to 8 players in cooperative online multiplayer.  Roam freely over huge maps, complete randomized objectives and deal with surprise events that keep you on the edge of your seat.			"

												In The Red Solstice, human life is now located on Mars due to a plague that ran rampant across the Earth. Essentially, the plague turned human beings into monsters. The Capital city of the new colony on Mars is known as Tharsis, and all communications have been lost due to a particularly nasty dust devil referred as The Red Solstice Event. Eight space marines have been dispatched to uncover what has happened due to the loss of all communications with Tharsis.Click this link to read the full Review:http://www.gamerheadlines.com/reviews/the-red-solstice/ "

												So...the Red Solstice... It was a coincidence when I stumbled upon this EA on Steam. I've made some bad decisions concerning EA-Titles in the last couple of months, but luckily not with this one.Although the Game is quite hard and unforgiving, the Community isn't. The People playing this Game are eager to help you if you're new to it. I'd still recommend you to read a Guide, before you blow up your fellow Marines by accident (I assure you, it will happen anyhow ^^)It still takes some time until you can get a full round with 8 People running, because there aren't that many players around. I hope the community will grow; the Game would deserve it. Sometimes there are occasional Framerate slowdowns, but it has gotten better.So if you're fond of intense Bug-shooting mayhem and don't mind to learn and fulfill your part in a Squad, this might be just the Game for you.

												The Dark Souls of co-op gamesBut on a serious note this game is a difficult co-op of up to 8 players with a single player campaign to it also.  The Red Solstice has a steep learning curve for new players, and there is also a bit of a grind when coming to ranking up which essentially is just giving you a bonus to stats each time.  This game rewards good teamwork and punishes mercilessly bad teamwork.  They're plenty of in depth guides for new players and the community is pretty helpful in breaking you into the game.  I would advise having a teamspeak or something similar even if its just to listen due to the fast pace of this game.  You may notice at times desynch and bugs not gona lie it's nothing game breaking but it's defently noticable especially if you join a high ping host.  The player base has been revived so finding a match with others isn't nearly as hard plus it's got a single player now so waiting isn't really much of a problem anymore thankfully. That's not to say the playerbase won't leave in the future but for now it's doing well.As for gameplay this game features 8 different classes each with their own unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. During the gameplay you gain energy which can power these different abilites making them more potent or unlocking new ones.  Six different maps to choose from and a myriad of different monsters and bosses all eagerly awaiting to chew your face off.  They're 4 diifferent main difficulties from Recruit to Aetridan with 8 different sub difficutlies to add with it. The objective of the co-op aspect is to survive 15 waves of hellish creatures all the while doing objectives and scavenging for items to use. At the end of the last wave you are to complete the last objective and then evac to the a certain point of the map, on average a game winning match will last around an hour.  So would i recommend this game... hell yes i would.   I had a great time with it and if you're willing to work with people it's one of the most rewarding experiences beating the game with others			"

								This game has a lot of potential.... that being said it is extremely buggy currently. I get crashes trying to join  a game lobby, crashes on game start, crashes mid game, crashes at game end.... crashing all over the place.There are numerous other minor issues (class re-set when another player joins a game with your current class for example) and I would be willing to bet there are other problems that are unapparent.The mission tracking feature is confusing and it is difficult to understand what the current goal of team is. This is incredibly important in a game that hinges on team work.  This needs to be obvious or more user friendly.It is still a fairly fun experience though but I can't recommend it with out knowing if the developers are going to improve the game.			"

												Artificially made diffult with overwelming odds with the necessity to destroy ""tunnels"" with specific weaponry that is rare.  These ""tunnels"" are where mobs spawn from - but no matter if there is only 2 left or all of them - the number of mobs coming at you is always increasing and it is endless (no joke ENDLESS).   One would think if 90% of the ""tunnels"" are down - there should be a lot less mobs coming at you.Artifically made difficult so they can say 30 hour campaign? Not much strategy as there is only 1 way to get to your objectives - a pre scripted path.  Can''t easily use explosive weapons as the mobs are point blank hitting you and your explosions will kill your own men.On mission 2 i can't get beyond this a set of barricades that is swarming - even after 30 checkpoint restarts (and after 10 - you have to start the mission all over again - with the same dry scripted openings each mission.). A lot more fun / non frustrating games out there.			"

Early Access Review
								For the moment i can't recommand this game for everybody.Because...Instead of my last review [watch at the end of this one], i've won a game !This is amazing how good it is. Especially if you loose around 20 times before it ^^In fact the mission was different and, in my humble point of view, much better !All the team was droped from a space ship near a beacon.It must be protected until the end of a certain amount of enemy's waves.The beacon drops some supplies to help you in the battle, like sentry turrets, ammo and sand bags.All the difficulty was to build the defenses, set up traps, protect sentries and for me, keep the other guys alive until the end of days that came on us. And we made it ! I was a Medic as usual. After so much failures, i could start to upgrade my character.The upgrade system is really cool, for each class you have a rank and defines how long you played this class, so the higher the better...Skills wich increase with levels: at the beginning too few, but with few levels... oh my ! That's so good to place a resurecting beacon during a hellish mission ! You can even call orbital drops to give stuff to your comrades or activate buffs to the whole team.You have new weapons in two different types: primary and secondary. The primary weapons really changes your way to engage, as a Medic i can choose at high rank a sniper rifle, the basic weapon is a weak assault rifle. The secondary give you some shotguns and explosivs weapons like a rotary grenade launcher,ect.. Weapons are different between each classe. Medic: assault rifles. Demolisher: explosivs. Recon: smg. Heavy: minigun, ect...Your armor can be upgraded with 4 slots to receive some ""perks"". A bit complicate to use because each perks increase a statistic of the character but reduce an other one. You want to run faster ?allright but you will have less damages done... quite nasty :'(All of that is not too much to prepare yourself for the fire of the action.And this is really tought !As i said before you gonna die a lot. But winning is very rewarding. Like some few rares games like Arma or Dark Soul. Enemies are quite numerous and very violent. Every creature has stats (you can see them when you hover your mouse on them). The special events happens quite often, and a good planning is really rewarding, like using explosivs to make chain reactions and take down a boss or a huge horde of creature in one blow. But when your team is splitting... in general you won't stand a chance.Every classes needs skills to be mastered.As a Medic i needed quite some time to understand how to get exp correctly (missions or the most common slaving monsters to get xp). Xp give you the opportunity to increase the level of the skills you have choosen (you can only have 4).  The skill level is lost between each mission.And like many games, maps needs time to be understood because hunker in a building and defending is really difficult. Especially with the light system that influence the line of sight of the team and the accuracy for shooting enemies.So...This game is really good but really hard too with unfriendly players that doesn't give a sh... of what you say in game.It's a bit messy for now but with few updates... this is gonna be a gem !The Red Solstice is nice and needs to be played with friends.Alone you gonna hate it.So i recommand it for experienced player used to games really hardcore and ready to play with trusted fellow... for the others, wait a bit ^^.[Previous review: game not recommended]I was really disappointed. In the action you're just lost. You spend tons of time to search for gear in lockers. You always lack of something especially ammo. Shooting enemies is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥especially due to the fact that firing in automatic mode is useless (automatic mode= your monkey see smtg he shoots. The problem, after 3 meters you miss all the time).The objectives are ♥♥♥♥ed up. In fact you spend so much time in gearing that you can't see what you have to do. There is no order in objectives or obvious triggers. You will have an AI which talks all the time and disturbs you by the same occasion.In general in the game is like that (when you are a medic like me):-Clicking all the time on the screen to move sucks...-Shotgun ammo allready depleeed ?-Where is that dude? His health is dropping too fast, stop running away from the team damm it !-Why are we scavenging? There is a mission to do!-This auto aim sucks.-Please AI, shut your damm mouth!-Oh no! I've spent points in the wrong skill section...-This player is a bas... i doesn't want to give me some ammo.-More monsters. Where do they come from?-Ok righ... thanks for stealing the ammo I need!-WTF ?! We haven't done the objectives and we have to evac?!-It's crowed out here... I hope I will keep theses meat bags alive without ammo.-What he is doing?! The damm VIP is running into the danger![Dead]-This boss sucks.-Thanks for the help guys![Disconnected]Sorry but for the moment we can't play correctly because there is no way to prepare the attack or talk in game. For a tactical game it's a bit difficult to accept.So actually all games i've played failed, even in easy mode.I tried to do my best as a medic but seriously it doesn't appeal to take the role of support in this game. It seems more efficient to kill everything...And the controls are bad, moving should be with the keyboard.There is a great potential but actually the game is unplayable.And if you don't like this review, well... thank you ! Because with your help other players will be completely wrong about this game.And it's not because of Early access. I've changed some of my reviews in front of the state of the game...			"

								July 4th 2015. This game is a peice of crap. If you are thinking about playing this game, realize that you will be playing it with yourself. Ive been checking it out on and off since day one, hoping that they will update or fix it, but half the time, the game wont even start.  (July 13, 2004)    State of the game; Promising, but unstable.   This game touches on alot of diffent genres, and alot of different gamers will find enjoyment in this game. Its a MOBA; Its an RTS (you must change tactics and think on the fly constantly); Its an RPG; Its got waves of monsters; It has persistant ranks and perks like some FPS games. Play this game if you are patient with in-development games. Dont play it if a graphical UI bug ruins the whole game for you.      At this point, I can play for several hours with only a few crashes. BUuuuut the game loads so fast, that Im back in a game lobby 8 seconds later.    Game Lobbies:    Need work; this is where the patience comes in. sometimes you roll into a generically named match, and get booted for no reason (actual reason being, there are no solo games YET. some people want to be alone)      When looking at the game lobby, think. pre-starcraft gamepy-battle.net Warcraft lobby. with some more serious UI graphical gliches. A friend of mine said half the game list was pinched into itself, so 10 games were jumbled into a single line. He couldnt see my game. Or the fun one where your mouse pointer selects things a full inch above it on the selection screen and you join the wrong game, get kicked, then the game you wanted is full and non-joinable.    These are things they will change, and shouldnt be taken into consideration, when summarizing this games overall quality.  Yes, it has gameplay bugs, yes it has balance issues, yes, you will die ALOT.... BUT. the players are helpful, the developers update biweekly it seems, AND Im going to go play it right now, Despite writing all this			"

								This tactical top-down 8 player co-op survival game can be unforgiving at times.  The random objectives & maps kept things fresh and unpredictable, though the difficulty is incredibly unbalanced in my opinion.  While matches supposedly can last up to an hour, I found myself dying within five minutes...mainly due to the ""waves"" growing in difficulty at a ridiculous rate.  Eight different classes and the ability to level up/gain xp help to make up for that, though.  It needs some more work (obviously), but I'd be interested to see how the final product looks once the game goes live.

								being a notdso player, trd player, loving survivals; as hard as it is : this game is simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. there are so many great survial games out there, and this game literally messes up everything. bad UI, absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed up graphics, super bad gameplay. the main mechanics, along with the gameplay, are more difficult than they need they need to be, UI is very clumpy, gameplay in general is veeeery foucussed on shotguns  and conning. in general: this game has not much in common with the original notd. i would love to say this game is awesome, but it simply isn't. the controls are very messsed up, the complete game is focussed in conning, the complete game is VERY buggy. Neither the community nor the gameplay allow newbs to understand anything, the opposite: the creators made a game which is simply focussed on what they + a few veterans enjoy, nothing is left of the orginal NOTD spirit. less synergies, less focus om teamplay, all what counts is being is having high movementspeed and a shotgun. i cant' even say how boring the idea of this game is.everyone who wants real survival should rather stick to wc3 or sc2, both got good and balanced (and especially bug free!) survival games like night of the dead spec ops.there is no need to waste money for this game which is full of bugs and full of messed up survival basics, rather stick to the original games.Especially because atm it is just completely bugged. along with major lag and random game crashes  this game is just not worth playing it right now, better wait till atleast the stability is okay.

												This is a game I've come to really enjoy. Although singleplayer experiences are normally my thing, I couldn't bring myself to stick with this game's singleplayer campaign past completion of the first mission. However, the cooperative online mode is quite great. It's a bit tough, which is normally a turn-off for me, but the players in the online community are generally quite helpful and give lots of wonderful tips to success. I wouldn't call myself ""good"" at the game yet by any stretch of the word, but I know enough to be able to have fun and have a better idea of what's going on than I did when I started and was pretty clueless. The other players were really great despite my idiocy in this game.Long story short, you all drop down on a planet with funky zombie and xeno monsters, you have simple objectives without much going on plot-wise, and while you're running around completing objectives, the types of enemies are getting tougher and tougher. At first, you have time to get a lot done and try to gather up healing supplies and ammo, but later on, everything will be so hectic that you'll be trying to conserve ammo even more and things just keep getting more intense. Finally, if you live long enough, you can escape on a drop ship, and it feels pretty darn rewarding to survive when you're pretty new to the game. After each mission, you're awarded experience points which unlock skills and new classes, which is fun, though each mission often takes 45 minutes to an hour, so you do need a bit of time to play.Now comes the big downside to this game. It can be difficult to find people to play with. I've been online before in spurts of 5-10 minutes without a single game available to join, or a lobby trying to fill up desperately. It's quite sad because the game is fun, but it's not always reliable that you'll be able to play when you want to. I came very close to not recommending this game for this reason, but there are people who do play online, and I've had more times that people were online than weren't. With that in mind, I do recommend this game. I wish more folks played it, because it's different than many online cooperative games, and is a nice diamond in the rough.			"

After some rounds youll get an idea and get full joy of beating hordes of aliens and big fat bosses, during youre do your mission.+ a lot of diff. bosses+ 8 diff. Classes start with 3 and with level up youll get new ones)+ randomly generated missions with story line+ possibilty to use different weapons on different classes+ many game modesIt's an awesome game with cool and friendly community.Love It!

Don't expect to win any time soon as a group of newbies.There's a singleplayer story campaign too, but it doesn't seem all that popular.			"

								I give this a negative rating, not because its a bad game, it is actually quite good & fun (when you have a team). i give this a negative rating for the solo player. this game is zero SP at the early stages of the game, sure you can go in solo, but dont expect to last too long on easy, hopefully with future realeses there will be a solo campaign yet as it stands there isnt. the option for solo is grey'd out. This Game is alot like alien swarm, the FTP game steam released a few years ago, great game, yet too focused on MP and gets old quick, am sure this will follow suit with the community dimming down until there is no one to join a team with.  The thing is, Alien Swarm seemed to get it right where this game falls short in every category.			"

												I love story driven sp or coop campaigns with a rich backstory so I asked for a refund mid mission 2. There was an alien shooter long ago that did exactly this but was way more fun. If I could remember its name, I would have been playing that instead.Cons-The single-player campaign was horrendous. -I have to individually left click each enemy to attack when they spawn like crazy? No.-I have to right click and lift finger to move somewhere. I cant use wsad to move or keep the mouse clicked. No. Think of it in this way, Monster is coming, I have to move back or instantly change direction and also fire. In this game, I left click the monster, then right click a path. The tactical whatever to issue orders is nice but it adds complexity to something that should not be complex in the first place. It has been done properly before (If only I could remember that game's name).  Not worth the effort.-Cant see which doors are open or even if there is a door where you are facing. Developers must have noticed this as well since they implemented precise pathfinding. -Some kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ flashlight would be nice on an elite commando squad leader. -There are random supply crates around but you get meh stuff for every 10-15 crates opened. The rest is empty.-My squad ai just sucks. I would presume in a virus infested world, you wouldn't be hugging the squad leader all the time unless he specifically orders you not to.-I turn on the ingame lights but everything is always so dark (Except for a few places). I play every game fine with my current monitor setting so I don't see why I have to change it just for this game.-An elite commando who has to shoot gas canisters and barrels 4-5 times so they explode...? No.-Enemies in the first 2 levels are just...*sigh*-I found a merc armor which lowered my hp. I have no idea what its supposed to add as stats.Pros-Whatever the upvoting guys wrote, I suppose. They appear to have loved multiplayer with some guy boasting 500h+. -Tactical whatever where you assign orders to each member. "

												The story is ok but, your buying this for gameplay. Successful matches last between 20-50 minutes, all of it intense, squad coop, loot and run action. But don't worry about successes because your first game you will die, along with every game after until something clicks and you die less. Everyone has and that makes this game's community awesome. My first game was with a mix group of guys and we got picked off one by one.My Second game i stayed with the squad everything was fine and then everyone run out of ammo.My Third game was awesome, boss mobs, explosives, chainguns and flame weapons. we died.... my point - in all of them everyone said, GG and laughed about it.Must have for any die-hard space marine.Remember press ""X"" to drop ammo and ""F"" for flares.

												First singleplayer mission was the Dark Colony. Watched others play that mission and it was a normal sqaud mission with briefings and whatnot. Me, i had to defend a crossroad from waves of mobs no breifings no nothing. 4 doors/gates 4x10 wave of mobs, thats it. No story whatsoever just pure survival.I managed to complete this map after getting stuck inside a closed gate and wait for the mission timer to run out. Next mission wasnt mission #2 it was mission #7. Same thing.Devs, what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you?Nice game though, got potential. Deeper RPG elements and world item construction would be grand. The barricades as is is a joke. If you build a barricade that thing should be there for a reason not just visual fluff mobs ignore. How about the ability to close off gates/doors, as a player, for a more tactical viability and immersion. Yeah the ability to setup a proper defense position...crazy ♥♥♥♥ing idea right.As it stands this game is a waste of time.			"

												Things wrong with Red Solstice:1. poor mob AI2. Weak player dynamics and limited map expansion 3. 1 bland and boring map, no RNG or map rotation4. no gear  or loot farming5. Ethically challenged developers who may or may not have rigged their 1 tournament. 1 thru 4 is pretty standard for an indie team. I can forgive that, but compound 5 on the first 4, and we have a wasted potential.Go to Squad, or go to Serious Sam if you really want to support Croatia's IT industry. Nothing good came of this labor of love, and after all the goodwill that went into Red Solstice's kickstarter that is the real tragedy.  "

												Game is very average, but load times are OUTRAGOUS even on a good computer, and Some Scenes are just DRAGGED out.....really dont need it wastes so much of my time. OH did i mention the load times? they are bad.....wait i did, and still waiting as i right this review......yeah very bad. Over all this game felt like it could of made a better BOARD GAME then computer. OH I HATE THE Default to leader when not in tactical mode. Maybe i want to focus on a different char then my main leader, ever think of that Developer? overall just a game to KILL Time literially but its conscept is ok. Story line wise a virus could do this but there is only so much BIO matter to deal with it would literally wipe its own food source out an then die off in a matter of time. now can you survive that long? good question. either way rather make a board game of this and call it good. NO load times then.This game apppears to focus on its MULTIPLAYER, so yea, my review is for solo play. As for multipler it looks.....well average fine, not amazing. Tactics i have seen and advice plays dont really explain things its going to be a BIG learning curve it seems.			"

												Some of the best game time I've spent ever. Successor to WC3 and SC2 mod maps (NOTD), played some of those but find this to be more enjoyable and ""easier"". Learning Curve is still pretty steep though but once you've sussed out the maps and the wave timings and with a good group the gameplay is nice. Higher difficulties need communication via voice (anyone who says otherwise has probably never succeeded in playing harder difficulties) - so join the Official TS server (join.ts4gamer.com).The community is small, and yes, fairly exclusive but anyone who is willing to learn is more than welcomed into the ""fold"" so don't let the vets scare you. We're all just gunning for game wins :)Looking forward to TRS2!!!			"

												Everything in this game is average at bestwin 10, 980Ti and i7 4770K and I don't have good fps, I turned off Vsynf to check if it will help, in some game this cause frame drops and low fps feel, but no. So I turned off couple more options to check if it help and in the end I turned off everything :) funny thing game didn't change all that much :P In the end this help a little but it is still not ideal.Another thing, preloading, this take forever! I turned it all off and this help a lot with level loading times. I don't know what is wrong with this, bad optimization? Oh did I mention that if you want to change any graphic options you will need to restart game in order to changes take effect? Very modern approach like in 1998 and only in some bad games :)Graphics is nothing special, so I don't know why fps is such a big problem, should wokr great even in smartphone :) Most levels are dark, uninspiring and not interesting, very repetitive and boring, all the same all the same. Animation are clunky and stiff. Endless waves of enemies is tedious and combat in tactical mode or not are not satisfying. Story is simple and just meh, I would be ok with this if any part of the game was actually good that I can enjoy but no, not even this :) Writing, dialogues, voice acting are like everything else, good thing you can skip all cut scenes :) Even in menu between missions where you can equip skills and weapons have low fps and hitboxes on buttons in menu or "" how to play"" part doesn't always work.If you shoot flare in the air outside buildings it can lighten up all buildings inside because why would anyone build roof in buildings right? crazy :P and if you move camera and shoot flare you can lighten up even other end of the map far faaar away from your character :)And there is more and more things like this.So if there is anything good in this game?in short: nolong version: noooooo :)			"

												TLDR; no one plays this, starcraft NOTD is better and free.This game is fine and dandy ... but it's dead and it's kind of always been dead.  SC2 NOTD is free from blizzard and there are many active players with the game still in the top 20 - 40 arcade games of all time after all these years.  Get a game going faster with more exciting equipment and looting mechanics in game and just as exciting combat and classes to unlock.  So I can't really recommend this game because i've kept it installed for a while now and keep going back to it but its sooooo hard sitting there for 30+ mins and I can't get one player and i see two whole players connected in the public channel. GG RIP no advertising, badly managed community, badly managed game over all.  The game itself i would give a 7/10 because the graphics are good and the gameplay is good it's just too bad its a dead game with 4 old school elitists playing and the game is kiiiinda sorta newish but it was dead day one =\   overall experience is a 3/10 because sitting there for an hour to connect to a game where everyone dies right away because they want to solo just isnt fun where i could get a game of notd going in sc2 in about 5-10 mins			"

								Please take time to read this before you buy. I bought this game because I saw on Steam it had pretty good reviews and after watching some gameplay videos, I wanted to try it out. When I get into the game, the setting were not the optimal settings I wanted. I changed them and had to reset my game. I did that and now the mouse cursor was way off point. I decided to go on the discussion forums for this and see if anyone could help. When I did that, they had a section for bugs and other problems and they were LOADED with pages of bugs people were reporting. I understand it's still in the process of being made but wow, it was a lot. I posted about my problem. I even tried doing other things that people posted on different forums but nothing worked. The dev. replied back ""You probably changed your resolution to bigger ratio your monitor doesn't support it, we'll be fixing this very soon. In the meantime go to users\local\theredsolstice and change settings.ini there to fix the problem."" My resolution is set to my optimal screen resolution which is 1920x1080 so that can't be the problem. I tried another time going into the hard drive settings. It says 1280x720 and go into game and still 1920x1080. The game is unplayable for me. I feel like I lost $20. This is my first Steam review but I feel like this needed to be noted. If you're looking into buying this now, I'd wait till they seem to get everything under control.			"

												Played for about an hour and didn't like it, even on easy the missions consist of endless waves of enemies that inevitably swarm and overwhelm your team. This isn't Space Hulk, it doesn't have the production values nor the appeal, but of course it's also cheaper. If you're willing to persevere and try out the tactical mode it might be worth a shot, but my patience for overly ""wavey"" games is wearing thin so personal take is a big no.4/10			"

												TLDR: Do I reccomend this game? NoDavor I  [developer]   ""Can you tell us a bit more about why don't you like the game? Perhaps we can fix the issues you might be having.""Edit: Davor, okay you want to help this game?Step 1: Get this game to reach ""top 100"" list played on steam, could help by at least getting 1,000 people on at one timeStep 2: Let's try to make the game better with every patch instead of the reverse outcome.Step 3: Don't alienate your players, this also helps with step 1 mind you, and it would help if there wasn't someone spying on our teamspeak telling everything we say to the developer.I would go on but I can't really care about a dead game anymore. May the -=75=- Squadron rest in piece. I knew ye well my brothers in arms.			"

												*Early Access Review*****  Apparently letting people know how few people play this game before they buy will cause the Developers to lock and censor your posts ****Update : After they ban you, they even harass you. http://imgur.com/vpGw7UkPoor play controls.Gameplay is mostly running around ignoring enemies to flip lightswitches to turn on automated defenses which you sit behind for the win.Player numbers are VERY LOW, generally less than 20-30 people playing, which makes getting a multiplayer game ALMOST Impossible unless you plan your life around it.New player? - Well expect the only 50 people on earth that play this will know it and you can enjoy getting booted from games.So prepare to spend your time failing missions over and over to level up so you have a chance to join a group...while having no idea how to really play...just pray the microscopic community wont remember it and blacklist you.No WASD Controls, and the Devs claim there never will be, because that would take away from the strategy of the game and make it less tactical...AHAHAHA!Bad play control = more tactical?   What a load of *@)$^!@*...			"

												this game is a joke. 1-2 second delayed control of character in an action-based game? are you serious?lets forget about the amateur horrible graphics, sound, and voice. thats fine. but what is even the objective of this game? there is no challenge. you just run along a given mission direction line and your squad automatically kills everything in its path? this is not called a game!

												This game is bad! ...i seriously cannot recommend this game at all. The level design and graphic design of the game is terrible! It feels like some bad 80's sci-fi movie/game gone bad. The game is boring and repeatative. All you seem to do is click here, click here, grab this, click here. It's just terrible. I can't believe the overall re-action to this game is Positive when the game is so bad. Seriously this is a bad game. I just wasted $15 at EB's buying a retail version. Waste of money - stay away!

												This game was made for ♥♥♥♥ing rats. It's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and only horses play it. I personally played a few minutes of this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game and met terrible stallions. One man didn't even know the lyrics to Allstar by my main man Smash Mouth. I swear, I have no idea why anybody is leaving positive reviews for this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥looting simulator. I would recommend this game. Not to my friends, but to those I hate so that they have an incentive to kill themselves knowing that they own the game. I completely understand why this game was put on sale, it needed to do anything it could to attract players into the trap that is the pit in which the Sarlacc Pit Monster from Tatooine rests within. As someone who has played many ""strategy"" games, I can safely say this is not NOT a strategy game. It's a game made for you to blow your own brains out as you attempt to blow the brains out of the meaningless hordes of zombies and other creatures the game throws at you. I would rather sit in a lobby for CS:GO matchmaking for 14 hours than player another minute of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥, badly optimized, rat ♥♥♥♥ing game. In all honesty, my honest rating for the game would have to be:1,000,000 dead Han Solos/1. In other words, the worst possible game I could ever think of. "

												EDIT:Ive given the game a bit of time now that its officially out. The single player campaign is decently fun, and the multiplayer now has a small amount of people playing. Getting a team together still can take some time, and often consists of people all different levels creating a very unbalanced game of noobs with vets.However, the gameplay is still fun if you enjoy the semi starcraft modded gameplay, and with decent people, its a very fun group game.Old Review:I want to like this game. I DO like this game. Its a good game. At least, the little bit of the single player prologue that I was able to play (which was all about 20 minutes). The rest of the game right now, is online only, and well, THERE IS NO ONE TO PLAY IT WITH.Ive sat in the lobby for hours with only 1-2 other afk people. NO ONE PLAYS THIS GAME. I WANT to play this game, but since its 100% reliant on having other people, Im unable to play it. I regret buying it not because its a bad game, but because I cant actually PLAY the game. Sigh.			"

												The Starcraft and Warcraft mods, are currently far better. Balance wise, and more. This has potential, but I don't think they will ever change it. Another note. Even after the fixes, there are certain bugs that still hit a large majority of people. I for instance, can play this game, and every once and a blue moon, all the models actually load in. But generally, I am shooting air. Several people in the gorup I play with, suffer this same issue. This was recently tested again. All of us, more than meet the minimum requirments. This game is just poorly optimized, as of yet. If this game ever fixes these major issues, it may be worth picking up.Update 8/3/2015:  While I haven't had a chance to play through to much of it, it has definitely improved on a lot of little things, which actually make a big difference. Better yet, the game is working, and most of the major compadability issues everyone I knew had for the entirety of the beta, are now fixed. As the game is now, I would definitely recomend it. If you like these types of games, you'll probably like this one.  Admitedly, there are a few things I prefer about the Starcraft and Warcraft maps, such as the recon and marksman class, but, overall, this is a nice new twist, and I've played the other maps to death.If you are worried about an unfinished game, have no worries. Everything felt rather complete, and the single player campaign is really well done, including having special features specifically made for the campaign alone that make the game something of a charm. Such as the tactical combat. An interface that slows down time, and allows you to control your entire squad individually. I was wondering how they were going to handle the lack of fellow players with AI, and they nailed it.  Truthfully, some of the people online in the community are a bit sour, but there are also some nice, friendly people, just looking to have fun. Also, probably one of the better games to play with a group of friends.			"

												Played it when it was still an SC2 mod, or was it WC3? Maybe both, I forget. Deep gameplay combined with teamwork make for an unparalleled experience. There's no greater moment than when you are swarmed by zombies, two squad members are down and everything seems lost, but you struggle back from the brink of death and come out alive on the other side. Zombie survival, indeed.			"

												The game is very tactical, you need to work as a team (this however means it has the problem of random groups which could lead to nothing), it takes alot of planning and failing a few times over to learn what comes when, and what you need to be ready for.This game has so much going for it, except for how it's almost impossible to play without a full squad (8 players!) or at least play it well and without the issues of being overwhelmed.Then there is the problems that the mouse button does most of the work. Right click for moving and interacting, and aiming and left clicking for shooting (That is unless you want a random auto-fire mode to do all the work, LOWER the damage, WASTE ammo and MISS targets in the dark) While the Left hand can move the camera (Optional) and mess around with inventory that barely is needed, except for when it's mandatory like boss battles where you may as well don't shoot and surrender if you don't have any explosives, damn sad.And before leaving the aiming, you don't aim at the curseor, you aim slightly below to the side where a red dot is where you have to keep track of, so much easier than keeping track of the cursor damnit!
