												It's a pretty good game, for a $5.00 game. Some of the animations when the planes maneuver clearly weren't finished or half heartedly put together. Other then that it's a very fun casual game.			"

												More than anything, this is just a skin for the original Ace Patrol. If you enjoyed the original game, you’ll probably find a good amount more content in Pacific Skies. If you are burnt out on the formula, this game is just going to bore you. And if you didn't like the original at all, well, this one is just more of the same.			"

												I was a rookie pilot just getting my wings on a mission to shoot down enemy Japanese planes. My maneuvers were weak and so was my aim. I shot down a few but was lost a little later behind enemy lines. Next up came my partner who seemed to fair better but unlucky for him he was terrible too. One by one what was once a total of four slowly became none after failed missions over and over till we were all lost behind enemy lines with no way of escape.  This is the sad story of our our lost soldiers of war.Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is a casual strategy hex-grid style game. You control four total pilots which you maneuver around the board trying to take out the enemies. When you start you have a very limited choice of movements. Over time you earn upgrades and better planes to help you out against tougher and tougher enemies. You are scored on each mission on how well you perform. The more you get hit or if you lose a pilot your points drop. There is a total of eight areas with 4 missions to each one. You will fly around at Pearl Harbor, Midway, Okinawa, and a few other locations on the pacific. You can still fail a mission and move on to the next one. You'll just end up with a lower overall score. Pacific Skies is not a bad game and you can get it for fairly cheap. It also comes from the great Sid Meier who has a fantastic game making record. So if you enjoy a little challenge, WWII history, or Sid Meier games I recommend you try this game out. Bear Rating 8/10			"

												The great strategy of Sid Meier's Ace Patrol returns with Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies. It's set during World War II; where players have the choice to play as the US Navy, US Army, Imperial Japanese Navy, and Imperial Japanese Army. It certainly has a familiar presentation for those who played the original, but it’s also more polished and enhanced. The mission set-up is different as players are given one mission instead of a choice between three. I also find the visuals to be more polished and likable, but that's probably because I love the old warbirds.Pacific Skies offers that same great strategy, though these aircraft are capable of additional moves and tighter turns. This means facing an enemy ace can be a daunting task. It’s always important to keep the enemy aircraft out in front. If not, players can lose position and fail to shake the enemy off their tail - eventually being shot down. I’m reminded of this often as I’ve made the mistake of going in heavy for an attack on multiple occasions. This led to an enemy aircraft getting in prime position to shoot down my plane. This is why the strategy of Ace Patrol is so much fun for aviation enthusiasts and strategy fans. It’s a game of chess that takes place in the skies above. If players make one wrong move, it could very easily be check-mate for their aircraft.There are multiple difficulty levels to choose from so it can be a very fun and causal experience for those who play on easy. The rest of us that like a challenge will enjoy the harder difficulties, even when things get impossible. It's exciting, and that means everything in a game like this.With each mission there is one objective, and once players complete it they can fly back to base or shoot down the remaining aircraft to finish the mission. Obviously, shooting down the remaining aircraft is perfect for getting high scores on the many available leaderboards, but sometimes that might not be the best idea when players have damage on their aircraft. It's still fun to bait an enemy aircraft with one plane while coming from behind with another. There are also endless chases where players wait for the remaining enemy to make one wrong turn so they can finally shoot it down.Pacific Skies is a wonderful enhancement on the original Ace Patrol, giving players even more strategic aerial greatness to enjoy. It's a fantastic strategy title with its simple controls and gameplay mixed with good objectives and tough difficulty levels. It really leads to some of the best strategy that can be found on the App Store. Plus, there is online multiplayer to keep players busy beyond the 180+ missions. Go fly over the Pacific, Ace Pilots!			"

												Turn-based lite strategy game about WW2 fighter planes. The premise is really interesting and I think the game mechanics are nicely executed. The planes each have a different feel, and the game does a good job of modeling ""energy fighting"" (e.g. trading altitude for speed and vice versa) and roll/turn rates (a P40 will roll left/right within a hex; a Zero doesn't roll so good but can sustain a turn to 120 degrees, etc.)Beyond that... it's a good thing this game is just $5 because it is woefully under-polished, especially for a Sid Meier title. The missions are very repetitive (180 are claimed, but they're really a variation on four or five missions with different enemy planes in them), the animations are clunky, and there are endless small boneheaded things that will annoy you. It's very good for a tablet game, but I can't give it my full recommendation.			"

												  Okay.  Yes this is an iDevice game. Ported to PC. And yes, normally this would basically make me not even consider it.  But AP: PS is such a unique game, gameplay wise it's a great buy.  It's cheap to buy,  no fancy graphics or animations.  But the gameplay is quite complex and UNIQUE.  A strategy game that is even slightly unique hasnt been invented in like forever.  ALL OF THEM are the same♥♥♥♥♥♥. But I had never played a turn based, x,y,z axis, WW2 military airial combat RPG.  And when I did, I was glad.  This♥♥♥♥♥♥is FUN. And the missions only last like 8-10 minutes each.  It takes turn based military to another level, each place has stats, each pilot has stats, and together they earn gear and movesets.  And by mid campaign you can pull off some SWEET tag teams with your planes.  Hiding in clouds, fly upside down over someone so they can't shoot you next turn.  The ways each move can play out once your in battle are insane.   If it sounds good, get it.  I would LOOOVE to see more of this made just for PC.  Even though I don't care much about graphical fidelity.			"

												I played SMAP initially on iOS a couple of years ago, so when I saw both SMAP games on Steam I jumped at them.  These are turn-based dogfighting/fighter mission games.  Think of them as a lite version of the Wings of War boardgame.  These days, IMHO Sid will put his name on anything, so it is good to read the reviews and watch the previews to see if it is something you like.  For me, it was.  I think I got this game for less than USD$3 and it is worth it for that price, as you will be challenged, you will go down in flames a few times (or more) and you will get 25-30 hours of turn-based gameplay out of it.If this kind of game is interesting to you, or the strategy around dogfighting or ground attack missions interests you, then I think you will find it interesting.  If you think this is an action game, you will be immediately disappointed.  This is more like chess in the skies, and as such a novel and interesting twist on several genres.8.5/10			"

												A turn based dogfighting simulation? Who knew that could work. This really looked like iPad shovelware to me, but I tried it, because, you know, Sid Meier. Turns out, it's really fun. It models the performance of the planes really nicely, and the RPG elements work well.It could really use some larger scenarios, a scenario editor, and online multiplayer. But at $5, I guess it can be excused for not having those features.			"

												Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.The second ""Ace Patrol"" game, ""Pacific Skies"" is a turn-based strategy (TBS) game that is small in scope, simple, yet very engaging and nice to pick up and play for a bit. There really aren't that many historical air combat TBS games out there, so it is hard to compare it to anything else. It feels a bit like a smartphone-port, yet the controls work well so I cannot really say that this is a drawback in itself. The game IS casual, so do not expect it to have overly much complexity to it. The core of the game is assigning different maneuvers to your pilot(s), trying to put them in the best position to shoot down the enemy. As you progress, you unlock new maneuvers and gain new planes and improvements.Pro:*Simple, engaging pick-up-and-play gameplay.*Both sides are balanced the same.*Has a certain charm to its style.Con:*Not that much depth to it.Summary:A fun little TBS game that will cater to your desire for a casual TBS experience, Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is worth its pricetag so long as you do not expect anything with too much depth and complexity to it. 6/10 - Recommended.For more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation "

												(Just like the original, with minor differences)While it might be a great mobile title (like  Steambirds [www.steambirds.com] and Flight Control) it's a very poor desktop PC game for a host of reasons:- it's a hurried exact port, with an engine resembling Flash, carrying very odd problems like complete broken graphics if i'm running Fraps or EVGA software, flickering menus if Winamp's running in brackground.- gameplay cluttered with buttons and the dogfighting planes on the neighbouring hexes, making very difficult space orientation, and moving the camera (3D) doesnt help much since it's very unsmooth (feels like 10fps)Basically a great concept from Sid, but the the monkeys who ported it for PC weren't fed.

												What I said about Ace Patrol really also applies to Ace Patrol Pacific Skies (except that it has some upgraded graphics), so here we go again:Ace Patrol is good fun. If you can look past the ugly mobile-phone-graphics it's a pretty deep game with plenty of strategy and tactics. Choose between several missions and complete the objectives using one or more (max 4) pilots. Make enough kills and your pilots will level up allowing them to use more/better maneuvers during battles. This can be critical later on in the game.You'll also be able to unlock perks by completing secondary objectives. This, for example, allows crashed pilots to get right back into action after being captured by the enemy forces. And yes, better planes can also be unlocked.Ace Patrol isn't a very long game and it's best played in short rounds, but like I said, it's good fun.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												Ace Patrol Pacific Skies is basically the exact same game as Ace Patrol (which was set in WW1) moved to WW2 Pacific Theater where you play the Japanese side or the American side. The game is best described as a turn-based air combat where you move planes from hex to hex, where the ""attitude"" and ""altitude"" of the plane, as well as the skill of the pilot, determines what moves you can make. If you are low, you can't use a power dive (drop several levels of altitude) or ""falling leaf"" (drop several levels of altitude and face a specific direction), for example, or if you were in a left turn, you can't immediately switch to a sharp right turn (unless you learned ""roll"" manuevers). This is harder to explain than to see for yourself by watching the videos. You control 2 or 4 planes and corresponding pilots. As pilots make ""kills"" they gain experience that can be translated to better power moves. So it's not good if you let one pilot do all the killing... Share the bounty. In a bit of ahistorical equality, there are female pilots (fortunately, you can turn that off). Try not to let your pilots get shot down. They can be kept prisoner or end up in hospital for several missions. The planes themselves can also be damaged and repairs are not instantaneous. Typically you have about 6 missions per ""year"" and there's a big mission at the end. and 4 years in a campaign. You are scored based on how much damage you caused, did you complete your objective (such as taking out a ground target), vs. how much damage did you suffer. If you like Ace Patrol, Pacific Skies is the same game with faster planes.			"

												I have never played any Sid Meier's games before for the exception of Civilizations. Yet, this game reminded me of Civ 4 so much. For the first 3 hours I have played the game non-stop. It was more like ""Just one more mission and then I'm off"". Well, that never happened. The game is relatively easy to start, provided you do the training missions to understand what is going on. Quite a bit of reading to do to learn all the manoeuvres but its worth it. You are able to play the game at your own pace as it's turn based. But I would say that rushing you turn without thinking is not a good idea as sometimes it can result in a failed mission and a few captured pilots. There are two sides to play for: US and Japan. At the base your are able to hire new pilots and upgrade your planes. The pilots can learn new skills on level up. There are a lot of skills to choose from, so you must pick wisely. The planes can be custom painted which makes it so easy to recognize which pilot is flying it. I really enjoyed the soundtrack in the game. As any Sid Meier's series that I have played the music doesn't get in the way of your experience, because it's quietly sitting there in a background and making your gameplay much better. The voice acting is simple, yet very nice. I actually laughed a bit at Japanese ascent, but I think it's good. The graphics look like Civ4, so it looks quite old. It doesn't really matter for the game of this size thought. I think it's suites the game just fine. Nothing really stands out, everything looks pretty good.In the end I can say that this game must be in your library, no matter if your a plane fan or not. Its just a fun game to play. Although I would recommend buying it on a sale of some sort, as the re-playability is under the question.  "

												Sid Meier's Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is the sequel to Sid Meier's Ace Patrol. This is not a carbon copy, however, and more was done than simply swapping models and textures.So what's different? Primarily the setting, although quite a few game mechanics have been changed.As the name suggests, the game takes place in the pacific theatre of war. The only nations involved are the Empire of Japan and the United States of America. Unfortunately, this reduces the overall choice the player has, since they basically get the option of choosing Army or Navy for either nation. At least each branch has their own planes, so you'll only see a F6F Hellcat when playing the US Navy or a P38 Lightning when playing the US Army. I have to admit, it's somewhat disappointing the only two options are the USA and Japan. Granted, that's to be expected given the location the game takes place in, but I enjoyed having four different nations to play in Ace Patrol. I can understand the decision to take this route, as the war in Europe would've looked even more like a rehash of Ace Patrol. Even so, the multi-national feel of the first game held more appeal for me.Like the first Ace Patrol, you have four pilots. They can earn promotions, gain abilities, get callsigns (which give them a unique trait, such as becoming immune to anti-aircraft fire), become injured or captured by the enemy. There's also two new options available: you can make all pilots male or have both male and female (like the first Ace Patrol), and you can allow pilots to die.Unlike the first Ace Patrol, abilities are no longer tied to the pilot himself. Instead, these abilities are installed on the aircraft. That means each new aircraft you get has no upgrades, even if the plane itself is better in numerous categories. Fortunately, you can switch back and forth between all planes, so if you liked an older plane more than the newest one, you can fly that.One reason the ability to switch between planes is important because, unlike the first Ace Patrol, aircraft damage isn't repaired after every mission. Instead, damage persists until the campaign is over (admittedly, campaigns are only four missions each, so they don't take much time to complete) and then your plane is fully repaired. The only exception is the ""Grease Monkey"" callsign, which lets that pilot repair their plane in small increments after each mission. Callsigns are presented after shooting down seven enemy planes; however, which four callsigns you have to choose from (for each pilot) is selected at random, so you might not see ""Grease Monkey"" appear or all four pilots could be offered it. Another change is that you no longer get to select which mission you fly. In the first Ace Patrol, you could choose between three missions (sometimes only one was available, but in those missions the entire squadron flew), but in Pacific Skies, the mission is given to you. As each campaign consists of four missions, you could easily end up flying the same type of mission four times in a row. The game's graphics are no better (but no worse) than Ace Patrol, except for one area: the pilots themselves. This may be a personal preference, but I preferred the way the pilots look in Ace Patrol. In Pacific Skies, they look like deformed bobble-head dolls. Even more confusing is when pilots gain rank, their emblems or pins don't change, they just gain extra pieces of flight gear. Gain a rank and you'll get goggles, for instance. Sometimes medals don't even show up, despite the fact you were told that pilot was awarded one as well.Would I recommend Pacific Skies? Only if you really liked Ace Patrol and you've got a strong interest in World War II, particularly the pacific theatre. I don't think Pacific Skies is as ""fun"" as the original Ace Patrol, but I've always had a stronger interest in World War I than World War II, so perhaps that's my own personal bias getting in the way.

												Well, I liked the First Ace Patrol just a little bit more, however I would have played the first one more had there been more content, so I guess, now there is.  I think what I liked about the first one, was their were four factions, US, England, France, Germany, and they each felt so unique, because in reality they were so unique, in this one you just have your choice of US or Japan, now don't get me wrong, you can choose from Army or Navy on both factions, but....it just doesn't feel as diverse.Although for the next two weeks, you can get both Ace Patrol 1 & 2 from The Bi-Weekly Humble Bundle Sale at www.humblebundle.com for a dollar, plus you get civilizations 3 & 4 the complete pack, and Sid Meier's reinvisioning of his 90's game Railroad Tycoon.  So if you don't have any of those games, or have been considering just buying this one, you might as well slide over there and pick it up.As a bonus, all keys are individual, and can be individually gifted, which seems like that's been rare as of late, but a little more incentive to buy it if you all ready own some of the others, you can just gift the extra copies to a friend or two!All said and done, it's still an IOS game, that would be better played on your tablet then your PC, but if you pick it up during this two week sale, why not?  It's a great collection that's on sale, and if you decide to spend 15 bucks, they throw in Civilization V complete.  So enjoy!3/5 Stars on Tablet  2/5 Stars on PC			"

												Ace Patrol and AP: Pacific Skies, they are the very old boardgame Blue Max ported to pc, for those as my who are lovers of those kind of boardgames, its a great buy and an awesome game, simple graphics but each game is unique making it very replayable.			"

												Purchased this on a whim in the Christmas sale. I like turn based hex games, I like the history of the Pacific Air War. Sounded like it might be worth a look and it certainly was. Basically a boardgame where the computer controls your opponent and handles all the dice rolls for you - if that is your thing, this is an enjoyable board game for you. You can upgrade your aircraft and pilots if you are succesful in battle. The game consists of many small rounds, so this is also a great game for when you have just a few minutes to spare - do a mission and save the next for later. Multiple skill levels allow you to have relatively easy to quite tricky missions to achieve. I've spent far more time playing this than I ever expected to!			"

												Just got this and it is both great fun and utilizes the stuff I know about dogfighting (from games!) such as the importance of altitude advantage, attacking bombers from above or below, etc.  Also, nice pilot and tech improvements.  Note that this is a hex-based ""you move-enemy moves"" game that the twitch folks won't like, but nice grphics and sound.  Also educational if you don't know about WWII battles.  Best of all is watching a replay of the entire engagement, which is a smoothly animated movie of what you and your opponents did--allowing you to see when things started to go wrong, or when you made just the right move.

												I'll cut straight to the point: In the end I hated this game. I only finished it for the achievements sake, but I was super annoyed at the end. Here's my pros and cons:PROS:+ nice pacific setup+ new planes+ new maneuvers (given the technological advances since WW1)CONS:- every campaign is exactly the same- planes don't heal between missions, but only after battles (of 4 missions)- no matter which faction you play: the other side is SUPER overpowered (have more HP and armor whilst at the same time doing more damage to YOU)- because this is so annoying the imbalance gets another minus point here- all achievements are repetitive, no unique challengesI got this game in a humble bundle together with the original Ace Patrol. That one was okay. This one is the same only in more annoying.			"

												While essentially not a bad concept for a light, casual game, the polish isn't there. It literally crashed after every other mission I played. It lacks any sort of volume adjustment other than 'on' or 'off.' The graphics leave a lot to be desired.Gameplay really is quaint and fun. But the constant crashing is a deal breaker. If I were Sid, I wouldn't want my name attached to this game.			"

												Just like the first Ace Patrol, ""Pacific Skies"" is a casual strategy game. You get to play as either US Navy, US Air-force, Japanese Navy or Japanese Air-force, and fly on missions against the other side. The point in the game is to use tactical airplane maneuvers to your advantage and shoot down the enemy airplanes.Unlike what I expected from a game with Sid Meier's name on its title, both games on the series are quite easy to learn. Having that said, they do get really challenging on the harder difficulty levels. A part of the fun is, you can change the difficulty level while playing, and practically choose the difficulty level of each and every mission. The thing is - the points you get for completing a mission depend on the difficulty level, so for anyone trying to compete for a place on the leaderboards and for some of the achievements, playing on a high difficulty level is a key.As far as graphics, music and sound effects are concerned, Pacific Skies doesn't offer much beyond the original Ace Patrol. There's nothing fancy or extraordinary regarding those aspects of the game. The gameplay, however, is a lot of fun. I recommend this game to anyone who's into airplanes and strategy.			"

												It's more of a ""meh"". Not bad enough to mark it as ""Not recommended"", but also far from impressive, and worse of all, quite far from being completely worthy of having ""Sid Meier"" in its title. When I think of ""Sid Meier"" games, I think of intricate, comprehensive games that come with challenging learning curves and huge levels of complexity. Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is far from that: it's small and rather simplistic.The graphics are really messy at points. Don't expect it to look good. The plane models are the only graphic part I enjoyed. It can get quite complex, challenging and captivating if you play it on higher difficulty levels. Anyway, the complexity is not given by the number of plane models, skills or upgrades, but mostly by the number of movement possibilities. This can also make it get boring after a while.Still, you can have a lot of fun with it, especially if you like playing the more-chilled turn-based strategy games or if you're into history or fighter planes. It's a Sid Meier title after all, so it's worth having, especially if you can get it on a discount.			"

												I wanted to like this game. It looked interesting, so I got it, but now it turns out as an big mistake.The first level was running smoothly and without any problems, but from then on it is a disaster.The images doesn't show up correctly, the objects (airplanes, ships) are completely black and it gets stuck.After a mission it freezes either for a moment before the menu appears or it freezes completly and I have to restart the game.Then it says the driver of my graphic-card isn't up to date, but it is.I'm really disappointed. Now I will let it run only because of the Steam cards, after that it will be deinstalled!Don't buy this crap!			"

												Overall, I recommend it. It's a fun strategy game that can be played either in short bursts on over a long period of time(1+ Hours). In many ways it improves upon the original Ace Patrol, such as more modern planes, new maneuvers, better plane customization, and more detailed maps. But in they totally ruined the feeling of choice the first Ace Patrol had, where you can choose what types of missions you wanted to do, where you did the mission types you liked and avoided the ones you didn't, except for when you were desperate for points to win that Defense/Offense and that mission type you didn't like had bonus points that period. In both Ace Patrols a campaign consists of alternating between offense and defense, with each offense/defense having 5 battles. Each battle you got to pick between 1-3(1 being the final battle) different mission types. So the whole offense/defense you got to choose your favorites.In Pacific Skies(this game), It's still a Campaign with 5 alternating Offenses/Defenses and 5 Battles each, but now you can pick your mission type. It just randomly picks one, which BLOWS.Being able to pick my favorites, or picking my disliked types when I wanted variety was my favorite part. Since enemy Squadrons would rotate pilots between battles, so if the current battle had pilots you didn't like, you can choose a more defensive mission type. But that's gone in this game.And for some ungodly reason, they removed the full screen option. It was more convenience than anything else, but I see no good reason to remove it since Pacific Skies is basically a retexture of the first game.Anyway, as a final comment: Unless you hate the planes in the first game or love the planes in this game, just get the fist Ace Patrol, it's better. Though this game is still good too, I guess.			"

												This is a promising game... with unforgivable bugs, crashes and downright frustration.If you're reading this since you're ""on the fence"" about getting it... ... Dont get it... at least... NOT YET...First thing you should do is check on the STEAM forums here, you'll find hundreds of other players having issues about playing/starting the game. AND NOTHING FIXES THE PROBLEMS.. So you know I dont lie about this... Secondly, take a look at the dates those posts was made. Notice that some of them have been there for more than a couple of months.As I type this, there has been absolutely NO FIX to the game crashes. So I recommend not getting it right now... ... Which is a pity, since whatever 'gameplay time' I managed to squeeze with it between my 300th game restart... Just under an hour's worth, with 60% of it being stuck in the main/loading screen...Its actually a pretty good air strategy game.Like dogfights? Like being a 'commander'? Well this game is for you.Very much like Sid Meier's Civilizations games, you use hexes to move across the map and attack your enemy. The only difference is, since its airbourne... You can 'dogfight'... There are manouvers which your pilots can pull off... There are skills that your pilots can learn... A differnent set of movement skill in your first turn, would unlock a diffrent set of movements during your next turn... Get more air to make use of a more advanced set of skills and manouvers.. .. ... All these to plan the perfect spot to get onto your opponent's six (dogfight jargon for being right behind your enemy's plane for the best angle of attack)... or get them off your own.All in all ... It looks to be a very very fun game... ... provided they get that patch fix out soon.In the meantime, save your money. Keep this in your watchlist and come back in afew months time... Hopefully by then a fix would be available, or another STEAM sale might push the price down abit... ...For me?... Well... I'm just glad that I got this through giving Humble Bundle for 30bucks... ... ...Guess Im not really that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off compared to other players here since... well... .. ... .. ...At least I can tell myself its mostly for the Charity...... Who knows? If you're feeling charitable like I did, you could try your luck with this game... ... we'll see how that goes.I'm sure the Devs wouldnt mind donations to kickstart their @$$3$ into getting a patch fix for the rest of us.

												If you are here looking for a great sequal to the first Ace Patrol game than I'm afraid to tell you that it's not here. If your looking for a cool turn bases WW2 airplane dogfighter game, well again. it's not here. I'm afraid to say that this game is actually unplayable and an embarasment to Sid Meier's name and Firaxs it's self. Why? here's why.-No fullscreen option. Normally that's okay but when the first Ace Patrol game had it and this one doesn't... -There's no graphics. No I'm serious, you load into the game after the main menu (which as graphics) and your presented with a choice of who to fight with. On this screen you see outlines of planes but no color or graphics. Next you get to chose a pilot from 4 different portraits which, some how, look uglier than the first game. After all that you get to pick your first mission... if you can find it. the plains are bright purple, the background textrures are black, you can't see any buttons to controll your planes and the game is just unplayable. Reading the forums there have been many threads about this yet the game has never been updated. So avaoid at all costs, go play the original Sid Meier's Ace Patrol, it's much better.			"

												This game is great when it works. I had to install windows 7 first. But now that i use windows 7 it works. But as many have said, this game has a tendency to not work well even if you happen to use windows 7.So if you do get the game working. It is worth playing if you want a quick turn based game. I am now enjoying this game now that i got it working.  You can play as japan army and navy , or usa army and navy. There is 3 save files. The graphics are ok but if you want the highest grade this game is not for that.The game play is very easy to get used to. You click on the arrows to move the planes. Then the computer takes its turn. You can also set the game to be as hard or easy as you want.  One final though about this game. It allows you to customize the color of the wing tips and rudder. This can be very helpful to know which poilt is which on your side.  And you can upgarde the planes with add on mods you get after winning a battle. Sometimes the poilt will level up and you can train new skills to use.Overall rating inmo  7.5/10  if it succesfully works on your computer.[Important note: DO NOT buy if your using XP operating system it will NOT RUN. You have to have a later version of windows in order for it to work.]			"

												Like with Ace Patrol, I also get asked the same question with this one 'is it worth getting?' so lets do this review.Short answer really, Is yes if you liked Ace Patrol but want something more with a little punch. It comes with most of the other features of the previous game (randomised pilots you can name that can earn RPG traits and manauvers through experince whilst fighting randomised missions between 1-4 AI pilots using hex combat in a turn based system) and it is especially worth it after playing Ace Patrol.Pacific Skies takes place the era of warfare where planes have shifted over to faster engines and single wings. Thus the turn based combat is slightly deadlier and quicker than in the prequal game but the aim is still the same (get on their six cover your own). The art assets of course are very very different and much more varied. Both the two American and Japanese factions do dog fighting over land and sea and there are a few new twists added (Instead of Offensives it is now eight famous WW2 battles of the campaign with six missions each to do) like a mission to shoot down a pilot or towers to save one of your crashed pilots from a POW camp. Plane customisation has improved, you can now paint five different part of your squadrons plans with a varied amount of WW2 flight insignia.While like Ace Patrol there are a few minor once in a blue moon issues with the tiles (I had a mission where an enemy pilot just few into a tile and vanished from the game, assumed crashed) it played a straight up solid indie title like previous game. So in total and in my genuide opinion getting this and the older WW1 themed brother together during a sale will entertaining you for a solid 22 hours in total for a first run on each game.			"

												Worst game ever made!! Dont buy this game unless you want to have to try really hard dodgeing ace manuevers by the skin of your teeth. Your surviving pilots gain xp and then you have to choose a new ability making them more powerful pilots. Then you get to value them more which totally sucks. I hate this game so much. After trhe 1st hour i hated it so much. Damn it, and I cant stop playing it because its so fun. Definately dropped the bomb when they tried to make a crappy game and then they made it addicting. Sucks, dont buy unless you want to sink tons of hours in trying to improve your skills.			"

												I just cannot start the game. On my Windows 7 Dell laptop w/Sandy Bridge, the games starts, and when it looks like it's going to run.. it closes on its own. Then, I get ""Failed to start game app already running"" error message. On Windows XP desktop, I just get ""Failed to start game. unknown error"".I googled and tried many different remedies, and none of them are working.Verifying integrity,installing \Steam\steamapps\common\Pacific Skies\_CommonRedist\OpenAL or vcredist,unchecking Enable steam community in-game option, etc.Same thing goes for both Ace Patrol and Ace Patrol Pacific Skies.There are many open discussions on steam communities for the same error. And 2K games seem to be aware of the error since September, but failed to provide the remedy. Although I like Borderlands, this is not very good customer service.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Update: I have another desktop with i7 and discrete AMD graphics card.  On this PC, both games ran without any problems.  I am still disappointed by the fact it doesn't run on my laptop w/Intel graphics.  This is a strategy game with less than 150MB in size from a reputable developer / publisher.  I didn't have this kind of problem from many indie titles I own.			"

It is a broken piece of trash. I've asked Steam for a Refund. We will see how that goes.0/10 stars.EDIT, UPDATE: Steam has decided to give me a refund (pending) for this broken game. Thank you Steam for doing the right thing.			"

												Too bad ... my first thoughts of this game was it would be a fun turn based strategy one.  It is, but it falls short in the graphics department, lack of intuitive information and ability to configure the screen resolution or a true ""full screen"" display.Shameful for a Si Meier's game having such 1990's graphics ... especially after being spoiled by a lot of his other name bearing software titles ... but his Name sell's software ... proof in the fact I now own the ""Ace Patrol"" bundle.But it is worth more than the money spent on a ""Double Whooper"", fries and coke ... and will last longer ... although you will be just as inactive ... you will be sitting in a chair for a few hours, perfecting your tactical flying manuvers ...

												This is a most aptly described casual game. That being said it's quite entertaining and does have the constant ability to make you think rather than go in all guns blazing. Short and sweet, 4 different campaigns lasting around an hour+ on the easiest difficulty. The more experiance your pilots gain, the more they can do. Various flight manuevers and equipment as well as aircraft become available to you as you progress through air combat. Is it worth 5euro? Sure it is.  "

												I tried to write this review for the original Ace Patrol, but since I can't get that game to even run I didn't manage to rack up the 5 minutes necessary to be able to write a review. But since Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is basicly the same game with a different skin, this'll have to do. :-)The game might be incredibly good for all I know. But because I belong to the vast majority of people being unable to play the game because of frequent crashes (eventhough I meet all the required specs) and since there is literally NO SUPPORT TO BE HAD from the developers/publishers who seem to be happy just taking unsuspecting people's money and trying to give workarounds instead of ACTUALLY FIXING WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEIR GAME (I mean, they tell people to unplug USB-devices, change the sound bitrate on their system, turn off MSAA and movies in the game, for crying out loud!) I would recommend people to get hold of two older games; either ""Achtung Spitfire!"" or ""Over the Reich"". Both of these games are vastly superior in graphical assets (though they are not in 3d), realism and playability. And since Ace Patrol shamelessly rips off these two old gems, I find it a really easy choice. The only reason to buy Ace Patrol or Ace Patrol: Pacific Skies is if you get it, like me, in a bundle (but don't bother installing it) OR if you want to perpetuate a company getting away with selling a product that in most cases does not work as specified or does not work at all. Sid Meier should sue the publisher for defamation.			"

												Bland, limited & repetitive gameplay is what you can expect from Sid's Ace Patrol. I really tried to enjoy this (I put in the time!), but it has none of the 'one-more-turn' addictiveness of his other games. Only one real flaw, it crashes frequently, like every 2-3 missions which is really annoying. I'm Removing this game from my steam library because it is so bad.			"

												Interesting little game, it's a turn-based tactical game, sequal to the original Sid Meier's Ace Patrol. It is very basic in its design, set in the Pacific during WW2, you can choose to play as either the Japanese Imperial Navy or the US Navy.In terms of challenge - On easy there is very little skill involve - simply get behind your opposition, not in front of them, and continue to shoot them until you've defeated them. As you increase the difficulty the challenge really does ramp up and you will need to plan what manueveres to upgrade your pilots with and understand how and when to use them, it becomes like a chess game.I was dissapointed by the use of famous naval battles to represent each chapter, the opening page of the chapter gives you a very basic run down of the battle, however the subsequent fights have no relationship to the so-called setting, they are literally just randomly generated engagements based off the same 4 engagement types - Combat Air Patrol, Search & Destroy, Recon or Escort. Really it either needed to be related or it could've just been called ""Round 4"" or something.I prefer the original version, at the end of the day there is a bit more variation in it than this one and you get to choose the engagements which means you can choose to challenge yourself or avoid doing that one engagement type that you've become bored of.Overall if you like turn-based tactical or even if you're just a fan of WW2 it could be and interesting way to waste a few hours.

												I played SMAP initially on iOS a couple of years ago, so when I saw both SMAP games on Steam I jumped at them. These are turn-based dogfighting/fighter mission games. Think of them as a lite version of the Wings of War boardgame. These days, IMHO Sid will put his name on anything, so it is good to read the reviews and watch the previews to see if it is something you like. For me, it was. I think I got this game for less than USD$3 and it is worth it for that price, as you will be challenged, you will go down in flames a few times (or more) and you will get 25-30 hours of turn-based gameplay out of it.If this kind of game is interesting to you, or the strategy around dogfighting or ground attack missions interests you, then I think you will find it interesting. If you think this is an action game, you will be immediately disappointed. This is more like chess in the skies, and as such a novel and interesting twist on several genres.8.5/10			"

												Score: 8.5 / 10Recommend Price: $10.99 or lessA fantastic title that reminds me highly of Fantasy Flight Games' X-Wing Miniatures series, Pacific Skies is a turn based strategy game focused on WW2 air combat in the Pacific. Each side takes turns performing various maneuvers with a handful of aircraft from both the American and Japanese Army/Navy. Most missions are simple, ranging from one on one ace combat, reconnaisance, bombing and zepplin attacks.Pilots add another layer of strategy as they level up with successful kills. Each level allows the player to choose from three different sets of maneuvers for that specific pilot. Should the player keep damage levels above 50% in a scenario they will gain a part unlock to attach to a plane. This comes in the form of accuracy, damage, speed and maneuverability upgrades. All in all, a wonderful game with high replayability. The only difference I have noticed between this and the first Ace Patrol is purely graphical, slightly faster plane speeds and higher damage ratios. Recommended at any price!			"

												Sid meier pacific skies is a tactical game where you control one or more pilots by making them do maneuvers like half loop and then finish it with a full loop or going forward , roll to the left , or make forced landings in a hexagonal grid based map.You can choose 4 campaigns all set during the world war 2 , usa navy or army , japan navy or army with different missions each and uniquet fighters.The game can be quite challenging in some missions like stop 2 fighters and 1 bombard with only 1 pilot and can be even more by adjusting to the max difficulty out of 5.The maps might be preset but random elements like position of battleship, flak towers and clouds always changes making you adjust to the enviroment in order to win the battle with less damage possible.When you start the game you get to choose one out of four pilots each with a uniquet skill like evade flak cannons or escape POW prisions easier, and as you make missions with them they gain ranks which allows them to learn more complex moves, access to experimental upgrades and a unique extra set of abilities.Really fun game and at this base price is a must have.

												The game is worth the price whether on sale or full price, I don't feel I have been let down or over charged yet by any Sid Meier title. It is enjoyable and like the earlier version it is easy to understand and play. (Note I Have Only Played On the Japanese Side At The Time Of This Posting) The Pacific Skies version does not allow selection of missions, in the previous game there was usually a selection of different reward values and dificulty. Planes in this game maintain mechanical improvements selected, so when a pilot moves to a newer plane model the enhancements earned stay with the older model. Repairs for a players squadron occur when new planes arrive. Damage to the squadron carring over to the next mission adds another layer of tactics, or caution,  to the game play. In one of my missions I had to select between an 81% damaged and a 40% damaged plane, means this plane will have to hang back and do finishing shots if possible. These notable changes or rules do not seem to be present anywhere in game but can be found in steam discussions and forums for the game. The fiery smoke from downed targets blocks alot of the shootdown cutsceens. The game is fun and slightly more challenging than the first release , but the graphics and cutsceens seem to be a little poorer or rushed perhaps.Thanks for your time.			"

												This game is a hex based game where you simulate dog fighting on a turn by turn decision.  It's fun but I wish there was more attacking of ground targets such as ships, vehicles, bases which the game really doesn't have any of.  So if you're buying it, you are buying it for a turn based dog fighting simulator.			"

												Same basic take as the first game, but this is the ww2 pacific theater instead. Still simple, easy to understand and control and toonish, but as it's predesessor it delivers an ample challenge and a good portrait of small scale aerial combat. Simple and well-made along the principles of an old Sherman tank, I've never encountered any bugs and have had a decent amount of fun from this game. Recommended.			"

												♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ phone game. I didn't know that or I wouldn't have bought it. The idea could be really cool built up to a pc release. However as a limited phone game it got highly repetitive and boring very quickly. Also the shoe horning in of female pilots in WWII is just silly. A lot better things could have been put into the game with that development time.Worst game to wear the Sid Meier label.			"

												Both Ace Patrols crash after completeling the second mission (tutorial). Only have them because of the bundle.Edit: Went back and beat the 3rd mission, but when it loads your stats from the mission, crashes again. Don't buy either of these games.			"

												Sid meier pacific skies is a tactical game where you control one or more pilots by making them do maneuvers like half loop and then finish it with a full loop or going forward , roll to the left , or make forced landings in a hexagonal grid based map.You can choose 4 campaigns all set during the world war 2 , usa navy or army , japan navy or army with different missions each and uniquet fighters.The game can be quite challenging in some missions like stop 2 fighters and 1 bombard with only 1 pilot and can be even more by adjusting to the max difficulty out of 5.The maps might be preset but random elements like position of battleship, flak towers and clouds always changes making you adjust to the enviroment in order to win the battle with less damage possible.When you start the game you get to choose one out of four pilots each with a uniquet skill like evade flak cannons or escape POW prisions easier, and as you make missions with them they gain ranks which allows them to learn more complex moves, access to experimental upgrades and a unique extra set of abilities.Really fun game and at this base price is a must have.

												Ah a plane game that works. This is a good game. Makes you think in more than 2D. Would it be better to do a roll here or try a flat spin to make the opponent go by??? If you like stratagey games I can recommend this game. I have played for just a little while but I enjoyed it. Please remember that this is a older game so the graphics are not super. I got it in a bundle so I did not pay full price. I think at half off I would jump on it. Is less off than that than YES PLEASE.Good luck and don't fly straight.			"

												Played the game for a couple of hours and managed to complete the first set of missions using US Navy planes.The games not bad. It's not great either, but for a quick, fun, turn based air combat game you could get a lot worse. If you can pick this up for a cheap price, or as part of a bundle deal, I would say give it a go. The battles seem a little easy at times but for a pick up and play game I'd give it a thumbs up!			"
