Tower(Defence) = Guns / Turrets + Bullets(Lots)*MissilesTower defence games often follow a formula, whereby you obey certain rules and fulfill certain criteria. Good tower defence games make this process happen invisibly and provide an experience that is both addictive and challenging, games like the seminal Defence Grid, which is considered the benchmark upon which all other Tower Defence games must be looked upon.Comparing Terrorhedron to a Tower Defence game isn't really possible, because if Tower Defence is a formula, then Terrorhedron is algebra. It is mathematical purity and brilliance, expressed in abstract form. In most Tower Defence games you have a fixed path upon which the creeps will run and try to get to your base, you may be able to mess with this path by placing towers down, or you may have fixed locations upon which to build your towers.Wait, what, I have root? ... I have root... muwahahahhaha. I HAVE ROOT!In this case you do have fixed starting locations from which to build upon, but where it departs from the norm in this case is that the tower build points are merely bases, and from there you add lego like snap connectors from which towers can grow, tree like from the root node. The game takes full advantage of this, with levels working on every single plane of a three dimensional maze, often weaving complicated, tangled paths over cubes or more complex surfaces, allowing you to maximise your opportunities if you're clever and are willing to be imaginative.That's the key bit, because you can use the snap connectors freely, the only limitation is really funds and how crazy you can get with the tower layout, want to build mighty archways with laser turrets hanging off? Go nuts. I just did for a section of the first level, and it worked beautifully. Here, you -build- the towers, step by step.Depth of field? Check. Abstract polygons? Check. Chiptunes? Check.With such an expansive canvas, the aesthetic comes as a relief, being clean and abstract, minimalist but without looking amateur, game looks slick, well rendered, and has a thumping soundtrack, and doesn't suffer any framerate issues, regardless of what mayhem is going on at the time, and the clean design of the level layout allows you to keep focussed on the action. Doing the tutorial is mandatory this time, because Terrorhedron requires you to adapt to the fact that this game will have you building corners, arches, bridges, and all kinds of things to create your own defensive setups.Enemies in this game are represented in a similarly abstract manner, simple three dimensional shapes with various colours representing their health, it keeps things simple and allows for absolutely ridiculous levels of enemies on the screen at once, when combined with the insane combinations of bases and towers, this can turn into an exceptionally busy game in a real hurry. It keeps scaling as you go, so when your carefully constructed strategy begins to falter, you may find that you have to re-engineer and expand to ever greater feats of lunacy to keep the enemies at bay.Terrorhedron University is open, enroll today.In Terrorhedron you take pretty much every principle you've learned from other Tower Defence games and then extend and amplify those concepts, turning them from basics to pure, abstracted concepts. In effect, the game takes the genre, strips away all the things that aren't needed and then refines what there is and adds a few key elements that in turn fundamentally require the player to abandon the comfort zone of ""just build a tower"", because it's never just a tower, not when you're perpetually adding and extending it. Tower defence is maths, Terrorhedron is the degree course.Verdict : Essential, even moreso if you are a Tower Defence fan, or a Tower Defence player looking to improve their skills in the genre.Writer and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

												Terrerohedron is a tower defence game with a lot of promise and is very addictive!The concept is of a standard tower defence game but the map is in three dimensions, at first this can confuse and be disorienting but after a few games you will be spinning the map round and planning your kill zones with relative ease.I normally like TD games that allow you to maze and shape the route that the enemy takes TH does not let you do this but gets very tactical as you can build in three dimensions, you place extendable blocks and then place towers on them or more extendable blocks. This makes looking at the map in all dimensions and then thinking of how you will build a 3d kill zone in an area quite rewarding.There is not a huge amount of variety in the towers but the game does give 3-4 solid different play sets with towers you can choose from, it feels good when you enclose a complete section and then have towers that the bullets bounce back and forth to deal a crazy amount of damage.There are also some great additions that should be in all TD games, a damage counter for each tower for each round and a total so that you can see tactics that work better or towers lagging behind. A huge choice in different target priorities for every single tower, this is something that should be standard in all TD games!The game has multiplayer also and at a recent lAN 3 of us spent far longer than we would have thought trying to improve our game and win together. It is a nice addition to the game and adds a lot more hours of fun to it.The game is definitely a small indie game that is what I hope the first edition, I got it on 95% sale and paid 19 pence for the game and so my following niggles not so much pan the game but are improvements I would love to see on the TH2 and I will pay more than 19 Pence for it!The units that you try to destroy are multisided shapes and you take off sides until they have no sides left and they are destroyed. This makes it quite hard later on to identify how bad the threat is as one moving unit could end up costing you the game as it has more than 100 sides and thus all your lives. I would assume this was done for ease but even some that glow would be helpful.The camera can get very disorientating and annoying to use, there are hotkeys to mark camera points and I recommend you use them. When you build an enclosed box it is hard to select towers to build.In multiplayer even the fastest game setting is quite slow and makes it quite slow to play.There are quite a few challenging difficulties and an impossible mode, this is not for the feint hearted and one map took me nearly 3 hours before I eventually lost, unfortunately most of the time in this was trying to spend the huge amount of money I got each round and it would take 10-15 minutes to spend it all. This is a small gripe as this mode is not to played that often but a quicker way to build would be nice. Also anyone who likes Minecraft would love this mode as it turns into a TD version of it. All in all, this game is very interesting if feeling like it has a lot more to be unlocked at some point. I highly recommend getting it even if you just play some of the easier settings on a few maps, it makes you think and mixes up the tower defence area.Oh and I loved the soundtrack, one of the few games I play with music on. Make Terrerhedron 2!!! "

												Pros:- True 3D tower defense: geometric placement of towers is important- Simple shaded graphics is easy on the eyes- Open-ended gameplay with infinite number of solutionsCons:- Indie game that is rough around the edges- Balance issues: some towers are not worth their cost- The EMP Turret, which slows enemies down, works permanently after one shot. That is never explained though and I wasted a lot of time building multiple EMP Turrets until I figured it out.- Medium and Hard difficulties are available from the beginning, even though they are impossible until you unlock additional towers.Final note: I've thoroughly enjoyed Terrorhedron. Part of its charm is that there is no fluff. The graphics are purely practical, so much so that the enemies are simple shapes. Everything on the screen has meaning that is relevant to gameplay, which allows the gamer to quickly become immersed in it. "

												I've been playing TD games since the original StarCraft, and Terrorhedron is refreshingly unique amongst the genre.  This is a fun and interesting take on Tower Defense which can be very challenging.There are a variety of towers which you might expect in TD, such as single-target lasers, splashing cannons, and slow towers to name a few.  Where it gets complicated is the limited numbers and orientations of mounting points along the map.  This is when you turn to your 4-sided tetrahedrons and 6-sided cube pieces in order to expand your defensible area, which also allows you to place towers in otherwise-blind spots for coverage.Upon the last enemy's death (or when it reaches the gate and you lose lives) the round pauses for building phase.  Use this time to experiment with angles to maximize coverage of your turrets.  Any pieces you place during this time can be sold for their full cost, but once the building phase ends, all of these pieces will only be worth ~50% from then on.If you like TD and want a fresh, fun, and challenging new game to play, buy Terrorhedron.

												A new twist on the classic tower defence genre. Both challenging and entertaining, Ive been enjoying what ive gotten to play so far. Towers, upgrades, and maps unlock as you gain xp, and are persistant between maps. Upgrades are pretty standard with the level 1,2,3 system, however the level 3 upgrades seem to completely change the function of the tower, making for some new and interesting strategies. Cant wait to try out multiplayer! I strongly suggest this for any TD fan out there.			"

												what an awesome unique tower defense; if you like TDs where it is all about the geometry and not about RPG elements or grinding this is a must. there is no mazing at all, but with the elaborate setups of platforms and towers you need to develop you get kind of something new here.the game feels quite unfinished and lacks some more content but still is totally worth the buy.

												While this is strictly a tower defence game, the convention will only go so far as having enemies that moved in a pre-determined path and the fact that you construct towers to defeat said enemies. To succeed in this game, you must have to the mental fortitude to plan in three dimensions, as well as an abundance of creativity to maximise and extend the reach of your turrets based on limited nodes to build upon.In the first hour of play you’ll learn to construct vine like constructs to maximise your firepower, since you can only place turrets on specified nodes or extend upon them via connectors. Balancing between the reach of your foundations and your capacity to damage, you’ll glow new vines across a few strategic points, eventually connecting them all in one gigantic network. All between rounds of steadily increasing waves.The game can be mercilessly hard at higher difficulties, but it is also a rewarding experience to players that can adapt new tactics in different elevations and angles.That said, the multiplayer felt tagged on at the last minute and it suffers from sync issues when I tried it. The lack of a map editor is also a major oversight on the developer’s part, as this could have so much potential if it had workshop support; potential that was wasted simply because the devs wished to work on a newer title.If you wanted a relatively new take on the tower defence genre, you ought to give this a try. The unique visuals and catchy tunes are just icing if you happened to like the retro theme.			"

												I like tower defence games. Defence Grid the awakening is brilliant. Defence grid two was OK .This is a breath of fresh air. I love the way you can build around the 3d route adding towers which become very powerful (along with the enemy - shapes). Takes a bit more preperation to set the camera angles. It very worth the money - dont expect an easy ride. Not a first tower defence game but the learning curve is quick. Well recommended			"

												I played many different tower defence games before but this one is the best.(+++) The biggest thing in the game giving priority for turrents. It makes everything different and more logical.--> For example: Let's say you have two weapon which can hit 80hp and you have two more which can hit 20hp. And your enemies have 100hp.In other tower defence game because they hit the nearest one;First hit make enemies hp 20 and the second enemy pass away because as everyone knows power means slowness in that kind of games. If the second powerful one hits one has 20 hp then the second enemy still has 100 hp and your 20hp weapons cannot kill it. However in this game;You can give the priority. This one will hit slowest one, this one will hit strongest one etc. This makes your game more logical and if we back the example, powerful ones hits the most strongest one then it compares 20hp with 100hp then it hits 100hp so your weak weapons can kill them.(++) Second most attractive thing is; there is not lots of nodes to build turrents. In the other games you have a path and you can build weapons on side of path. In this game you can build nodes to build more nodes or turrents. Therefore, you have to find the optimum balance for it. You can manage your money more carefully.(+) The path is 3D and this is a bit more difficult the other tower defence games. (+) Price is really funny. Kind of there is no price :)(-) Control mechanism of 3D view is weird. Sometimes I lost the game :D(-) Levels are too hard actually.			"

How in the f*ck am I enjoying this game?!This simplistic tower defense seems like it has nothing to offer, but upon learning the possibilities lying behind 6-sided and 4-sided platforms, it gets full of crazy looking ideas. 3D aspect of it gives room for some very nice strategic planning. Great for coop, doubt it's any good for single player.Cons:-The worst camera Ive seen in my life-Chat is broken, stuck on capslock and there is no special characters and question marks(Come on, just use steam chat m8)Truth be said, amount of fun I had from cooping in this game overcame awkward controls, and upon getting used to them I really enjoyed it.

												This is a must have for every tower Defense Fan!  It took me a while to get used to the 3d profile and building the tower bases but the learning curve is part of the fun and challenge to most Tower D games. That is the case here as well.  A mouse is a must in my opinion.  If you are used to a track pad you could probably manage though.  You must grind a bit to unlock towers and upgrades for them,  however, they do a wonderful job of scaling it so you are grinding as you are learning and unlocking new tracks and such so It does not become a bore.  It has some kind of 3-d effect option but I have no idea how that works.  Someone more tech savvy will have to comment upon that.  The game looks great without it.  The gameplay is pretty much the same as most tower d in principle.  Different 3-d shapes move around a set 3-d track.  You set towers in set places on the track and blow 'shells' - think layers- off of different shapes until there is nothing left and the shape is obliterated.  You also have a couple choices of bases that allow you to build more than one tower in a spot.  Use slows and offensive towers to kill all the shapes without running out of lives and you will beat the track.      It also has trading cards and achieves for those that are interested.  I had bought it at the super cheap price of .24 cents but it is one of the few games that I would say is worth the full price.  I have yet to play the multiplayer modes and will amend my review to reflect that later.  Until then Game On!			"

												Terrorhedron (despite the awful name, sorry but I had to say it!) is a really nice game. It's a tower defense, and basically that says it all. I think that the best way to enjoy the game is to play cooperatively with a friend, discussing the strategies you adopt, and talking about the pros and cons of placing a turret here instead of there... played like this, this game is good fun. Personally I don't like very much the sound assets of the game, so I play it with my music in the background and talking to my friend using the Steam voice chat. Ah, and we have to use Hamachi in order to be able to do online multiplayer!You will have fun! Especially if you start naming the various coloured prisms that you are meant to shatter one by one... So play Terrorhedron already (and then tell me if the developer didn't experience a trauma with geometry!)!			"

												An addicting, challenging tower defense game with a simplistic though pleasant art style.  Can be played alone, but is also a multiplayer game.  I've played with a couple people, and it's a lot of fun to have people to talk to and figure out strategies with.  There is a fairly large variety of turrets you can earn, each with 3 levels you can upgrade to eventually.  There are also 4 and 6-faced blocks that you can build structures with to place turrets on, allowing you to branch out from the specified, sparse turret spaces and make some really awesome stuff.  There's also quite a few maps, all with multiple difficulty levels.  Definitely worth buying.  The only downside is the in game chat system.  You can use it, but it's not very smooth.  You'd be better off hopping on Teamspeak.			"

												There could be a very interesting game here, if only the UI were more supportive. The mouse buttons are backwards to my reflexes, and there's no way to remap the controls. The fuzzing at the edge of the screen is unnecessary and interferes with seeing things peripherally, effectively forcing the screen resolution lower. There appears to be no way to rotate the 4-sided platforms, so they're much less useful than they could be.			"

												Fun and bloody addictive game but it's hard to find out where the enemies start, end and their route. If some of the maps were polished up (and some more added) and the routes were more obvious then it would be a very fun game.EDIT: Also, if you added a map editor and workshop support, the game would also be a lot more community involved. You could even add the highest rated maps to the game itself!EDIT2: I just realised there is a little white dot showing the route. My mistake. But do make it a bit more obvious :3			"

The game is pretty nice, very simplistic in design, the music, can be a little annoying, but otherwise sort of reminds me of something you'd hear on the original gameboy. This game isn't awful, but I wouldn't want to pay full price for it. I give it about 6/10. It's a nice little indie game to add to your collection if you like this sort of thing.			"

There is no story whatsoever just pure defense. Unlike your normal tower defense they use a 3 dimensional axis for the game which allows you to build your defense system based on what you like and this is much harder than your normal tower defense.Won't say anymore, Tower defense lovers ?

												A fun an challenging 3D tower defense game.I didn't think I'd enjoy it quite as much as I do right now, but it really is quite fun to build your own constructs to place towers. Usually I prefer games where I can control the enemies path, although sometimes those kind of games get boring after a while when you know the strengths of your towers and it is simply a matter of how fast can you win instead of ""can I win this at all"".Since in this game the path is predefined and can't be altered by anything you do, and the path is 3-dimensional this game presents a challenge. First you have to get around in thinking in 3D when placing towers and finding your kill-zone and then you have to plan ahead of how long you can wait placing new towers in order to be able to buy the expensive but effective ones.Like most TD not all towers and upgrades are available at first, you have to do a bit of grinding to get to the good stuff. After almost 7 hours I haven't unlocked all possible upgrades yet, but it took me a while to get around this 3D thinking required, so maybe it is possible to get all the content faster.This game definitely needs a mouse to be played, the camera and controls are a bit confusing at first, but you'll get used to it after a while.PROS:+ 3D presents a challenge+ fun an really addictive game-play+ towers are built within a second (no waiting time for the tower to be completed)+ upgrading a tower can be done mid-fight without loosing precious attack-secondsCONS:- controls/camera take time to get used to- no in-game description for upgrades you haven't unlocked yet- you start out with 100 lives and loose lives whenever you let shapes escape, the amount of lives you loose depends on the kind of shape that manages to get through (still haven't figured out how many lives a certain shape is worth)Compared to other TD games it doesn't offer quite as much content but still manages to be fun for a couple of rounds. Given that it has less content (maps and towers) than other games priced at 5 bucks. I bought it on sale and I'd recommend you get this when it's around 3 bucks or less, that's the price it's definitely worth.			"

It's taken me quite some time to unlock level 3, and it's by far the hardest so far. I can only shudder to think of later levels, considering the fact that I'm doing this on easy mode. Either I suck at turret defense as much as my friends, or this game is down right, damn near impossible. 11/10 Would recommend to buy.			"

												I have come here to write about this game, that can only be summed up in one word, frustrating. Although it is frustrating, boy is it good. When you first jump in the game you will be confronted with complex red circles and angles, but have no fear, for you will learn. Since this review is not a guide, I will continue on with my point. Recently, me and my friend have been playing this game and we are addicted. Although I only have ~5 hours this is still the only game I want to play.Pros: -Awesome game play and it adds a new twist to games such as bloons td or regular tower defense.-Nice unlockable system that keeps you wanting to play continually to get the next upgrades-CARDS, need I say more?-Interesting maps that open up a lot of opertunity for interesting structure placement and angles/choke points.Cons: -Terrible movement system that I find almost impossible to even move half-way across the map with.-Hard to connect with your friends, (have to use hamachi) *edit* Not sure on the hamachi but that is how I got it to work. -The game will lag and you will not see what the host sees and you will either be behind or be expeirencing something totally different from the host.-Lastly, NO INFINITE GAMES! Me and my friend have gotten to wave 25 on different maps and feel like we could go farther but that is where the map ends and you have to start over. My main complaint about this game is that it desperately needs an infinite mode so we don't have this problem. I have much love for the owner/developer for this game and keep on rocking dude! I hope you can get infinite mode out soon and best of luck!Also, I picked up this game for 24 cents so, very worth it!			"

												Terrorhedron is a very fun tower defense game! I have played it for a while and can honestly say that it is a great game. It features multiple towers. Some have a straightforward use such as the laser towers; just shoot at the enemies. Some have a tactical use and must be placed in a certain area to maximize it's effectiveness, such as the EMP tower.The currency system awards you appropriate currency for killing enemies. You don't get under payed and you don't get over payed, so the difficulty is balanced. You must manage your money well however, or else you won't have the appropriate funds to construct much needed towers. The one thing I need to mention is that the waves' difficulties are unbalanced. Some waves I handle no problem and I'm at around 80 lives. I build even more towers than before, thinking I'm ahead of the game, and then I end up losing. I don't really understand.Also I play multiplayer on this game quite a bit and would like to see an option to give your partner some money. Like a 'loan $100' button or something like that.I got the game for $0.32 and can say that it is well worth the cost. I would buy it again for full price if I needed to!

Just doing 5 right now is difficult.You have to connect by IP which is a set back, but the game otherwise works great.Features that would be nice would be an AFK setting, since the game is so long.  This would automatically distribute your share of funds to the other players and have you set to continue to the next round.But for $0.24 I can't expect everything.

												80 minutes in and I have to say, this game is worth the 24c I payed. But I would be disappointed if I payed the 5USD asking price (6.24AUD for me currently). As a fun tower defense game, I can say there is nothing onscreen that isn't needed. After 5 minutes I turned off all Audio ingame as it is just a small set of annoying sounds, a stock robot voice and infuriatingly annoying music. The menu music is too loud for it's own right. But, I do enjoy this game. Tower Defense games are immensely fun, and this is no exception. I would get it while it is on sale, otherwise, I would hold your money and get another TD game. This feels like it should be in early access though, so be warned. It is rough around the edges, I am unable to get Multiplayer Co-Op working, and did I mention the horrible audio effects? Yes? Well, I will until they're changed. The gun variety. This is something I would file as neutral instead of just good or bad. It has good variety, from the stock Laser turret (essentially a short burst machine gun turret) to the EMP turret which slows down enemies (but is not worth the money, keep away as it is faulted massively). I like the plama turrets. They are very nifty for when there is a distance to cover with a lot of power needed. I tend to put them near to the entry point.The EMP turret is very bad. I thought it would be helpful but took me 10 rounds to realise the geo is only slowed down until it gets shot. Why would they chose this as a design decision? It is very strange in my opinion. But the other turrets do suffice in how well they work, just stay off of the EMP.All in all, this game is fun and a good distraction, not the best TD game. Not the most well made game in general either. It's UI is about as bland as the UI from Bad Rats. And we all know how terrible that game was, dont we...If you have some money to spare from maybe some steam trading cards, go for it, it's worth a buy then. But for the $5 marking price I personally wouldn't go for it. There are plenty of other TD games out there for such a low price with much higher content and a lot more well made than this one. But for a game which you can lose hours in , I don't regret ny purchase one bit.			"

												This is a (surprisingly challenging!) tower defense game whose main claims to fame are:1) A fully 3d playfield, with Escher-like level layouts that will see enemies climbing walls and even going upside down.2) While you are limited to building turrets only at certain points on the map, you've also got 6-sided and 4-sided extenders in your arsenal, which allow you to expand from those points in any direction, putting up turrets as you go.Cons:1) This game isn't going to win any awards for graphics. They're strictly functional.2) The music can get grating after a bit (but you can turn it off.)Bonus:1) As of this writing (7/25/15) this game is 90% off (49 cents) for the next couple of days. It also has 3 cards, which sell for about 10 cents each. Overall:If you're a fan of the tower defense genre at all, you're doing yourself a disservice not picking this game up while it's on such a deep sale.			"

Even when I kept losing, I wanted to keep trying it again. This simple tower defense game evolves over time and becomes shockingly addicting.			"

In order to win I had to stack massive towers of plasma cannons, with multiple turrets and blocks towering across the map like a minimalistic Lego set of a futuristic battlefield. Even when I kept losing, I wanted to keep trying it again. This simple tower defense game evolves over time and becomes shockingly addicting.			"

Eng ver. belowเกม Tower Defense ที่เรียบๆ ง่ายๆ unit มีไม่ค่อยเยอะ แต่ให้อิสระในการสร้างและวางแผนค่อนข้างมากTerrorhedron มี platform ให้เรา 2 แบบ คือ 4 ด้าน กับ 6 ด้าน ซื่งเราสามารถสร้างต่อออกมาได้เรื่อยๆ ตามที่เราต้องการ (ถ้าเงินถึง)Unit ป้อมปืนต่างๆ (7 แบบ) สามารถอัพเกรดได้ 3 ขั้น โดยขั้นที่ 3 จะเปลี่ยนการทำงานของ Unit เป็นอีกรูปแบบไปเลยการเคลื่อนไหวของศัตรูที่วิ่งตามทางแบบ 3 มิติ ผู้เล่นต้องหมุนดูรอบๆ และหาที่วางตำแหน่งป้อมเพื่อตรวจสอบ line of sight ให้ดีๆเล่นเพลินส่วน Multiplayer กับ Co-op ยังไม่ได้ลอง-------A Simple Tower Defense game with 7 type of Defense units. Terrorhedron gives you 2 types of platform (: 4 sides and 6 sides) to play with, which can extend indefinitly in any direction you want. as long as you have enough resource.This give you lots of freedom to build your defenses.The defense units have 3 levels. at the 3rd level their mechanic slightly changed. add a bit of varieties in your defense plan.I've not yet dive in Multiplayer or Co-op yet. Having fun blasting the colorful polygons at the moment.[edit] forgot to mention the offender movement path are in 3D (if you aren't already know that). so the line of sight of some defense unit matters.-Recommended!!- "

												A simple concept of tower defense game with just a geometry,yet can be quiet challenging since you are dealing with all sides of dimension and the placement of your turrets and how you utilize the turret platform willgive huge impact whether you'll be succeed or otherwise . Bought it at cheap price too :).			"

												A very simple yet well designed 3-Dimensional tower deffense with likely the most intricate design patterns Ive ever seen in this genre. Not only do you get to select the target priority (i.e. first in line, fastest, closest, etc.) but you can essentially craft the terrain with either a 4-head or 6-head platform extension. The multiplayer is quite fun, and strategy can be individual and still work. The sweet chiptune soundtrack, well designed stages, neat concept, and that super fair price: definately worth checking out.			"

												For two dollars I was not expecting a great tower defense game. What I got was probably my favorite tower defense I've ever played.It's pretty straightforward, and not overly complicated. Each type of turret is entirely worth it if you upgrade it enough.This game is incredibly satisfying, and the levels provide some great escher-feeling game play. Playing with other people is also great fun (and great aggrivation until you figure out how to work together.) It does lag a bit when you play with three or more people, but it doesn't really effect gameplay.Not sure how long I've sat here playing this, but I worked an 11 hour day starting at 8am, and I got home and played until 3 am because I couldn't stop playing. HIGHLY reccomend this.			"

												This game does a great job of bringing tower defense to 3 dimensions. You have to build the platforms from spots which are often well away from the track to somewhere more useful. The turrets take some trial and error to master properly, but that just helps to create more complexity. All in all, I'd say this game would be well worth the money for anyone who enjoys tower defense games.			"

												A cheap standard Tower Defence game which gives value for money.There's not a huge amount of content in Terrorhedron but enough to give you a decent amount of game time.It has 6 maps which are in 3D letting the tracks twist and bend around.There's a limited amount of build locations on the maps however you can expand from them with extension blocks to have as many towers as you can buy.. or as many as your computer can handle.You have several turrets which you can place on them however I found myself using the same tactic throughout all the levels which left some of them redundant, i felt like more could have been done to make the others more useful and give you more ways of passing the waves of attack.One of the odd things that I didn’t like when I first started playing was how the towers unlocked, what you start with weren’t good enough and meant failing, once unlocked they stayed unlocked so it was a little pointless to go through.There’s several difficulty settings which give more waves of attacks, plenty of hours can be put into completing the game but I really do wish there were more to it.Unlike nearly all Tower Defence games, Multiplayer Co-op is available and for up to 8 people.Anyone into Tower Defence should enjoy it and Terrorhedron goes on sale quite frequently for a high discount so it’s definitely worth a shot if you pick it up on sale however it really isn’t much at full price for the time you get out it.

You can create massive arrays of platforms to mount turrets, lasers and the like, even placing platforms on each other to enable a turret to reach unimaginable areas that a ""typical"" tower defense game wouldn't allow. The game also has an added bonus of some catchy chiptune music.I'd highly recommend this to anyone that loves the tower defense genre or even people that just want a game to lay back and relax.			"

Certainly unique and fun to play. I personally got this game as a gift from a friend when it was on sale for around a quarter, but the game might be worth the $5 for some people.

Sadly, this game is undernoticed and because of that, is usually on sale. Also because of being undernoticed, online mode is just about allways unusable.

As it seems the dev is done though, 25 cents is more than worth it. Hell id pay 2 bucks.			"

The graphics seem pretty simple but it gets quite pretty when you've got a plasma beam rapidly peeling off layers from the enemy. The music is also nice and adds to the retro style the game has.The online co-op works well and is a pleasant addition, every game is more fun with friends.Worth it at full price and a total steal if gotten in a bundle. Probably the best out of the dozens of Tower Defense games I've played.			"

												I got this ultra cheap for like 50 Cents or something (can not remember) and for that price this game is a steal! If you are into Chiptune, even the music is worth the full price. I am not that much into tower defense games, but this one has some highly addictive Gameplay. The possibility to lock the turrets at specific targets (faster or slower enemies, stronger or weaker enemys and so on) is refreshing and I really like the minimalist graphic style. I can only say one thing to the Devs: Well done!			"

												This is a Tower defence games 3d with very very simple graphics.Base turrets become branch arrangements with dozens of turrets hanging off of them, all pointing in different directions, programmed with different priorities and having different lines of fire, and in this game, attention such that you don't obstruct your own towers.If you like Tower defence with possibility to create your own defensive setups this game is for you.

												Moderately amusing at 19 cents, biggest jip in the universe at $5. The interface is as unhelpful as possible (turrets that you cant afford are not greyed out and descriptions to turrets and upgrades that you do not have the level to use refuse to give the text that describes what the turret/upgrade does, for example). Multiplayer is a PITA. They force you to type the IP address of the host every single time you lose. Copy Paste does not work and there is no obvious .ini or .cfg to edit the default. The game keeps kicking the non-host randomly, ruining successful runs where we would otherwise beat our records.			"

												It's like that line in Jurassic Park about where people were so busy trying to find out if they could do something, they never stopped to ask if they should do it. That applies here. Just because you think you can make a three-dimensional tower defense with the mobs going on multiple sides of a structure, it doesn't mean you should. It's just confusing and irritating. Also, the game has an experience system where you can't upgrade your towers until you've leveled up enough times to do such, which is particularly frustrating at the game's onset when you flood the map with towers and don't really have anything to do because you can't build anything else of worth and can't upgrade your pre-existing towers. Pretty dull, lacks the draw that a lot of games have, and I just can't see this as a worthwhile expenditure of anyone's time to play.			"

												The game lacks polish.For example, the game features an unlock system, where you have to play the game more before you unlock the different tower types.  On the one hand, I suppose this system is intended to ease players into the game.  I would have preferred having everything to toy around with at the beginning; right now I'm playing the game just to unlock the types before I really start playing around with it.However, the isn't implemented into the UI well.  Locked tower types are greyed out before you've unlocked them.  The problem is that all unlocked towers stay highlighted, even when you don't have enough money to buy them.  I frequently try to buy towers when I don't have enough money, assume that I bought them, and look back to see they're not there.  There's no ""you can't buy this"" error noise, no flashing X over the button... just nothing.It would have been nice to have the prices of the towers shown above the icons rather than only display on hovering over the icon.  It would also be nice to have your total money shown on the bottom of the screen next to the ""buy"" icons so that you can see more easily how much money you have left.Also, when placing the towers, hovering over a tower placement spot should ghost the tower in and show its range.  I keep placing towers and expecting them to have their range 10-15% bigger.  It keeps feeling like tower placement spots *should* just reach a little bit longer, but they fall short fairly often.Additionally, towers can't shoot at anything below their placement plane.  I was expecting the towers to be able to shoot downward within a ~30 degree angle; most tower placement spots are absolutely useless because they can't shoot at ANYTHING below the horizontal plane they're placed in....and there's no resolution options, or framerate options.  And there's no options to turn up the shadow quality.  And there's no button in the pause screen to restart the level.  There really also could have been a way to go back to the beginning of the last wave....and there's no way to change the controls.  And the game should zoom in more for each click of the scroll wheel.  And the game should zoom in toward where the mouse is focused on the screen.  And I have a brother who only plays games with controller support.I was wondering if this game was actually released or not.  A bunch of these ought to have been fixed in an Early Access phase.  But the game has been out for a year, and it's apparently not getting any better than this.Just get Defense Grid instead.			"

												Disclaimer: The game is buggy, the interface is unintuitive and the multiplayer is sometimes completely out-of-synch.Still! Recommended, because you can get it dirt cheap and get good laughs.Good:- Fun concept.- Simple and neat 3D design.- You can save viewpoints for good navigation inbetween.- Balanced leveling up.Bad:- I find the turrent/element placement unintuitive. You have to click on the place you want it, then click on what you put on there, as opposed to selecting the element you want to put down and then the place. Sometimes it gets confusing which place you have selected, so you can put the element in the wrong place.- Can't see what range the turret would have in the desired place before putting it down.- Bugs. EMP seems to shoot incosistently, multiplayer (played on LAN) was out-of-synch lot of times.- Can't control the angle of the extending elements.The hilarious:- When you save up all your money on a big fancy turret but you don't put it where you wanted to because you accidentally had another place selected.For what we got this game for, it was very funny, but it definitely needs polishing.

												TerrorhedronTerrorhedron is an amazing 3D tower defence game.  Its soundtrack is cool and everything else about the game is also cool.  Basically, there is a track made out of cubes and on it there are many circle shaped platforms.  These platforms can have weapons put on them.  The weapons are all turrets.  Some examples of these weapons are Laser Turrets, EMP Turrets and Photon Pulse Turrets.  These turrets can be upgraded to a maximum of level three (they start off at level one).  Also, when you unlock a new turret or upgrade you usually get a Steam achievement.  There are forty seven achievements in total for the game and twenty one of them come from unlocking turrets and their upgrades.  This is excluding the two achievements for unlocking the four and six face turret platforms.  The rest of the achievements are unlocked when you complete different levels at various difficulties.When I was playing the game, I realised that the soundtrack was really good.  Since the rest of the game was also brilliant I paid no attention to the soundtrack until I went back to the menu screen.  That gave me an idea.  They should make a DLC for the soundtrack, why not.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this game because it involves strategy and because it is a 3D tower defence.  It has been made really well and the tutorial teaches you what you mainly need to know to play.  Also, as you continue the game you will discover a few secrets.I would rate this game 90/100 because of the graphics, the levels and because of the fact that you get to annihilate and obliterate geometrical shapes.  Some things it could improve on is a cooler design theme in the menu and and cooler design theme in the turret selection that is at the bottom of the screen when you are in a level.  Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot and it is definitely worth the minuscule price (which I think should be higher as the game is of really high quality).  Don't forget there is a co-op and multiplayer section in the game so don't stop when you have had enough of single player.  Great game.			"

												This game is definitely worth every penny and more, I would have happily paid much more for this game. I am writing this review to recommend this game because I got it yesterday and did not want to stop playing, also I like games that aren't to complicated to get used to but have a challenge in them. This game never runs out either because it does not matter weather you unlock everything, I don't think anyone will get past round 30 on mathematically impossible, I certainly know I won't ☺. Buy this game, I promise you its worth it.			"

												As a TD lover, I got carried away and quickly unlocked 80% turrets. Game is definitely worth it. addicting. But, it still needs some rework. Easy mode is NOT easy, especially if you don't have towers unlocked.Seeing so much different levels of difficulty it's kind a disappointing that Easy is actually hard.Best map is the 3rd one in my opinion and the first turret is the best choice. Overall, game is fun, but still not as fun as warcraft III TD games were. 8/10			"

												I bought this game for about 50 cents one day while it was on sale.  I love tower-defense games and I just stumbled upon it so I picked it up.  I absolutely love playing this game to kill time and when I just want to relax while listening to music.  The Pros:Multiplayer supportEasy to playRelaxingCheap6 maps to play on Many combinations of tower placement, leading to many different playstylesCons: Multiplayer can be tricky to play (port forwarding)Designated spots to place turrets/extensionsDevelopers seemed to just release the game and never updated it again. There are a few (about 1 or two) spots where you can place turrets that can't be used since they interfere with the ""track"" (Path enemies follow). No workshop supportOverall, this game is really great for its price but it seems to be neglected by its developers. I tweeted the developers about maybe adding workshop support but they shut me down.  If workshop support was added with the ability to create tracks, this game could easily be worth $5			"

												This game is really addicting; its better than bloons tower defense. The sound affects may come to ear♥♥♥♥♥♥. but thats not to worry! This game is just ridiculous fun but not unless you play multiplayer with a friend. It does suck that you have to use hamachi and you can only join through IP. The price for this game is right.. but I feel like it should be free because it's a really enjoyable game for anyone who likes tower defense. Unlocking the turrets is a bit tideous and the levels can get repetitive and seem like you're just playing the same thing over and over. I will say though that it is very good and has allot of pros and not too many cons. 7.5/10 its a good game but maybe if they had servers and a steam workshop model maybe it would get a higher score.

I only could last 3 minutes every time i tried to play this game. which i did only twice. So let's get down to business would i buy it for 4.99, probably not this game just isn't for me. but since i got it for free i'm not going to complain(although isn't that what i already did). The lack of options in the options menu is just ... no just stop.and it looks to me like they took most of everything from the Unity Engine which i'm not getting into because the Unity Engine is an awesome thing to play with but you don't see me putting my games on steam.

												This isn't a finished product. This is an Early Access game that looks like it's been cobbled together in Unity over a few months as a school project. I should hate it.I don't hate it. I can't recommend it in its current state, but it's fun to play. It's less polished than the original Cubemen at launch, if that gives you some idea. The co-op multiplayer is some janky type-in-IP♥♥♥♥♥♥ the graphics are less stylistic choice and more babby's first 3D renders, the music is annoying and not very good, and there's no meat to the game besides a tacked-on level up system to pad the game out and restrict your building options.I mean this is not a good game by any stretch. It's pretty fun, the fundamental idea behind it is solid, but I feel like selling this as a finished product is really, really pushing it. Caveat Emptor.E: Just checked when this was released, it was July last year, and the only newspost I can see states that they've added Windows XP compatibility. Are they serious? That's the thing they chose to polish up?			"

												Good idea, bad execution!The idea of three-dimensional TD game sounds really cool. So i bought Terrorhedron. Actually, everything was so bad, so i forced myself to continue playing. It was a mistake. The game didn't get better.The graphics which probably looked good in 2014, now looks poor. The camera is bad. These 3d paths of monsters always made me confused. The design of towers is primitive. The design of enemies is much more primitive. It seems that UI design was made by a man without any arti skills. Towers are imbalanced. The strategy part of the game is bad. The design of levels is bad too. You can use the same tactic for every level. Poor balance...Ok. The game is cheap. I often see high discounts. You can give this a game a try, but i have doubts if you like it.I can't play this game, so i don't recommend it.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsMain menu music is annoyingly bad.You are able to play fullscreen or windowed mode.You are able to change the Music volume between 0 and 5.You are able to change the sound Volume between 0 and 5.There is a Tutorial.There is a multiplayer available but this is IP Based.About the game.This is a bad tower defence game. I find the camera the most annoying thing in the game. The graphics are plain and look very boring. Killing an enemy is not very rewarding because the money that you receive is based on shots, which could give you money issues. You are able to level up (character) and you will learn new towers and other things. The character level is saved forever, even if you left the game. I played on easy, which was nearly impossible already to complete the 2nd wave without losing a life. Mostly the money that you are receiving is just too low.The music is bad and more of an annoyance.Graphics are not that interesting and very simple and plain.You can sell and upgrade towers.You are able to speed up waves.Camera could be annoying after awhile. Rotations and everything. The execution of the camera is really bad.There are 5 difficulties. Easy to Very hard.You don't get alot of money whenever destroying a target.It doesn't tell you, how much money you will need in order to make an upgrade happen.Other things.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10 "

												Game is poop. The guys you shoot are different colored triangles and your towers are rather bland as well. No story or anything. Nobody is on multiplayer. 6 different maps to play for single player and thats it. Pretty bare features. The ideas of them moving around these strange shapes is kind of cool in concept, but its actually super annoying because the camera control is probably the worst I've ever seen in a game. One mouse you click and hold and can move side to side, the other rotates, then you use the the WASD to zoom, or the mouse wheel, but either way takes too long to be helpful. You constantly forget which mouse button does which, which isnt good when you have to follow the guys around this winding flipping track, you end up more annoyed than anything else. There are only a few preset areas you can build, and the targetable areas make no sense. In the first level I built a tower on top of a ledge, overlooking the path. But the tower couldnt hip them because I couldn't see from my view but they went up the wall and flipper under. So it was a waste and early so I lost. Why even have that preset area something if it cant shoot. You spend half the time flipping around navigating the map to try and find placeable spots but you never are sure if they will be effective or hit the path, because of some dumb rule they made where you can shoot sideways, and up, but no down (??). I place another turret in a preset spot because i wanted to kill them but it was next to a path where they go up and down and got instantly blocked by them going down. It just makes it frustrating rather than inventive. There are also no-rebindable controls in the game. The fact this type of strange path game on weird geometry shapes exists would be ok, but the terrible camera and controls make it 10x worse. I would lose because if anything got past I would get lost trying to maneuver the camera around to find them on their random♥♥♥♥♥path and by then it would be too late. I also couldn't ever tell if the placeable turret would work because of the angle they would be at compared to the path, so you can't really react and fix the problem of them getting past. There is this strange and confusing 4-6 way branching thing you can place that you can then place the tower on one of the branches, I think effectively switching its direction, but it costs money and you only see how it works once on a basic tutorial level. It would have been better if they didn't need that and make the turrets fire properly, like placing them upside down they can fire to the side and below. 4.5/10. Not impressed. Developers seem super cool and still respond to the community though, so props to them for that.			"

												As a fan of the Tower Defense Genre I believe this game to be far too complicated in terms of defense layout creation. You may begin construction of your defenses upon developer chosen insert points and nowhere else. On these points you may construct either a defense tower or install a triple adaptor and/or extension in order to set up defenses for parts of the level which do not have these insert points. These adaptors can be stacked as much as you like...I have no quarrel with unlimited creativity but when it stems up, down, left and right with unlimited avenues it begins to lose its charm quite quickly as you have so much option but very little drive to do so. There is no game atmosphere to give you any reason to play...Infinite ways of stemming out from insert points creates a game based on extreme patience and testing; something I nor most of my friends have.Also, the theme of this game is very dull with simplistic cube styled levels, mostly unimaginative towers and enemies that are just difference shapes and colours to represent how much damage they can take as they travel through the maze... No, you cannot plan out the maze, only the defenses.This game just gets boring extremely quickly and doesn't allow you to do a simple restart even if you DO manage to maintain focus upon this game.If the theme was changed and each tower felt like it provided a more unique and useful design then this concept could become an okay game. The problem really is that this game is just an unimaginative geometrical bore which will most likely find you quitting not because you failed, but because you failed to get to the point of failure.This is boring and dull but could be made better with the existence of some imaginative graphics and more interesting concepts.This game I would rate a 35/100 due to its boring gameplay, unimaginative style, Lack of polish and the biggest no no of tower defense games: Leaving out a RESTART LEVEL button.There are better games out there which will provide more fun and charm, including veteran TD players.

												I am not the biggest fan of TD games, but I do find them entertaining.This is one where you can really expand quite a bit.  The stacking ability for your turret mounts is a nice one, and you can get some fun builds going in all directions.I will probably tinker with this one, but some things make it not as fun as it could be.  The camera could have different control setup for one thing.  Maybe a button to swap mouse pointing and mouse camera control.  The way it is now is kind of sloppy and I find it difficult to get the camera looking at what I want and that doesnt work well if you need to build during an attack phase.It has a few flaws, but I like the concept and I will at least play it now and again.This is like a 3/5 or so.

												A geometric TD game. The unique twists here are two: 1) though you have a limited number of spots upon which you can build towers, you can build structures that add more platforms for building. 2) The stage twists into three dimensions as does the platform building. This allows for some pretty cool and unique strategies.The graphics are nothing special but are fitting. Same can be said for the music. The controls are a tiny bit wonky, but nothing that really hurts gameplay. Though I believe it offers no advanced features like multi-select or such.I'm personally not a huge TD fan, but I dug this one a bit. I'd recommend this for anyone who finds at least the more popular TD games interesting. 7/10			"

												TLDR: 8/10 Great tower defense gameFull Review:Terrorhedron takes the traditional tower defense formula and adds a twist by having the game utilize three dimensions rather than the traditional two. This is an interesting change to the tower defense formula and adds a new layer of strategy. The other main difference Terrorhedron adds is the ability to build connector blocks to tower locations, meaning you can turn a single tower slot into a defensive megastructure.The music is great and really adds to the minimalist tech feel that the game provides. The enemies are all colored shapes which change depending on how many hits they can take. Towers are unlocked throughout play at a reasonable pace, I never really felt like I was grinding for a new tower or being given too many options too quickly. You can also upgrade your towers which generally provides them with a new ability rather than just a stat boost, which is great.I can't think of any real problems with this game. I have been having a ton of fun with Terrorhedron and if you are a fan of tower defense games I think you would too.			"

												I wasn't really sold on the game until I had played through and failed, then took a closer look at the opening cinematic, and it dawned on me: This isn't just a tower defense game, this is taking control of an organic mutating monster hiding in the guise of a clean, isometric world.From the beginning, all three dimensions are brilliantly used, with the travel path going over, under, and all around the map, leaving you to find the nooks and crannies to place you units, but it seems lacking and some of the very limited build spots are useless. The game truly comes alive as soon as you start using the trees to build off in dizzying directions. No place to put a unit? Cobble an insane hodgepodge of trees around to wherever you want it. Forget the ground, hang a dozen turrets right over the path and make them walk the gauntlet. With enough cleverness and cash you could win the game from a single build spot. I strongly prefer to use the 4-way trees instead of the 6-way for the surprising element of organic chaos they introduce.No game will ever be ""optimal"" and no two games will ever feel the same, unless you consciously force it. Sell-back is cheap to encourage continuous urban renewal of your garden; in fact, the most basic turret sells-back for the same price at level 1, so you can stick 'em all over to figure out what has coverage and what needs more.The main downsides are that the camera controls suck (left and right click are reversed to my intuition, zoom is too slow, and grabbing hold of things to rotate is incredibly random), and there's no endless mode. I also wish it'd show you the firing arc a unit will have BEFORE you buy it. Despite being ""done"" I hope they revisit it someday. You'll start getting used to the controls, but you'll stop cursing them when you get sucked into how insanely involved it gets.Terrorhedron is some of the most fun I've had with a defense game in years. Once it clicked, it really, really clicked.			"

												Picked this game up when it was like $0.19 not expecting much, and thus far I've been pleasantly surprised. The 3D construction of turrets is refreshing, and the limited building spaces force you to get creative with your placement. The game is admittedly much harder than most TD games I've played, which adds quite a bit to the game's entertainment value. The controls can take a bit to get used to, especially moving the camera around and whatnot. The amount of different turrets that can be built along with the target priority settings and upgrade paths make it a lot more in-depth than your standard in-browser TD games. Great game to just zone out to with some music on in the background and play for a few minutes here and there. Would recommend.			"

												A great little tower defense game with interesting game mechanics. You can employ a wide range of strategies due to the fact that you can add expansion platorms to expand outward from the construction points. Also, each tower can be given behavioral instructions (such as ""attack nearest target first""). The camera control is the only weak point in the game. Zoom to cursor might work well here. At the very least, it would be nice if there was a setting to increase the zoom speed. I have been enjoying the game quite a bit. I purchased the game while it had a deep discount but it would have been worth 5 bucks for sure. Hopefully more maps will be released - better yet, Workshop support and community-created maps.			"

												This game is very unique and honestly one of the best tower defence games I've played. The music is also pretty good. There are some things that could make the game better, but for the price of $2 (I got it for $0.49 on sale though :) ) its got all it needs. Before you buy it, consider that to play co-op, you need a virtual LAN software like hamachi or to know how to foward port your router; there is no NAT punching. Singleplayer is still fun though.

I bought 5 copies and gave it to my friends!and yes.. its just as awesome if not more, and frustrating in a good way in multiplayer.Definitely a game you will stay up for 48hours playing til you suddenly realize you missed work...Definitely the controls at first are a little difficult to master, but definitely has a lot to offer. very funfor those with a more stretigec mind. so many possibilities and new unlocks of turrets as you progress make going back and replaying levels fun too!would Highly recomend to anyone! perfect LAN party game for those late nights.

												A geometric TD game. The unique twists here are two: 1) though you have a limited number of spots upon which you can build towers, you can build structures that add more platforms for building. 2) The stage twists into three dimensions as does the platform building. This allows for some pretty cool and unique strategies.The graphics are nothing special but are fitting. Same can be said for the music. The controls are a tiny bit wonky, but nothing that really hurts gameplay. Though I believe it offers no advanced features like multi-select or such.I'm personally not a huge TD fan, but I dug this one a bit. I'd recommend this for anyone who finds at least the more popular TD games interesting. 7/10			"

												I wasn't really sold on the game until I had played through and failed, then took a closer look at the opening cinematic, and it dawned on me: This isn't just a tower defense game, this is taking control of an organic mutating monster hiding in the guise of a clean, isometric world.From the beginning, all three dimensions are brilliantly used, with the travel path going over, under, and all around the map, leaving you to find the nooks and crannies to place you units, but it seems lacking and some of the very limited build spots are useless. The game truly comes alive as soon as you start using the trees to build off in dizzying directions. No place to put a unit? Cobble an insane hodgepodge of trees around to wherever you want it. Forget the ground, hang a dozen turrets right over the path and make them walk the gauntlet. With enough cleverness and cash you could win the game from a single build spot. I strongly prefer to use the 4-way trees instead of the 6-way for the surprising element of organic chaos they introduce.No game will ever be ""optimal"" and no two games will ever feel the same, unless you consciously force it. Sell-back is cheap to encourage continuous urban renewal of your garden; in fact, the most basic turret sells-back for the same price at level 1, so you can stick 'em all over to figure out what has coverage and what needs more.The main downsides are that the camera controls suck (left and right click are reversed to my intuition, zoom is too slow, and grabbing hold of things to rotate is incredibly random), and there's no endless mode. I also wish it'd show you the firing arc a unit will have BEFORE you buy it. Despite being ""done"" I hope they revisit it someday. You'll start getting used to the controls, but you'll stop cursing them when you get sucked into how insanely involved it gets.Terrorhedron is some of the most fun I've had with a defense game in years. Once it clicked, it really, really clicked.			"

												.....That dots above this text shows how speechless I am about this game. The game's screenshots is so unconvincing and looks like nothing more but another dirt cheap indie game (I bought it when it was around ~US$0.17 on my rates), but it REALLY has more than meets the eye.Gameplay wise, there's nothing new about this game. It's basically place towers to shoot 3D shapes down before they reach their destination. You'll start with a single, unupgradeable tower and some money to build a few of them. You'll have to progress just with that. As you shoot more of these shapes you'll gain XP, unlocking new towers and upgrade levels for the towers, just like Bloons (in fact, the whole game feels like Bloons).What makes this game unique and nauseating at the same time is that the map is 3D taken to literal levels. Enemies can move through planes just as long as there's road on the cube's sides and so your tower placements (as long as there's deployment zone). You'll need imagination and decent visual interpretation to make your perfect defense, as deployment zone's arcs will affect wheter the turrets can shoot them or not (the turrets can only shoot in half-ball area). You can also build turret platforms to build more towers (of course), greatly enhancing numbers of creation possibilities (feel free to use the screenshots as an example or maybe, spark some ideas).For the sounds, the SFX's are rather generic (especially the firing sounds) but the music sounds rather kickass, and somehow fits the futuristic feel of the game (even though it isn't, I mean why there's such structure in the space in the first place?).Visually, there's possibly nothing to say. It's just cubes, pyramids, balls, simplistic to say the least. The amount of health the object have is based on it's color. That's it, nothing else. Even the options only give you options for toggling fullscreen and audio volumes.Worth one buck? Well if you like old school TDs with 3D twist, then this game is really worth it. Just beware, the learning curve is not for the faint of heart.Pros:- Co-op (if you have friends to play with)- Old school TD experience with massive design possibilities.- Techno music.Cons:- Confusing and nauseating map layouts (takes a while to get used to).

It is a fun little game, especially for the pricetag and if you're looking for something cheap to buy this could entertain you for a little while. Also I don't know why it has the 'casual' tag because I find it quite difficult compared to other tower defense games I've played.

												At first glance this game was pretty good, with simple retro graphics and interesting game play,  but this game is pretty repetitive. It is missing some important features such as a save button, which is detrimental because all you time playing is pretty much wasted when you exit. The multiplayer won't work for me. Overall, this game was worth the 49 cents I paid (during the sale), but should be developed a lot more. "

												Snap Cubes, the video game! (Remember those colourful cube biulding blocks that snapped together? You'll see)For 20p (sale), I just spent the last 4.4 hours in an Tower Defence heavan that blew my mind in regards to how many different strategies can be formed. I've never been so focused, playing this game is very stimulating and the difficulty is not forgiving, giving it incredible playablity.The most underrated TD game I've ever found, Amazing soundtrack, great retro feel with 8-bit music. It has satisfying graphics and SFX, you won't be dissapointed.			"

												Really fun, multiplayer works... if you port forward correctly. Well made but it gets hard after a while.Possible improvements are :On multiplayer make it so when a turret is sold the money goes to the person who bought it, and possibly increase the money on multiplayer, but maker it harder.

												.....That dots above this text shows how speechless I am about this game. The game's screenshots is so unconvincing and looks like nothing more but another dirt cheap indie game (I bought it when it was around ~US$0.17 on my rates), but it REALLY has more than meets the eye.Gameplay wise, there's nothing new about this game. It's basically place towers to shoot 3D shapes down before they reach their destination. You'll start with a single, unupgradeable tower and some money to build a few of them. You'll have to progress just with that. As you shoot more of these shapes you'll gain XP, unlocking new towers and upgrade levels for the towers, just like Bloons (in fact, the whole game feels like Bloons).What makes this game unique and nauseating at the same time is that the map is 3D taken to literal levels. Enemies can move through planes just as long as there's road on the cube's sides and so your tower placements (as long as there's deployment zone). You'll need imagination and decent visual interpretation to make your perfect defense, as deployment zone's arcs will affect wheter the turrets can shoot them or not (the turrets can only shoot in half-ball area). You can also build turret platforms to build more towers (of course), greatly enhancing numbers of creation possibilities (feel free to use the screenshots as an example or maybe, spark some ideas).For the sounds, the SFX's are rather generic (especially the firing sounds) but the music sounds rather kickass, and somehow fits the futuristic feel of the game (even though it isn't, I mean why there's such structure in the space in the first place?).Visually, there's possibly nothing to say. It's just cubes, pyramids, balls, simplistic to say the least. The amount of health the object have is based on it's color. That's it, nothing else. Even the options only give you options for toggling fullscreen and audio volumes.Worth one buck? Well if you like old school TDs with 3D twist, then this game is really worth it. Just beware, the learning curve is not for the faint of heart.Pros:- Co-op (if you have friends to play with)- Old school TD experience with massive design possibilities.- Techno music.Cons:- Confusing and nauseating map layouts (takes a while to get used to).

												I must say, this game is pretty awesome for it's money. I personally got it on sale for 0,24$, but i must say i'll even be worth a dollar, oh well, it depends on the fact if you make it worth it. To start off, the sounds are perfect in the game, nothing much more to say about that. I love the lasers being shot everywhere and anywhere. This game is heaven for Tower Defense game fans. (not saying it can't be for non-towerdefence game fans!). Though the game is overall good, i get annoyed sometimes by the camera controlls; hopefully that will get changed soon a bit. Another thing is that this game is very hard! (Atleast in my opinion). It took me pretty long to get to level 7, and that in EASY mode. Yes, i do recommed this game, and if you are thinking about the the fact if it's worth it, just get it on sale.			"

												Combining resource management with tower defense and math, Terrorhedron does well to offer a great challenge as you place several types of turrets in crazy positions to compensate for their 180* firing radius.Just note that this game can be a bit like Morrowind. You may screw up and fail a few times before you get a hang of it and start kicking orb hiney. Just know where to place your turrets so you can get the full effect of their firepower. It may take a bit of trial and error, but anyone with decent knowledge of geometry should get the hang of it in no time.Unfortunately, there are only about eight turrets in the game, each with only a max level of 3. There are also only six maps available. And while each of them are challenging, they can get a bit too easy to memorize once you start getting better. Some DLC maps and turrets would be a nice addition. There is also an experience system for unlocking the maps, turrets, and turret upgrades. The only thing I hate about this game's experience system is that there is no level cap. Once you hit level 30, you unlock everything, which makes gaining any more EXP pointless because unlocking things is the only purpose it serves.Overall, I'd give Terrorhedron an 8/10. Better bought when it's on sale, since it's $0.49 when on sale			"

												The Game Itself Was Very Good But When I Finished It I Thought That There Would Be A Sandbox Mode To Test Myself,But Sadly It Didnt Have It.It Was Definetly Worth The 0.49 Cents.This Game Needs A Sandbox Mode And A More Not Complicated Way To Play With Your Freinds.And There Should Be A Mode Where We Can Send Our Own Enemies Not Custom Just You Could Send Any Level Of An Enemy To Test Your Limits.And Plus I Think This May Just Be The First 3D TD On Steam,So Congrats On That! And Please Pleas Just Please Add A Level Editor And A Map Shop To Download Other Peoples Maps So You Can Use Them,Also Please Add More Levels To The Turrets And More Turrets And Add More Turret Platforms To The Maps.If The Developer Reads This And Updates The Game I Would Be Happy!

												Definitely a fun game, the co-op worked good on the first try. A few bugs hinder the fine gameplay. The 3d aspect really gives a somewhat new approach to this tower-defence, howeverthere is a lack in depth for the different turrets and upgrades. A double damage upgrade simply doesn't give a wow-factor. I would have wanted to see some unique turret designs and upgrades but apart from that this game is worth picking up for a couple bucks. 10+ hours of gameplay is a great amount for this low of a price. With a couple tweaks and upgrades this could have been one of the best tower defence games till now. I like it.			"

												I love this game.  I love the good selection of retro music. I love the game play.  It is very replayable.  I like to replay with different strategies.  I love the geometry of it rather than gore in so many other games.  This is a very fun game.  It has enough levels to be a very fun experience but I wish it had 30 more levels as well designed as the ones already in it.  I do recommend this game if you like tower defence games.  Its a solid fun experience.			"

												WOW.  This game's awesome.  Concept's the same as all other TD games, the little creeps that you have to kill travel on a set path, and you have several fixed tower positions.  But the awesome thing is that you're able to build base blocks with MORE tower spots on them.  So let's say on a map, you've got just one tower spot to build on.  You could put a cube-shaped base block on that spot, giving you five more build spots on that block (top and the 4 sides).  On top of that cube, you could put ANOTHER cube-shaped base block, so now you've got 8 sides and 1 top build spot.  So far, I've seen the cube-shaped base block and a triangle-shaped base block, not sure if there are more to come, but with just these two, the possibilities are endless.The turrets, I have yet to get the hang of.  Sometimes I'll place a turret in a spot and think it's gonna fire and be very effective, but it just won't function at all.  But, if you build to check out the turret's firing distance/directions, and then sell BEFORE you start the round, the tower/baseblock sells for full price.  You're always getting XP and unlocking stuff, too, so losing doesn't even feel terrible.  Feels almost like I'm MORE encouraged to play as I lose, making mistakes is rewarding me with more skill.  I dunno, I love it so far. There's maybe a half hour learning curve.  The camera's tough to get the hang of at first, the UI's really barebones, and I'm not able to find a controls section (probably isn't one), but if it's possible to rotate the base blocks, I definitely want to know how.  Also turned the music off -immediately- because no sir.  Developers, if you're reading this, I can compose a far better soundtrack for you, or just let you use an instrumental album I've already written/recorded.I just can't stress enough how great the gameplay is.  Anything in this review that even sounds remotely like a drawback, it's a minor gripe that I honestly don't care about.  Bells and whistles can go to hell.  The strategy in this game is second to none.8.5/10.  Maybe a 9.  I'd give it a 10 if it came with flashier graphics (I'm picturing RUSH meets Defense Grid 2), the ability to rotate base blocks, an easier camera, and a pause button.  Took me 20 minutes to know I'll be playing this game for years to come.  Basic UI, basic graphics, and GENIUS, spectacular, limitless gameplay.			"

												TerrorHedron is exactly that Terror of the dodeckahedron's (don't know if i spelled it rite) the game takes a step back from all the other generic tower defense games with unique level design turrets and turret upgrades with a theme of Futuristic written all over it. Music is nice. But with a good game comes it's flaws and personally my issue is the camera. Not saying it's terrible but it's a little tough to control. with limited placement spots for your turrets your offered 4 sided stands which do as they say offer more room for turrets. you can even build more 4 sided or 6 sided stands on either of these for a branching amount of possible turret placement. as i mentioned before turret upgrades are unique and basically turns into a bada** Laser side show if you can get far enough. one last thing the game can be very difficult without strategy (easy mode can be difficult without strategic placement) that sums up my review 8/10 P.s Developer, Please add a Level Creator would really appreciate it Thanx 4 the game			"
