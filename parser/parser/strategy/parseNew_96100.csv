												Defy Gravity is a platformer with a simple concept:  Get from point A to point B by creating attraction/repulsion areas.  The game is simple but fun, and provides a good challenge during the second half of the game.  It can be tricky but the checkpoints are placed in such a way that you're willing to take risks and try new ideas to get past some obstacle - a very important attribute for puzzle games.The only thing that is sub par is the animation (or lack of).  It isn't really needed, but the game has the GameMaker feel, a bunch of sprites just moving around the screen with a short walking animation, which I find kind of off putting.  It isn't important, but it should be mentioned.If you like physics manipulation games or platformers, then I recommend buying this.  The game is $3 at the time of this writing, more than worth it.

												It's hard not to recommend this, given that I made a 7 cent profit from buying the game then selling the cards... getting paid to play a game is never wrong. :-)But even ignoring that, I had a surprisingly good time with it. Defy Gravity is your basic puzzle platformer where you have to use an unusual mechanic to navigate levels. In this case, you can shoot gravity fields that attract you or repel you and activate a shield that lets you ignore all gravity fields. By mixing these, you can sort of rocket-jump-grapple-hook your way through levels. Some timed jumping and obstacles that sometimes are and sometimes are not affected by the gravity are there to stop your progress.In the words of a wise man, you're going to die. A lot. The game takes delight in throwing stuff in your way at just the wrong moment. But at the same time, it's surprisingly forgiving with how you swing around the level and you can often brute force your way through tight spots. ""Hectic"" is not a word you usually associate with puzzlers, but Defy Gravity can get pretty hectic -- and that's when it's arguably at its most fun. For me it hits just the right balance between frustration and challenge.The graphics and sound are absolutely nothing special, but in terms of pure gameplay, this is value for money even when it's not 90% off. When it is, of course, it's a no-brainer, just get it. :-) "

												I just bought it for cards admittedly (at $0.29), but I actually found it rather fun to play instead of just idling. The game is short so I have to say only buy it on a major sale, but well worth the time if these kind of games interest you.Gameplay wise it is a fun platformer, and does remind me a bit of Portal. It isn't an exact copy though, instead of Portals, you manipulate Gravity to repel and attract yourself and other objects. The momentum and physics of the game is fun to toy with, though it CAN be frustrating at times. Checkpoints are placed in fair spots of most stages to reduce frustration, but later stages stretch this out quite a bit so you will have to keep on your toes or be prepared to die again and again.I did beat the main story but I decided to leave before continuing deep into hard mode. It takes away one of your powers and while I do feel that's an interesting challenge, I'm satisfied with just beating the main modes.			"

OverviewDefy Gravity Extended is a small game, with only a few tricks, but does it very well. It lacks the flair of a quality game, but once you go in and try it, it certainly redeems itself. In this game, you play as a spacesuit wearing gravitymancer trying to pass the gauntlet. You are equipped with a gravity gun (not the HL type!) and have to traverse many levels to prove your worth!The Pros:Simple Concept - If you can make a simple game fun, you have succeeded as a developer. The game mechanics are very simple. You move about, and create two types of ""portals"". One that has a strong gravitational pull and one that repels objects. You can also activate a shield around you that negates any gravity effects. Leaving breaking the laws of physics aside, you must combine these simple actions in order to get yourself to the exit.Good Level Design - I'm not talking about the aesthetics, of course! I'm referring to the level layout, the challenges you face, their diversity, their difficulty. It impressed me how challenging this game became in later levels, without repeating itself throughout. The levels are many times relying on sinusoidal patterns and geometric arrays of projectiles!Challenging - The levels begin increasingly harder, and some are outright stressful. If you are looking for something to test your skill and patience with, you've come to the right place!Good Music - The background music is a nice relaxing tune that suits the space environment we are supposed to be in. Really helps ease out the stress from those hard levels.Cheap - The game is 0.99€ at normal price and can go all the way down to 0.09€ when on sale. So, just give it a try, it will cost you basically nothing. (Not to mention it has Steam Trading Cards)Achivements! - Few achievements, only requirement is passing the game. Sounds easy, huh? It's not, but good luck, hunters!The Cons:Ugly Visuals - The textures aren't eye candy and everything is flat and pixelated. While I'm not saying a game is good if it looks good, it wouldn't hurt getting a little face lift every now and then.Shabby Animations - The animations are barely existent, sometimes movement may seem plastic, especially the way your character tilts its body when looking at the cursor.Conclusion:Defy Gravity Extended is certainly not a game for everyone, so if you don't like skill-based platformers with minimal controls, then look elsewhere. If however, you like that sort of thing and still have the pocket change from grocery shopping, then consider giving it a go!If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												Defy Gravity (henceforth known as DG) is an example of what a small indie game should be.Gameplay:Based on two types of gravity spheres, one pushing you away and one pulling you towards it. Using these you have to traverse levels and bounce/throw yourself across pits. Overall the gameplay is simple, standard WASD and mouse, plus having support for a controller. Graphics&Sound:What are you expecting out of an indie game? The sound is above average, as the music is pretty nice. The graphics are typical, though not bad enough to be annoying. The one complaint i do have with this game is that your character looks as if he's using a Super Soaker rather than a gravity gun. The Good: I got this when it was on sale for $.14 (yes, 14/100) and it was a nice, cheap pickup. It'll provide a good amount of fun.The Bad: The controls are a bit wonky and some of the levels require split-second reactions.Overall Grade: C+ Not Bad, but it's a small game, good to play if you got a few minutes to kill.

												This game is okay, worth the money if it goes on sale under $1.00.

Fun gameplay for about 15 minutes2.) Alright music for a cheap indie game3.) Controller support (If you like that)4.) Really inexpensive alternative to the Portal franchiseCons:1.) Graphics could have been run through MSDos2.) Locked resolution3.) It's that kind of game you will play for fifteen minutes, beat it, and never touch again4.)

I haven't finished the game, as i'm stuck in stage 5, but with enough effort you can finish it and feel the joy of completing such a difficult task.I'd say this game is well worth the full price for its gameplay, soundtrack and challenge, but you may as well wait for a promotion, as the price goes down an insane amount (around 90%).

												Defy Gravity Extended it's an indie game based in physics / gravity laws. It could looks like a horrible game. I mean art and animations are simple and it can feels empty, otherwise it's too challenging. You can feel that it's a 2D version of ""Portal"", you have a gun that has two functions, repel and attract.Something that i loved in this game was the relaxing background music that makes you relax during stressful levels.It has enough good levels and after finish it the nightmare haven't finished yet, you have to complete it twice in order to get all achievements, something that will make you rage.It's always on discount (95% off i guess), so if your style it's the challenges you can give it a chance.7.5 / 10If you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.

												Decent puzzle and platformer game that involves placing gravity and anti-gravity wells strategically across hazards and obstacles Kara must travel across to reach the exit in every stage. There are approximately 21 levels altogether, plus the same 21 levels for the real Gauntlet mode where Kara may only place gravity wells. Although some levels can be frustrating due to the random and unpredictable movement patterns of some of the hazards, the game is forgiving and has checkpoint locations to enable instant retries at each checkpoint location along various intervals in each level.

												This game was a lot of fun and very reminiscent of the early 2000s online flash games, which gave me a wonderful nostalgic feeling all throughout the game. This puzzle-platformer is straightforward, however reaching your end goal can and will be difficult. The simplicity and correct execution of this game's design creates that unique feeling, where the player knows finishing this level is solely due to the player’s ability to perform. No game exploits, no grinding to get to a certain level or luck driven events. Just simple, skill-based levels with original and adaptive gameplay.Granted that not everyone is into 2D flash puzzle-platformers, this game may not be what everyone is looking for, however if you do purchase this game and give it the time of day, I think you might be pleasantly surprised at how much fun you'll have.Extra - The authentic soundtrack is very atmospheric and enjoyable.

												Tough platforming game, but worth the cheap price you can find it at, or especially when it goes on sale you can easily find it for less than a buck.  The goal, to reach the end of each level offering a different level of difficulty with different obstacles.  The gimmick, a double jump ability and an anti-gravity/well-gravity gun.  Using both of these while stagnant is easy though tricky, but when you have to use them while on the run can prove quite difficult and at times frustrating.  The hard mode features only the well-gravity gun.  Beating this latter mentioned segment proved really difficult and a true test of the puzzle and platforming skills.  I did find a few odd issues.  At times the screen would go black when loading or reloading a level.  Shooting would fix the problem, however, if the level was saved at a save point, you may need to act quickly, shooting and eliminating your gravity shot then moving forward when given limited time only added to the difficulty and when it's unnecessary difficulty, it made it really bad.  The graphics are simple, the sound and music forgettable, but it's the gameplay that wins this game a recommendation.Overall though, I did appreciate the tests and found the game worthy of playing and I do recommend it for you if you can deal with proper frustration and sometimes improper and unnecessary frustrations.

												Defy Gravity Extended is a puzzle platformer game where you play as Kara, a gravitymancer. You will use a gun that places gravity wells and anti-gravity wells. You will use them often to solve various puzzles throughout the game. Gravity well pulls you into its center, while anti-gravity wells repels you from its center.Defy Gravity Extended has a very unique game mechanic, it is quite different than most puzzle platformer games I've played. The soundtrack for this game is very nice and relaxing too. You can get 100% achievements just by finishing the game. I like that the game doesn't make you finish a level in a particular time so you won't be pressured while playing. The game has 24 levels and certainly doesn't lack in challenge. There is also a checkpoint system in the game, so if you die, you won't start from the beginning which is nice.However, for me, it is more frustrating than It is to enjoy while playing this game. The controls are a little bit difficult. I don't like the animation. The game looks very unappealing to me. The game lacks on the options menu. You can't adjust the game's volume at all, so you will need to change it from Windows or your speaker. It also lacks in resolution options too. The game at one point crashes, but it wasn't in a middle of a level. The story is pretty much non-existent.In conclusion, Defy Gravity Extended is a unique and very challenging game. But it is very frustrating to play. I don't enjoy this game very much, maybe because this game isn't for me. The price seems a little fair though. But I do not recommend buying this full price since it goes on sale quite often. I do recommend purchasing this game on sale because it's usually on sale for 90% off or more.			"

												This game was absolutely fantastic. It has an original concept, and good application. It was challenging, fun, infuriating at times, and immensely satisifying to complete. The storyline is relatively simple - as are the controls. You will almost always be able to understand how a level should be beat, but the application will still be somewhat challenging, and may require a few attempts. Once you've beaten the game, there is a secondary playthrough which removes one of your abilities, rendering the game a completely different approach - needing more planning and less random leaping about. It assumes you know how the mechanics work at that point, then puts your knowledge to the test. The game was a bit short, but well paced. I would happily buy the game again, and at it's current price, it is more than worthwhile, even just to test it out.			"

												""Release Date: 18 Mar, 2016"" Fake release date. This game has been out for at least a year, maybe 2 even. The release date has changed simply so that the game will appear on the Steam store front. Very fishy action from this dev and this should not be alowed on Steam. The new release date is simply fake and false. I played it for 5 minutes and crashed 5 times by pressing W at the start point. Seems to be made with Unity (or Clickteam), but badly coded. I also looked al the reviews and most of them now show up a 'pre release' due to the fake release date. Not to mention that a lot of the reviews seems to be super positive with a 10 minute total play time, so I call those fake too. I can't really check how good/bad the game is ,because I crash every minute just by pressing a key. This game does not seem to be something to be super positive about.Edit: apparently the game was released on steam in 2011.			"

♥♥♥♥ Gravity - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Man has long yearned to fly among the stars. To be in space. The final frontier. There's all kinds of cool things up there, all of which could kill everyone on our planet in the blink of an eye. We could all just be a little flickering candle of a planet, snuffed out by the flap of a little space butterfly's wing. It's pretty cool.We've obviously never really been in space though, or on the moon. That's a conspiracy perpetuated by Richard Nixon and the Disney Channel. You don't want to believe the lies, but it makes people happy. Just like the tooth fairy or the concept of chivalry. You can believe whatever you like, but really all they want is to get in your mouth and leave some money on your nightstand.While humanity will probably never REALLY be in space, because space is actually also a conspiracy that Disney Channel likes to keep going for their ""special interests"", we can imagine what this fictitious place called outer space is like through video games. Yeah!According to the legends, people can float in space. There's a force that pulls things towards planets, but there's none of it in space. ""Gravity"", they call it. It's apparently what holds us onto Earth. Even though everyone knows that we're actually held to the Earth's surface by the natural paste on our feet and shoes. If you ever sprayed non-stick cooking spray on your feet, you'd float into the sun and die.But gravity makes for an interesting theoretical concept, and an even better game. Defy Gravity, which has also apparently been Extended, is a sweet little gem of a PC game you can get on Steam.Defy Gravity is a little budget puzzle platformer. Nothing too fancy. I probably bought it for a quarter. But definitely a quarter well-spent. It's short, sweet, fun, and surprisingly smart.There's a definite Portal vibe going on here, and it's at least mildly Metroid-inspired in some way. Your character controls gravity with their gun, which is capable of shooting two different colors to make pushy gravity and pully gravity. They also PLOT TWIST ARE GIRL WITH BOOBIES. GIRLS CAN PLAY GAMES TOO.WHEN HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF AND HAS THE BOOBS SO YOU KNOW IT'S FEMINISM.DID YOU KNOW GIRLS CAN DO THINGS.Defy Gravity packs a lot of punch for a simple game. I can count the amount of stage hazards on my fingers. And yet the way they're combined is never dull. It's a short, compact game. There's not a super bountiful amount of content. But for what you're paying for, they squeeze every little drop of game out of it.Most puzzle games need to be this huge♥♥♥♥♥Rube Goldberg type of thing. There's so many things everywhere, and you need to remember all these different elements that interact with one another in all these ways. And when all of that combines, you can pop a balloon or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Defy Gravity has like, a brick and some lemons. One lemon has a nail wedged into it. There's a dog. And yet they manage to pop the ♥♥♥♥ out of so many balloons. There's some really memorable levels with only those elements. It's humble, and it's simple. But it's smart, it's fun, and it's well-worth the quarter I spent on it.It's a budget title for sure. Everything seems to follow the basic theme of ""Not amazing, but for a quarter this is pretty nice"". It's not meant to be the biggest, most impressive game you can buy. Graphically, it's incredibly simplistic. It almost looks like it was done in Flash or something. The sprites are decent, but everything is very basic looking. The graphics work though. They're unimpressive, but they're not ugly. It has a nice look to it, the sprites are well made, and the general art direction and style works.Its game design and mechanics are its biggest selling point. It's not even particularly long. It's pretty short actually. But it's a brutal platformer later in the game, so it can definitely take you a few hours to complete with the excellently done difficulty ramp considered. And if you're a sucker for brutal puzzle-platforming, the extra Hard mode post-game is enough to frustrate most platformer fans.There was clearly some love put into the game. It's well-designed and has a nice coat of polish. Cheap polish, yeah. Not the name brand polish that all the super models use. More like store brand Kmart polish. It'll get the job done. Might even look nice. They'll never know, probably. Your mother-in-law will be able to tell, and she'll gossip about it to everyone just to spite you. You ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. But no one else will notice otherwise.It's a nice game. It's pretty nice. Better than most things you'd buy on Steam for the price. It's like the difference between putting your quarter in a fancy machine with flashy lights and junk, and giving your quarter to a homeless heroin addict. You want to pay for the nice machine, not only to reward yourself with the gumball but to reward the nice people that took the time to build this nice machine. You don't want to flip a quarter to a guy that's gonna save up to shoot himself up with heroin, break into your house and♥♥♥♥♥♥your guinea pig or your sister or something. Think of the guinea pigs.

PresentationDefy Gravity follows a similar road with some other platformers we've seen lately, using space as a foundation for the game, as you take control of one of the Gravitymancers who came to the Gauntlet, the ultimate test, in order to prove themselves. However, where other platformers with a similar pattern such as The Swapper manage to tell an interesting and unique story using the darkness and emptiness of space, Defy Gravity only introduces you to the Gauntlet, without actually telling you what it really is, what purpose does it serve and why would anyone risk their lives just to prove that they can get to the end. It is quite obvious that story isn't the main focus here, but even so it's hard not to notice the missed opportunity, since The Gauntlet itself could've been filled with messages from others who tried and were defeated by The Gauntlet or pretty much anything at all to justify your desire to finish it; instead you're left with a left to right Mario-style platformer without any princess at the end.Rating: 4GameplayThe gameplay is based around the use of gravity wells, which can be created using your gun, in addition to the ones that are already placed on the map and cannot be moved; using those wells properly and learning how they influence other objects is key in Defy Gravity, as almost every puzzle is based on how well you manage to use the gravity wells depending on position, as well as timing. There are two types of gravity wells: positive and negative; the positive wells will attract objects towards them, including yourself, while the negative ones will repel them, and combining those wells with your anti-gravity shield that makes you immune to all wells is what makes the gameplay unique and interesting. The whole concept does wear out by the end of the game, as there won't be any new ideas introduced into the game later on, leaving you mostly with more bouncing objects to avoid in order to make the game harder, something that does happen once you finish the game and Hard mode is unlocked, disabling negative gravity wells and changing a few things in each level in order to make it more challenging.Rating: 8.5GraphicsThe first thing you will probably notice are the backgrounds, which look amazing and change from level to level, but what on the other hand, the levels themselves are designed using the same monotone, gray blocks and the only thing that differentiates them one from another is the layout of those gray blocks and the bouncing objects between them. The visual effects are basic and nothing stands out, mostly because no beam or ray of light can move your eyes away from the galaxies in the background.Rating: 5AudioThe tunes are okay, but since there is no story or momentum to what is happening, this is probably one of those titles you'll play with your own music in the background. The sound effects feel absent most times, as they are either too quiet or not in total sync with the action, but then again you probably won't need those anyway.Rating: 4.5ExtrasFor its 3€ price tag, Defy Gravity offers enough to justify the purchase, even if you can finish the game in less than two hours, adding 2-3 more hours to that time if you're down for the Hard mode, but if you are looking for anything extra, there is nothing more to the game than the adventure itself.Rating: 7VerdictDefy Gravity is an okay platformer if you only care about the gameplay, as it does introduce a new concept even if it only lasts for a short time, but for anything else you might expect from this game, you will probably be disappointed.Rating Overall: 5.8Check out the full review and a lot more about Defy Gravity at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=366 "

Defy Gravity Extended is a very nice and short game that will satisfy anyone who has had enough of mindless shootings. The biggest asset is obviously the freedom to choose while solving puzzles and a feeling that the laws of physics are at our mercy. The graphics and music are perfectly matched. Everything is in its place and a pleasure for both the eye and the ear. So take a gun in hand and ... go right? Yes. It's just a simple, small, modest low-budget minigame.			"

Gameplay'Defy Gravity' is a platformer that uses physics (gravity). It has the usual jump-or-die and dodge-or-die mechanics, but you can also create two kinds of wells: a gravity well that pulls you and certain objects towards it an anti-gravity well that repels you and certain objects away from itAdd to that the option to switch on a body shield, which renders you immune to all gravity and anti-gravity effects, and you have some nice mechanics to play with.DifficultyI'm not a big fan of the platformer genre because I find standard platformers too 'twitchy' for my taste. But occasionally, I wil try a platformer game that has some special mechanics like the wells in 'Defy Gravity'. So you need to read the rest of this section knowing that I'm only a very casual platformer gamer.I have to admit I liked 'Defy Gravity' and I had a lot of fun until the 'Grandmaster levels'. Judging from the Steam Achievements, that's almost halfway through the game. At that point, you get a warning screen letting you know that the game is kicking it up a notch and is about to get - and I quote: ""much more difficult"".I noticed in the first 'Grandmaster level' that the game was no longer my cup of tea because it got way too difficult and yes, too twitchy for me. But I suppose for hardcore platformer gamers, the fun would only just begin at that point. I would like to point out that all the footage seen in the demo video here on Steam is from pre-Grandmaster levels. I'm not saying that's a conspiracy on the makers' part or something like that, it's just so you know when looking at that footage and thinking to yourself 'that doesn't look too hard to me'.Graphics and soundThe graphics are ok. They are nothing special but certainly good enough for a game of its genre. I invite you to take a look at the video and the screen shots to judge for yourself.A lot of reviewers don't like the music. I can relate to that but personally, it didn't bother me and I have a low tolerance for annoying music and sounds. For the most part, I even thought the music was nice and at least fitting for the game. So it's clearly a matter of personal taste and let's leave it at that.There are no options whatsoever for graphics or sound. A word about the Steam extras'Defy Gravity' has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements are uninspired. They are limited to your classic 'pass x number of levels and get an achievement'. If you just play through the 'easy' part of the game, you'll end up with 4/8 so a 50% completion rate.			"

												Nailing that feeling of satisfaction when you’ve figured out a solution to the task at hand is very difficult. Not all mechanics allow it and not all games offer more than one route from point A to point B. I believe gravity manipulation and physics-based gameplay is one of the greatest things gaming has bothered exploring. When done well, it is logical, intuitive and rewarding. It’s like pulling out that second to last piece of Jenga.This is what Defy Gravity Extended is: an extremely satisfying game. You play as Kara, following the Samus school of power armour where you couldn’t tell the gender were it not for the game description. She has to prove herself as a Gravitymancer in the Gauntlet, using her sassy gravity gun (which looks a bit like a Super Soaker). The gun can set two kinds of fields: one that attracts and one that repels. This is the basic premise, and the levels are variations upon previously-set rules. You might encounter enemies who are also affected by the gravity fields, a level may turn your anti-gravity shield permanently on, or you’ll have to use platforms affected by your gravity gun as well.The graphics are really basic, and I admit I was a tad skeptical when I saw some screenshots, but after 5 minutes into the game all my doubts were washed away. The levels are very well-made and reward smart thinking. The first few stages give you hints where to place the respective gravity fields, but you will soon realize that you can use even less resources than recommended.The music is also really good. Now, I’m not a music reviewer and I lack the capacity to translate how music feels using words, but Defy Gravity’s soundtrack took me off-guard in a very pleasant way.The only complaint I can think of is a lack of level editor, which seems extremely appropriate for a game like this.

												You get an excellent puzzle platformer for this price. It mixes mechanics that are a bit similar to Portal's mechanics with Braid's platforming (or jumping, really). Of course the game has its own style and own mechanics, so don't expect a clone of the games I just mentioned. The graphics are extremely simple, but they get the job done. I absolutely love detailed, well animated 2D graphics, so I'm a little bit disappointed, but for this price, I guess I can't really complain. The gameplay is the most important factor here and I have absolutely no complaints about that. Controls work well, but take some time getting used to though. The game is also quite forgiving in parts where you die. It makes the game fun and removes the frustrating parts. But don't expect an easy game. It will still take some skill to finish it. Go for it ![Rating: 78/100]			"

												An interesting platformer that although it may feel a bit cheap, i enjoyed it. Here you have a gun that can create a gravity or anti-gravity field, and you must use that to go through the levels. One thing i liked is that the gun isn't always necessary to progress, making the level design feel more balanced. There's 24 levels, and after that you unlock the hard mode, but either way the game isn't too hard, just challenging a few times. The graphics and music weren't impressive, but they got the job done. One thing i didn't like was the lack of a level select screen: you can only start a new game or continue. But it's a decent game nonetheless, and for cheap is worth of your time.			"

												Hey! I know most of you already have this game, because it gets so damn cheap, considering the card prices, it even had effectively negative prices in the past.So, this review is not to make you buy this overlooked gem. It is to make you play it.First, who is the targeted audience here? If you liked, Rochard or Outland or any other puzzle platformer, you will feel like at home here. I know most of the reviewers really like using shortcut of, ""Yes, this is puzzle, and the most commonly loved puzzle game around is Portal, so I will just call this Portal in 2d AND space AND gravity guns rather than portal guns AND without an actual story AND heavily amateurish -or indie- AND with some minor bugs making controls a bit harder AND....As you can see if you say this game is similar to some other with some exceptions, but if number of these exceptions are more than 5, actually your so called similarity does not convey any information at all. So, I will just skip calling this ""2D PORTAL game"" even though I agree that it sounds catchy. It is not similar to that game. And btw, if the idea of 2d Portal sounds enticing to you, here is the original Portal game that started it all: http://armorgames.com/play/107/portal-the-flash-versionThis game is a puzzle game. You use a gravity gun whose stationary bullets move you towards it, and another one whose bullets repel you. You also have a shield, causing you not to be affected by those effects. You can just use once for each type, until your feet touches the ground. You use these mechanics, together with momentum to overcome some obstacles, reach some high places which is not obvious how to reach. Levels get progressively harder, introduces some enemies, some hazards, and new tools like free to move platforms, vanishing platforms etc to increase the complexity a bit.I really liked playing through it. The most used ""tactics"" is same for many puzzles, put an attractor, jump to it, put a repeller behind, cancel attractor then you are flying ahead.  Of course there are some others, and even using when to use that changes from puzzle to puzzle, and in the later levels, choosing where to put starting attractor also becomes a part of the question. But still, if this game was longer, it would be prone to become a chore. In current case, it introduces the mechanics, uses them all, tests whether you are really able to use all, and says farewell before giving you a chance to get bored.I have one minor and one more minor negative. First, minor one. Even though I can feel the effort put for attracting and repelling mechanisms, they dont work in a predetermined way. Sometimes you perfectly know what to do, still a milimetrical wrong placement of the ""bullet"" destroys your strategy. Not being able to assign moves from before hand, together with general difficulty of placement of ""bullet""s midfly, helps the feeling of glitchiness. I think there is no glitch here, only some calculations is not smoothed out. Really really really minor mistakes, even the ones that is not visible to the eye can cause to death.More minor one: In the last level, checkpoint placement sucks. I had to read through all of the Credits 50 times before finishing it. For the first 5 times, I thought ""Wow! Such a nice idea to implement credits here!"" Nearing the end, my thought was like this: ""These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are stealing my precious seconds again.""If you can oversee some minor problems with games like these, you will enjoy the effort and thought put here. There is also an extra ""New Game+""like mode, supposedly taking the option of attractors out, but I did not try it, so I cant comment on it. From what I have played though, I know that you will enjoy ""Aha!"" moments, and succeeding ""Finally nailed it"" moments. Not expect a perfect platformer or a hardest puzzle ever though. It is mediocre at both of these.TLDR:=========================if indie_tolerance==0{ignore;end}if indie_tolerance>0 and puzzle_love>0 and platformer_love>0{if cheapskate>0{get;end}else{maybe;end}}			"

												The ability to alter gravity in a platformer is nothing new, but using gravity wells to do so is a novel concept that I haven't really seen done- at least, not with player controlled wells. At 24 levels, Defy Gravity is pretty short, but...Despite only having 24 levels, this is one of the most frustrating games I've played in a while. To put it bluntly: the main mechanics don't work right. Sometimes the wells pull you in/push you away as they're supposed to, sometimes nothing happens. Often with the blue wells I found myself looping around the center and dying, simply because the game felt like it. The design of most of the levels, especially near the end demand near perfect control with this utterly broken mechanic.Oh, and your air jump replenishes weirdly, sometimes triggers on the ground (hello, death!), and cuts all horizontal momentum when you jump.Hard mode strips you of the anti-wells and the only way to get any reliability from the mechanics is to use both in conjunction.Literally the only upside to this game is you can buy it, turn around and sell the cards for more money than the game itself. I guess that it's short helps too, but really this is not worth the effort to play through.			"

												Altering Gravity is nothing new, however altering it with those Gravity Wells is somewhat new, and unexplored.So the concept is great. But you only NEED to use the Wells in the last few levels, the rest is almost completely possible without them.Another big issue I had was the limit of the Wells. You can only have to Wells at a time, with one being normal-, and the other anti-gravity. They don't have a timelimit so that's nice, but I would much rather have unlimited Wells with a timelimit than two infinite Wells.But it's only one dollar, so if you feel like playing a little platformer pick this up.

												This game requires good forward thinking, great hand-to-eye coordination and an unearthly amount of patience to beat, especially if you want to get all the achievements.The use of gravity wells to adjust your jumps is the gimmick in this game, it is implemented to the core style of play and you’ll find yourself using it pretty much for all kinds of situations. Thankfully, the mechanics are very easy to learn, though it will take more than a few tries for the trial and errors to take hold in experience.There are 24 levels in total, you can expect to die countless times on laser traps, football-like projectiles, collapsible platforms, shuriken shooting bots, moving walls of doom and the classic never-ending pits of doom. It won’t be unfair to call this game brutal, but you’ll have unlimited continues in your disposal, along with a save point practically after every trap.The length of this game will vary depending on how good you are at it, a speed runner can do this in 20 minutes, a good player may get away with 2 hours, it took me around 12 hours to complete it entirely along with the hard mode.If you are someone who likes a real challenge, get this. If you’re a casual gamer who can’t take setbacks very well, please avoid it like the plague.			"

												Although very simple, it's really addicting due its difficulty, but, most of this difficult, is just finding out the trick of each stage and their sections. The faults of the game that gets irritating are when, sometimes, the blue vortex fail to grab the character, or sometimes expel, and the other is the jump/jetpack, sometimes it doesnt work and sometimes activate right after jumping, killing the momentum. I managed to finish the game in the Hard Mode, and not because of that, I recommend, it's really worth a try.			"

												Defy Gravity is a fairly minimalist 2D platformer. The game’s controls are very simple:•	You can jump.•	You can double jump in the air (with a cooldown between aerial jumps – but it is possible to jump more than once if you spend enough time in the air, such as if you’re in a gravity well).•	You can create a gravity well which sucks you (and gravity-sensitive objects) towards it. You can create one of these at a time, and have two shots before you need to touch the ground again.•	You can create an anti-gravity well which repels you (and gravity sensitive objects) away from it. You can create one of these at a time, and have two shots before you need to touch the ground again.•	You have a shield you can activate which prevents you from being affected by gravity (and in some levels, it is always on).The core gameplay mechanics are decent enough – the game has a very minimalist set of elements (platforms you can jump through (some of which move on their own, some of which fall down a few seconds after landing on them), enemies you can jump on top of to kill them and jump again, enemies you can’t bounce off of, and an enemy that kills you if you touch it which shoots other enemies which kill you if you touch them, and ground that kills you if you touch it). Everything in the game moves in linear, predictable paths. Some enemies can be affected by gravity wells (signified by them being gold-colored), others can’t (signified by them being gray); the same applies to the platforms.At its core, the game presents about an hour and a half of puzzles with these mechanics, and it is simple enough; it gets progressively more difficult the further you get into the game, and the last few levels are quite difficult. The game is mostly pretty generous with checkpoints, but the second to last level requires you to get through fairly long puzzles without screwing up.Once you beat the game, the game puts you back at the start in hard mode, in which you no longer have anti-gravity wells and all enemies are affected by gravity, which makes the game significantly more difficult. But the levels are the same as they were before, though I think there might be a few modifications to make it possible to solve some of the puzzles which require too many gravity well shots to solve otherwise.In any case, this core gameplay is decent enough, and while the game is quite short (about 90 minutes to beat the regular mode), it is probably about as long as it wants to be.The real weakness of this game is the fact that there is really nothing else here. The game is extremely simplistic, the graphics are clean and clear but pretty lackluster and not particularly pretty to look at, there is no story, and the levels feel clearly designed to be challenges without actually even bothering to feel organic in any way (which, ironically, may actually make sense, as the premise of the game is that you’re in there to… complete challenges…).Anyway, while this game has a fairly decent score on Metacritic, that is likely because, quite frankly, there’s not much to criticize here. But there’s not much to like, either; this game is extremely forgettable and I feel like I’m going to forget it within a very short period of time. The game never wows you, and that makes it hard to really love it or even care particularly much about it.All in all, this isn’t bad. But you can probably find a better use for an hour and a half (or three hours, if you really want to beat the hard mode and get 100% achievements) of your life. This game is simply unremarkable. "

												I enjoyed this game because it's a very portal-esque platformer, except that it's much, much, much easier to die in this game than it is in Portal. In fact, dying is a good 70-90% of what you will do.Basically you play as a gravity-mancer, which is a person who uses a gravity gun to create bubbles of gravity and antigravity. With these bubbles, you will redirect yourself, platforms, enemies, and platform-enemies to try to survive a series of increasingly difficult puzzles. This game requires as much skill in execution as problem-solving, and is more fun to play than most $15 platformers out there with better graphics. On top of all that, it's cheap. If you like puzzles, platforming and difficulty, you should definitely buy this game.			"

												Defy Gravity is a tiny little physics-based puzzle platformer in which you manipulate your movement through the creation of gravity and anti-gravity wells, allowing you to conquer assorted obstacles. Almost everything about the game is somewhat reminiscent of the big days of browser-based flash games. Fairly generic music loops, non-existent story, simplistic art style, and a pretty short length compared to most games on Steam (30-60 minutes for a basic playthrough, or 90-120 minutes if you're including all achievements/hard mode). The concept's not too bad, but the puzzle design is somewhat repetitive and the difficulty progression is very uneven (the final supposed-to-be-climactic puzzle is actually one of the easiest rooms in the game).Overall, there are plenty of worse ways to spend an hour or so. Defy Gravity is definitely worth the summer sale price of $0.29 - especially considering it comes with Steam Trading Cards which you can easily sell back for more than that. At full price, however, the cost is a bit steep for the paltry amount of content here. Grab it if it's on sale and you have a huge fetish for physics puzzles, or not at all.			"

												+ Challenging, but fair puzzles+ Good music+ Charming- Short- The second half of the game is a copy of the first half, the difference being that you don't have access to one of your 2 powers.- Very basic sprite-based graphicsThis is an extremely charming game. It's a physics based platformer. The reason why it's so cheap is because it's a fairly short game (I have 100% on it, and I haven't been playing offline). You play as a sprite with the ability to shoot physics altering gravity and anti-gravity ""wells"". Think 2D Portal in which portals don't teleport you, they attract or repulse matter (including you). Apart from that theres a Bullet Bill jumping element to some puzzles, but imagine being able to influence their trajectory by shooting a well in the vicinity.Now, you gotta understand that Defy Gravity hasn't been made to look outstanding. I don't know what it is about it, but I can tell the devs were doing this out of love for making a game.Props to the music, it really clicks in with the puzzling around. There's no other notable sounds, the gun shooting is adequate.Graphics-wise... well its a 2D sprite game. It's also very blocky, and I do regret the dev's choice of font for the menus, but this is me nitpicking.The only true flaw this game has is how short it is. It's 24 levels with a hard mode for one more playthrough. It's arguably 48 levels long, but the difference between one half and the other is that you need to approach problems from a different perspective. A shame there is no climax to the game - it just abruptly ends.I say it's worth the price. I mean come on, it's the price of a cookie. Develop your brain instead of acquiring calories ;p. Just be sure that you're fine with dying a lot to find the solution. Don't worry though for the longer levels - there are frequent checkpoints (in my opinion too frequent).			"

												A decent game. You play as an astronaut basically, and you have the ability to create and destroy gravity fields at will. Gravity fields that either pull you in or push you out.With that ability you have to navigate through very tricky levels involving lasers, moving platforms and various other obstacles. It's a bit low on the visual side however it makes up for that with the gameplay. It's extremely difficult to master and the levels are very very challenging. I'm a huge Super Meatboy Fan (even finished the Cotton Alley on A+) and I would say this is harder than meatboy.I recommend this game if you are looking for a challenge at a low price. It's interesting, it's difficult, and it will make you cry... It will probably also make you regret your decision to buy it and actually try to finish it because of how challenging it is.Give it a try :)			"

												This is a clever take on the platforming genre.You are a space man who can ""fire"" two kinds of level changing shots.  Either an area of gravity that will pull everything, including you, towards it, or an area of anti-gravity, that will push everything, including you, away from it.  You also can toggle on and off a gravity shield that makes you immune to your own and any naturally occuring gravity fields.  Also, you can only have two of any kind of gravity field up at a time, and you have keys to destroy them?Sound like a lot?For me it was a little clunky to ever be intuitive to play.  However, the challenge of figuring out each level was still interesting.  The music and art was not fantastic, but it wasn't terrible either.  There were also not many options to adjust the experience.Still, I appreciate the unique mechanics and what they are trying to do here.  Someone who likes platform games would probably enjoy this more than me.6/10			"

It has a rather strange style, by using textures from retro games and giving them a twist from textures from newer games, you get this, a strange looking game 7/10Music - The games strongest point, great choice by the Devs to put in calm and relaxing songs, while you are being irritated by dying at least a 100 times on a single level, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEVEL 9/10Story - You can't say this game does not a have a story, yes it is pretty small, but it still does. Like many games, you are the chosen but first you have to prove yourself by going through a variety of (let's call it chambers) till you get to the end. Just to be suprised that you have finished nothing, you just unlocked hard mode. OMAHGOD 6/10Content - Hmm, well 2-3 variations of enemies,  a lot of rooms (chambers) to pass, get's even more difficult the more you advance, but hey an interactive selection menu. 5/10Controls - Rather stiff movement, now you will say (but hey he is in a space suit, he is confined to certain movements), to which I will respond with (well in some games people wear armors that cover their whole bodies and they are still more maneuverable than he is). Plays almost the same on a keyboard+mouse or controler setup. 5/10Gameplay - The game runs at a normal rate, nothing too fast or too slow, you can have as much time as you want to think how you are going to do the certain challenge or how you would like to approach it. 7/10Overall the game is a fun time killer, for a few hours or like me for probably a few days, GODDAMMIT, either you are going pass it with no casualties or with, have fun xD   Overall score: 6.5/10			"

												Really fun platforming game. Use gravity wells that pull things toward them or push them away to hop along enemies, move platforms around, try to avoid killer stars, and often accidentally fling yourself to your death. Somewhat short, but totally worth the price for how much fun it is.			"

												A nice puzzle platformer with a mechanic that feels very unique.You use a gun to push and pull yourself and certain objects to navigate through levels. Music is very nice with an atmospheric tone to it as well as the sound design. Honestly I sucked for the most part with this game so I ended up skipping through a bunch of levels even on hard mode lol. But I can tell you that this is a very good puzzle platformer if your in games like Braid and Portal.Rating: 9/10			"

												A decent game. You play as an astronaut basically, and you have the ability to create and destroy gravity fields at will. Gravity fields that either pull you in or push you out.With that ability you have to navigate through very tricky levels involving lasers, moving platforms and various other obstacles. It's a bit low on the visual side however it makes up for that with the gameplay. It's extremely difficult to master and the levels are very very challenging. I'm a huge Super Meatboy Fan (even finished the Cotton Alley on A+) and I would say this is harder than meatboy.I recommend this game if you are looking for a challenge at a low price. It's interesting, it's difficult, and it will make you cry... It will probably also make you regret your decision to buy it and actually try to finish it because of how challenging it is.Give it a try :)			"

												Defy Gravity Extended is an...uh...extended version of what was originally an Xbox Live Indie Game. I forget exactly what's different about this edition, aside from being a fair bit longer. Still, this is a game that can completed twice in about two hours (if you're going for all of the achievements).Everyone buys this game for the cards right? After all, this is one of those games that can be had for so cheap, players will profit just by owning it. While it's tempting to turn on idlemaster and do something else, IMO this is a game that is actually worth playing. The concept is interesting, the mechanics/controls are solid, and there's a fair amount of challenge to keep things engaging. The pleasant low-key soundtrack rounds everything out nicely. Defy Gravity Extended a pretty short game, so it didn't give me many opportunities to find things to complain about. Actually, I suppose the hit-box is a little too big, but the checkpoints are generous enough so it's not really a huge issue.Give it a go sometime.			"

												Well, what can I say, sunk a total of three hours into this and all three were completely gratifying, you basically play an astronaut thas can push/pull himself through a myriad of obstacles using either gravity or anti-gravity portals you fire around you to gain advantage and pass to the next level, it has a very net yaroze feel I greatly enjoyed.Obviously, there are a few minor imperfections and if I'm to outline them briefly they'd outline the players ability to perform almost an infinite amount of double jumps in the air which makes a majority of these levels a breeze, there were only two real moments I felt a slight urge to rage quit and no doubt you'll experience them too, but I reccomend you push on through to the best of your abilities.The game is a great little time passer with moderate graphics, gameplay and music, definitley worth the eighteen pence I spent on it and brightened up my Saturday, my biggest dissapoinment which I'll hide behind a spoiler tag was that  once you've beaten the game you're introduced to the idea of a 'hard' mode, sadly, I found this much easier than the normal mode and some of the level recycling felt like a cheap, albeit enjoyable way to extend the game another hour and a half, though some will definitley lose their patience with the heavy trial and error segments of the game.Game on.

												Defy Gravity is a fantastic platformer with great gameplay elements. This platformer utilizes gravity as the main mechanic. The player can create gravity and anti-gravity pockets to proceed through the levels. I would say that it has a similar difficulty curve as found within Portal, but it lacks story elements. Being a platfomer, however, it doesn’t require story elements, just quality controls. Graphically, it’s lacking, but having solid controls is what makes this game fantastic. This game also has a “Hard Mode”, which requires you to only use gravity pockets, and the enemies are affected by the gravity. This “Hard Mode” extends the gameplay you will find within Defy Gravity, but it doesn’t come off as too forceful. The only real reason to play through “Hard Mode” is to get all of the achievements. I will recommend this game to anyone looking for a new affordable experience.			"

												As with many of the people here, I bought the game during the steam summer sale for 18p. I wasn't expecting much from it, anything better than being completely and utterly broken would be nice.Defy Gravity is actually a basic but pretty good platformer with an overarcing mechanic, making 'gravity wells' that either attract or repulse you. It's difficult, but not difficult enough to get you over annoyed, always a hard balance to get in a platformer. The only real problem is the graphics, which aren't the greatest, but serviceable. Soundtrack's half-decent as well. Sold the trading cards for 22p, so made a profit from it.Overall, a cheap and cheerful indie game that can currently be bought for next to nothing. Worth it at the (admittedly low) full price.			"

												I bought this game just to see if a credit card worked.My sister's jeep broke down in a pretty big way, and we needed a credit card to be able to rent a car while her jeep was being fixed. We scrambled all across the house and dug through everything multiple times, with things going less and less right as the day went on, and her losing her patience with everything very rapidly.Then I found it. An old card.Problem was, it might've been a card that she thought she lost a couple years ago, and thus had shut down. She decided that the way to see if this would work, would be to buy a cheap set of note cards or something off Amazon, since she uses those for school. Amazon had different ideas, however, and wouldn't provide a checkout button. We were stumped, as we were both pretty sure that Amazon didn't have a minimum price limit, since it's not like they eat the shipping charge.Then she remembered Steam was a thing.We went over to my computer, and I searched for the cheapest game right now, which happened to be this game for a measly 14 cents. Without even looking at anything about it, I threw it into my cart and checked out. The suspense built as Steam processed the card. And then payment went through.We joked about how this game would be the worst game ever, and looked at the store page to see a very XBLIG-looking game. I booted it up, and played it just a tiny bit...And it was actually a legitimately good game. The graphics aren't exactly pushing my PC to its limits, but it's a fun little game centered around gravity manipulation, and I've spent more on worse. After playing it for a bit, I noticed the game was made by the people making Road Redemption, which is a game I actually really want.All in all, I'd reccomend this game to people looking for fun little puzzle platformers, or people who need to test out their credit cards quickly. Thank you, Fish Factory Games, for letting my sister rent cars with confidence.			"

												Okay, so sure, the game might not be the -prettiest-,  but oh my does it make up for it in gameplay! I completed it in 0.9 hours...and unlocked Hard Mode. And it is just the perfect follow-up to the normal game... because by that point, you've become the master... and it explains how you no longer have anti-wells, and you think ""Oh dear this WILL be hard!"" And then you eventually master THAT, and then a level comes along that wipes that off the board...In summary, a challenging but VERY satisfying puzzle game with a perfectly executed...gimmick thing.Gravity!And this may be the only game I get 100% of achievements... and only for £0.09!

												Defy Gravity is a very cool puzzle game where you use a gravity gun to either attract or repel yourself along each level. As the levels progress, new obstacles are presented and things become tougher. It is a very challenging game and some of the later levels look downright impossible. However, i was able to complete them all, even all the levels in hard mode. Sure it gets frustrating, but the checkpoint system is very forgiving. I had to lower my 2560x1440 display to 1920x1080 in order to get this to run full screen.Pros-Cheap price-Challenging gameplay-Smooth framerate-Extremely stable. Never crashed on me. I use Windows 8.1-Great mechanics-Good music (does repeat quite a bit but the songs never get old)Cons-Doesn't run full screen in 2560x1440-Not able to change key bindings. The ""W"" key is also jump and messed me up many times when i accidentally hit it. I picked this up for 29 cents. You can't beat that. Even the full price of 2.99 is good if you enjoy puzzle games that challenge you. 8/10 Very good. Great deal!			"

												Great value... fun challenging platforming with a interesting game mechanic ... you use gravity and anti-gravity to traverse across the world and at it's low price tag definitely a game you should give a shot.One minor complain is that the animaton quality and art style is rather basic but an awesome soundtrack coupled with some captivating backgrounds will mostly keep your mind off it.

												A nice little game with a system of simple game. The goal is to play with gravity, repelling or attracting, so simple, but the principle complex from level to level. Physical weird game and redundant music doesn't allow the game to reach the rank of great indie game, but only a good game. I recommend only promo.			"

												4/5 - This game is great, I enjoy playing it, however, sometimes, the physics just sort of deny me, especially the gravity wells. Instead of pulling me in, they just sort of throw me away and deny me access. Other than that, this game is fantastic and would recommend this.			"

												It's a really short but kinda fun game, considering the price though the length is pretty fine. But as an experienced player of Platformers I gotta say this game is way too easy. Once i figured out how to properly control all the gravity wells I started getting bored. Since I knew how to control the wells after a while i got through the ""Hard mode"" even faster than through the normal mode.. I guess it'd be more fun if you were worse at games like this. I'd still recomend it when its on sale, or not, it's cheap anyways.			"

												Okay, so sure, the game might not be the -prettiest-,  but oh my does it make up for it in gameplay! I completed it in 0.9 hours...and unlocked Hard Mode. And it is just the perfect follow-up to the normal game... because by that point, you've become the master... and it explains how you no longer have anti-wells, and you think ""Oh dear this WILL be hard!"" And then you eventually master THAT, and then a level comes along that wipes that off the board...In summary, a challenging but VERY satisfying puzzle game with a perfectly executed...gimmick thing.Gravity!And this may be the only game I get 100% of achievements... and only for £0.09!

												Defy Gravity Extended is an interesting game, to say the least.  I got it on sale for $0.29 and it was worth every penny (especially since I sold the trading cards for $0.37 :PI would highly reccommend this game.  The difficulty is quite high, but extremely frequent save points prevent replaying the same thing over and over.  Although the animation and graphics quality are not the best, they serve their purpose and don't really take anything from the game.  The replayability is not very high, but I got 10 hours playing through normal and turbo mode once.Overall, I would rate it a 9.32/10.  Exactly 9.32/10.			"

												If you are reading this on when the steam sales are still in, OMG, go and get this one and fast. You can see from the hour count it is not very long game, as I have beaten it once or even twice, can't realy remember... but that's the only downside of it - that it cant go any longer than it is!It is an Indie-2 dimensional puzzle game, very fun and relaxing yet not boring almost at any point. The story line - is not super evolved, as it is, a puzzle game. there is a small background explanation of the 'events' leading the player into the puzzle series, simple enough to make sense.The soundtrack - Unbelievably amazing. In fact, i haven't played this game for more than a few months now, and the reason i'm writing this is that i got on a loop of movies & video games OST, suddenly got back to the soundtrack of this game and remembered the fond memories i have from the music escorting me through the game levels as the get harder and harder. The tracks are neat, chill and relaxing and very fun to listen even outside the game. I'm almost sure i can speak for many when I say that the music is an undivided part of the actual gameplay.The Puzzles/levels - Very fun, despite the fact this game doesn't have crazy graphics. As I discovered, all you need is some obstacles and a nice gravity-controlling device to keep you grounded to the screen for 2-3 hours straight. Overall opinion: a good way of having fun in a relaxing puzzle environment, listening to good music and just taking a break from life. if you have some 'change' left on your steam wallet from big purchases and you're looking for something refreshing definitely go for this gem.

												An original and 'fun-to-play-for-a-while' puzzler! I have finished it twice to gain the last achievement for this game. A little repetitive because in Hard Mode there weren't that much differences (mostly the lack of anti-gravity production and the fact that all enemies/obstacles now react on gravity and come towards you). I only played it twice because I was in for a challenge and it became challenging at times. I'd say this game is nice for a brain training :) Recommended, even for the current price!

												Nice little puzzle game going with the theme of physics based utility guns. In Defy Gravity this gun is a device that creates gravity and anti-gravity fields. Player can also issue a shield against these special fields, which renders him (her?) immune to the fields but not the ""ordinary"" gravity. Strangely enough, some objects (it turns out they're the yellow ones) are affected by the fields while none of the others are.This makes for adequate puzzles: in any level you have to reach the end, while juggling between platforms and deadly blades. Dying is not a big issue: you'll respawn at a close-by platform and can continue right away. However, there are a couple of rather difficult spots, that might turn to be frustrating to get past.Then again the game is rather short. In mere 2.5 hours I completed both the base game and the hardmode that comes after, has more difficult levels and slightly different rules.If you like punishing puzzle platformers like Super Meat Boy or Adventures of Shuggy, this game is a nice snack (it even costs almost nothing). Musics are nice, and while there's no actual story, you will probably find it fun to be one of the universe's magnificent ""gravitomancers"".Regretfully, I encountered a couple of bad bugs along the way. First, the game freezes if you try to start a new game without having Windows Media Player installed. So, you have two options: install that or disable music (by -nomusic command line option). Another one was even more annoying: apparently some video cards (ATI Radeons) have a bug that the screen black-outs every once in a while. Very annoying issue. It would have been game-breaking, but it turns out at least I could work around it by doing double jumps (jumping in the air... so yeah) or going to Steam Overlay, both that repaint the screen. It does seem that the developers are looking into the issue, so hopefully it'll be fixed sometime in the future. It turns out the game was entirely completable and enjoyable despite these bugs though.			"

												Defy Gravity is a platformer. You might say puzzle platformer, but I’d just call it a challenging platformer in the vein of Super Meat Boy or Blood of the Werewolf, though Defy Gravity isn’t quite that infuriatingly difficult as those two. The gameplay was challenging enough to be rewarding but easy enough to be fun, I thought it was a good mix. The checkpoints were much better as well, being more frequent. If you die, you basically just start right before the last little challenge. Levels are fairly short. I think with SMB you have to start at the beginning of the level and BotW there are checkpoints but they can be pretty long at times. This game doesn’t really have any enemies either, besides some orbs, spiky orbs, and some sort of ships that shoot missiles or whatever. I don’t really remember about SMB, but BotW had more traditional enemies and super bosses. This didn’t have any of that. Mostly you are avoiding friggin laser beams on the floor or wall or ceiling. Sometimes you had to ride a platform through the level. The way it all works is that you have a duel gravity gun. You can shoot attractive gravity and reflective gravity. Attractive obviously pulls you toward it, so you can jump, shoot that and get sucked to it and then dispel it as you approach it to give you a little jump bust. Reflective will bounce you away, like a rocket jump. You have a double jump in the air. Pretty simple. You hold the LMB or RMB until you want it to stop, aim with the mouse. Movement with A/D. I don’t think a controller would help the controls, but they didn’t work bad. I think Q dispelled the attractive gravity, though it didn’t seem I could dispel reflective. Shift put up a gravity shield so they didn’t affect you. Sometimes a level would shoot it’s own gravity wells. The more challenging levels were when you had to ride the platform, which was propelled by your gravity gun, and also avoid everything else. Problem was that the platform would continue through walls if you weren’t careful, whereas you would not. Challenging. Presentation was pretty mediocre/cheap. It didn’t look BAD, but it was far from a pretty game too. I would recommend the game for people that like this type of game, especially for the price. It’s normally only 2$, which isn’t bad at all and it frequently goes on sale for like 90% off. I don’t mind it, but it’s not my favorite by far. So I played until I had the first three achievements (38%) for progress and then quit. I think it was about a half hour. There was no indication of what level I was on or how many there are total. Which is annoying as you don’t know how long the game is going to be. Though I suppose most games are that way, huh? "

The gameplay was challenging enough to be rewarding but easy enough to be fun, I thought it was a good mix. The checkpoints were much better as well, being more frequent. If you die, you basically just start right before the last little challenge. Levels are fairly short. I think with SMB you have to start at the beginning of the level and BotW there are checkpoints but they can be pretty long at times. This game doesn’t really have any enemies either, besides some orbs, spiky orbs, and some sort of ships that shoot missiles or whatever. I don’t really remember about SMB, but BotW had more traditional enemies and super bosses. This didn’t have any of that. Mostly you are avoiding friggin laser beams on the floor or wall or ceiling. Sometimes you had to ride a platform through the level. The way it all works is that you have a duel gravity gun. You can shoot attractive gravity and reflective gravity. Attractive obviously pulls you toward it, so you can jump, shoot that and get sucked to it and then dispel it as you approach it to give you a little jump bust. Reflective will bounce you away, like a rocket jump. You have a double jump in the air. Pretty simple. You hold the LMB or RMB until you want it to stop, aim with the mouse. Movement with A/D. I don’t think a controller would help the controls, but they didn’t work bad. I think Q dispelled the attractive gravity, though it didn’t seem I could dispel reflective. Shift put up a gravity shield so they didn’t affect you. Sometimes a level would shoot it’s own gravity wells. The more challenging levels were when you had to ride the platform, which was propelled by your gravity gun, and also avoid everything else. Problem was that the platform would continue through walls if you weren’t careful, whereas you would not. Challenging. Presentation was pretty mediocre/cheap. It didn’t look BAD, but it was far from a pretty game too. I would recommend the game for people that like this type of game, especially for the price. It’s normally only 2$, which isn’t bad at all and it frequently goes on sale for like 90% off. I don’t mind it, but it’s not my favorite by far. So I played until I had the first three achievements (38%) for progress and then quit. I think it was about a half hour. There was no indication of what level I was on or how many there are total. Which is annoying as you don’t know how long the game is going to be. Though I suppose most games are that way, huh? "

												Lots of players are buying this game because of the low price - at sales usually it hits -90%, meaning that you'll probably profit from it's cards.But about the game itself: it's a good one. You control an astronaut (?) who has a special tool/weapon at his service: it can shoot two kinds of energy cores: one attracts things near itself, the another one repels. Sounds really basic, but the level design is really good, some levels require thinking and puzzle-solving skill, while other ones are more like  based on timing- and aiming.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, if you don't mind the simple graphics, it's a really well-executed puzzler-platformer game with medium-high difficulty.

												As someone who's played a fair share of platformers and puzzlers and has pretty defined opinions about design and what ""difficulty"" entails, this game started out as decently fun and interesting. I enjoyed the music, and the title screen background art got my expectations comfortably high. But quickly, it feels like the game runs out of ideas for level design using the gravity gimmick. It starts to feel like a mediocre free Flash browser game - long segments of jumping on a slow stream of orb enemies, repeated ""use gravity to drag this platform around"" bits, and a lot of areas where the solution to the puzzle is to simply use the same bruteforce technique a few times, because the inconsistent physics will net you a win. Some of the puzzles that brag difficulty turn out to be boring - you have to place a grav/anti well at a very precise point that you won't realize is wrong until a full 10 seconds pass, so you try just a little bit to the right, etc. A browser Flash puzzle platformer game is the best comparison really, because of the inconsistent physics and drawn out level design characteristic of them. And the ""ultimate challenge,"" which is the game's sort of newgame+ hardmode, serves to limit your options to make levels feel even less creative to pass by removing anti-grav wells, and makes all enemies physics-based, allowing the often shoddy engine to make your play even less consistent than your first run. Ultimately, I gave up on that because I was bored, not challenged. Games like La-Mulana will leave you feeling challenged by the puzzles and platforming. Or, perhaps this game will as well. A lot of people seem to like the game, but I would have been bored of it if it were freeware. A lot of positivity about this game seems to repeatedly refer to the price point. A game at a comparably low price point which I will recommend in Defy Gravity's stead is Super Hexagon, a challenging game that tests skill rather than the sheer snoring patience required of Defy Gravity. Or maybe I'm wrong and don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about video games.			"

												First let me make one thing clear. I hate platform games, I'm rubbish at them and they drive me up the wall.Now we have that out the way. I paid £0.09 for this in the 2014 Christmas sale, buying it as many did for the trading cards which were worth more than the game itself. I expected to leave the game running in the background for the cards and that I would be done with it.Well, actualy no. As it turns out this is a good game. Yes it is a platformer and yes it did drive me mad at points. The game while not easy is asscessable for those not of the platform minded. When you die you rarely have to restart that far away from death and the nature of the game with your gravity gun the is rarely need for pin point jumping and landing. No timers, no lives limit, no scoreboards with the simple goal of reaching the end of each level to reach the next.Played for 30-40mins completed about a 1/3rd of the game, 2 or 3 parts = many, many deaths that took a few mins to get right. Other than that an enjoyable plesant suprise.Graphics = Circa late 90sMusic = InoffensiveSFX = Not the bestControls = GoodTutorial = GoodValue = Exceptional@ the current price of £0.09 anyone and everyone regardless of there prefered game genres should buy this game without hesitation.

												Short little game but cheap and I'd say worth its price. The gravity mechanics work well and the level design does plenty with them. I'd contest a few of the design choices (especially the second-to-last level which somehow manages to get EASIER or hard mode =.=; ) but overall it's a fair challenge without ever being overly frustrating. It's not really much about the puzzles as much as manuevering around and you're given a variety of ways to deal with scenarios instead of being stuck trying to figure out the one thing to do, which is what makes it pretty fun to play. The hard mode also rather well changes how the game is played and I didn't mind playing through all the levels again for it. Probably a fair purchase at full price and a really good deal on sale.

												To defy gravity means to not have gravity apply to the person.You could defy gravity in space although there is no gravity besides the gravity pulling you closer to the sun at a very slow rate. But other than that one main pull of gravity in space there is no gravity. Defying gravity therefore would be physically impossible without the help of external sources, such as airplane, jetpack, rocketship. If you were to defy gravity you would need to be able to bend Earth at it's will, deforming it's surface, messing with it's gravitational field, and messing with weather consistency.In the end it is physically impossible to defy gravity therefore meaning that this game is a hoax.

												Overwiew:Fun, cheap, and a cool concept you can't let down.The Pros:Awesome concept.Most of the time, if not always, on sale.Amazing soundtrack.Very puzzling.(also a con) The Cons: Can be frustrating. Levels are hard sometimes.Graphics are too simple. (if you don't like 2D games)Animations are almost nonexistent.Very puzzling.(also a pro)IN CONCLUSION:I'm very neutral about this game. It's cool, relaxing, but also has a fair share of cons.Honestly, I recommend it, but don't buy it unless it's on sale. It's not worth $2.I got it for 29c and didn't expect much, but it did and does amaze.TO SUM IT UP___________|Concept|Rating||Music     .|Great.||Design   .|Eh     .||Puzzling?|Very . ||Fun?      .|Very  .||Graphics|Bad   .||Animat.. |Bad   .||Price      .|Cheap.|OVERALL:I reccomend it, but it's your decision.

												Although Defy Gravity Extended can be bought at a really cheap price, the game is not ""cheap"" at all. I enjoyed every single minute of it. Made after a pretty basic mechanic, the game offers a decent amount of gameplay time and it also feature trading cards, which will make you back the money you spend on the game. I never thought I'll find it interesting, but as you progress, the levels become more bigger, more interesting and even the puzzles are starting to be a little bit harder.Why would I recommend this game? Because the developer knows how to deal with the market and understands that using basic mechanics in a good way can turn his platformer in a appreciated game that will make people try it out just because it's a catchy game (not only because of the price)! I wish I could say something bad about it, but at this price, I don't know what do you expect. Frankly, I consider this to be the best cheap game on Steam at the moment. And by ceap I mean under two euro!			"

With said gun, you must shoot blue and orange swirling vortexs to assist in passing each level in an effort to get cake and/or defeat an egomaniacal AI hell bent on testing, lots of testing, which... oh, wait, no cake or AI but you do have blue and orange swirling vortexes.The game seems fun with a pretty original CORE concept, and I would recommend it to friends, but the moment I read Gravity Gun I thought of Half-Life, obviously, and it's not something that will ever make me think of this game.

												Defy Gravity is a decent puzzle platformer. The gravity orbs don't always work as intended and at some places there is a lot of trial & error, but I had fun with this game. However, I stopped my playthrough after 45 minutes (roughly 60%) because the game started annoying me. At this point the game tells you that it becomes harder, and yes - it is, in a specific way. It's not really the level design which becomes more difficult to beat, it's your sanity. There are less checkpoints and they are horribly placed.The passages are not difficult to figure out, the game just reduces itself to trial & error. After each respawn you have to wait up to 10 seconds for the enemies or platforms to move so you can continue. Usually I die and then I think ""Whatever, I'll just try again"". I reached the point where I just Alt + F4 out of the game after the 10th death because the game makes me wait longer than I actually have fun with it. It just feels like a punishment for bad playing which is inappropriate for a game like this. Or it's just really bad level design.At least I had 30 minutes of fun. I bought it for 9 cents and I sold each of the 3 trading cards for 8 cents. The game is worth a try, but don't expect too much.			"

												Really intense platformer.Unlike supermeatboy, there will be times where you can stop and think. However it isnt like braid... once you are done thinking, the actions must be fast. Mixing both puzzle solving with fast execution.Basicly aside all normal platform stuff (jumping, platforms lol, things to avoid, etc) you have a gun that creates a repel field or a pull field. You must click. hold. shoot. so it aint simple as portal, for when you release, the gravity field stays. This means that you just dont shoot, you gota hold until the field is where you want... picture that while falling...The difficulty here is the amount of commands. Basicly you use more than 6 commands. You have jump, double jump (which recharges while falling), you have a repel field, a pull field, a cancel field, a immune to gravity effects barrier, plus all platform basic stuff.The thing is, you are sometimes expected to use alot in a really short time. so a difficult puzzle would go, jump, repel, double jump, pull field, cancel, repel, jump. Its just alot to control in a short intense amount of time.I definetly recommend it, but be aware its not your average casual puzzle... imo its a damn great puzzle and something i personally been waiting for (intense command/execution puzzles).

												Surprisingly fun. I got this game for 17 cents and that it the best 17 cents I've ever spent. This game has a cool concept and the levels are lots of fun. It looks like it was made on a very low budget but that does not detract from the fun at all. This game is great for its price.			"

												Defy Gravity is a puzzle game with a simple mechanic. You have a jetpack and a gun which manipulates gravity, and with this equipment you have to get to the other side of the room, avoiding obstacles using your gun, the jetpack or the enviorenment. It's not long but it can take a few hours to beat (4-5 for average players). The best thing about the game is the soundtrack, it will accompany you and turn something that could be very boring and frustrating into something interesting. I think it fits with the game, and personally I find the soundtrack very peaceful. For an indie developer with that people (during the credits i counted 6 or 7), the final result is impressive. It's cheap (2,99) but if you find it with a 95% sale, you will even get a profit with the trading cards!			"

												To defy gravity means to not have gravity apply to the person.You could defy gravity in space although there is no gravity besides the gravity pulling you closer to the sun at a very slow rate. But other than that one main pull of gravity in space there is no gravity. Defying gravity therefore would be physically impossible without the help of external sources, such as airplane, jetpack, rocketship. If you were to defy gravity you would need to be able to bend Earth at it's will, deforming it's surface, messing with it's gravitational field, and messing with weather consistency.In the end it is physically impossible to defy gravity therefore meaning that this game is a hoax.

												Overwiew:Fun, cheap, and a cool concept you can't let down.The Pros:Awesome concept.Most of the time, if not always, on sale.Amazing soundtrack.Very puzzling.(also a con) The Cons: Can be frustrating. Levels are hard sometimes.Graphics are too simple. (if you don't like 2D games)Animations are almost nonexistent.Very puzzling.(also a pro)IN CONCLUSION:I'm very neutral about this game. It's cool, relaxing, but also has a fair share of cons.Honestly, I recommend it, but don't buy it unless it's on sale. It's not worth $2.I got it for 29c and didn't expect much, but it did and does amaze.TO SUM IT UP___________|Concept|Rating||Music     .|Great.||Design   .|Eh     .||Puzzling?|Very . ||Fun?      .|Very  .||Graphics|Bad   .||Animat.. |Bad   .||Price      .|Cheap.|OVERALL:I reccomend it, but it's your decision.

												For the price, it isn't a bad purchase. It was fun to playthrough and some levels were quite challenging. The controls are a bit weird to use, but you get used to it. It's a gravity-based platformer with some nice features like gravity shield and anti-gravity. You control gravity to your advantage and you have to reach the door to the next level in every zones to progress. There's a checkpoint system in place too, so the is less frustating.To be fair, this game isn't the best, so if you have no games to play and are bored, might want to pick this one up.PROs:-Fun.-Easy to get started.-Very cheap.CONs:-Music is repetitive and cannot be muted.-Some levels are just alot harder than others ( at random points in the game, not really in the end. )-Game is completed in 3 hours.-Low quality graphics.

With said gun, you must shoot blue and orange swirling vortexs to assist in passing each level in an effort to get cake and/or defeat an egomaniacal AI hell bent on testing, lots of testing, which... oh, wait, no cake or AI but you do have blue and orange swirling vortexes.The game seems fun with a pretty original CORE concept, and I would recommend it to friends, but the moment I read Gravity Gun I thought of Half-Life, obviously, and it's not something that will ever make me think of this game.

												To defy gravity means to not have gravity apply to the person.You could defy gravity in space although there is no gravity besides the gravity pulling you closer to the sun at a very slow rate. But other than that one main pull of gravity in space there is no gravity. Defying gravity therefore would be physically impossible without the help of external sources, such as airplane, jetpack, rocketship. If you were to defy gravity you would need to be able to bend Earth at it's will, deforming it's surface, messing with it's gravitational field, and messing with weather consistency.In the end it is physically impossible to defy gravity therefore meaning that this game is a hoax.

												Overwiew:Fun, cheap, and a cool concept you can't let down.The Pros:Awesome concept.Most of the time, if not always, on sale.Amazing soundtrack.Very puzzling.(also a con) The Cons: Can be frustrating. Levels are hard sometimes.Graphics are too simple. (if you don't like 2D games)Animations are almost nonexistent.Very puzzling.(also a pro)IN CONCLUSION:I'm very neutral about this game. It's cool, relaxing, but also has a fair share of cons.Honestly, I recommend it, but don't buy it unless it's on sale. It's not worth $2.I got it for 29c and didn't expect much, but it did and does amaze.TO SUM IT UP___________|Concept|Rating||Music     .|Great.||Design   .|Eh     .||Puzzling?|Very . ||Fun?      .|Very  .||Graphics|Bad   .||Animat.. |Bad   .||Price      .|Cheap.|OVERALL:I reccomend it, but it's your decision.

												I got this game off scrap.tf and it is an absoulute bargain. I enjoy it, I enjoy how hard it is, I enjoy how easy it is. I love the simplicity of the graphics. The music fits so well with each level, whether it is hectic or relaxed. However, there is always a catch. The first few levels were a bit repetitive, but once you get to the harder levels it is not repetitive at all, which I find nice. Overall, I give this game an 8/10. If the developer were to add anything, if there was a ""Defy Gravity 2"", it should be a bit more complex.			"

												I haven't played much yet, I have just had it running in background. Today I decided to actually try and play the game. Not too difficult to learn how to move the character around with the grav and anti grav beam/shot things. Seems like a fun platformer, and from the other reviews is quite short. Nice if you like the sense of achievement that comes with finishing a game! I give it 7/10			"

												Nice and simple but a tricky game. Its like portal in 2D, but with vortexes, one pushing you and objects away, and the other vortex pulling you and objects into it.Only game on steam that makes you money :D since the trading cards you gain from the game are worth over twice the price of the game (9€cents, on sale).

												i was really sceptical about picking up this game, kinda felt dodgy at first but because of the overwhelming positive reaction from the community i gave it a try....I don't regret it, it's one of the best platformers and can easily compare to Oddworld. I loved how easy it was to play and how hard the challenges got...took me a few tries but in the end i completed the game 100%the only negative side for me was, how easy the hard mode was9/10(too lazy to spellcheck)			"

I don't know, i just felt like that the last set of levels weren't necessary.8.5/10I would reccomend			"

Still, it's an interesting concept that I haven't come across before and if you quit for a while and return with a level head you can make it all the way through and the sense of relief when you do is beyond words.

												Unlike most, I bought this game because it interested me, not because of the trading cards. It's a neat little puzzle platformer where you use gravity and anti-gravity to navigate through tricky space hallways... of DEATH. It's a nice game to play when your bored, and is quite challenging. I wouldn't call it great, but it is definitely good. The visuals are reminiscent of a flash game, the backrounds are kinda cool, the controls are good. Overall very average, performance-wise. However, the music is really great, and perfectly accentuates the loneliness of space.			"

												Just got this game, and I've played through about half of it, and I keep thinking how much I would have loved this game as a kid.  It has the right feel for an old-school platformer, but it is a puzzle game rather than a shooting game.  It's designed like a classic 2-D sidescrolling platformer, but the trick is that you have a gun that creates two types of gravity fields.  One pulls you, and one repels you (along with some obstacles).  This makes it feel in some ways like a 2D version of Portal at times, although the feel is very different.  I am breezing through the game so far, but I have played a lot of puzzlers and platformers over the years and don't usually find them challenging anymore.  I think an average player would find this game very challenging, and it certainly is inventive.  So far, everything about the game is good from what I can tell, with one exception.  The aiming mechanic on a gamepad is a little hard to fine tune, and it's especially hard to aim when in motion on a gamepad.  This is bad as some of the puzzles are best solved with mid-air field placement.  Meanwhile, the usual gripes I have with this kind of game (bad hit detection, erratic controls, poor optimization, graphics glitches, etc) aren't an issue here.  The game feels pretty solid with the single exception of the aiming system.  Pretty good game.			"

												I initially bought the game because of the $0.29 price tag, and planned to sell the drops which are worth twice the initial investment. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun the game actually is.Not only did I beat the game in one sitting, but I bought a few more copies to share with friends.The endgame (hard mode) will provide another hour or two of difficult and frustrating platforming.Profitable, fun, and unique. 11/10 "

												As an action/puzzle platformer, Defy Gravity is quite basic: its mechanics, while somewhat original, feel repetitive and tiresome after a while. The soundtrack is decent, but the minimalistic visuals are very lacking, and there is no biome diversity, nor any kind of visual diversity for that matter. In terms of story, there is not much to say: there is none. The only type of background information you can gather is the one found on the ""About the Game"" section of the game's store page, which is disappointing, as the game would have stongly benefited from a solid narrative. 2.5/10 However, as a money making method, Defy Gravity excels itself, as the money made from selling its trading cards are is far superior to the game's cost. Therefore, I recommend it to anyone wanting to make some of that sweet sweet Steam cash! $$/$$			"

												I'm going to go straight up and say that I did kinda buy this for the money. It's on sale for 9 pence so I decided to buy it and sell the Trading Cards for a profit. However this turned out to be suprisingly good.First off, the music isn't too bad for this type of game and the graphics... well why the f*** are people complaining??? It's not meant to be like GTA V Graphics it's a platformer! Anyway, it's a highly challenging game with good controls. It's absolutely worth the money... or the profit.The only bad thing is that it begins to get repeatative after the 3rd achievement you earn.Overall I would rate this 8/10Would profit again			"

												It runs. For sixteen cents, that's pretty good.In all seriousness, the idea of the game isn't bad. It's the execution that leaves a lot to be desired. The game is very basic- the menu is simple with next to no option, there's no story, no context, and the tutorials are just kind of shoehorned in. On top of that, the graphics are rough, the sound design is uninspired, and the controls are really awkward.If you can get it for a dollar or less, it's probably worth a look. For more than that, I wouldn't bother.EDIT: To clarify, no story or context is given in the game itself. There is an opening cinematic.			"

												Ok, so whenever a decent looking puzzle game is only $0.29 on Steam you need to buy it.When I purchased Defy Gravity, I said to myself “If it stinks, I’ll just sell the Trading Cards and make a profit”, like everyone seems to be doing these days.  After putting only an hour into this game, I have to say it’s actually worth more than what I paid. The game style and play might not be for everyone but it’s definitely worth a try.  I just love how the color of the gravity/repulsion wells, and the gravity gun itself remind me of Portal.Bottom line... it a great little game.			"

												Defy gravity is one of those titles that can really (and I mean Really) get you hooked up to your monitor. Not in that classical ""Oh I lost track of my life in this masterpiece of a thing"" way. In fact, if you are that type of gamer, unless you love to get frustrated, this game is most certainly not for you. That said, if you indeed want a game that increases your levels of stress and frustration, and leads you to a path of self destruction, by all means buy the thing.I'm actually writing this review after a short session, in the hope of finding the magnificence of this piece. And guess what? Got surprisingly frustrated and full of strong emotions that made me swear like a sailor. But that's the point of a good game... right?To conclude, 11/7,5 would portal again			"

												A basic but fun game, using gravity wells to help you progress through each level, It can be fairly tricky at some parts but still doable. I do have a few complatins about the game which are: The hitbox of the character, I've been killed countless times by enimies/lasers not even touching me at one point a moving enemy went past me, just above my head I stood still to figure out what I was planning next then all of a sudden... dead, by the same moving enemy. Another issue I have is that a few moving lasers don't kill you? The only reason I figured that out is because i mucked up on a level and jumped towards the laser to retry but no the laser just passed through me and I was unharmed, I don't know if it was supposed to be fake to hurry you along but it never really tells you anything past the tutorial level. All in all it is a good game its fairly short from what I can tell but enjoyable.			"

It's a neat little puzzle platformer where you use gravity and anti-gravity to navigate through tricky space hallways... of DEATH. It's a nice game to play when your bored, and is quite challenging. I wouldn't call it great, but it is definitely good. The visuals are reminiscent of a flash game, the backrounds are kinda cool, the controls are good. Overall very average, performance-wise.

												Defy Gravity is a perfect example of why you should never sell a game with steam cards for less than the overall cost of the earnt steam cards. If a game is run idle for longer than it is actually actively played, something bad happened.The game is okay. You manipulate gravity. I mean the premise alone was fun to mess around with. Game is ugly though, and slightly glitchy. It sure as hell isn't the WORST 19 cent game steam has offered me.I don't remember why I never finished this game. I think I just tuned out.			"

												Cute, fun, short game. Not terrible hard but not super easy, the textures got boring really fast though.When you die you have to wait for the entire screen to brighten up before you can see your mouse location as it goes dark aswell making it hard to go fast. (Dont hide the mouse from people like that it actually kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off)Really needs a button to remove the gravity wells and better instructions.			"

												Holy hell if that isnt a tough game. The initial levels took me about 30 minutes to go through but hard mode try an hour and a half. So here's my feelings on the game in 3 catagories...Gameplay:The gameplay is fun and easy to grasp, each level offers a new challange. The early levels are easy but as I got to the last 5 it took a few deaths to formulate a strategy. The gravity gun is a very interesting mechanic, left click fires a blue ball that sucks things in and the right click was an orange ball that pushed things away. I like the idea and would love to see the same concept done in a 3d environment. Overall, the mechanics were smooth and no glitches occured.Graphics:Not really an important part of this game as I'd have been just as happy with 8bit. The graphics are smooth and made for 1080p screens. The animations are basic with very few frames but this isnt really a con to the game. Really I think the artwork done for this game fit the theme and looked rather good for what it is.Sound:The music for this game is rather nice, one moment its calm and relaxing and then in some levels the music speeds up a bit for escape levels. One nice thing I'd like to note is that the sound enemies make when they bounce off of walls is there but not distracting. That I believe is very important and I'm very happy that they were careful about the volume of that ting noise they make.Overall I can definately recomend this game to casual and hardcore gamers alike. 10/10			"

												This is a nice short game with a good soundtrack.The concept on which it is based is very interesting, although it could be better implemented. You use your gun to create gravity or anti-gravity wells in order to make your way through the levels.Gravity is hard to manipulate and it can get frustrating to try so many times before succeeding, relying a bit too much on luck with the timings and the hard-to-predict behaviour of the wells.The controls are easy enough (although I had some trouble with the jumping, as it would only jump after I ran off the edge) and, again, the soundtrack is quite good.The graphics, however, aren't the best around, even though I believe the look somewhat agrees with the game. Nevertheless, the game is visually consistent and the space setting is always pleasing.With all that said, I found the game to be nice, but also frustrating and somewhat boring after a while. The good thing, though, is that it is short.All in all, it is a fun, short-lived experience, if you can keep your cool after dying so many times on the same spot because your gravity well didn't pull you well enough. I recommend you give it a try, especially since you can get it very cheap on sale.			"

												I got this as a weekly deal for $0.29 USD and I must say, pick this game up if you are into puzzle platformers.If you enjoy simple, yet challenging puzzle platformers, you will really like this game.The aesthetics are very simple but good - the space background is nice to look at. The music is very good, quite a bit of variety and I have been playing to both listen to the music and enjoy the challening puzzles. The controls are simple, however, you may need to practice getting used to manipulating the fields created by your gun - you can create gravity and repulsion fields. The learning curve is moderate, as the puzzles get pretty difficult once you reach the second half of the game - you will need to be good at timing to pass many of the stages. You can create one active field of each type with your gun, and you can fire twice - you will refill ammo whenever you touch the ground/jump on an enemy. The fields are destroyed when you place a new one, or you can manually destroy them. There is a shield you can turn on to ignore the effects of any fields. You can also double jump.Any golden objects can be affected by your fields, and many of the puzzles utilize this mechanic in a variety of ways. Your main hazard are purple lazers that will kill you on contact - your body explodes into several pieces (no blood), and this can be quite hilarious if you are dying within 3 seconds repeatedly and you consider the type of music playing (making it seem like less of a big deal). I've been getting into a lot of puzzle platformers, and the ones where timing is critical to completing stages are my favorite. In DG, timing is essential in the later levels. There are also several ways to complete the stages, and, if you experiment and become proficient with manipulating your fields, you can even bypass a few levels without having to use the objects the game places to help you.A very, very good platforming game, get it if you are even the least bit interested in this genre.Definitely recommend!

												Good soundtrack and gameplay.It is based on the use of portals to reach the door at the end of every level.The blue portal attracts, while the yellow one repels. You can activate a gravity shield to ignore their forces.A single hit means death, but you have infinite lives and lots of checkpoints.This game has trading cards, so if it is on sale you can sell them to get your money back, plus some profit.

												Defy Gravity was a game I was pleasantly suprised by. I picked it up for about $0.20 on a sale, and overall, it's a good game.  The game revolves around the use of a gun that shoots gravity wells, the blue gravity well, which attracts things, and the orange anti-gravity well, which repels things. This is a quite fun concept, and is used quite well. Now, if a gun that shoots one of each orange and blue glowy vaguely round objects to progress through a series of puzzles in some sort of challenge course sounds familiar to you at all, that's probably because it sounds a lot like Portal. However, it is actually quite different from Portal. No puzzle has one specific solution, and feels more of a skill-based platformer than a puzzle game. The puzzles are fairly loosely designed, so you can solve them in your own particular style. The game also looks nice, and the music is quite amazing. And after you beat the game, it starts Hardmode, which is implemented in a quite interesting way. Instead of just giving you trickier puzzles or a limited number of wells, it gives you the same puzzles, slightly modified, all enemies are affected by gravity, and you can only use regular gravity wells. This really caught me off guard, because for most of the game, I was using tha Anti-Wells in a sort of rocket jump way to clear the levels. I had to change up my playstyle, and it was kind of cool. However, my biggest problem with Defy Gravity is the bugs. These weren't just small things, they happened every single time I played. When I start the game, I always need to close out of it in task manager and start it again before the graphics will work, and on some levels you need to shoot a gravity well off before the graphics will start, which can get very irritating, especially if there's an enemy nearby. But despite these problems, I enjoyed it. It's creative and fun. If you can pick it up for a few bucks, I say get it. And thank me for not using a Wicked joke throughout this whole review.			"

												Sales review, with 95% discount, sold the trading card twice the amount I bought.The game itself is not bad as we can see from the review.Basically the game is about moving your♥♥♥♥♥to a door with the help of your super gravitation controller gun.It is easy most of the time until you got into a certain stage which is frustrating since you had to jump over and over again to finish the stage.Overall it is good puzzle game.

												This is a good game, but depending on what you're really expecting from a casual puzzle platformer, this game might not be for you. Takes a little effort and skills to go through late game, so you'll either end up enjoying it, or have more hair-pulling rage moments then you expect.Not bad to kill time when taking a break from the usual power gaming. But if you ask me, it should've been free, and not worth paying for. You can grab it when it's on sale, otherwise, there are way too many other options to choose from.			"

The game instantly turned into an extremely hard rage game with little forgiveness of death. It seriously took me 30+ serious trys to beat one area of a level, Yes, one little stretch of land is difficult as ♥♥♥♥.2/10Atleast I got this for 29 cents.			"

												Defy Gravity is one of the worst games I've ever played. The idea itself is not bad: armed with a gravity gun, you have to make your way through all kind of (jumping) puzzles. Not enterily original, but still.But. Almost everything else about this game is awful. Sorry for the harsh words, but I find no others means to describe my feelings during playing. Controls are very, very poor, which is disastrous for this kind of game. I played it on an Xbox360 controller, which should be fine, but alas, no.Graphics are even worse - even in the 1980's, games looked way better. Sound is almost non-existent.The only reason I can see to buy this game, is for the trading cards and the xp when you craft the badge. The game is, understandably, very, very cheap, so you can even make a few eurocents if you sell the cards. Oh, there are Steam achievements too, but I gave up after under an hour out of sheer frustration.No detailed rating, but surely only 3/10 or so - and that's just for the cards. Otherwise, it would be even less.			"

												As this game is only 9p with its' 90% off, I wasn't expecting much, but I totally underestimated this game. Comparing it to a 2D Portal would be a vague comparison, but they are pretty similar.In this game you have a gun which shoots a blue ray, a pulling force, and a orange ray, a repelling force. Using these forces you have to figure out puzzles and ways to get around obstacles (similar to Portal) and interact with the enemies around you. The style of the game reminds me of the retro side of games, but it kind of adds some sort of character to the game. Oh and also, it gets pretty hard I wanted to dieAll in all, I really think you should get this game. Not just because it is extremely cheap, but that it has so much to over and it really enjoyable. I am not near finishing it, but I definitively have my moneys worth (it did cost 9p for Christ's sake).			"

												I bought Defy Gravity for 0.09€ and it was worth. You control your guy (girl?) that has a swaggie gun thing that changes the gravity force of the place you shoot, while accompanied by a deep-space swag overload music and there is the challenging hard mode which I love-hate with all my heart.The graphics are not swag approved and there is also a lack of story.Overall it's fun and I would like a sequel, cause I got another 0.09€ to spend.

												For now - the cheapest game i've ever seen, cheaper is only a free one.So ""pluses"":+ A good game for having a rest. + Good musiс set. Though it has only several glees, they remind me the 80th-90th - the songs of space theme improve the environment.+ The game makes you think about your tactics and rapidity, that's why you should strain your logics.+ Short levels and frequent autosaves - that will help you not to break you pc, when you try to handle a level.And minuses:- Sometimes the character doesn't jump, but i don't know whether it is a bug or i do something wrong.- The cost justifies the game itself - rather short, but i don't think that the aim of the game was to involve you for many hours. Just to pass it through once and then play just when you don't know what to do.If you are a game collector - buy it. If you like arcades - buy it. If you like space songs reminding the 80th - buy it. A fortiori that it costs only $0.07 when it is on sale.			"

												If you don't like paying for flash games then don't buy this. It really is not much different from something you can find for free online but there are a lot of people who spend more on trading cards than this game. It's worth the price. I felt a bit of nostalgia to platforming games when I was playing this. The soundtrack is the icing on the cake. It's a great game for what it is.			"

												What the hell?! The game is now so much more expensive than it was before!This game is surprisingly good for its former price. Pros: the difficulty is just right: it get's more difficult as you advance, but not to the point that you want to throw your computer against the wall. Cheap. At least it was. It was so cheap that you would actually make money from it by selling its cards! Easy 100% achievements; the graphic sprites aren't great, but are ok;  sound effects and music are satisfying. is not repetitive.Cons: if you have high expectations, this game will be too simple for you; no controls rebinding; not worth its current price; poor interface; one short gameplay and nothing else to do. No extras.For its current prince (BRL 6.29, USD 2.99), I do not think it's worth, but I will say it for my experience with this game, not only actually playing the game, but also considering the price I paid — almost nothing (BRL 0.24, which is USD 0.07): it was worth the value, so I recommend this.

												Not sure why this game isn't just another flash game out there. Also not sure why it costs money but it is a bit entertaining. Good for an hour until it becomes stale. I don't expect games to last for a year esp for linear games like this. If you want to go and buy this game for 9 cents, 14 cents, 49 cents, go ahead! You have my full encouragement. It's just I wouldn't buy this game if it wasn't on sale. Fun game overall with challenging puzzles and good soundtrack. 7/10			"

												So Defy Gravity, quite a nice platformer, and I'm very terrible at these -.-. But this has handy mechanic which puts you in control of two wells one is pulling you (and other objects) towards it, the other is pushing you away. This allows for some dodging and jump'n'run action. Additionally you have a shield to protect you from these effects. I liked:++ unique gameplay mechanic+ cheap price (0,09€ in Steam Sale), extremely good value for your money+ challenging but doable, either with try and error or a by planning ahead++ multiple solutions for puzzles+ relatively fast respawnI disliked:- not so good collision meshes- no visual difference, levels are all looking similar to each other, variety would improve the overall experience- story is missing :((((- strange point-and-shoot feature, which requires timing (only when you release the mouse button a gravity well is created)- controls are unchangeable (but there is controller support)At the time of writing this review I did not finish the game once, but I think I may need a total of about 4 hours with my bad skills...I would recommend this game, because of its new mechanic and it is a great game to spent some time.

Well, its actually a really fun and challenging puzzle game that surprises you with what it will throw at you next. I almost forgot to mention the amazing soundtrack to this game, it is the perfect music for when you beat a level or in progress of completeing one. Unfortunantly, The only thing that bugs me are the horrible graphics but you get used to them over time...Since this game has trading cards that most sell for 0.09 cents each, and if you buy this game under 0.25 cents, you will literally make a profit from this game. It's like they are paying you to play their game!Pros:-Challenging-Fun-Great Soundtrack-Hard mode for replayabilityCons:-Graphics			"

												This puzzle platformer is an enjoyable, quick, and (for this generation) hard game. Its achievements, although slightly buggy, are easy and basically the only drive you have to continue. I, personally, found this game fun although at points it got on my nerves because I died over, and over, and over again. However, I know quite a few people who didn’t like it at all so if your inpatient or have lots of good games to play, don’t buy this game. I bought this game on sale for 17 cents and sold its cards for more than that. Yes, you read that right and let me say it again 17 CENTS. It’s really hard to go wrong with a game you earned money by buying. In conclusion, this is a cheap game that’s an easily 100% and is actually quiet fun (for a 17 cent game anyways).			"

If you're standing on a golden platform and make a blue portal in order to move passed a projectile, the portal may cause the platform to just start bouncing in place making you hit spikes if you're too close.

												Defy Gravity is a nice little puzzle game that can be fun but challengeing at the same time. With its little sound track of three songs as far as i can tell but they do go with the theme of the game. A comparison for this game and from all the games I have played and seen its a little like Portal but without haveing to go thought walls. instead you use the force of the gravity gun witch is what is game is mostly about. Only dissapointment though was that i didn't notice any consellations in the background of space maybe they where there maybe not.But anyway Defy Gravity is worth checking out for the 0.19 cents.

												Got this on a whim when it was at 0.29$, definitely worth every penny! The difficulty of the game is slow at first but picks up half way through, which may catch some people by surprise depending on how they played. The mechanics worked just as they should, and while the enemy objects had a bit of a clunky hit box, they were not too hard to get around. Takes a few hours to play all the way through, but a good game at this price nonetheless! 8,5/10			"

I almost forgot to mention the amazing soundtrack to this game, it is the perfect music for when you beat a level or in progress of completeing one.

												This game is nothing but frustration. There is no real point to it and all you're doing is dodging one obstacle or another. It's not very hard to do any of the tasks, but each one can be incredibly frustrating just from the stupidest of things. I personally don't like this game and don't think the majority of gamers would either. Didn't enjoy it, thumbs down. 4/10.I beat pretty much the entire game before reviewing, as well.			"

												OK, so I bought it with 95% off for 0.14$ only, which is practically free.And yes, I guess that even for the full price of 3$ it's okay, well it is an indie game.But you should know that this game is very buggy, and clearly not test-played well enough, as the levels are far from perfect. Third way through, 0.5 hrs on record, I'm already growing weary of it, as the levels are not as challenging as they are tedious.Now, the concept is good and with a better game design it actually might be a great game: for starters, we should not get all the powers at the first level, but attain them as the game advances. This way it won't be so easy, with so many ways to tackle each obstacle, and it won't have that premature feeling of exhaustion.The way the game is right now, I would recommend avoiding it; it is cheap, but probably doesn't worth your time. I have played many, many indie games over the years and none of them was sold half-baked as this one.			"

At least they could do some kind of help tool if you get stuck and you can't proceed to the next bloody hard level. I had some good hopes for this game but I guess I was wrong. I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy it it just doesnt seem to be in my likings. I don't recommend this game for people who rage a lot because it will ruin their life sorta. Rated 6/10!			"

												""buy da game wen it on sale den sel da cards for more!1!!"" - Every review for this game, ever.This game is actually not that bad on the early stages, it introduces you to all the aspects and all most the enemies, now that wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the stages in the later game get really bloody boring, and tedious. To the point where the puzzles aren't fun, just a grind. If you're going to get this game, get it on sale, don't get it for the full price, it's not an awful game, but I still can't recommend it to anyone to actually play. So, as every other review states;1. Buy the game when it's on sale2. Idle for the cards3. Sell the cards on market4. Profit.			"

												The game feels fine. It's a solid puzzle game. It does the whole ""I'm trying to be portal"" thing in the first act, and there are a few gripping, quick-paced moments, but it's all ruined by the ATROCIOUS art style. The fun part of an indie game is the simplicity, sure, but when the art style is this neglected, it all feels very sloppy. They even describe the character, when obviously all you need for this game is ""You are a dude in a space suit. Have fun."" Sure, I got what I paid for at a staggering 0.23 or so USD on sale, but that isn't saying a lot. Hell, the font the WHOLE GAME uses is the default one from MS Word.All in all, unless you just want to waste .30 cents, don't get this game. Play a flash puzzle game instead, those are fun and usually free.			"

												It's a very good physics-based indie platformer game. Great for wannabe astrophysicists and space lovers. In this game, you've to work your way through the Gauntlet (a space competition) as a female space ninja, Kara, who can bend the laws of physics using Grav-wells and Anti-wells. If you're creative and played games like Angry Birds Space and liked them, you'll like it too! It develops your problem solving and lateral thinking skills because certain levels in the game are quite challenging. The soundtracks are also great and help you to focus on the gameplay. But the game is very short. Newbies may find the latter levels quite hard (some may even have to retry up to 10 times). It's recommended to buy this game on a sale because you can make a profit by selling the card drops as the price drops to $0.14 only!			"

												This game CAN be fun, but there are a lot of bugs and room for improvement. Like with the ammo system, there is nothing saying how much you have so you could be one shot away from survival but you would fire and nothing would happen, causing your imminate demise.Do NOT get unless your prepared to break something.

												If you want to buy this game, wait for it to go on sale for $0.14, like when I bought it. This way you can make profit off of a video game! If you like the portal games and 2D platformers, this is the game for you! With wielding a gun that shoots a suspended ball that either pulls or pushes on your character, and with many obstacles to avoid and navigate, It makes for an amazing puzzle game. And its cheap too! With only a $2.99 base value and when on sale, super cheap, anybody can experience such an awesome game for little money. It also has a very intense difficulty curve that when you get that 3rd or 4th achievement, you'll notice that the game isn't as easy as it was before. It doesn't even take that long to get to that point either. So if you want a puzzle 2d platformer that's not very advanced and takes skill to play and learn, then go ahead and get this game because honestly, it was the best $0.14 I've ever spent! It even comes with trading cards (how I earned profit)!			"

A friend of mine quit the game because he couldn't do the levels after 4th that but if you have played Super Meat Boy like me you won't find it that hard. :D I got it on sale and now after selling the cards it will be almost or even free. Definitely recommend it, it's really cheap when on sale, if you don't like it you won't lose much. :)			"

												Absolutely amazing game. Worth the price. It has the style of portal, without portals. You have a gravity gun (how many volvos am I going to refrence today?) that shoots gravity wells. They will suck you in or push you out- a black hole concept, while trying to get through the Gauntlet. You go through a series of waves of enemies, and if you truly want to put your skills to the test, at the end, there is a hardmode.Pro 1 ABSOLUTELY AMAZING soundtrack. It fits perfectly.Pro 2 Unique game mechanics. I have never seen them before.Pro 3 Nice and cheap, especially when you have a coupon that makes it 74 cents :PCon 1... hmm... hard to think... Short? Sure, why not? I'm sure they'll update it though.8.9/10. Would spend the extra 3 dollars to play it.			"

												If this game is on sale, it's probably stupidly cheap and well worth at least the trading cards you get from it. It's a fairly short 2-3 hour full game if you're already good at platformers in general and getting a feel for game mechanics, but the music change-ups can keep you around if you're halfway in and might start to get bored. The music gives you a feeling of purpose, with a trippy dreamscape allure, or some such shaite( I dunno man, I'm no critique). I love that the music corresponds to certain level themes, it's what really distinguishes this from some flash game on Kongregate. That, and the good amount of difficulty later on and in the ""Extended"" portion(basically just hard mode).Overall, keep it on your wishlist and wait for it to cost like thirty cents at the most, it runs very smooth for what it is, so no glitches just dreamy atmosphere, simple game mechanics, and yada yada good things to say about this game.

												Even for a really cheap and simple game, this is a great platformer, it requires a good amount of skills to go trought the harder parts of the game, it's original, it's smart and simple. As a veteran gamer I actually loved it, gameplay is awesome, and the music is just amazingly beautiful. I would totally recomend this game to people who are looking for a good 2d scroller platformer combining classic stuff with new mechanics. But seriously.. the soundtrack is just amazing! Cons: It was kind of short, it deserves a part 2 or at least a DLC with new levels.			"

												Simple, puzzle game using a gravity gun to bypass obsticals to reach your goal. There are lots of autosaves to help yourself on your way. Its kind of short which is nice if you want to add another perfect game to your collection. Its one of those games which quickly challenges you to complete it, as its simplicity is deceptive. You will find yourself with tense calves, and lurching playing this game ... nough said.  "

												Defy Gravity is a very interesting game. You play as some astronaut guy and you traverse levels using a ""gravity gun."" This gravity gun can create portals that attract you toward them and portals that force you away from them. The gameplay mechanics and level design of this game are actually impressive! The game starts pretty easy but near the end some levels are litterally the deepest pits of hell. The ""hard mode"" of the game, which is unlocked after completing the normal mode, is actually much easier because you don't have to deal with the anti-gravity portals. Anyway, Defy Gravity is pretty fun, and on sale it's definitely worth it! (I got it for 29 cents.)Gameplay: 10/10 (Very fun game!)Dificulty:10/10 (There were a couple levels that actually disemboweled me...)Replay value: 8/10 (I can definitely see myself playing it again! And dying many more times...)			"

												This game is not worth any money it should be a free to play game. It has a slightly higher production value than a flash game. Unless you want to purchase it for the steam cards don't buy it at all.			"

												Best game you could ever buy. A simple puzzle game? No, this goes way ahead of that. A simple cheap game to get some change back? Obviously not, this games gives you so much more than money or cards. This game is an experience, this game is a dream made true, hopes are being made every single second you pass playing this, you are becoming more human the more you play. I'm sure that in a couple of years from now we'll see this game head to head with things like Ocarina of time. Only time will tell they say, but we know that time will give this game his true place.The dream, the hype, the game of the millenmium. "

												This game is fun, but the controls are ridiculously hard to handle and prevent you from really having a good time in later levels.  You have to contort your left hand when playing with keyboard when you want to move any direction after disabling a gravity well or try to press the diectional button as soon as you press a disabling button, and that isnt as easy as it sounds, especially in the later levels where you have to keep pace with a moving platorm and you don't have tie to set yourself up to make the movements.  Aiming is also fairly difficult, becuase the game camera is not always centered on your character, so your crosshair might not be where you want it when you need to use it.  Crosshair style 2 kind of fixes this, but sets your crosshair at a fixed radius, which might not be welcomed by some (including myself).The concept behind this game is novel and fun during the easier stages, but when the difficulty ramps up, you begin to realize just how bad the controls are.

												Defy Gravity is a pretty challenging and fun platformer if you can ignore the bad graphics and the overall presentation.You play as what seems to be an astronaut with some sort of a gravity gun that can create gravity anomalies that help you advance through various levels, some of which will require a lot of thinking and planning to complete.The game itself is fun and there's definitely lots of hours of gameplay here, so really the only downside to all of this is that it looks a bit amateurish due to poor graphics and mediocre sound. But don't let that stop you. It's actually pretty awesome.			"

												It's a simple yet beautiful puzzle game that actualy stumped me a few times. It's hard mode is also very impressive, as instead of a standard more enemy HP/time limit/etc, now you can't use anti-gravity wells which forces you to go all ninja everywhere on the map. All the enemies are also now effected by regular gravity wells, so you shouldn't stay in a particular well for very long.Amazingly well thought-out game. Definately buy this.			"

If I had to give an overall score, I'd say this game's about a 7/10. Visuals aren't anything special. Gameplay is nice. Music is pretty good as well. Chances are, the gravity mechanics will make you rage at some point. Good game overall.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												When I bought this game for $0.14, I only had the trading cards in mind. What I actually paid for was a fantastic platformer with a very unique and interesting concept to fuel the open-ended movement style: gravity.Pros:+Gravity at the dispense of the player is an amazing concept that the game executes beautifully+Freedom to make it through levels as you'd like: while the levels are indeed linear, the strategies the player can use to traverse them are not+""Hard mode"" that extends replayability+It cost me $0.14 manCons:-I finished the game in about an hour and a half; however, even at the full $3 price tag I'd be plenty happy with what I got out of my first time through-As far as I'm concerned, the game has no story whatsoever other than that the protagonist is a woman named Kara with a special ability.These cons mean nothing considering the pros though, and it's a shame to know so few people have heard of this game. I recommend anybody pick it up.			"

												This game is plain ugly, visually inconsistent and I could swear it's using stock images and ripped assets (Twenty bucks the completion sound is same as Warcraft 3's ping sound!). This is like one of those ugly Greenlight games that should never pass, and don't ask me how it ended up on Steam on the first place, being rather simple and unsighty.Still, there is one excuse for it: Next time it will cost like 30 cents, buy it and you'll get yourself like 45 cents worth of cards!  Economics, aren't they awesome?			"

												Hmm, not that bad of an Indie game, but not for everyone, definitely    not 'casual' or friendly.Pro- music is nice- interesting gravity controllsCon- art style is generic- platforms twitch around gravity and drops you off- lazers everywhere like spikes in VVVVVV- after like half of the game becomes very hard or just need to be lucky :D4/10 rating.

												Revision: After playing a little more with this game all I can say is: The Physics in this game are way to unpredictable to be fun. The only reason to get this game is to make money by selling the trading cards when it is on discount. Other than that: Avoid it at any cost.Original Review:Ok, I got this game in the same sale as assumely most people here atm.The game idea itself isn't so bad. You are an astronut :) holding some sort of space-gun. With this gun you can shoot two different types of missile-like projectiles that aim the direction you're pointing the cursor at and explode as soon as you let go the mousebutton.One of the projectiles creates an orb that sucks you in and the other one creates one that pushes you away. You have a doublejump too but you won't get very far in this game unless you master the correctly timed placement of those two orb-type-thingies to drive your player around the different courses.The difficulty curve starts fair and easy and there even is a tutorial at the beginning of the game explaining all the different things you can do. But really it isn't much more as I mentioned before. There are some types of ""enemies"" though. Some cannot be touched but jumped on and another sort cannot be touched at all. If you do so nonetheless you'll get killed instantly.Sounds interesting eh?Well it is (as long as you can cope with the plain graphics and leveldesign). But there is one major flaw that renders this game nearly impossible to play at higher levels: The physics everything is based on really aren't that perfectly done. I died plenty of times because the player sprite fell through a correctly placed push-orb or didn't get sucked to a suck-orb.And yes this sucks (even without any orb) and so pushes one away from the game way too soon ... Without these flaws it could easily be a nice game because, as I said in the beginning of this review, the core game idea is good. But due to the fact of the imperfect physics I think that most players won't get very far ...But what the heck. All in all you get this game for free because you can always trade in the trading cards and maybe even make a few bucks plus this way. So maybe I'm just a sucker at this game and you will have great fun with it.For the price they're asking right now you should give this game a try if you're into platforming action-puzzlers. At least you can't loose anything in the process ...			"

												Ugh, this game is alright, I suppose. Definitely not the worst game I've ever played.The controls are horrible, for a start. I kept messing up because instinct told me to hold W, even though that is jump and holding jump is liable to get you killed, because space is also jump, and you can't jump if you're holding both jump buttons.Graphics are Flash-era. The game is too, sort of.The puzzles are... Some of them are easy, some of them are hard, and some of them are just deathtraps to annoy you. Mostly deathtraps. Checkpoints are placed before/after every puzzle, which is nice.However, working with gravity and anti-gravity, well... it's a fun concept, and it was fun at times in this game as well, but due to the fact that most 'puzzles' are just deathtraps with tons of hazards, it's not really that fun.The music is alright, though.Oh yeah, and don't try playing this game with a controller. You need the high sensitivity of a mouse to even attempt half these puzzles.And the dev is fishy, too. Bumping back the release date just so it always appears in Upcoming Titles. Considering the publisher's name, I shouldn't be surprised.(get it? fish factory, fishy dev? ah, forget it) "

												The game mechanic is interesting, but that's pretty much it. The game wasn't polished enough to keep up my interest after attempting the same stretch of level ten times over before being able to reach the next part. I'm usually more pationt than that, but not with this game. Get it on sale just to experience the innovative mechanics, but be prepared to put it away after a while.			"

												It's hard to reccomend this game at full price, but I guess it's okay if you snag it in a sale.The game consists of platforming and using a gun that can create gravity wells that either pull you in or repel you. You can probably beat the entire game in under an hour then replay it again on hard mode to get the final achievement in one more hour.Some of the puzzzles are legitimately difficult which was fun. Hard mode was great. This game is just so very short.			"

												This is what I call a very good game. I found that the later levels are a bit on the hard side but it is still fun. The story is basic but good, the gameplay is rather basic but good as well. GAMEPLAYIt's pretty much like Super Mario with a slight twist.You have a gun that creates gravity wells and anti-gravity wells.The gun helps you through the levels.There are also different ways you can get through the maps as well.MUSICI think the music really matches the game, I give it a 4/5.GRAPHICSThe graphics are basic, nothing earth shareting but still looks good.OverallThis is a great game for it's price.It has very good gameplay, music and graphics.I recomand this game to anyone who wants to buy a cheap game on steam.

												This is the perfect game for people who like everything and are easily impressed. There is some fun and satisfaction to be had solving these puzzles but other people will find them annoying and tedious. And the levels are unpolished. The world of Defy Gravity is not a vibrant world alive with colors and life or amazing artwork. Its a pretty drab place that made me want to kill myself the way it constantly reminded me I was wasting my life playing it.I don't remember the music. I didn't like the controls. I did like the way they didn't keep sending me all the way back to the beginning. If they'd done that I would have actually been mad so I thank them for that consideration. The price was right but I fear that someday soon I'll have a need for that 29 cents. I hope they use the money to buy some talent and good ideas. They are sorely needed.			"

												Terrible controls do not make a game challenging. They make a game absolutely terrible. This game has some of the most interesting concepts wrapped up in what I can only guess is Baby's First Program. It is too convoluted to use a Gamepad with, and the buttons are too twitchy to make using a keyboard much better (How many times I've double jumped simply because I was trying to jump once and move forward...)Avoid at all costs. I got this game FOR TWENTY NINE CENTS and even got Steam Trading Cards to actually make it so the game PAID me to play it.I still feel like I wasted my money.			"

												This is a rather nice puzzle game for a low price, except for one annoying bug. At the start of every level, the screen will be black until you shoot a gravity well. The screen will also become black randomly in the middle of a level if you haven't got any gravity wells out, which can be quite annoying if you're in the middle of a death-defying jump.Needless to say that I can't quite enjoy this game as I should. Until this bug has been fixed (which I understood the dev has been trying to figure out for over a half year now), I can't possibly recommend this game as it's more annoying than enjoyable.To show an example why this is rather annoying... in one of those levels there is a laser beam heading your way, and you have to get to the other end of the level as fast as possible. There are a rather lot of spikes on the floor and you have to jump with a floating platform and time things nicely. Now, imagine jumping with a hot laser beam on your tail and you need to be able to look where you are jumping off to, and suddenly the lights go out for no reason. Very likely you're going to die, and the screen stays black even when you start over. The hot laser beam, however, is still heading towards you in the restarted level and you won't see it until you shoot some random gravity well just to notice you're too late and died again. Rinse and repeat.			"

												This game is impressively bad. There's a crashing-bug on the first screen unless you use command-line options to force it into windowed mode and disable the music. Once that's sorted out you find yourself in the midst of the kind of ""I made this in just 30 minutes"" shovelware that you'd expect to see with a low score on a flash games site. (NOTE: THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION.) The controls are poor, the concept is moderately amusing, but very poorly executed. There's no storyline of any sort beyond the opening screen. The graphics are garbage.I felt like I should exercise some restraint in making harsh criticism, since this smacked of ""baby's first vidya gurm"", but then I got the trading card with the girl showing her cleavage, which I figured would be worth 5 seconds of amusement. Then I clicked on it to see the full-sized version and instead of showing the picture on the card it showed a gameplay screenshot.This is a troll game. Don't waste your time.This game goes on sale sometimes for $0.29 USD. The cards are currently worth about $0.08 USD, and you get 3 of them, so you can get this game for a nickel. It's worth about a dime less than that, though.			"

												...too easy. Seriously.----------1) Bad graphics. Really bad effects. The object are everything but nice, the background is probably a random image from Google, and the walls...did you just copy the walls from another game, and took out the particles?2) Bad music. I never saw epic music...also bad, epic music...mixed with sime xx-bit sounds, probably MIDI if not xx-bit, and on a ""space"" game too.3) Easy to understand how it works...easier to understand how levels should be made. The hard part? The mouse cursor is useless. You have to wait for the right amount of time, and the job is done.			"

												Defy Gravity is an action platformer that is a mix between classic platforming and gravity based puzzle solving. Kara, our heroine, has access to a unique gameplay mechanic that she uses to manipulate the world around her. She has a gun that is able to alter the laws of physics through the creation of pockets of gravity and anti-gravity. By mastering the use of these abilities Kara is able to augment her jump in order to almost fly past obstacles. These powers can also be utilized to move objects that block her path and platforms that Kara stands on in order to traverse the levels.			"

												Right so after just half an hour, stuck. Blazed through tutorial, came across one puzzle and...its impossible. Literally impossible. And you aren't offered a tip or even a skip, nope. Apart from that, very boring graphically, cool concept but literally a reskinned 2D portal with a slightly different mechanic. If its on special sure try it out.			"

												Very low production values, but surely more than excusable for a game that costs $2.99 normally and is often on sale for $0.29. Other than that, a surprisingly clever puzzle-platformer that you can turn a profit from buying. :-)Very smooth difficulty curve and forgiving checkpoint placement make for an easy-at-first-but-deceptively-challenging game, though I didn't find it too hard. Many of the puzzles can be swiftly bypassed with some twitch skills, however.			"

												Defy Gravity's a pretty good game!It's a platformer where you have the ability to place grav wells (a blue field that attracts you) and anti-grav wells (a yellow field that repels you). To keep you from just slowing launching yourself between points and never touching the ground, you're limited to one well of each type on screen at a time, and you can only fire each type twice before having to recharge on the ground or after bouncing off an enemy. The puzzles are basic, with you having to navigate hazards to reach the goal, and some levels where you aren't effected by your own gravity wells and can only manipulate the environment. Then, after you beat the game once, you're asked to do it again without anti-grav wells, changing the strategy of the game.It controls well, it's fun to play, and it can be challenging without ever becoming unfairly difficult. It's a short game, but $3 is a fine price for it. If you ever see it on sale, though, you have no excuse not to get this. Definitely recommended.			"

												I paid 18p for this ""game"". Admitedly for the cards, game refused to load with white flickers on first few tries (epiletic sufferers should avoid this game). Turns out you have to use -window in launch options. Even then, the game is very buggy. Feels like a poor web browser game with not very inticing game mechanics. Left mouse makes a gravity circle (well) while right mouse makes a repelling well. Checkpoints make the game's punishing difficulty somewhat bearable.I can only reccomend this game purely for the value it offers in dropping three cards that you can sell or get a cheap badge (if that's your thing). Otherwise, a poor game fitting it's current price.			"

At least I can sell the trading cards for more than what I paid for the full game.    I feel sorry for the people who paid £1.85 for this when the sale was not on. I'd rather have thrown the money down the drain or sponsored an african child. This makes Big Rigs look like game of the year. I don't even understand why there were shurikens in space.

												I'm actually surprised that I enjoyed this game as much as I did. I got the game for 29 cents and sold the cards for more than that, so I actually got paid to play the game. I liked the unique gameplay of using gravity manipulation to get from one platform to another, there was a steep difficulty curve in the middle of the game but it wasn't too bad. The music was also good, though I'm not sure if it was made for this game. If you got rid of the cheap animations, tweaked the controls and gameplay a bit and added a bit of depth and a story, you could have a pretty decent game.			"

												If you're thinking about picking this up during the sales at $0.29 DON'T!It feels like an unfinished unpolished piece of work. The mechanics are there but it just doesn't seem to work so well. Gravity doesn't seem to pull you enough at times and likewise for Repel. Jetpack doesn't ""refuel"" itself well enough (maybe have a jetpack bar indicator? that little light on the pack isn't good enough.The aiming animation of the character is locked to up, middle and down. Its hard to tell where you're aiming despite the character still shooting in the same direction as your mouse. C'mon guys, if you're making a mouse controlled game at least make it smoother.Don't even get me started about the UI. The UI is absolutely horrible. Theres no design in the UI to make it at least aesthetically appealing. Art of the game is just average.It seems like this game was made by a bunch of students for a student project. Which would be fine, I always encourage and look forward to indie works, but PLEASE PLEASE polish it before you release it on Steam!! How did this game even got on Steam is beyond me. I'm sorry devs, your game isn't even worth the $0.29. Heck your game isn't even worth me selling the cards and getting back $0.07.If you're looking for a game like this you'll have better luck on Kongregate.Rating: 1/10 for Kara			"

The cards arent selling as high as before, but you'll still make a profit if you buy it at .29. I'm not sure what causes the ""black screen glitch"" that other people have mentioned, but it didn't happen to me, and I had a good time with this game. Another example of gameplay over graphics.

												For 9p it's a solid platforming puzzle game with good music and a decent challenge. The puzzle provide a good amount of freedom to solve, with puzzles before it serving as clues as to what needs doing.One frustration I had was with the hitboxes. Usually when games require precision, the hitboxes are smaller than the visible bounds, but in this game they're larger. Over time you get used to it though.It's also short, but being a cheap game, I really didn't want to play it too long. It ended just when I thought I'd quit so it's pretty well timed I'd say.If you're looking for a cheap game to relax with for an hour, buy it!			"

The mechanics (while a bit frustrating at times) were refreshingly original and overall created a difficult old school style platformer.      While the game was a bit on the short side and the additional hard mode was a bit of a cheap way to add more gameplay to the already short game, I can't complain with the low price of $0.15 (which I then made back and more from selling the cards).7.5/10 (short, unique, but cheap resulting in a plesant suprise)			"

												This game barely works. Not just gameplay wise but launching it too. If you have two or monitors connected it will always start up on the secondary display. If you Alt+Tab out of the game the only way to get back to the game is to close it and restart it. The double jump seems to randomly go off when I try to do 1 jump (May be an issue with keyboard) and later on in the game there is now sense of direction for where to place your grav wells and you're just left guessing while bouncing off gold orb things. majority of issues do come from a technical stand point but another complaint is that the difficulty curve kinda goes all over the place with some levels given you too many checkpoints and some giving too few. The only reason I managed to beat one level is because on the way back to the start of the level to get to the exit I managed to jump through the ray beam that was supposed to be chasing me. If the Dev fixes these issues (Again mainly technical) I will give the game another try but right now it's just a pain to play			"

Hard mode doesn't have harder puzzles, but instead ties your hand behind your back and says 'Do it again!'...now I refer you to my first sentence!			"

But first impressions are that of a fun puzzle platformer that could potentially kepp me interested for a few hours. much more than I would expect from a €0.19 game.Though having said that, I find theres a few bugs, most notably that when you die, or go to the next level, the screen goes black. you get it back, you have to alt+tab to the desktop, then maximise it again. sometimes you also have to pause and unpause.theres not much to complain about given its price point, and the bug above is only a minor annoyance thats easily resolved.I'd give the game a hesitant 5/10.Great if you want to kill a few hours.

A Gravitymancer is some one who warps gravity to accomplish a task. In Defy Gravity you will alter gravity to get to the end of the stage. That is all the game is, but the puzzles are challenging as well as the platforming so the game is quite difficult as wellas fun. I would fully recommend this game to anyone that likes puzzle platforming and at its pricetag it is well worth the $.29-$2.99 you'll pay for it. Pick this one up for sure.			"

												I mean for 9 cents you cant go wrong. A huge bonus on top of that is that the game is actually anjoyable.Plus, with two or three trading cards from this youll actually make a profit from buying it.I mean you could sell any little item on the market and get minimum two hours of game with a decent soundtrack, interesting mechanics and fair visiualls. The game does get pretty difficult later on, and its nice to see another one of those games that challenge you instead of assuing you are as smart as lazy cod.I have two main gripes with this game. Number one is the lack of everything that is not gameplay. Litlle to no story, barely any options and so forth. The other one is how many different skills the agme asks of you. You have to have good reflexes, be smart without thinking much and have extreme keyboard and mouse skills, with removing grav-fields, shooting new ones at the correct places (you actually have to hold down the mouse bottun that you shot with, which is ridicolus, a horribly executed feature) and more.Wow, I just typed away there. Just realised its pretty much free, so no need to read a review of this lenght...Oh well, just buy the game and sell the cards = good agme experience and you make money for your Steam wallet.			"

												Don't be fooled by the price, this is one of the best platformers I've recently played. The game starts eas but it gets quite tricky. The way the game works is you have to try and complete some puzzles to get through the levels, armed with only your gravity gun. You are able to create gravity or anti gravity fields, affecting you and some of the objects around you, as you try to reach the end. Get it, especially while its this cheap.			"

												I bought this during the summer sale when it was like, 27 cents.  I have to say, it's not what it looks like.  It is actually pretty good so far.  Looking at the previews, I thought it would be completely horrid.  However, it looked like they knew what they were doing with this game.  Although it isn't very much puzzle, it's definitely a good platformer.  And a challenging one at that.  I didn't feel like my intelligence was insulted, nor did I feel incompetent.  I may be terrible at writing reviews, but I know when a game is not bad;  this was not a bad game at all.  Would reccomend for people who like puzzles, but prefer platformers.			"

												Boring, far more than mario. Music goes in loops in each level but different music each level. I'm hitting jump key but my jet pack don't work, i'm letting it recharge but still doesn't work sometimes. Very challenging levels but don't see much fun in them other than getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at it. Hard to tell where you're aiming, can barely see the spot where i am aiming. Not very detailed game settings, seems it only gives the mouse and keyboard or 360 controller and the option to quit game but when i click exit to main menu it goes back to press the jump key to continue as if the just restarted by launch.Only if you want to burn a few minutes getting ticked off. Really can't recommend due to the lack of settings given. I highly recommend a video game to have more settings than this and give the player a little more enjoyable time instead of stressing the player out. For the price it was though, i think i would have passed if i would have known the game was the way it is.			"

												Interesting concept and regardless (or maybe because) of its simplicity, works well. The controls - which are critical for a game of this type - seem a bit sluggish at times and overall the game lacks polish: for example the level design isn't bad, but somehow it all just looks very...generic and unimaginative. Neither is there a real background story of any kind, leaving you with the feel that you just jump around levels for no reason. The soundtrack catches your attention as you actually at times stop to think how great it is, only to realize it's the same song over and over again. Would really benefit from user-generated content to extend the replay value. Considering the price tag, though, you get the game experience, the trading cards and the achievements, and the game itself isn't critically flawed, so...At this price, recommended for those who like the genre.2/5			"

												Defy Gravity is a game about using the Gravity Gun (Hmmm...where have I heard that before?) which creates Gravity Wells (Oh, that's new) in order to complete feats beyond the rules of generic platforming. Wells, retract and attract, can be fired by using LeftClick and RightClick, or LT and RT if you do so desire to use the controller support, and allow you to fly around like a space eagle, or a bluetit on LSD. Only two of each well can be fired at any one time, though, to prevent flying over the entire level like some kind of intergalactic eagle.The mechanic is certaintly a hit for the game, and will most certainly attract fans of games such as Portal, and other physics-based puzzlers, and the platforming is smooth, with firm controls. Any msitakes feel genuine, and you know it's your fault and not the game's. It's not blunderingly difficult, but it's not easy either, which also brings back the feel of Portal, which I like very much. It may take a few attempts before you can get past a puzzle, but that's to be expected, and as an added bonus, you feel great when the soloution suddenly comes knocking at your brain's door.The XBOX controller intergration is nice too, and for PlayStation fans, the D-Pad acts like another joystick, bringing the 2-joystick feel, but actual DualShock 3/4 intergration would have been preferable.I have very little negative points for this game, except for the fact that the mouse cursor cannot go past a certain point in front of you, but can go anywhere behind you. I don't know if it's a bug, but it's still hindering. The presentation of the menus and such isn't too spectacular, either, but you won't be seeing many in this game.Overall, the game's intriguing mechanics and solid, feel-good platforming make this game a winner. Pick it up while it's this cheap, because it's well worht the 18p, or the £1.85 otherwise.This game scores an 8/10. Lovely			"

												Defy Gravity is a pretty great game. The music suits the atmosphere very well, being calm and collected to match the smooth pace of the game. Dying presents no annoyance, letting you get right back into the action of the game. The controls, whilst they could be improved upon quite easily, serve their purpose. There are a few glaring annoyances such as the somewhat shoddy hitboxing and the tendency for the game to register your single jump as a double jump, costing you a death quite easily. All in all though, the puzzles are generally very well made and serve to test the players skill in timing, strategy, and a variety of other necessary areas. Honestly, I would give this game a nice solid little 7.5 out of ten. I picked this game up for 18 pence, and it's definitely worth more than that. Pick it up whenever possible.			"

A good challenge but that is never discouraging. You know you'll make it eventually without pulling too many hair out… just a little… just enough.Same for the 2nd walkthrough with only one gravity hole. I'd progressively adapt and have just as much fun in the 2nd play through.Also, the music was surprisingly fitting and very enjoyable.I personally bought this while it was on special, but I wouldn’t of been too upset to have paid the full price.

												This game has surprisingly more going for it than it's Newgrounds appearance may lead you to believe, with some well designed and tricky puzzles inside its disappointingly short playtime.Gameplay wise this is a pretty simple, but good idea seemingly inspired by Portal, except rather than firing portals connecting to each other, you fire a blue gravity well, which pulls you towards it, and an orange anti-gravity well which pushes you away. Despite the simple controls being basically move, aim, fire, and remove gravity wells, I found this game to play much better when using a controller, so bear that in mind while considering playing it.Graphics are nothing more than what would be expected of an in-browser flash game, the space-y backgrounds look nice, but the main character is poorly animated and enemies and other platforms are very simple in design. Despite this the music in the game was pretty nice, nothing too special but it fit well and never seemed intrusive.I managed to get this game really cheap (9p) in a sale, and while I wouldn't say it's worth full price, it would definitely be worth more than that, although from selling cards I managed to make a (very small) profit, so if that's your goal then go for it. Also if achievements are your thing then it's possible to get all eight of them (which are based solely on story progression) in just three hours, and I didn't need to resort to any sort of guides, despite being stuck in places for a while.Overall this game is good, cheap fun for a slow afternoon, but don't expect a life-changing experience.8/10 "

For the first time it might looks a bit boringg... but when you get into this game you will feel the space adventure.... however i must recommend this :) (cuz i really appreciate the developer :D) Pros :-This game is simple cuz in 2D-Easy to play-No Bug-Nice Quality (not that bad at all)-Has a delightful music :) ( I Feel so sleepy cuz the music is melo haah... so i take a nap with it xD)-Trading Cards~(yeah ik evyone is going to buy this game for that) you should get a profit when this game is on promo!Cons :-Its like a♥♥♥♥♥♥in 2D-Gaming for 90s era-You might get angry over the obstacles cuz some of them is hard..-Single player (You play alone)-No OPTIONS/SETTINGS button-Too expensive! (Buy it when this game has a promo sale!)			"

												A surprisingly good puzzle game that made it's way into my library one way or another. It indroduces some awesome and unique mechanics, you'll need to bring in a persistant mindset if you want to go far in this game.I recommend you pick Defy Gravity up if you have any spare change.			"

												At a very discounted price of $0.14, I'd say I got what I paid for: both good and bad. As the trailer shows, this game is ugly. The stages look like they came out of a 2005 Newgrounds game, with its bare-bones layout and stock-image-looking backgrounds that, sometimes, have visible edges where the pattern ends. If you were to judge this game based solely on its looks, then it certainly isn't for you, Mr. Overclocked $800 Graphics Card.Where the game shines is in its gameplay: and at the end of the day, that's all that reallyt matters. The game ain't no Portal slayer but it does use its gravity and anti-gravity in clever ways, like having to cross a gap by switching between the two. They aren't always tight though: I got to the end of a couple based on luck and I doubt I did it the way the developer wanted it. So sure, this won't be the greatest puzzler you've ever played, but if you got some refund money sitting around like I did (thanks poorly optimized copy of 'Hatred'!) and you're feeling up for some cheap fun, you could do a lot worse; it's decent and worth a risk of whatever you pay for it.

It's not got the same nice graphics like The Swapper or Braid, the graphics are really bland in fact, everything is just gray, and there's no story to be seen, but it's still fun gameplay, it's interesting enough, and on sale for 9p, well, you can't really go wrong there.

												I understand the sweat and tears that go into creating a game. I’ve dabbled in programming and decided I’ll leave it to real devs. So I don’t think my demands are too high. I love indie games because they are gaming at its purest. The prettiest game can still play like crap, and the best voice actor can’t save a steaming turd.So how did Defy Gravity stack up?This is the best fifty-cent platformer I’ve played.It checks all my boxes. Highly addictive gameplay, perfectly responsive controls and cheesy graphics make this a ghetto-approved gaming experience.---See my full review http://ghettogamerblog.wordpress.com "

												The game is a brilliant platformer conceptually and has reasonable level design and artwork/music, but the controls are so wonky that gameplay is a frustrating chore. Gravity well placement is fineckty. Controller ""Support"" is badly implemented and using the right stick to try and aim precisely around 360 degrees is teeth-grindingly irritating. Maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I struggled even on the tutorial levels. For comparison:In 'The Swapper':- The object of aiming (your swapper clone) is moved around like a cursor by controller or mouse, making aiming easy.- Time slows to a crawl when you engage the aim function.Gravity Defiance:- The targeting reticule is fixed to a circle around the player, so you have to try and line up by eye your little spaceman, the targeting reticule and the target. There's no projected line to assist aiming either.- Time moves normallyresult: frustrationIt's on sale right now for like, 20 pence. I sold my cards for 30 pence of steam gold, so I guess this review is more a complaint that what could have been a good game got sh-ttified through laziness.			"

												This game is absolutely unpredictable, the objects that kill you don't seem to follow the rules that you've established in the game and so they can't be followed by your mind. It is also really confusing how the wells work. The gravity well is supposed to suck you in, but if you go into it at a moderate speed, it seems to spit you back out at the same speed you were going in, and sometimes even faster. It's even worse that once you reach a hard level, you need to get past each section before reaching a checkpoint, and after trying the exact same thing, time, after time, after time, the only thing keeping you from rage quitting is knowing all of the progress you've made before then will be lost if you quit. I got this game for %0.18 and even then, I wish for my money and time back.			"

												A physics puzzler, much like portal only a 2D platformer and with gravity.  Worth a good 3 hours for the main levels and more for the hard mode. Solid recommendation given the price.			"

												The game is short but provides a little challenge, and the mechanics it uses are limited. However, it is totally worth buying whenever it's on sale, since it gets a price as low as 10 cents, which is practically what you earn from selling the trading cards			"

												Fairly simple mechanics, but paired with a difficulty wall that forces the player to figure them out almost instantly or be unable to progress in the game. Several levels require lengthy periods of precise platforming, where a single mistake causes you to lose significant progress.Only worth it on an extreme sale when you can sell the cards for more than you paid for the game. Even then, it's probably more enjoyable to Alt+Tab out and just do something else until the card drops roll in.			"

												It was alright, not terribly exciting to be honest and occasionally frustrating, but not the worst either - I got it for a couple cents on sale so I don't have much of a complaint.  If you like retro puzzle games, you'll probably enjoy this game.  If that's not really your thing, then it's okay, but you can pass on it.			"

To my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed this game, as it reminded me of Portal and Mario. The game itself took me 4 hours to beat but the puzzles really made me think.

												Defy Gravity is exactly what I look for in a game like this; It's challenging, but not too challenging; it's not super repetitive (it may be a little bit repetitive at times). Overall, it's a pretty good way to kill time and have fun doing it. The game's pretty short though, so I recommend waiting until goes on sale.

												With a price of just 11 cents on sale, I'd say the quality of this game totally exceeded what it looked like when I saw the screenshots. The game mechanics weren't *exactly* original, but the execution and level design were quite nice.Synchronizing player movements with the deployment/cancellation of gravity wells can get a little weird sometimes, but after a while any player should be able to traverse the stages without confusion. The jetpack mechanics, however, are a little delayed and can get uncomfortable when you try to deploy a double jump, however that's probably the only irritating issue about game mechanics I can find.Verdict: A neat little puzzle platformer that will provide wholesome entertainment and worth its low price. Great for anyone looking for a break from the expensive and intense action shooters out there and just looking for a classic puzzle platforming experience.			"

												I came into this game off of a steam trading cards coupon. I expected fairly little from the game, and figured ah what the heck it`s cheap. I thought this game would only take me a few hours at most. I was so wrong, I am currently at the three-ish hour mark and a little over halfway through the game. While the game could be better in the graphics department, it is a stellar playthrough. EDIT: Finally finished took me a bit because I got sort of lazy at completing things, but overall it was still a solid 7-8 hours.9/10 would dodge bronze things again			"

												Before I begin this review I think it should be clear that my time spent in this game is not indicative of my experience, its just a really short game.Now, as is obvious, this is a puzzle platformer. It has simple models and pretty nice backgrounds. But as any experienced gamer knows, its the simple ones that are the hardest. Now there is no difficulty setting to use, it just gets harder as you go. And when I say harder, I mean insanely difficult. Trust me, I spent 30 minutes just beating the credits level (yeah, there is a level - halfway through - with the credits) only to find that they had a harder game behind that. This is that kind of game; Simple but addictive, frustrating (REALLY frustrating) but immensely satisfying. You will scream at your computer when an enemy gets those lucky shots and scream again when you pass the level and get a harder one still.You will get the message ""Press jump to try again"" SO MANY TIMES, just don't even think about leaving until you've passed just that next bit....But don't get me wrong, although the amount of times you die in this game would make Dark Souls look as dangerous as a bake-a-cake game, it is a real gem in the indie community.The gameplay is smooth and simple, the controls are easy to master and the levels are nice to learn. It has a killer soundtrack as well (although it does get repetitive if when you get stuck). But above all, its cheap. If its on sale, you have no excuse.A few little nit-picky bits would be the inability to turn the music off. Also the pause menu doesn't work properly so objects will keep on moving, you just don't see it until you exit pause.Overall I very much recommend this game to anyone really, its something to do when you're bored and its got trading cards as well (foil currently costs the same as normal).I rate Defy Gravity Extended 8/10.

												You know when you buy a game for laughs and expect it to suck because it was only 9 cents? But then you try it out for fun and it's actually amazing how good it is compared to how bad you expected it to be? You're looking at the game. It's nothing amazing, but it's a lot more fun than I expected to get out of it. It needs a lot of polishing but the core is most certainly there.			"
