												It doesn't seem we will ever see a sequel, which is a shame considering how advanced this game was for its time. Even by today's standards it is a very enjoyable grand-strategy title and features some of the best diplomacy in the genre. Sending a spy to infilitrate an opposing faction and watching him seize their lands for you, only to find out he has claimed the lands for himself and has usurped you, is just a taste of the possibilities the campaign gives you. Highly recommended and I would love to see features from this game introduced and evolved in future TW titles.			"

												Honestly this game is a lot better than I initially thought.What first was a 2 dollar steam sale purchase I thought i'd spend 1-2 hours with has now become one of my most beloved rts games so far. If you like the total war series or crusader kings and are looking for a fine mixture of managing and actually controlling armies and empires this is the right game for you.Pros:-It offers 3 (dark , middle and late medieval age) periods and a huge map (Extended map of europe) letting you play as almost all nations that were present at that time.-New factions can emerge when certain provinces are captured (uniting england , ireland and such)-It offers a interesting kingdom power system that encourages you to act with honor. Breaking agreements and treaties will result in a loss of reputation, leading to civil unrest. -Royal families, their offspring and marriages can be managed as well as knights you can employ in different positions such as generals , spies , priests and merchants.-Battles can be fought automatically or you can take direct control yourself-Still has working multiplayer support due to direct connections via lan or tcp/ip-Game can be quite difficult if you want it to be but the learning curve isnt so bad. It didnt take me long in order to do well and build a small empire.Cons:-The units are a bit hard to get into formation when directly leading your battles and it has some minor flaws. Its not bad but dont expect it to live up to total war battles.-The steam version is not updated to patch 1.05 , its 1.03 instead so manual patching is required. -Widescreens and windows 8 arent properly supported but there are some people that have been able to get it to work. I do recommend to check the forums on that.			"

												This game is a gem. Its like very lite version of Crusader Kings &  Europa in real time. It has a lite amount of diplomacy,has trading,you can have vassels,be a vassel,make non agression pacts,peace treaties,alliances,declare war, pilage/plunder,start crusades with your pope,join in crusades,and a few more religious items. The default A.I. is pretty decent but I have found often their castle might not be as heavily fortified as one would make.This could be due to battle and such though. If you want a much tougher one,there are mods but I find the default AI fun enough to play with.Auto defend/attack is present be you defending a town,your castle, or when battlefields. This game has probably one of the best auto attack/defend mechanics I have seen I usually just let it auto do it.Just remember there are factors at play via your units that will determine the end result of the battle.Multiple ways to try to be the most powerful and win the game via getting voted by 2/3 of the top 5 kindgoms. Fail to win the votes and the top 5 kingdoms will declare war on you. Interface is clean,hotkeys for quick menu access,and map icons access menus.Game has autosave which you can enable.The game has online multiplayer restricted to battlefield battles.The game has a lot going for it with a little of column A ,B and C in it. I hghly recommend playing it with the Dusk of Glory mod  which works with the default patch steam installs with. Its not a casual game but at the same time can be enjoyed as if it is one.You can play for 10-30min and get a good deal of enjoyment out of the game.Its a game that id like to see a sequel for.Check Community Hub for each of these mods I recommend  :Dusk of Glory  - Game v1.03  (default steam intalled version) I love this mod and currently use itElderly mod[spz.uw.hu]   - Game v1.05 only. Information about mod[forum.paradoxplaza.com]World Domination Scenario mod & Upcoming Amerika Mod  -Game V1.05)As far as the  GameV1.05 info[forums.blackseastudios.com] goes from what I read, V1.03 patches the game well enough for most and is bug free.However V1.05 does add additional changes making the A.I. tougher and more capable during battles,but it also introduces a few minor bugs. V1.05 also introduces a map editor.You can dl it here or anywhere just google search.Or visit the studios Mod section[forums.blackseastudios.com]  . Many of the mods the links do not work,but the 4 I mentioned above are more than enough.They are not compatible with one another sadly.Quick Technical StuffsIt works in Vista and Windows 7 (32/64bit) even though not stated on store page and unworking demo.It only supports 1024x768 (but you can play in windowed mode).For some the image won't look stretched at all in full screen. If your widescreen stretches 4:3 resolutions badly, you may want to go into your nVidia or ATI control panel and have your video card pre-scale it before it gets to your monitor so it will display correctlyFar More Technical Info written by CMay,click this sentence.

												I absolutely love this game. Although it has definitely aged and the graphics aren't that great, it's perfect for those who love real time strategies focused on warfare. The rush of taking over multiple provinces and expanding across Europe is amazing and highly addictive. The soundtrack will keep you humming the tunes for days, it's truly perfect music for this medieval style. The game takes forever to win, so if you have time to kill then this will totally satisfy those hours. Graphics 3/10, Gameplay 8/10, Replay Value 9/10.			"

												KoH is an excellent medieval RTS, very underrated and unknown by many players. It was originally released in Belgium 2004 by Sunflowers and then by Paradox for North America in 2005. Developed by Black Sea Studios, (now Crytek Black Sea) they did a fantastic job on this game. However, there are some things I don't like about it, and it's merely personal preference. Despite KoH being a great RTS, it does tend to get a little boring and repetitive after awhile. The developers could have done some extra things to spice it up more, such as more historical units, random events like disease, fires, barbarian/mongol invasion, the plague, a royal family tree, etc. I find it a little odd that knights live forever unless killed in battle or by a spy, and your Kings only die of old age or in battle or by a spy. Didn't the developers know people died of disease and other things in those days, just like we do in today's world? I'm not trying to flame, not at all, the game is great, but a little more realism would have made KoH the best RTS ever. All in all, and despite my personal thoughts, KOH is a great game that everyone should try.			"

												Thia game is a real old school gem. If you like grand strategy games this game will suit you well as long as you are not bothered by the 1999 graphics. From kingdom management, trade and conquest  to real time battles, this game has it all. The AI is also pretty great at the hard difficultyYou can score a quick victory by collecting all resources or go for the long haul and conquer the whole map.I have been coming back to this game for 10 years now since it was first released in Europe, and it is still not boring me. The countries you select are never the same as trade resources, buildings and enemies at the start of the game are randomly generatedBack in the day this game also had a great modding community, my favorite mod being Dusk of Glory, although there are a few other good ones as well, such as a roman themed mod, mods adding more units and buildings and simpler gameplay enhancing mods.Conclusion: My favorite strategy game, it will keep you entranced for hours at a time. Definitely worth the money.			"

												One of best strategy game there, it is a mix between paradox titles like EU and Total war, everything else is just amazing, I do not what to say, but it is really balanced and there are so much to do, feels like a grand strategy but still have this RTS feel, Unlike total war games the campaing map played in real time (which is much better than Turn based style), the battles played like total war but everything in 2D, siege battles are amazing too, the art style of game is superb and the sound cant get any better than this, the only con I have despite being a 2005 game the graphics are so dated, feels like 2001 graphics more, but you will not care much once you get immersed in the game, the historic accuracy is high here, not to the paradox titles par but at least much better than total war game. If you are a strategy lover, this game is a must... Big 9 can be 10 if the graphic was a bit better.			"

												An interesting game to say first; I picked it up during the Publisher Sales and found it intriguing enough to buyThe pros and cons.Pros:Fairly easy controlsHistorical accuracy maintained (somewhat) closelyCons:Complex system to navigate as it grows, demands full attentionIf you've played Age of Empires, the similarity between these two games begins and ends with them being RTS games.In Knights of Honor, you can not simply attack as you please, you have to build relationships, maintain funds, supplies and even the happiness of your own people to prevent revolts. It can really test patience and strategy.However, the characters can be interesting and the combat is fairly simple, controlling entire armies with relative ease rather than trying to manipulate small groups of soliders like in Age of Empires.If you haven't tried any RTS (real time strategy) games before, maybe wait on getting Knights of Honor or buy it on sale but if you love RTS games like this, Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, Civilization, then give Knights of Honor a try.

												Knights of Honor, while certainly not unique from the dozens of other Paradox published or produced map based games, Appeals to me as the most accessible for new time players, while still easily one of the more fun ones for more advanced gamers. Its core gameplay was easy for me to understand with 25 minutes, and I had mastered many of the simple tasks by the end of an hour, allowing me to start bigger and better parts of the game.  The game is laid out similar to Total war, where you control a country during a time of war and unrest (In this case, during the medieval ages). The game is largely map based, and while it has RTS type battles, I recommend leaving it to the AI auto battle system, as that is a lot less frustrating and tedious.  The games highlights for me are based around its well balanced uses of espionage, religion, economy, military and diplomacy. Any of these may be used to achieve total victory, or a unique combination of them. This allows the player to choose their play style, unlike Total war, where you are trapped in a looping cycle of battle.  Like all games, KoH has its share of problems, and a few of them are major. On some machines, the highest available resolution is 800 X 600, which looks very odd on modern monitors. Un-skippable start up logos that last around 1 minute each time is annoying and makes launching the game a pain. Actual in game issues are few in the area of glitches, but some sections of the game are cruelly tedious, like rebellion and currency inflation. While it may be open for debate if these ruin the game, it definitely adds another dimension to the gameplay.  While KoH may not be on the same level of polish as other map – based strategy games, it should not be forgotten, especially for the bargain price of $9.99.			"

												I used to love this game, way back before I know Steam, but then I lost my installationAnd now on Steam, I found that I still love this gameThis game is rather similar to the Total War series, except in real time (with pause of course), which is a nice change of paceThe diplomacy is rather simple, but consistent and predictable, no arbitrary rejection of alliance proposals for example, quite unlike my experience with Total War, where the only alliance proposal I manage to pass are the ones made early game, even to those nations which could be considered very friendlyDon't expect much in the way of graphics, the screenshots should give you a good understanding of it, but on the flip side, this game can be run on slower computers, even ones without adequate graphic cards, which makes sense considering its ageAll in all, I think this game is worth the money spent if you're looking for a strategy game to play on laptop or the likes			"

												The best game I have come across for this value that plays a pretty realistic feudal strategy conquest game. Basically a super awesome version of risk with a lot more complex decisions and options. To control battles is just amazing even though I am apparently the worse general ever.I have lost so far in a great many ways. My one empire was suddenly dissolved into city states because I had no heir. Than the next game all my armies became rebels and I was overrun by them. I have been conquered a few times by my neighbours. In fact on easy level once I had three neigbours attack me right away ... on EASY!! To me that is awesome. I hate easy games I like challenges and I dont mind failure if I learn or have fun doing it.This game is fun.. it is slow so do not expect to complete it in one sitting. Keep saving... it does have the option to do that for you... I have failed to save a few times. Things can go from really good to really bad very fast, but they do not generally go from very bad to very good fast.  "

												Knights of Honor is a special type of game in terms of replayability, their is a vast amount of factions and three different Medieval era's to choose from. What makes me enjoy this game most is the sandboxy nature of it, for example: once i had Bosina; a single provinced country take over 1/3 of the world! Certain factions in the game get special unit types which can be very intriguing for some people, including myself.One small problem I have with the game is, combat. Combat can be very difficult due to the fact that it doesn't work in the same way that usual strategy games do; its more based on numbers advantage or your generals skills, which is from leveling up. However, if you don't like combat or your just bad you can just automate combat.Well worth the money.Hope you enjoy!			"

												Think of it as an early Heroes of Might and Magic except time moves continously and not when you end your turn.This creates a flow of events that keeps the pace going as the game only pauses at specific points for you to make a decision.Its not very popular as it pre-dates steam and its an eastern european country that made it, they didn't have a big publisher or much marketing.It actually holds up quite nicely through time.If you are into castle fighting medieval units stuff like crusaders, cossacs etc and the many others this is a farily good one.Took me 30 hours to conquer the world.I am really surprised the fools who published it on steam haven't bothered to compile a few minute video to do it justice.A few people recommended it to me in 2015. If they remembered it that for over 10 years and cared enough to tell other folks its definetly a worthwhile step in the genre. Not to mention the company was bought up by the big guys as soon as the game was released, the quality of work shows everywhere.			"

												Max resolution: 1024x768Price this morning at 80% off: $1.99Hours played continuously: 9 hours and still goingYour mileage may vary.I tell myself I'm playing this to learn user interfaces... yah... uh huh...The interface is a little convoluted.  There are buildings you can build which won't have ANY USE WHATSOEVER because your nation isn't able to build specific units related to the building.  For example a plate armourer builds his shop in your city.  He builds magnificent armor - but all the people just walk by... they can't figure out what to do with the stuff.  So you just wasted resources to build a building that has no use for your kingdom, but would have use if you happened to be the next country over.  That's a bit silly and annoying - those buildings should be greyed out if they can never be used.Still the gameplay is very compelling, not for the sake of the graphics, but for the learning curve and immediate challenge with some difficult economics.  The building interdependencies remind me of Eador a lot.The various technology trees:  Building interdependencies, Ruler designations, Resources and trade, Advantages (bonuses to groups of resources acquired), maybe 1 or 2 more as I'm just getting started.  Oh yeah... ""when are they going to have some babies?""  In that way this is a ""be the pestering mother-in-law simulator"".I play most of the tactical battles in auto-resolve, which is still a slow animation that is interesting and fun to watch, but my guess is the tactical battles will eventually become a requirement at higher difficulties.The Pope keeps issuing annoying crusades calls, which if you refuse other nations relations will deteriorate, but if you take, you'll lose a marshall at least for the duration of the crusade, or permanently if you generate a vassal nation from the crusade conquering.Lastly the voice acting is not bad overall, and pretty good in many places.10/10 I have already got more than my $1.99 and probably easily more than the regular price.  It's a no brainer can't stop playing.			"

												This game holds up very well and stands as a somewhat unknown classic of the era. Think Rise of Nations meets a paradox title like EU IV and you have Knights of Honor. Tons of things to build, upgrade and do all in a very large map and running at a perfect pace. Plenty of time to issue orders to units and such. Sure the graphics are of course dated but the sprites were done well and imo they hold up fine to the test of time. Don't miss this one if you like slower paced, large map RTS games.  "

												It's a really good strategy game i won't argue with that, but it's not flawless. Beating even hard AI is not an achievement and random minerals in cities with every new game, although refreshing it's might be annoying over time. Battles are slow paced and borring with their recurrence. BUT! Unique concept with heroes as clerics/generals/merchants (and so on) is great, and it's really hard later on (in a friendly manner), when you have a great kingdom but still only 8 heroes to control and wars on 2/3 fronts. It's something different from others main strategy games, and it's worth a while of your time. If you like strategy games like Stronghold and CiV or EU buy it! But not for a full price really, only on one of the steam sales.			"

												Ah, this is one of those few games that I wish I could've played when it first came out. I tried to play it now, but all I do is compare the game mechanics with other older games that did it better. If only I could've played this game at release, I would've had a blast, but by now it's outdated. If you can't approach this game with nostalgia, then stay away.

												A great game, though it is more than a decade old. Don't expect next-gen graphics, but if you want a good time playing as almost any nation existing in Medieval Europe, this is the game for you. Think of it this way: Age of Empires and Total War had a baby. Knights of Honor is essentially a combination of those two games.			"

												The most intelligent and deep RTS I have ever played, STAY AWAY from this game, it is more addicting than any drug. Feroucious gameplay, fantastic atmosphere and great detail to the theme of the game. While the graphics look old and outdated, here it works great and has that old time RTS charm to it, it prays on our nostalgia for games lost in time. The music is preposterously EPIC, and by that I mean, it's awesome. It has a huuuuuuuge replay factor, the multiplayer is it's weak point, but in this case I can live with it. Nothing is perfect, NOTHING, but this comes too darn close!			"

												A hidden treasure for sure. I never heard of this game before. Until I ran across it here on steam.The game is older and the graphics are not going to pretty enough for certain types of people.  The game definitly is unique. It's a more strategy oriented RTS with limited armies and supplies.  The game is still very playable and entertaining. The value of the game is definitly worth it.  I would say it is a very refreshing game compared to new games coming out.  The game is based upon towns and their provinces. Some are of greater value than others and some are just rare.  This makes for a great strategy themed game. The downside of the game. Its a pure vanilla game with no additional add ons or expansions. The game concept is great. It is a shame that no sequals were created or even an expansion. The game is lacking in variety of units. But that said, the game is still very fun. This is one of those great games that fell to the side and was never finished being polished to its full glory. "

												Great game.For those who have played this game they might have seen that remembering your king's brothers is so important because they don't appear among royal father once the eldest brother becomes kings. Need to use them well as they don't revolt and are not spies. Having a king who has many princes is also a bonus as you don't need to pay marshal wages. Also I'm using king as merchant or spy guarding my own castle and also using him to kill rebels as you can just call him back to castle and  deploy him in any other rebel invaded city (if you have enough gold to leave his previous army and recruit new). Very enjoyable game.			"

												It is like an older simpler version of Europa Universalis 4, but you have Knights instead of advisors to give you bonuses or carry out your will! I wish I had found and played this amazing game earlier.Knights of Honor is like EU4 a fairly slow paced real time game (there are buttons for speeding the game up though) where diplomacy and interpeting and manipulating the worldwide opinions and events is very important. You can make Trade, Non aggression pacts, Alliances and Royal marriages. Peace and War are of course present and can be declared however you wish, but breaking Trade/Alliance/Royal marriage carries penalties. Spies are present and can do all sorts of shenanigans if you are so inclined and they work in a rather unique way, or you can fill your royal court with Army carrying Marshals and forget spies, merchants or any other utility Class your knights could choose and just crush your enemies, stomp out rebellions until they calm down, and intimidate your enemies with your massive armies so they will be too afraid to try to stop your quickly expanding realm while plundering everything in sight so you don't run out of food and money.A lot of the countries you can choose to play as has unique units that you can recruit anywhere the resources are present at and the locations of provinces determines what other local units might be around for recruitment, Vikings for example are available as special local units for hire in Scandinavian provinces.Combat is handled either personally or by the AI, heading in yourself can be preferable if the armies are about equal in strength and you want to ensure victory by say sacrificing your cavalry to rush and kill the enemy marshal, ending the battle unless a reinforcing marshal is present for them. While fun, you can generally trust the AI to handle battles where you outnumber and/or outclass the enemy, except when terrain or castles or such are about to mess things up.In addition to your knights you have your royal family that you should take good care of, marrying off your women to secure peace and making damn sure you have male heirs so succession is not a problem.Finally there are multiple ways to win, so far I have only managed to get the Kingdom Advantages win, which is gathering all the trade goods and acquiring all Kingdom Advantages which are bonuses to various areas of your Kingdom obviously. There also Click Here to Claim victory buttons where you demand others to recognize your greatness and undisputed rule, and independant somewhat irregular meetings to determine a Supreme Ruler.Gonna try to conquer Europe as the Golden Horde next with hordes of horse archers. And after that play as a muslim country and cover the world with Camels.			"

												This is basically a prettier and less complicated version of the Europa Universalis games. The mechanisms are more transparent compared to that series, and the game feels more limited, less open-ended. This can be both a good and a bad thing, depending on your preferences.Trade plays a relatively important role, because you have to have access to trade goods in order to gain kingdom advantages, and you probably can't produce all of these trade goods yourself unless you conquer a lot of territories.Military and combat are straightforward. Waging extensive wars is complicated by two factors: one, you can only have a limited number of armies at any time; and two, rebels regularly appear in recently conquered territories, so you have to garrison some of your armies in the new territories for a rather long time to defeat the rebels.The limit on the number of armies is due to a clever idea that I don't remember having seen in any other similar strategy game: You have a set number of slots to which nobles from your kingdom can be assigned, and you also assign a specific role to each noble. One such role is the general (marshal), which is important because every army must be led by one. Second, a noble can be assigned the trader role; traders are sent to other kingdoms either to earn money or to gain access to goods that you don't produce yourself. Third, there is the cleric who can convert your provinces to your state religion. And fourth, a noble can serve as a spy either to intercept other spies sent by foreign powers or to be sent to other powers by you in order to gather information and carry out covert attacks.Having played through one game, it is obvious that Knights of Honor is far too easy on default settings. I played as the kingdom of Hungary and was able to conquer the whole eastern half of Europe and part of Anatolia during the rule of my first 6 kings or so (which seems the only way to measure time in this game, since the current calendar year is not shown anywhere as far as I can tell). Given the fact that Hungary was at best an intermediate regional power during this time span and most definitely did not have the resources to carry out such conquests, it is safe to say that you can forget about Knights of Honor if you want to play something that resembles a historical simulation. (For example, when I tried to pull the same stunt in EU III, I was duly wiped out by the Turkish.)The winning conditions are a point that is more problematic than historical accuracy (which is not really that important for a game). One way to win the game is to collect all of the kingdom advantages. This is easy to achieve, you basically have to have access to 5 sea ports and money, both of which are easy to come by. The second way is to be elected the emperor of Europe, for which it is necessary to have the support of the five most powerful kingdoms. This seems rather difficult to achieve. Being the most powerful kingdom yourself is easy, but to get the support of the others you would also have to have perfect relations with them. This wouldn't be that difficult per se either, since everybody else is more than happy to ally themselves with you if you are the most powerful kingdom. However, if you are already allied with one power, this excludes an alliance with powers that are enemies of your ally. So not only is it necessary for you to be on good terms with other kindoms, you should also guarantee that your friends are friends with each other as well. This is quite impossible to achieve given the mechanisms provided by Knights of Honor.Logically, diplomacy should be the way to do this, but the diplomacy system in this game is quite useless. You can only ask your allies to attack some other kingdom, but there is no option available to ask (or order) them to make peace with one another and leave each other alone, or else. This, of course, is not surprising but rather seems to be the norm in these games, but it is still a completely stupid omission that basically renders the whole diplomacy system completely useless.Beside the fact that the emperor victory condition is unrealistically and artificially difficult to achieve, another major problem with the game is the AI. They don't seem to be interested in the victory conditions. Coastal powers should presumably have it easy to attain the kingdom advantages victory, since all they need for that is ports, but apparently no AI power does that. As for the emperor condition, in the emperor elections no kingdom ever got any votes, which suggests that the AI isn't even trying to win that sort of victory. The AI also tends to do stupid things. For example, tiny, one-territory kingdoms constantly declare war on my kingdom, being by far the most powerful empire in Europe, with the explanation that they need land. It apparently does not occur to them that they should rather try to expand toward their similarly tiny neighbors, which might not destroy them instantly.To sum it up, Knights of Honor is a rather one-sided affair. You either win a trade victory relatively early on, or you try to win the diplomatic victory, which takes unreasonably long, and the computer players do not really represent any serious challenge to this. The only thing they are somewhat good at is the military challenge, which is especially present in the early game. Later on you become so powerful that even this part becomes too easy.Despite these serious problems, I'll give Knights of Honor a recommendation since there are good ideas in it, and the early game is relatively good. The fact that the late game becomes very unbalanced is rather annoying, but this is unfortunately the case for lots of strategy games (even otherwise ingenious games like the Civilization series).

												This is a good cheap game! It is similar to a total war game in that you have a large areal view of the map and have cities to build in and upgrade and you can rucruit armies. The game has poorish graphics but it probably won't bother you. In the game you have provences with one city in each, and the cities have limitied build space and some randomized natural resorces. You can't fit every building in the cities and some buildings require the recsorces to be present in th provence to build them. You also hire agents to trade, lead armies. convert, spy, or increase build speed. You are limeted in the nember of these agents. The ones that lead armies gain experiance when they win battles and they can be upgraded when they level up. You can also go on the battlefeild to control units from an areal view, not its best feature so I just let the ai do the battles and try to outnumber the enemy or have a upgraded army with good units in it. You will find managing your country fun and there are many things to do in the game from building to fighting to diplomacy. I recomend this game and I am sure you will have fun playing it!			"

												If you like Medieval strategy games and haven't played this game you are punishing yourself.  From the first time I played this game I loved it.  I orginally bought this game from fileplanet which went crazy and I couldn't get it on my new pc.  Then I bought it again from gamersgate and played it a TON.  When I noticed it came to Steam I just had to buy it again because it's just that good.   I have put countless hours into this game and hope and pray they make a sequel.  When it's on sale you can literally get it for like $2-5 and it's worth so much more than that.  The strategy aspect of the game is deep because you can take control of the battles and use your soldiers strengths to your advantage allowing you to be insane odds with clever play.If you get the mods out there for this game you'll get hundreds of hours of fun out of it.  I got to the point were I was editing the game files to make it like Game of Thrones or Rome and such.  With the online editors and mods you can basically make the game what you want.			"

Recommendation level:|-|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|░░░░░░|+|Knights of Honor is a medieval strategy game which mixes the style of the Total War and Europe Universalis series with real-time elements. It is almost ten years old now, but is still a competent game in its genre.Pros:Nice mix of kingdom management and military strategy. Provinces can be taken over, developed and defended when needed. Military units can be moved with marshals through the map in real-time. Leveling and perks are deep enough. Fights can be simulated or played on one of the many pre-built battlefields. Sieges and engagements need strategic decisions. Diplomacy is important, every move influences the way how others will act. The whole map of Europe can be seized and dominated. Many nations can be controlled in three different period. The world feels living due to the many events occurring constantly. Pre-rendered graphics look decent even in 2014 and the menus are also usable.Cons:Only two game modes available, campaign and battle. Multiplayer campaign would add to value. Some features are too simplistic and leave some more to be desired, like the importance and use of trade and exotic goods. The limitation of knights/nobles available for actions are frustrating, especially when a bigger kingdom is governed. The way military units transported and used in slots and their numbers feel less appropriate at cases. Also, units moving on the battlefield can collide with each other causing well set formations to break. AI sometimes prefer annoying and dumb decisions both in diplomacy, map movement and battles and can be exploited at times. Graphics engine lacks options demanded nowadays, like higher resolutions and widescreen.Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a complex military strategy game with many ways and choices available. The game features long campaigns with dozens of played hours and also has a high replay value.MY OPINION: 8.0/10 (GREAT)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 8/10Gameplay: 8/10Sound: 7/10Replay Value: 9/10			"

												Started in Cork, allied with Scotland.. Got myself a solid economy fueling my army.. Swept accross the British Isles while fighting rebels back home. Trained some spys with books, and a couple of my Marshels were themselves spies. I tourtured them and lost respect of the other nations.. Sent my main Marshel on a crusade, upon completion of crusade he choose to take the land for his own. Swept over Spain into Africa and as far east as Russia, destroyed the Papacy by accident when my son and the daughter of the ""pope"" claimed the land after he died. Sent my last spy on a mission, while gone my throne was infiltrated and all of my near maxed out marshels claimed lands of mine as theirs and rebeled... Still had 3 proviences left and a few marshels... My treasury which was 1k gold a cycle, dropped to -700ish, I was near 100k.. Quickley my marshels which remained loyal were trying to reclaim the lands I had ""liberated"".. My new marhels were left with basic units and many died in service or imprissoned. I found a few mercany camps and exploited the best units I could find and alloted them to my prince, who immediately became king,. Only to throw all his feudal knights against basic spear men in the african campaign. My spy became king losing vast random tracks of lands to other claims. Finally I regained most of my lands.. Game froze.. Had not saved in 6 hours. This is a really good game for its time, and despite some of the clunky controls a solid experience with all its merits still. I grabbed it for a couple bucks and put in more than time than I paid for. I wish some of these features were implimented with modern Total War games.			"

Take charge of a country in Europe and begin to piece together an empire to rival the Golden Horde, The Ottomans, or Holy Roman Empire. In my case I united Ireland, took England, and then swallowed up Spain, Portugal, France and Germany before squaring off against the Fatimids, Teutons, Lithuanians and all other rivals. The game is broken into 3 sections: a political map, an action map, and the battlefield. The battlefield is a strategic trooop leading exercise like in Total War and other games. On the action map you control several knights who guide your army, evangelize and convert cities, control trade or spy on other nations. Combine these talents and conquer Europe!			"

												ive played this now for 84 hours on steam and a few hundred off steam this is and always will be the best game ive ever played in terms of music and strat. this is a real classic for people who like RTS games. the best way i can describe this game is. This game is like total war on a smaller scale and a more arcade like game. considering this game was made years ago it doesnt look to bad in terms of graphics and art. in this game there are 3 game modes play on europe a campaign game where the main objective is conquer europe in the medieval ages. quick battle where you are given an army of random units and you battle them be it an open battle or defending or laying seige to a castle. then there is multiplayer where you choose the battle field your army and you battle this doesnt really work as no one is playing multiplayer :(. for all my hours on this game i cant find any faults granted im not a game critique like worth a buy but i still look and cant find any. since this game was made ages ago and really is a very good game im surprised there hasent been another one. so for £7 this really is worth the money and if you dont like it you can refund it so why not give it a go.

												While at first glance Knights of Honor may look like a low budget Medieval: Total War clone, upon closer examination you will find that it has a personality all its own. Firstly; there are no turns. Everything happens in “real"" time (though you can speed up, slow down, and pause as you like). It also has many features that make it unique, not the least of which are the knights for which it’s named. While not perfect, if you are a fan of grand strategy in medieval settings you really should check out this underrated gem.			"

												Perfect game without any similar game in terms of concept. Simple kingdom relations management and nice tactical battles. The pain is only that there is no widescreen support and the graphics, though its all related to the old age of the game. It still remains at top due to its ""fun factor"" and would be a blast if someone managed to update it to new graphics, just for gods sake dont ""improve"" change the game like they do(f* up) all rebuilt titles.

												This is a very fun game, It is as Fun as the Total War series but alittle less detailed, the limited slot value for the castle improvements, Army units, and Commanders keep each game unique and keep you from having the same system over and over. each castle is not the same, each have diffrent starting traits per game. each trait allows diffrent buildings to be built per proverance. then another cool thing is each nation have atleast 1 unquie unit and each nation have atleast 1 unquie unit, then the Religions have Unique units as well. for example, the Frence has Feudal Knights for nation, and Halberdier for region units,  while the English have Men-at-war for Nations and Longbow for regions. every region is diffrent all this allows diffrent game play per play through.  the game is in Real time both in battle and overview. example for the diffrence. so i was playing as england, and i for got to save before i went to bed, and i still had the game and i lost some things i did, in the first go through the Irish were beating the other UK regions  and the Germans were beating the french and Italians, The Papacy was becoming powerful. the Arab regions were almost unified. and Norway was still around. but the next time i played, The Irish still beat the scotts and Welsh. but the french were being killed by the Portugal and the Germans were ripped apart by the Italians and Pomerania. and the Arab Regions were all little proverance states. the Norwegians were taken over by Denmark. and Poland was a huge world power rivaling my own.

												I've been playing Knights of Honor for many years. A popular comparison would be to say this is a real time version of Medieval 2: Total War. However, there are a lot more nations and quite a bit of options. I was delighted to see this game was on steam ever since I broke the original CD I got back around 2004 or 2005. This game is very deep with a lot to discover, but not a lot of information about what is available. For instance, if you are in the Early period, you can take control of Normandy and try to recreate the Norman conquest. Once you eliminate all English nations, a popup will appear with an option to change your name to England and get a bonus, or stay as Normandy. Also, in the (I think Late) medieval period, you can control a Spanish nation and attempt to reunite Spain. One thing to note, there are cheat codes for this game, and there once was a very robust and active community who developed some fantastic mods. There used to be challenges for who could conquer England the fastest, beat the game with Kingdom Advantages, total conquest, etc. It's sad that this community is all but gone now since it added a lot of life and variety of the game. This game has a huge learning curve, but once you get it, it's fairly straight forward. Develop your own strategies for running your kingdoms, building your castles, raising your armies, and conquering the world. I recommend this to any strategy lover or medieval fan.			"

												A good wargame, but unplayable on last versions of Windows. The graphics are tight in strategic map and outdated in tactical battles, although include a clear cenital view. Mechanics is wonderfull, really deep, varied and complete on military, economic and diplomatic issues, and with a honest AI. Could be one of the better wargames ever made, but its real-time gameplay not allows take advantage of all fine aspects. Later was adapted by designers of Total War series, who after made Total War Medieval, that introduced his turn-based system that really improved the gameplay concept, but eliminating the true cenital view, introducing a cheater AI, gambling for graphic spectacularity, downgrading the options of game mechanics, and invested a lot of recurses in marketing.This historic title and its successful concepts were forgotten, too because the software not was upgraded for new OS, and progressively became unplayable for later Windows versions by compatibility problems. Download last patch ( by the way, not included in Steam version ) or change the OS compatible options not solve the problems. A pitty. Only can be play perfectly with Windows Xp, and if not possible, only with patience against the unavoidable crushings to desktop. Unnoficial Mods and Community Patchs make tnings get better, but not solve all problems, by the moment. Recomend save a lot, play with compatibility with at least Windows Vista, uncheck all visual enhances and sound effects, and read a online manual. Obviously, to buy only with a huge discount or in bundles.			"

												I'm conflicted about how to rate this game, because while it was pivotal in introducing me to the genre, it's not fun anymore.I played this game a lot as a kid, pre-Steam, and very much enjoyed it. It introduced me to new aspects of medieval political history and map painting, and ultiamtely led me to Paradox games, one of the best gaming discoveries I've made. But years later, after playing Crusader Kings and Total War, I can't go back. The interface now feels very cumbersome (you can't even zoom out), the mechanics too shallow, and the battles too haphazard.So, try it as a piece of history, but chances are you've been spoiled already.

												Knights of Honor was a blast from the past even on its release date---as the Total War series started to evolve away from province-based conquest and toward the form it now has become, KoH was effectively a clone of Medieval: Total War (the first one).  Which means that it will always have a place on my hard drive, since MTW1 just plain doesn't seem to like to run on fast, modern machines, while Knights of Honor runs smoothly and all but completely crash-free.

												One of the best medieval soundtracks I've heard in a strategy game.Combat is mediocre at best, though the seiges are a lot of fun.-Empire management is simple enough with your towns focusing on specific production of limited resources (one region able to focus on making wine, marble, and salt while others focus on cultivation and fishing maybe). So expanding to neighboring regions and trading with other empires is a must if you wish to be successful early on. Each region also has a random generator attached to them. It decides what features it starts with at the beggining of the game, either farm, chapel, village, and docks (I also think it depends if you have certain options checked before starting). -Knights have differing proffessions: merchant, spy, commander, mason, farmer, etc...(e.g.. Have your only heir become a spy, infiltrate the enemy nation, commands one of their armies, mistake hime for an actual enemy..............It isn't a complex game but it's fun enough to try if your bored with EU4 and the likes. Could also get you started with the genre if you are new...			"

												I have played this game since I was 16 and Not a single day I got bored of itto my opinion this game is the Adam and Eve of games like Europa Universalis and CivilizationThe game has an old world map with three different ages to play in. Ages does not matter in terms of weapons, buildings or military units however, each age has its own countries, borders and political situationsThere is multiple religions from Paganism to Catholic, Orthodox, and Islam with a few kingdom abilities that makes every religion different than the otherThe AI is pretty dump even at the hardest level in the game however, the gameplay is never boring.You can hire a limited amount of royal court members to be either merchants, clerks, spies, landloards, builders, Marshals, etc. and you can control your kingdom happiness, production, gold income, and trade routes in an acceptable wayPolitics are really good in KOH where you can build your relationship with another kingdom build ties or watch your relationship ruined through time with your allies depending on your interests in the gameYou can win either with claiming the title as a ruler of Europe, or through winning elections with majority amongst the other kingdoms, or by collecting all exotic goods, or simply by conquering all the provinces out there in the mapThe amount of details provided in the game considering it is released in 2004 makes it one of the greatest games I have ever played. I wish they have released a series of KOH games.PS: I have played it with another license so you can easily add one thousand hours of playing to the hours recorded by steam			"

												I didn't think I would like this game, it looks a bit like the kingdoms of a childrens story and sounds like it's narrated by Morgan freeman. But you can get use to the art design and the gameplay is actually what I was looking for.             If you thought ""Total War"" has been missing the mark recntly with grand strategy as I have, then this game is perfect for you. Sure you're not going to have much in the way of Epic battles but the strategy part is there. Both the campaign map and battles are in Real Time, and there is not time pausing as far as I can tell. The game requires you to think on your feet, busy marching your armies north? well you just missed the enemy swing around and invaded you from the east.             This game also simulates one thing ""Total War"" does not; Campaigning. For instance if you want to take the fight in enemy territory you have to plan, you only get a base 100 food in your cart (Can be upgraded with buildings or leader abilities) if you run low half way to your target you have to plunder a farm to get more which is time comsuming. Also the Longer your on the march the more your men's morale will drop, you'll have to Camp your Armies to keep morale up or plunder villiages wich give you gold.             There is no prisoners of war like later ""Total War"" titles however if you decimate an army without killing it's leader (Member of enemy royal court) you capture him and can ransom him off let him go or execute him.              The game also gives your Great historical infomation with 3 playable start times all with a diffrent mix of nations to choose from, and a lengthy introduction to each one. To summarize, if your looking for a grand strategy game that is just that, one that you can prepare your armies and plan massive operations, buy this 10 dollar game, you won't regret adding it to your library.

												If you like Medieval Total War, you'll probably like this. The battles aren't as memorable, and it really places a focus on kingdom building and diplomacy. As such, it can be a fun little jaunt into the byzantine politics of dark age Europe. The only shortcomings are the lackluster battles and the fact that you need to own certain provinces in order to produce what you would think would be staple medieval units such as Feudal Knights or Armored Swordsmen.A good buy at $9.99, and an excellent time-sink. Not as engrossing as Europa Universalis, thank God - approachable, with a fully voiced tutorial. Simple but deep mechanics. Extremely dated graphics. Good stuff, though.			"

												I have played this game since I was five years old and when I didn't know what more than half the options meant. I am now thirteen and I am STILL finding new strategies in this game. I have played some of the biggest title games, but I have never enjoyed a game more than Knights of Honor.Update on that one: Currently, 17, still playing the game. Interesting stuff has been found. Apparently a Muslim King, historically speaking, CAN become the Pope. Didn't know that was Catholics believed in Allah.			"

Product received for free
												Got this game as a gift a few days ago and let me tell ya, I am having alot of fun. Yes it is published by paradox interactive but it is totally not their game. They though if you look at their games have taken from this game alot of times. I honestly find this game alot more deep than their games in a few ways that they cant replicate. Also it doesnt have DLC spam like their games. For instance the New Expansion for EU4 is about plagues and like(should be a free patch as it doesnt really add much according to description) and it will cost I bet around 25 USD. That is the over half price of the original game. I cant support a company that treats its customers like that, when you buy a x amount game and have to buy x times 5/7 to make it complete. Just saying here, Also I suggest Darkest Hour, another game published but not made by PI.			"

												Good game overall, especially for one so old and now cheap (bought it for $2). The game is very much replayable and there's so many starting options I personally have been playing the same path for 9 hours (byzantine, year 1000?,  easy) with that being said.... I rather suck or the game's just that complicated. It's so in depth that it makes you focus on your entire kingdom all at once. 2-3 nations could be attacking you from different corners of your kingdom plus rebels revolting. Definitely the best game if you're looking for long hours of addicting game play and a low price.Cons Instructions/tutorial can be a little vague (it's a more learn as you go), in depth fighting is a little rough and hard to control (I personally just let AI do the fighting now), and the game crashes quite often (i'd say about 2-3 times every 2 hours) TURN AUTOSAVE ON, there's an option to autosave every 15 min TURN IT ON.Update on review 3 lhours later....TURN THAT MFING AUTOSAVE ON !!! 3 mins till my next autosave and game crashed. As i said before the game is extremely fast paced, so losing any data is a little disorienting when you have to re-establish where you're at in the game. A huge flaw and consideration before buying this game.... still loving it tho <3			"

												Very engaging game! Like Mount and Blade but without the actual 3d closeup combat. Quite complex depending on your playstyle, but everything is there. Espionage? Check! Combat? Yup! Alliances? You bet. Trading? Of course! You really get the feeling that each action has a ripple effect, changing your stances beyond the nation you've just signed with, according to their alliances and yadada. It's slow, methodical, and works very well. Made me a new fan of an old game!			"

												This is probably one of the most underrated strategy games I've played. I can look a bit dated, but it's the gameplay that does the difference. Especially when compared with other Paradox strategy games. It's not a pompous, bloated pseudo-complex games as Crusader Kings 2, for example. It's simple to get into, you can finish a campaign in one quarter of the time than you would with Crusader Kings, and it's never boring - you always got something to do.I wish Paradox would release a Knights of Honor 2 sometime soon, or, at least, that a bigger modding community would exist for  this game.10/10			"

I think most of the negative points addressed are true although the good greatly out weigh the bad. This was one of my favorites for a long time.I notice the steam version is more together then the version I used to play,  and this is a good thing cause it used to be easy to get over on the computer, AI is batter now...hard is now actually HARD. Fans of the old ""Imperialism"" will love this. 8/10			"

												I started to play this game in autumn 2010, many years after its release.Didn't had too much information about it, apparently almost nobody ever heard of it (the only exception, a romanian gaming magazine called Level), but I did discover while playing that is surprisingly good and so much fun.Easy to learn and not too hard to master (although it's not a quite simple game), intuitive, balanced, sometimes challenging, in rare occasions frustrating. Very atmospheric music, too.Some hilarious speeches also.Diplomacy could of been a little more elaborate (but it's far better than M2TW), the presence of some minor bugs, multiplayer limited only to battles - those are the things that should of been better. Best part is the strategical component of the game, worst part the tactical component (the battles).But, all in one, I'd recommend KoH to anyone who likes a good medieval strategy, it's a game that definitely worth the time spent while playing, I still enjoy it every now and then.Too bad the bulgarians from Black Sea Studio didn't release a Knights of Honor II...

The graphics are reminiscent of Age of Empires but they absolutely manages to carry any information the player might want. Cities grow when you add industries and different types of soldiers all look unique enough that you can easily tell them apart on the battlefield. Easily worth the money.Only things i would say detrct from the game is the fact that it had no multiplayer and the fact that it's playable resolution is stuck in the 90s.			"

												Used to love this game alot then stopped cannot remember why, saw it on sale immediately picked it up, excited to play it booted up and went in and remembered why I stopped playing.Pros- 1. Alot of unit variety2. Alot of ""factions""/countries3. Nice blend of combat and managing of country and family/court4. Loads of different builds for cities/provinces depending on resources and needs5. Diplomacy seems better than some games where every AI does not immediately declare war Cons-1. Combat is really really stale and way too fast, archers are really good for killing own units, tactics vary little.2. AI constantly recruits peasants but yet said peasants always manage to kill alot of my own better trained ones like spearmen/swordsmen3. Unit variety does not really help when certain units arent even good at what they are supposed to be for, eg. light cavalry charged head on into 2 tightened formation of spearmen, managed to wipe my spearmen out easily by kiting them.4. AI really kind of cheats, I burned down his coastal village, imprisoned 2 of his marshalls, sacked and pillaged most outlying villages producing money and yet he manages to dig out 6500 coins each to rescue both marshalls, instantly recruit full stacks of swordsman and come back at me with 3 marshalls when I have yet to even earn 1000 coin to buy a new unit. Supposed his traders were simply floating off or teleporting to the other nations to trade with them5. Hardware/outdated software issues. Game runs in 1024 x 768 max causing borders and stretching on pretty much current industry standards of widescreens. Scrolling is either too slow, too fast or very ""jerking"" in a sense probably due to aforementioned stretching. Unable to zoom in/out makes decision making and planning tough. Probably some other pros/cons slipped off my mind but this should be enough for now. Conclusion: Buy if PC is dated and cannot play any new strategy games/runs in 1024x768 resolution. A good game back then but unfortunately just cannot keep up now.			"

Posted: October 4, 2015
												This is a great game. It's a weird mix of Europa Universalis (real time strategy map, faction events such as rebels) and Total War (tactical battles, faction/location unique units and province improvements). And it works wonderfully.Pros: A quicker yet deeper Total War-like game. The strategic map is real-time, so the game flows better than Total War's turn-based strategic map. It remains manageable because you have a limited set of knights (who can be generals, merchants, priests, etc).Europa Universalis-like events, like rebels, nations rising, crusades. It makes the strategic game really fluid, with factions moving across the map, overextending, and collapsing to rebels or nations rising. Even large nations are not immune, so there isn't an invincible, immovable big blob (except for you if you play things right).Cons: The game is 2D only. While the art style is ok, the low resolution (1024x768) makes playing both the strategy map and tactical battles cumbersome. An HD remake that allows you to zoom out would be awesome. See Majesty HD for reference.Can get repetitive towards the end of the game once you become dominant. AI is a easy once you get over the hump at the start of a new game. AI factions don't often concentrate their forces, and builds way too many low quality units. Even worse, AI alliances don't support each other's armies, which leads to them being defeated separately.			"

												Love this game. The first game of its type I played when I was younger. Wish they'd make a new one. Crusader Kings doesn't interest me, in large part due to the lack of moving armies and how combat works. Even if you don't use the RTS style combat in KoH, I still find the map combat superior to Crusader Kings. It's more interesting. Also fun to watch your troops march across Germany, raving villages along the way, only to have your top marshal drafted for the crusades.			"

												I can't believe how good this game is, and that I've never heard of it.I was so surprised I decided to write my first review ever on steam for this title, if that tells you anything.It's like a mix between Age of Empires 2, Medieval 2 Total War, and Crusader Kings!Throughout playing I keep noticing features in this game that have been reused in many modern strategy games.Graphics are dated obviously but the art style is actually clean and very well done!I'd say the main drawback is that it does have a pretty steep learning curve, and takes quite a bit of trial and error to get a hang of all the game mechanics, but it's totally worth it.

												A great game, but two aspects kill the experience for me.The first is the randomly-generated cities.  If you don't have certain resources in any of your cities, too bad, you're stuck; the RNG is too real.The second is that you cannot zoom out in battles.  When I can't see my whole army from a reasonable distance, some mechanic is wrong (or missing) from the game.Other than that, Knights of Honor is a well-crafted, funnily-narrated, deeply-intricate strategy game.  I'm impressed with the scope that KoH manages.  I recommend it ONLY if you're willing to put up with those two major issues.  I hope you can look past them and love the game for the rest of what it is; I cannot.			"

												As a consumer I always try to avoid buying games that will not get play time. It's not fair to the game or my dollar. Because I bought this on sale for a very small amount I was not concerned with the lack of achievements or potential loss. This game was not a loss, it was my addiction for a week. (considering opportunity cost... it may be a loss)This game stood out on the market place because of its Age of Empires II graphics coupled with a seemingly total war ""esk"" strategy dynamic. Upon reading reviews it had a zealous fanbase. (always a good sign) When this game booted up I was suprised to see that this was published by Paradox Games. That was when I knew, that I would be in for a treat.This game's most valuable asset is the real time mechanic. Most often I avoid real time stategy like the plague because I like to take my time playing turn based stategy games. However, Knights of Honor has a real balanced approach to real time and made a real fresh experience in my primarily turn based game library. With a trade system like Settlers of Catan KoH frees you to focus on the land grab and military aspects of the game. In addition, this game is not so much do or die. Most games I play: Crusader Kings II, Dark Souls II, LoL, require a well planned and finesed approach to everything you do. They will stress you out after a while. The game handles a lot like Sid Meiers Civiliation, its got a relaxed approach that gets only as serious as you want it to be. The last gem within this game is the randomization of the map resources. I cannot tell you how many games are limited by a single game breaking exploit based on an area, character, or strategy. The randomization frees you from the burden of starter placement. It gives you a reason to expand, instead of being passive. It gives the game all the replay value and ultimately drives the game. I would describe this game as Sega's Total War + Settlers of Catan dressed up as Age of Empires II masquerading as Crusader Kings. Very unique.If this game had only received a better name and more marketing it would have been a gaming Giant.			"

												Played this game for the first time last night and ended up playing for 6 hours straight (it says I only played it for 5 minutes but I don't know why it's not recalling my previous time).  I should have gone to bed earlier, but it was very enjoyable.  It has a helpful tutorial that gives a good overview and feel without overwhelming with detail.  The art is beautiful, the different elements of managing your kingdom are well chosen and engaging.  There is a good balance between strategy and improvisation.  Really got me excited about the ""grand strategy"" genre.  It's evident that a great deal of care went into the design of this game.I think right about the time I started to figure out that I could try negotiating royal marriages with other kingdoms and that would affect diplomacy and future implications about contingent succession, all happening on the side as it were in a game that I had been treating more like a Risk/empire-building game, that is when I began to feel very impressed.  The dynamic of different religions and occasional religious events and the subsequent effects that can have on every nation is richly complex and fun.  Espionage with different branches of possibilities and control.  The ability to choose auto- or manual battles.  Skills and experience bonuses.  Special trade goods and resources.  Kingdom advantages.  An excitingly reasonable diplomacy engine.  Reasonable morale.  Kingdom modifiers.  The different relational dimensions go on and yet it doesn't feel heavy, rather it was pretty easy to just dive in and start making waves.  Oh, I dig it!  Two thumbs way up!			"

												A good light grand strategy game to get your feet wet in such games. In comparison to Crusader Kings 1/2 and Medieval 2: Total War, it is very arcadey. You can take the known world by pure conquest or by subterfuge using spies, or even by demanding another kingdom recognize your right to certain lands due to to a royal marriage.That said, there is no family tree history. There is just your current ruler (King, Emperor, Sultan, Caliph, Khan, whatever), his wife (either an ""ordinary noblewoman"" or a woman they married from another kingdom), and their sons and daughters. Only your sons may inherit, you can choose which one becomes king but this can cause some issues. Your daughters can only be married off for royal marriages/alliances.The campaign map is akin to a total war game's campaign map, except in real-time. You can pause or speed up time, however. The battlemap plays out with you actually ordering individual units, and even your marshal (you can not send an army out without a marshal) + his bodyguard, to fight (whether in a field battle or siege). It has the look of a cleaner age of empires 2: the conquerors, in terms of graphics. You may opt to instead let battles auto-resolve (certain marshal traits only apply in auto-resolve). Naval battles are always auto-resolved, and can never be fought manually.The A.I. was purportedly developed simply to entertain the player (it was discussed on the old black sea studios forums), rather than actually challenge them, even on Hard difficulty, but this is more or less the case with pretty much any video game in existence that has functional artificial intelligence, anyway. The game has surprised me a few times, like when I had no heirs to inherit the throne, and it turned out the nobleman whom took the throne for himself (a lord I hired to act as a merchant to earn more gold) was actually a spy for another kingdom... And so he dutifully handed the crown over to said kingdom, and suddenly game over.It still has great entertainment value, however. And there is even a modding community for it, and once you've mastered the game on the ""Hard"" difficulty setting, there is a ""Hard"" modification that makes the A.I. into a totally unrepentant warmonger once you've reached a certain amount of provinces, though they can declare war before that point. Moddb.com has some of these modifications.			"

												Absolutely beautiful game. Everything is awesome. Realtime grand strategy game. I love how you can see armies move accross the map. It's not like they are some chess pieces. You can create tactics even outside the battle. You can cross the path of the raiding army and save a town from being captured. Excellent gameplay. There are 5 levels of diplomacy. You can conquer everything not only by force, you have powerful spies, and the power of religion. You need to take care of providing an heir to the throne and the interrelations, or you could pretty much lose everything.Unfortunately the multiplayer consists of only battles and no conquer all scenario. There is no cooperative. And another sad thing is that the developer Black Sea Studios were bought by Crytek, and are now know as Crytek Black Sea. And there will be no KoH2. I looked into it and the rights for the game now belong to another party, so I don't think that they will release the source either, because this game has potential and should be left for the community to make the game great. Btw there are some tools that allows customization of the game. Custom maps, custom graphics, custom music and sounds. But it is limited to the number of content that the original game can have. Even though the game is already pretty old, this is a great game.			"

												I have played this game back when I was 14 and loved it.10 years have passed now, so what is left?Well defenitely not the compatibility with modern computers. I run win 8 and the game pretty much hates it.It crashes at random. And it has a weird bug where, when garrisoning troops the mouse gets stuck in its garrisoning task and hindering you to click on most of the stuff. Great... Also the german translation is gone,      -        because of reasons.Playing the actual game brings up mixed feelings. On the one side there is of course nostalgia, the great music, the pretty art style of the game. Also the refreshingly not completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ campaign AI. You can actually form treaties and alliances with them unlike in certain other games. *cough* Also the campaign is in real time just as the battles. Some might not like this, but I enjoy it.On the other side there are the actual battles. Looking back I can't really seem to grasp how I enjoyed them.Here are some points that kill the battles for me:Controlls:  - no way to select multiple troops without drawing a box with the mouse- no way to form a line with multiple troops properlyView:        - no zoom in / zoom out- camera is stuck right on top of the map, so you have absolutely no overviewAI:            - the AI of the troops always tries to attack enemies from the front. This makes sorrounding your enemy and performing hammer and anvil strikes almost impossible.- the troops are able to walk into each other when ordered to attack the same unit.Who needs tactics? Mass wins!General:   - In sieges armies spawn much to close to each other. You have very little time to react to rally your troops as a defender without walls. And as an attacker you need to draw back your troops instantly because they spawn range of the enemies archers and towers.- Stamina is drained too quickly from the troops which makes manouvering in battle difficult and tactics obsolete.- Cavalry is to slow compared to infantry making skirmishing, and using them as a flexible force impossible.And best of all: If your General is killed, the battle is lost automaticaly and you loose all your troops. Which is even more infuriating is the fact, that the enemy general can, and will, ride over and kill your general instantly, winning the battle. Also, if your general and the enemy general are in a fight, the enemy general will win. Always.It happened to me more than once that I was winning the battle and then without noticing (remember the view is stuck right on top of the lawn) the enemy general snuck around my army to kill mine. No call out by the game like: ""your general is being attacked!"".No, no, we don't need that...Basically you win battles by having better troops, sitting back and letting your archers do most of the work.Well and of course not letting the enemy general kill yours...All in all I'd rather recommend auto resolving them and to concentrade on the campaign.Summary:I can recommend the game for those who like a relaxed and fun campaign, whilst enjoying the beautiful music and art style.But due to the fact that Steam is once again selling a very old game for money without fixing it to work on newer machines I can't.

While a few things are annoying (king dies, your large empire then gets splits up if you have no heirs [this happens to the AI too which means easy pickings for you]), it is easy to look beyond any shortcomings because it is so damn fun.Slow starts with small kingdoms are fun...especially when you expand from 1 province to 30+ and have an income of over 2000.It is worth the $60 I've paid so you bet your royal behind it is worth the $9.99.

The publisher has made zero effort to rectify the problem.The game only runs in 1024x768 resolution, and you can't switch to fullscreen.  Instead, the app overdraws, overfilling the screen so even the main menu is inaccessible. It's reprehensible to sell such games on the Steam store with no warnings about incompatibility.

												Okay this the reason I am giving this game a negative review is becuase of the late game. The late game is just boring and bd. Once you get very big you have to keep your marshals in your territory in case there is a peasent rebellion. There is always a chance there wil be a peasent rebellion and you cannot change that becuase there is only one upgrade to the tavern. It becomes a crushing revolts simulator in the late game. The reason this hapens is becuase you cannot make your court size bigger so the bigger you get the more thin your army gets.			"

												Nice at the begining, but the limit of Marshals and the unending rebellions when your kingdom grows, just make the endgame unbearable. Every single time. What's the point in even starting a game if you cannot finish it just beacause of a stupid limit wich makes no sense ?			"

												Phew...this is a tough nut...I've been the ruler of Europe in some ways so often...can't even say how much time I've spent.Which makes it all the sadder to see this lazy steam portation. The port is not bad on it's own, it's just horribly incorporated into steam. Basically not at all. Fun fact: the steam version uses the EXACT same data that the non-steam version did, I could just go pick up my old save files without manually altering any files or paths.Problem is, same goes for a lot of other things. It seems it just emulates everything from ""back then"", steam overlay doesn't work, no screenshots or anything, screen resolution forcably set to 1024x768 (yes, not only game resolution but your screen as well), tabbing out of the game crashes the AI making enemy kingdoms and their marshal stand around useless for a moment, also overworld locations (villages, ports, etc) don't regenerate after time as they should be. There were some other...irregularities I couldn't tie to the portation without a doubt (like Germany conquering Papacy within the first 3 minutes, might be an issue or just my imagination). As of the current status, I can only give this game a negative review. Hopefully fixes will change my mind. Until then, steer clear of this port.			"

												OMG! I almost conquer all Europe, just Sweden (North-East) and the Russia side (east)... but sunddenly my king die and ALL my region become independent!! I lost over 50+ regions, how that possible?? (my king have died by age)It is good idea that the king die because getting old and so... but the problem is that they don't get any child often, and the throne end up in one of the marshals (general). Oh! and usually that marshals is in your comand for long time too, so he will die again before he can have a child...There are limited amount of marshal you can have... This is bad because: -To be able to trade, you need a marshal to do so... The merchant can't command an army, he can only trade with ONE ally at a time!! -All captured (prisoner), either from your side or the enemy occupies space. That mean if you have your marshal slot full, you can't captured any prisoner.			"

												This game has a few serious flaws:- no full-screen mode, not even stretched. Horrible.- no zoom-in/out over the map: difficult to estimate the size of a nearby kingdom, difficult to navigate your own kingdom and cities, difficult to get a sense of what is going on- every diplomatic agreement among any other country appears on the notification area, however you receive absolutely *no warning whatsoever* when a kingdom *declares war* on you: if they just immediately on an outpost that has no defensive walls, you are screwed. Now, how does this game qualify as *real time strategy* when it gives you no time to plan and enact a strategy to counter the computer's moves? - apparently, the time can not be paused while still being able to interact with the map to get a better understanding of what is going on in the nearby cities. - the tutorial goes to great distances to explain trivial stuff like 'click here and there to show this and that' - thank you Captain Obvious, I can learn that myself - but it doesn't spend a single word on the most crucial aspects of the game, that is how stats affect other stats. Basically, you've got to do a lot of trial and error the first dozen of matches before you are able to design a sensible strategy and not waste your gold.- at times, armies just sit there doing nothing despite of being given an order repeatedlyPositive aspect- The overall idea of the game is great, but the technical implementation of these ideas is horrific and it is not worth a single penny.

Unbelievable they do not give you a popup for needed resources- How do I know the strenght of a castle before attacking?- REBELS EVERYWHERE, puny but burning your stuff. And my nice army next to them does nothing unless explicitly ordered - Building unclear; do I need multiple buildings in all counties? Do I need one? Such a mess- recruiting; there seems to be a centralized recruiting system somewhere but when I need something its not there. So: UnclearPositive- Diplomacy, there is some- Trade, except the ui to help you there is some- war. simple but fine			"

												I've put 50 hours into this game and won both the minor-economic and major-voting victories.It's a very good game for it's age. Sadly, we don't live in 2004 anymore.Graphics 0/0 ------------ The graphics are not an issue for me.Diplomacy 4/10 --------- The diplomacy was simple yet satisfying. Though after I had figured out the mechanics though it was easy to manipulate.Economy/Industry 6/10 - It was compelling, having to find the resources I needed from other provinces for specific Trade Goods. Once obtained though it was just an unnessicary chore to duplicate any other building excluding military ones.Military/Combat 4/10 --- The overworld and direct battle system is just so very simple. Even on hard, battles are easy and boring.AI programming 3/10 --- The AI literally has the same options and functions as the player does which is great but the AI simply doesn't use a lot of those functions (religion, deleting and rebuilding correct structures, proper military anything, knight professions).It's a nice game. But nice doesn't bring home the big bucks or get your dream girlfriend.If it's cheap get it. And if you're a fan towards this kind of game then don't worry about it. "

												  Not a terrible game but definitely not a top performer in the genre.  Nice unit choices and a variety of building options.  However the buildings are somewhat weak with their effect and really don't do much for the playability of the game other than give unit recruitment and some resources used for the kingdom advantages part of the game.  The ""Royal Court"" only consists of 9 slots regardless of how many provinces you own and that gets to be a real problem with expanding your kingdom.  Somehow you have to fit marshals, priests, governors, merchants, spies etc, into these 9 slots to manage your expanding kingdom.  That is pretty much impossible.  I usually went with 1 merchant, 7 marshals and left a spot open for whatever else I needed at any given point which makes the whole kingdom court a useless part of the game.  Even with this strategy it was advance a few provinces and then wait and quell the constant uprisings in the newly conquered provinces.  This takes what seems like forever as you have to wait for the ""Nostalgia"" effect to drop before the rebels stop spawning in the recently acquired areas.  Diplomacy is unpredictable as nations that you have had good relations with will eventually turn bad for no apparent reason.  Marrying into the noble family of another nation is no guarantee that the nation will have good feelings for you and seems to do nothing but cause problems in the future.  Marrying off a princess is, most of the time, the worst thing you can do.  It doesn't help your standing with the nation your princess is married to and if they claim rights to your lands it goes bad for you either way you decide to handle it.  If you agree, you lose land. If you disagree you lose more than half your kingdom power which effects several aspects of the game to include income, happiness of the populace, and overall standing with other nations. princesses in my kingdoms were all spinsters, never married and an overall waste of the king and queens lustful energy.  There are a lot of things I like about this game. Unfortunately there are a lot of other things I find very undesirable.  Now for the reason I gave this game a ""NO"" in the recommendation.  With all the little things that are either small irritants or just plainly useless in game play the thing that makes no sense is thus.  I played several campaigns and they all ended the same way.  For no apparent reason or some reason that completely escapes me all of my marshals will just quilt and turn against me.  With population at a content level and everything going well they just decide to turn rebel and start destroying anything and everything around them.  When new marshals are recruited to replace and fight the old ones they too turn rebel and continue the onslaught against their former king.  The developers may as well have just added a message that says: ""You have played this particular game enough and even though you have done well and managed your kingdom like a pro, YOU LOSE! please play again soon.""  I guess that is one way of getting out of writing a good successful end game screenplay.  If you do decide to purchase this game I'm sure you will get several hours of enjoyment playing it, just don't expect it to be the greatest game of all time because that one hasn't been written yet.  I do wish this game was better than it is.  It had the potential in development but I think they either ran low on funding or just got sloppy towards the end and rushed it out.  Nevertheless I hope you find this helpful and as I said earlier if you do play this I truly hope you find it enjoyable for the parts that do make it fun and take the rest in stride.  Its not a perfect world after all.  Cheers :)			"

												This is a good game. I'm not really a fan of old strategy games, but this one is an exception. This game allowed me to become the ruler of Scotland, convert Rome's religion to Islam, and be the most hated kingdom in Europe. This game is surprisingly fun and addictive.

												From the first time I saw my brother and cousin playing this game I was kind of captivated by it and had to try it for myself. KoH is an amazing strategy with surprisingly fitting and enjoyable music, which is in the case of medieval games very rare. Voice acting can sometimes get a bit irritating, but mostly its funny, the meta-narrator is even great. Political view! The landscape and the maps are very beautifuly designed, no 3D graphics unreasonable nonsense with no other purpose than to be 3D. I do not know how they achieved it, but every province has a different feel, making every part of the map somewhat unique, breathing history.The mechanics are not that complicated, making KoH an easily learnable game, while it does not degenerate into a boring repetition (to a certain limit). The relative simplicity is then a win, but i would not mind a few more tricks.The biggest letdown is that the multiplayer game supports only patricular tactical battles, not the whole european strategy level. If it did... well, that would most probably be extremely amazing.			"

I have non aggression pacts with everyone. I basically just fund other countries.My country is basically handing out free money and no one attacks me, it's great. "

												Great middle-ages empire game in the vein ot the Total War series. More emphasis on resource control and your officers. Has some unique features I'd like to see in more games like the resources I mentioned. Depending on some random generation, certain territories have certain natural resources. These resources can allow you to train horses or obtain different food items. Having multiple resources can unlock ""Kingdom Advantages"" which give you bonuses.I'd reccomend it for anyone who plays the Europa Universalis or Total War series.			"

												A hidden gem of grand strategy. If you like CK and EU, you'll dig the heck out of this. I found myself losing hours and hours and hours I couldn't afford to waste.There are short-term problems and long-term problems in this game. After a little bit of time you will know how to solve all of them, so even a problem that wrecks a whole lifetime in your kingdom will be only a little obstacle for you. You'll find yourself accepting when bad things happen, because you will know that if you slowly work toward reversing your losses, you'll come out way ahead. I find this to be tremendous in comparison to EU4, where after many hours of play the game will constantly set out to screw you and you can't stop it, and you will not be able to recover.I wish there was a sequel or an expansion that made provinces smaller, allowing for slower conquest of the continent. For example Scotland is just two provinces with only one or two trade goods available - if the game were expanded and Scotland were made into more provinces, and more of its RL trade goods implemented in each, then I feel like starting as Scotland and slowly taking over the island would be less annoying. But, I did it anyway. Scotland now rules most of Europe, having started from like 2 guys with swords and a salt mine. Though the HRE is aligned against me, its most powerful members being arab sultanates from the middle east...? Alt history fun.			"

Send a spy to a neighboring country to ensure that they do your bidding... is insanely satisfying...I remember when I played with Ottomans I've sent a spy to the papacy, the dude is elected as pope, I've managed to disband a crusader army against me... All in all it's a good game if you liked the ""Civilization"" part of the Total War and want to play that aspect with more intreguing mechanics...			"

												Knights of Honor is one of my many favorite strategy games. In all honestly to the people who never heard of this, I sugguest you buy it and give it a try. The price is pretty low and the game is very well worth it. My most favorite thing about the game is the agents mainly the spy becuase I wont spoil much but the spy is someone to be feared. Another good thing I like is the AI is pretty good mainly the alliances. What I mean by that is when you make an ally and get attacked or attack they actually help you. I know I didn't really go into more detail but trust me i've spent enough time playing this game to know the game. Try the game. You really have nothing to lose!     8/10			"

												THE BEST BULGARIAN STRATEGY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!Im from Bulgaria and I can assure you that this is our best game! In my country we are makin strategies mostly (Rising Kingdoms, Celtic Kings, Tzar, Tropico, Omerta, Grand Ages:Rome, Praetorians, Imperium Romanum, Worldshift, etc) and you can be sure, that we are good at it. We even started some crazy MMO project with base building, teritorry capturing and tons of strategy elements called Earth Rises Again, right now known as Earthrise :D but i think that the project is currently frozen.Anyway, as i've said we are great strategy makers, and this is our biggest masterpiece. If you wanna conquer Europe, but most games out there looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ or have high learnin curve, unatractive graphics and boring atmosphere, then you should try Knights of Honor :) Its easy to learn, hard to master strategy, with great graphics (even 11 years after its released lol!!!),  deep strategy, increasing difficulty and tempo, sweet background music, and most importantly - this game will leave you an unforgivable experience. Trust me, there are from zero to none games, that are as satisfyin as this one. Its a bit hard game, and it goes harder with every teritorry that you conquer, but at the end, after you put so many hours and days in this game, and you conquer the whole Europe, the feeling is just....amazing! It feels like a great achievment! Its so satisfyin........And dont look at my playtime. I've put in this game more than 500 hours outside of Steam. I usually dont like to complete my games, but if I do it, I only do it once. This is the only game that I've completed more than 5 times and the crazy thing is that I feel like I will never stop playin it. :)This game is an finished premium product, that can hardly goes better than this. Its made from experienced perfectionists, with a tons of love, and even if you dont like strategies like this (before KoH i dont liked em either) you should give it a try, at least to appreciate their efforts :) But seriously, who dont want to conquer Europe at least once? :D			"

												I Bought this game when it was only released in Europe.  Overall its a great game that does the overhead strategy well. The knight battles are fun but a little old, as soon as you start expanding you might just have the AI do the battles. I would say it is a unique game, it wont give you the depth of crusader kings in politics or the massive battles of total war but it still is fun to take Ireland and conquer the holy land.			"

Other than that the diplomacy while not bad is you could call it basic and by that i mean a 5 year old child could master it in 2 minutes. Aldough it should be said the combat , visuals (the sprites are amazing , the game is done in 2D , but you always have the immpresion thats its 3D) , voiceover (voiceacting) and gameplay have all stood the test of time remarkably well.As i said the game was and STILL IS  a bloody MASTERPIECE! If you like playing strategies I highly reccomend this game.I bought it for my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop , it can bareley run minesweeper but this game runs smooth on it.			"

												Played this game before it was on steam and really liked it, and even now I still find a lot new things about how game works, game mechanics it has a lot more than it looks at first, for example i've heard that some play only with marshals (to fight and conquer) and merchants (to get money) sure that could be some kind of a challenge, in some way, to limit with who to play but you don't fully use game resources and in some way boring, if you use spy and cleric it get's more interesting esspecially when you set a royal wedding marring out your princess to some other older king and using spy that combination can help to get rid of the king and if he doesn't have heir then you can get all the land of that nation.It has nice music too. If you like Strategy games with building, land control, army control, economics and politics then this game might be for you!			"

												Игра хоть и старая, но интересная и затягивающая даже в то время, когда игры создаются с самой реалистичной графикой и возможностями. Жалко только в то время она была не особо популярной, многие даже сейчас, мне кажется, не знают про неё. Спустя столько лет мне приятно всё ещё в неё играть. Надеюсь, выпустят что-то типа HD версии.Хочу сказать спасибо разработчикам за такую прекрасную игру! :) Game though old, but interesting and addictive, even at a time when the games are created with the most realistic graphics and features. It is a pity at the time it was not very popular, many people even now, I think, do not know about this game. After so many years, I am pleased to still play it. I hope the world will see the HD version of this great game.I want to say thanks to the developers for this great game! :)			"

												Charming strategy game with a kind of unique gameplay for it's time. Really good soundtrack which fits the medieval setting of the game.Although the game is quite old, it has aged well and it's still worth playing.			"

												Fun game to play. It'll take you a few hours to master every little detail. I feel there is a lack of depth in certain aspect of the game (spying, lack of technologies, maritime battles...), but overall, any strategy lover should at least try this well balanced game.			"

												THE BEST BULGARIAN STRATEGY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!Im from Bulgaria and I can assure you that this is our best game! In my country we are makin strategies mostly (Rising Kingdoms, Celtic Kings, Tzar, Tropico, Omerta, Grand Ages:Rome, Praetorians, Imperium Romanum, Worldshift, etc) and you can be sure, that we are good at it. We even started some crazy MMO project with base building, teritorry capturing and tons of strategy elements called Earth Rises Again, right now known as Earthrise :D but i think that the project is currently frozen.Anyway, as i've said we are great strategy makers, and this is our biggest masterpiece. If you wanna conquer Europe, but most games out there looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ or have high learnin curve, unatractive graphics and boring atmosphere, then you should try Knights of Honor :) Its easy to learn, hard to master strategy, with great graphics (even 11 years after its released lol!!!),  deep strategy, increasing difficulty and tempo, sweet background music, and most importantly - this game will leave you an unforgivable experience. Trust me, there are from zero to none games, that are as satisfyin as this one. Its a bit hard game, and it goes harder with every teritorry that you conquer, but at the end, after you put so many hours and days in this game, and you conquer the whole Europe, the feeling is just....amazing! It feels like a great achievment! Its so satisfyin........And dont look at my playtime. I've put in this game more than 500 hours outside of Steam. I usually dont like to complete my games, but if I do it, I only do it once. This is the only game that I've completed more than 5 times and the crazy thing is that I feel like I will never stop playin it. :)This game is an finished premium product, that can hardly goes better than this. Its made from experienced perfectionists, with a tons of love, and even if you dont like strategies like this (before KoH i dont liked em either) you should give it a try, at least to appreciate their efforts :) But seriously, who dont want to conquer Europe at least once? :D			"
