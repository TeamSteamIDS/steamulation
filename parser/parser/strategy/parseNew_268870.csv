SummaryFree roam squad based RTS/RPG with a cyberpunk setting running in the classical veins of Syndicate. Start from the ground up with a weak squad and limited supplies, and slowly work your way up the food chain to take on the big corporations. Acquire a mass of guns and upgrades to help you accomplish your goals. Decide whether you want to use stealth, sheer firepower or a mix of both to complete your objectives and rise to the top. Plays a lot like Dawn of War II with a Blade Runner theme whilst being fresh and unique. Highly recommended!Graphics The city is one of the best and most imaginative environments you'll witness in video games. Rain pours down onto the streets below, neon lights reflect in puddles, steam spews out of vents and manholes, elaborate architecture that portrays its own themes and back-stories varying from district to district. Crowds of civilians walking around going about their daily lives, unaware of the potential chaos about to erupt around them. Groups of soldiers patrol outside the surrounding bases, occasionally bullying unlucky NPCs.	 This truly feels like a living breathing city hub and not just a simple tickbox for player immersion. There will be many times where you will simply stop all manner of violent activity and just scroll around the environment, admiring the sheer scope and beauty that this futuristic Blade Runner-esque playground has to offer.Sound The soundscape of the environment is top notch, with all the beeps and boops you can expect from a futuristic setting, some of which pay homage to the earlier Syndicate games. The ambient raindrops underlies all the sounds of NPCs chatting, cars driving past and other general background noises, creating an extremely immersive atmosphere that makes you feel like you are actually in the game.	Music wise, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and perfectly fits the game and settings. All the synthesised beats, drum bass and electronic keyboard motifs will make players have a sheer blast reminiscing cheesy music from the 80's era. Still, there’s only a few tracks available that grow repetitive over time.Gameplay Missions follow a rigid structure, requiring you to gain access to a base and send a particular agent to steal some wares, and from then on it's pretty much up to you on how you want to accomplish it. You can always just blow open the front door, gun down everyone who gets in your way and be in and out within a few minutes... assuming you have the necessary firepower to do so.The more strategic method would be to send in a lone agent to sneak past guards, steal the goods and sneak back out without anyone knowing you were there.	Of course, if you're up to the challenge and can effectively utilise all different Agent's abilities on the fly, you can combine the two for maximum pleasure. For example...Use a mind-controlled civilian meatshield to pop of a few rounds causing the guards to open the gates, then send your Soldier in to cause a mass distraction. Have your Support guy refilling his ammo supplies whilst healing him at the same time. Meanwhile the enemy is so focused on concentrating their fire on this monster of a man, they failed to notice two shady characters slipping by unnoticed: the Hacker who is disabling security and opening locked doors for the Infiltrator who is making his way towards the heart of the base to swipe their tech data.It's moments like this when you've mastered the game mechanics and everything clicks into place as your fingers fly over the hotkeys, you observe the controlled chaos with a steady hand but thumping heart, the insane 80s techno soundtrack harmoniously mixing with the sound of gunfire and explosions, that you realise ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. no game in recent years has EVER come close to replicating what I'm feeling right now”. It's that same feeling you get when you finally do the freaky-deaky with your first love, after all those expensive chocolates and soppy love cards everything finally makes sense, and it's just ♥♥♥♥in' beautiful. RPG mechanics Satellite Reign is a cruel mistress that will punish you for being sloppy: succeed however and you will be rewarded, if ever so slightly. Early on, your Agents bear nothing more than a puny pistol and SMG, so you are expected to tackle missions and enemies in an effort to gain Experience Points. XP can then be allocated to each individual Agent and mould them how you see fit: If you want your Infiltrator to concentrate more on long range attacks, or rather devastating close combat abilities than it's your choice.The firearms are well balanced and diverse: ballistic arms are a good middle ground, whilst lasers excel against enemies welding shields, whilst plasma is best used for melting away heavily armoured foes. Machineguns are good for general purpose assault, shotguns for flanking tough individuals, plus sniper rifles for assassinating far away targets. Then you got your miniguns and rocket launchers to, you know, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up.You can also acquire a great number of upgrades to further enhance your capabilities, such as artificial eyes to improve your accuracy, or synthetic limbs to help you carry heavy weaponry. Likewise, you can unlock some great pieces of kit: in addition to silencers, grenades and first aid kits, you can enlist the use of attack drones or mobile deployment option.The sense of progression is really strong, as the initial soldiers that once wiped you out in the early stages of the game become nothing more than annoying fleas that are easily crushed later on. It's so satisfying to view out your squad, decked out in energy shields and massive glowing plasma rifles ready to take on the best the city has to throw at you.Final Thoughts The game can get repetitive during later stages and the Unity engine is far from optimised. There currently is no drivable vehicles or multiplayer, with that been added in the future by the devs.Let's also not forget how great the game is, but how great the developers behind the game are: 5 Live Studios. They've been absolutely fantastic in handling Early Access Kickstarter, and it should set a standard for every other game developer out there, hands down. There’s so many unprofessional Indie groups out there enforcing a now negative stereotype, you need to give a round of applause to the few good ones out there in this polluted cesspit of Early Access generation.5 Live Studios have been getting directly involved with their community, asking questions and responding to enquiries, even engaging in friendly banter and trolling the trolls, plus acknowledging mistakes and setbacks. 5 Lives Studios doesn't feel like a corporate game company who only care about making sales, they come across as very organic developers who genuinely care about the game they want to make for themselves and for their fans. How many other game companies out there are like these blokes??If I could explain it any better, it's like customer support. Instead of automated messages and getting a human response 10 days later asking you to disconnect and reconnect your wireless ethernet cable, reformat your hard drive and making sure your computer is turned on, 5 Live Studios are the guys that will personally talk to you to find the root of the problem, get back to you on the progress and making sure you are satisfied as a result. In the words of Disky “i r fix it n stuff.” 	These are the guys that you'd genuinely feel like you'd talk to them in real life and give them a beer for just generally being a fellow human being.In short, get Satellite Reign and enjoy everything it has to offer. Not only is it a throwback to the classic Syndicate series from 20 years ago, I guarantee it's unique and refreshing gameplay is nothing like anything you have experienced on today’s market. "

												It's like Syndicate but not bogged down in a UI from the early '90s.If you were a fan of the original Syndicate you owe it to yourself to at least give this a shot, 5 Lives has done a stellar job of bringing their vision of what a spiritual successor to Syndicate should be to life, and while some things could do with a bit more elucidation, the systems at play in the game makes it a pretty compelling experience.It's easy to bounce off in the early game due to the fact that your initial agents are pretty basic and the world is a little overwhelming, but as soon as you get a couple of upgrades and levels behind them, the game opens up in a really big way, granting you more flexibility in how you want to approach any given situation. If your soldier can't hardwire so good, just mindjack a civillian and let him have a go at it, even if he zaps himself into the afterlife the generator will probably shut down at least for a little while. Agents can be outfitted with gear and augmentations that let them acquire abilities across classes. Can't sneak a hacker to the right terminal? Slap a Proxy Hacker on the Thief and let him borrow the Hacker's skills. Support need a little more firepower? Cram a Drone Control chip into his brain and let him borrow the Hacker's drone. Need a soldier to hardwire something without being seen? Give him a Stealth Generator Module and let him borrow the Thief's invisibility for a little while.The last tiers of each class' abilities are usually pretty significant and lend bonuses to the entire team. For instance, the last tier of the Thief's invisibility reduces the energy drain of his squad's cloaking modules, letting them stay invisible for longer.Also, the lack of an active pause is pretty insignificant as the Support's Team Stims ability will slow down time to 10% of regular speed while boosting agent movement speed, cooldowns, accuracy and damage above even regular levels and lasts for absolutely ages.I'm not really one for indepth technical analysis of how stuff works, but other reviewers will cover that without a doubt.The long and short of it is that the game is a solid and fun experience even for those that never played Syndicate.

Early Access Review
Alpha-Build 0.6.19/10 EarlyAccess Rating""Awesome implementation of the originals.""Satellite Reign is a 3D top-down rts shooter which takes place in a sci-fi cyberpunk future where corporations have completely taken over. You take control over 4 agents, each with individual abilities (soldier,support,assassin,hacker). How you get the job done is up to your freedom of solving things. I played both Bullfrog titles; Syndicate as a child & Syndicate Wars as a teenager & I am happy to announce the waiting time is finally (almost) over!!! - though I am over 30 now ;D If you played the old titles you'll totally feel ""at home"" right from the start. This totally feels like the true&worthy Syndicate successor!Pros:+ totally feels like THE NEXT SYNDICATE+ great atmosphere+ great implementation+ great gameplay+ very good graphics+ good sound&ost + good controls+ save feature=> SLI FixCons:- consider BUGS- consider that this is an alpha!- consider not more than a demo, atm- consider not many features're included yet=> Known Bugs""Wishes"":# a gamma slider# a multiplayer (coop)# a massive world# improved sound&ost# improved controls# improved civilians# improved environment (dirt,litter&stuff)=> devs take your time & evolve this fantastic pre-view!The alpha looks&feels terrific, for an alpha. If the devs go on as they do, this will be a jewel in my game library - when it's finished. "

												Satellite Reign is the spiritual successor to the classic cyberpunk game, Syndicate. Fans have waited nearly a decade for this (including myself), but now that it's finally here, I find myself a bit... Underwhelmed.Perhaps this is because Satellite Reign feels and plays almost exactly the same as Syndicate did, except with a facelift and some small additions.Don't get me wrong, Syndicate was a great game, but let's keep in mind that it was released back in 1993 and we know a lot more about what makes a game fun now than we did back then. Syndicate was more acclaimed for its fearless aesthetic and premise than its clunky gameplay, and Satellite Reign appears to have decided to adopt the same exact same formula. In some ways, this game feels like it was made in a vacuum, where recent conventions in gaming have been deliberately ignored.For instance, this game really needs a pause feature. It is always in real-time and you control four characters at once, which means that it's not always easy to keep track of everything that's happening to them. This game needs a way to be able to stop the action while still being able to issue commands. Without this, ordering your agents around while they're getting shot at from three or four angles can become extremely hectic and frustrating. This was probably the biggest problem with Syndicate, and no effort has been made to change this fact in Satellite Reign.This is made worse by the fact that your agents are as dumb as a sack of bricks. They literally will not do anything unless you tell them directly. Even if they're being fired upon, they won't return fire unless you specifically tell them to; once their target is dead, they won't target anything else until you tell them to target the next one. And even if they can't properly attack their target because their line of sight is blocked, they'll continue to fire anyway, wasting their ammo, despite the fact that their shots are clearly hitting the wall.This game needs smarter agents, and it could also use toggleable AI states. For example, a setting that switches your agents to ""aggressive"" mode, to make them attack any enemy in sight; a ""defensive"" mode to make them return fire when fired upon, and a ""passive"" mode to ensure they take no actions for when you want them to run away or conserve ammo. Plenty of other games have features like this, and it would seem like a no-brainer to include them in Satellite Reign, but this game has nothing of the sort. It forces you to micromanage everything, and you must do it entirely in real-time.So what do you do in this game? Basically you sneak around and shoot people. This would not be a problem if these two aspects were well implemented, but unfortunately they aren't. The stealth mechanics are twitchy and unforgiving, and the combat simply isn't fun. Mostly you will find yourself trying to sneak around, only to fail due to your agents' inability to route the simple paths you've told them to go. Then, when you are discovered by the enemies and forced to fight, you will try to find good cover spots and sequentially click on enemies until they're dead. Then you will have to run away, because if you don't, this game will spawn an infinite amount of enemies at you until you're out of ammo and completely overwhelmed. So you run, hide, and wait. Once the heat is off you, you attempt to sneak around again, but you fail because the game is glitchy, and so you get drawn into another tedious conflict, and on and on it goes.In addition, the ""open world"" this game advertises is a bit misleading; it should really just read as ""persistent world"". The game is essentially one huge map that you can roam to your heart's content, but there isn't much to do in it. You can hack ATM's and kidnap people to harvest their genes, but that's about it. This game is all about the missions, as Syndicate was, which begs the question as to why an open world was necessary for Satellite Reign in the first place.I mean, sure, you CAN go on a murderous rampage and slaughter civilians if you want to (and that was half the joy of Syndicate), but doing so doesn't really benefit you in any way. The only way to gain money in this game is to wait for your ATM hacks to slowly fill your coffers, and the only way to get new weapons is to steal prototypes, which are only given to you by completing missions anyways. Deciding to shooting up a bunch of cops or security guards will only yield you ammo to replace what you lost during the fight, and nothing more.So what is good about this game? Well, for one thing, it features an absolutely amazing soundtrack by Protector 101 and Russell Shaw, whose retro-synth scores perfectly match the game's cyberpunk theme.For another, the game looks visually stunning in absolutely every respect. The city is a beautiful, vibrant setting packed with clever hand-crafted details. No two streets are alike, and this is quite a feat unto itself. It's easily one of the best looking games I've played in recent memory.But unfortunately, this is not enough to make the game feel complete, nor is it enough to make it fun. This game is ""all style and no substance"". I'm hoping that future updates will round out the game a bit more, but now that it's out of early access, I'm not going to hold my breath.I'm glad that I didn't pay full price for this game. If you're a die-hard Syndicate fan you will probably be satisfied with it, but everyone else might want to keep their distance.EDIT: As of the September 4th update, new players now have the option to start a new game with the ""team stims"" skill already unlocked, allowing the player to slow time at will (without having to grind for 10 hours or more to acquire the fully upgraded skill as normal). While this is good news for new players, it still isn't a proper ""pause"" feature like the game really needs - it drains your support agent's energy and won't work if he's dead. Still, it's better than nothing.			"

 why this game is special  - Open world RTS  think syndicate + dawn of war + open world, dont be discourage with the game size (500mb++). - Freedom gameplay  you can do any job/quest/task in any order of you want or just roaming around the city and do whatever you want. - RPG element  skill point, research, upgrade, augment, bribe, stealth, and so on. people who prone to this may want to ""think twice"" before buying this game  - Overwhelming at the start  if you are new to ""syndicate"" gameplay (not your typical base building RTS). - Carefull management  you cant just select all and right click everything in this game, most place/task require (somewhat) delicate planning. - Huge map but pretty much ""thats it"" design wise  its a huge open world but what you see is what you get throughout the game. 8/10 would hack ATM machine again  "

Early Access Review
								Do you remember Bullfrog's Syndicate and Syndicate Wars? Do you wish there had been more of them? If the answer is ""yes"" (and it better be!) then keep this one on your radar. It is being made by one of the developers of Syndicate on the Amiga and also Syndicate Wars.Currently, it is very alpha. Many many missing features and issues with bugs and stuff. However, what is already in, is fun, clean, looks and plays great, and is a clear indication that this is a spiritual successor to Syndicate in every way.Highly recommend backing this one, or at least keep it on your wishlist until closer to release.

												TL;DR stuffPros+looks good, great cyberpunk atmosphere+lengthy campaign+gameplay mechanics are generally solid+performance in current version is good (older early access release left a lot to be desired.)+agents all have their own skills and usefulness, making them all important one way or another.+big city split in basically 4 parts, pretty much feels like ""open world""each district has its own look.+places have multiple entry points, offering different tactics to your objectiveCons-stealth is overpowered to the point it basically becomes mandatory -linked to that con; enemies are bullet sponges-AI occasionally glitches out, especially using the ""assassinate"" action-clone system with instant stat reduction seems unnecessary and punishing-each city district basically has the same objectives making the game kind of repetitive-even fully upgraded, your agents never seems truly powerful compared to most of the enemies-not a big fan of the ending, but that's personal opinionAnother Syndicate?I grew up with the original Syndicate and like many others I was horribly let down with EA's generic FPS reboot back in 2012.When this game popped up, being branded as a ""spiritual successor"", of course I was interested.While this game's inspiration from that series clearly shows, already right away in the menu when you first start the game, Syndicate this is not.When I recently described this game to a few people I said the following;If Syndicate had you controlling 4 cyborg terminators then Satellite Reign has you controlling 4 cyborg ninjas.Let me explain. If you have played the original Syndicate, you are no doubt aware how good the minigun is in that game.You have 4 agents equipped with it and enable their IPA things, they would absolutely terminate everything. By themselves.The minigun in Satellite Reign has a cool description (quote: ""When you absolutely, positively, have to kill every motherf@#$er in the room.""), but it's absolute trash.It's incapable of even taking out generic guard units. And it's not just the minigun, in fact most of the weapons require tons of shots before even generic enemies go down.Meanwhile, you can one-shot ANYbody (including the last ""boss""!), completely ignoring their health, armor, shields and everything with even the most basic starter pistol if you use the stealth kill (assassinate).You have the option to ""hi-jack"" enemies, similar to the persuadertron in Syndicate, but the game places somewhat of a limit on it by making the units weaker the more you have hi-jacked.So, even if you get some extra people to back you up, you still can't really go in guns blazing because you always seem to be outgunned.Much like in Syndicate, you can upgrade your agents with different kind of cybernetic enhancements. While they certainly help out with stuff like being able to sprint longer and take some more damage(or some will allow you access to different entry points like vents), your agents never seem truly powerful. All the enemies seem to be enhanced as well.Every agent has its own skill set, so each of them have their own purpose. With that, all of them also have their own limitations making it hard to really limit your ""team"" to say 1 or 2 for entering some enemy compound.The soldier can hardwire certain objects in the world to open alternate routes or disable power to security systems. The soldier also has access to more powerful weapons without any penalties.The Support class is there to buff and heal your team. The Hacker can disable security systems, open doors and ""hi-jack"" enemies.Lastly, the Infiltrator is your default sneaky guy. Comes with default cloaking system and has the highest movement speed.The game plays out in a fairly large city, split into 4 different districts. You can thankfully fast travel through multiple beacons in each district.While each district has it's own look/feel to it, every district basically has the exact same few compounds in them, with the exact same objectives/rewards.This makes it all pretty repetitive as all you do is infiltrate all of these compounds for the same goals..And as mentioned previously, with stealth being almost mandatory, it adds to this repetition because you are using the same tactics.Sure, there is the occasional bribe or assassination but most of it is infiltration.If your agents are downed and you were unable to revive them in time, they will die and a clone is respawed at the nearest beacon to replace your fallen agent. This process degrades the agent's base stats.When you hi-jack enemies, you have option to send them in for cloning, giving you the option to find potential agents with better base stats. However, for some strange reason, if you apply this new clone it instantly degrades the stats.This makes their description already a lie and honestly I think this is an unnecessary feature that adds nothing more than frustration.The game looks good and has a nice cyberpunk atmosphere. The music fits well to it and the sound effects are generally fine.I would've maybe liked to see more effects for the agents themselves, similarly to Syndicate Wars like when you select weapons and such.There is a bit of a story throughout with a ""twist"" at the end that I didn't much care for. Overall it's pretty generic but works well enough for what it is.Overall I recommend the game, I had a good time with it. If you are looking for a game similar in setup to Syndicate, it's worth your time.			"

												If the steam had the rating ""So so"" this would be the first game i would use it, i was actually going to go for the refund, but it was 6 minutes past the time, so, well, decided to play more of it.-the tutorial doesn't teach anything really useful about the game, a lot of things you have to discover by luck or trial and error, oh, you want to start a new game? You'll have to go trough the whole useless tutorial, have fun.-Some mechanics are simply dumb: your sniper (infiltrator) must be four meters to kill someone with stealth, yeah, a fu**** sniper can only insta kill at VERY close quarters.-You don't know the true range of visibility of your enemies, in an stealth game, this is very annoying.-There is no pause option to think about your strategies, it's a game feature, but people must know about this.-The game have a very good feel, the graphics are actually good.-The story... there is an story?-The cloning system is very interesting-The game actually offers numerous ways to solve missions, and the scenery actually offer different opportunities to do so, go berserk or stealth (just don't try to use your sniper for stealth).-The classes should had more abilities.In my opinion, the game is only getting the ""amazing"" reviews because of the nostalgic feeling of syndicate, but in reality is just a very average game, worth of buying for it's price,but far from being good.I'm giving a positive review because the price it's fair and the game isn't bad, but as i said before, it's not what i would call good.

												40+hrs and just completed my 1st playthrough, a good solid enjoyable and immersive experience.The gameplay is relatively simple and repetative which is why its so appealing at one level, easy to get the hang of and gameplay reinforces the lessons learned presenting new challanges without becoming un-necessarily complicated or a fight with the UI and controls.The 'openworld' is perhaps open to interpretation. There are 4 distinct zones the player can access once the tutorial area has been completed and one is free to attempt to gain access to these zones and then further explore and undertake missions at ones own leisure and without time constraint. However, during the 1st playthrough this may not be immediately apparent as it takes some accustomistion to the game's setting and the missions available are unlocked partially through exploration and partly through completion of successive objectives. In short the game sets its own pace but the player can skip to later sections for greater/challange reward. The openworld gamestyle makes for a much longer preload but cuts out the need for tranistional loads during actual gameplay.Gameplay is pretty typical squad based (a)rpg. The player has access to exactly 4 unique character classes with their own skill trees and asociated hotkeys. There are then a variety of generic weapons/gear/augments that the player must 1st aquire and then research before being able to purchase and equip to further customise the squad to individual playstyle and mission specific needs. This seconadry management aspect of the game directly affects how one approaches the game. Balancing the ease of the missions available against the possible rewards those missions may provide in the form of access to new tech while bank roling the current r&d cashflow and currently available purchases. This is generally a reverse difficulty curve and by mid to late stages of the game much of it will be superfluous.The game has been fairly well balanced and almost everything has been designed as a viable option with multiple approach layouts and rockpaperscissor layering of damage and health pools, (although certain items are exploitable). The missions types are varied in approach and 'colour text' but often repetative in actual execution despite the efforts to keep them fresh with added or changing suquential objectives.There are several novelty features and design approaches that keep the game appealing to both casual and more competative players. Such examples include; mission delivery, an 'active pause' skill, character cloning - Each character can be given a clone body that boosts certain stats, upon death these bonus stats degrade as does any unspent experience. Its easy enough to aquire a new clone but sometimes difficult to find the stats one desires. So the careful player is rewarded through retained bonus while the casual player isn't overly penalised by character death.The world is divided into public and private areas with respective but usually contained security and localised response units. Each character has its own heat metre and can gain or loose it easily through action/location. The game generally boils down to a series of mini puzzles, to circumvent or otherwise overcome the challanges presented by the area where one is trying to achieve the objective of their current mission or just larking around for fun. The satisfaction of a stealth puzzler with the failsafe of an action arcade for when one miscalculates or hasn't the patience for subtley.Graphics wise the game is pretty stylised and ""rain-soaked, neon-lit streets"" is accurate in depiction and atmosphere. The game uses a modular art which is further defined by the district it is within. While this may feel a little 'copy and paste' it does give a nice congruent feel to the city and enough individual attention has been given to make plenty of areas feel unique and identifiable as landmarks when navigating the city. The game runs on unity engine and has plenty of overt eye candy, but the frame rates are often lower than one might expect although it has no noticeable effect on the smoothness of actual gameplay. Personally i averaged around 40fps, (or 1k+ without v-sync in the menus) - worth checking the forums for further details on this known issue.I found the sound average, that is to say perfectly apt to the setting and in no way detracting from the gameplay despite prolonged game sessions. Some of the key mission dialogues are voiced again pretty average but most of the info screen are text only.I've only attempted single player but i should imagine it would make and interesting LAN playthrough for like minded players.Replayability - that's a difficult one. Yes the game is repetative and yes playing a new game will do little to nothing to change this, beyond the manner in which the player chooses to approach this particular playthrough. But, if it's still fun then it's still replayable.-Win10 64bit, 8gb ram, Gtx 970 4gb, 7.2k rpm hdd.			"

Early Access Review
								My english is not good, so sorry of errors in this text.Well, I love cyberpunk and I love Syndicate universe - dark world, powered by corporations, with its violence, high tech and low life, you know. :) Thats why I purchase Satellite Reign at once I saw it in Steam early access. My first imressions was: wow, its really seems like Syndicate Wars remake. I also understand, that now Satellite Reign is in pre-alpha condition, so I'm going to comment some moments of this game. It would be nice, if developers will read it. I would like to see in this game:1) First of all, co-op multiplayer. It's very important. More mods of the game: survival, hunt (when you fight against agents of other syndicates), etc.2) More interactive info on the screen. More info about world and objects (cyber-look, like in Syndicate FPS). It's cyberpunk or not? :)And (its important too) more combat info: range of weapons, capabilities of your enemies and other.3) Augmentations of your opponents: NPC-s has different augmentations too. You can hack or jam it (like in E.Y.E. - Divine Cybermacy game for examle).4) More loot. Now you can take only weapon of your dead enemy. Why you can't take his implants or internal organs to sell it on the black market?5) Why you can't direct auto-actions of your agents? To hold his fire, for example, or going to free fire, when he saw the enemy? To hold positions or attack? This options are necessary for all tactical games, I think.6) More abilities to manipulate items, realized by drop-down menu, for example. 7) An ability for player to change the set of agents (and hire two soldiers for the mission, it may change the style of playing and game tactics).8) The system of punishments. Now you can kill the enemy and wait their response actions in the shelter, where they can't find you. And how about the waves of enemy reinforcements and total interception of your agents? For example, you can't kill somebody right on the street in real life without any problems - cops will try to find and arrest you for a long time.Thats all. I hope, my comments are helpful for dear developers. I wish you will create really great game.			"

												I love the original games.  kickstarted this for a decent sum and so really want to love it.However, after a few hours play it all feels a bit …wooden?What do I mean – wooden like the city is full of dummy ‘people’ that only react to the player. It ruins the immersion of a living breathing city. It feels like a cardboard cityscape - because it is.We were promised an open world Syndicate style game. However, the ‘open world’ serves little to no purpose.You can find ATMs to hack, and erm… that’s all there is to it. That ain’t no sandbox; there’s nothing to do except the missions!Almost all missions lead you to a compound, containing a door you have to reach. Whatever the mission objective states, it always comes down to breaching the defenses and reaching the door.Like I say – very hollow.Don’t get me wrong it feels like a solid base on which to build, but by golly it needs some ‘building’ of the world outside of the copy+paste compound missions.Simply put, the game just isn’t finished and as thought-through as it should have been. It pains me to say but I can't recommend it, it's very average.			"

												Feels like the long lost Syndicate sequel so many of us have been waiting for. Improves on it in all the right ways. Finally, a game that doesn't pretend you're a selfless hero. You're trying to stop one evil megacorp, sure, but you're mostly out for yourself, and the missions are not doing random people favors. They're purely transactional - a means to an end. + Awesome squad-based tactical combat+ Some great skills and progression+ Good game balance. Challenging without being frustrating.+ Well-crafted gritty cyberpunk open world+ The missions are fun and feel like they have a meaningful impact on your progress- Controls are not perfect / take some getting used to- Some little bugs here and there- Some skills are OP must-haves and some are lacklusterHonestly, it's running around a cyberpunk world with 4 souped up clones infiltrating corporations in an open world. It's as awesome as it sounds.			"

												So, despite all my pre-release enthusiasm, my contributing early-access dollars, and my awareness campaigns on social media, I don't like Satellite Reign.I've tried playing it multiple times, and each time I start a fresh game, each attempt has been unbelievably boring and sleep inducing. I could never put my finger on just why that is. I mean, all the elements for a kick-a$$ tactical game are there, plus interactive environments, yet, it's all just sooooo boring.On my latest attempt, I finally figured out why this game bored me to sleep - and it's something we all take for granted. Understandably, due to budget, this game suffers from lack of sound design. A huge open world teeming with activity was created, and if you were a blind NPC within the game, you'd probably think you were the only man left on earth, and everyone else was dead. There's no street chatter, no advertisements urging us to use products, no sounds of vehicles passing by on the streets, and even worse, no sounds made by anyone in battle. Other than the exchange in gunfire, you have no idea what's going on.I know it probably shouldn't matter, but for me, the absence of sound design makes the game boring and unplayable. If the sound design issue was addressed, I'm sure my opinion about this game would be positive, but until then, I'll be stuck with buyers remorse.			"

Early Access Review
								Build 0.91 review.This is Syndicate Wars on steroids, and then some.It is a superb recreation of the 90's version that adds many, many more layers of depth and strategy.The good:- multi-faceted character development. Add augmentations, gear/gadgets, weapons, weapon attachments, skill trees- players must keep a fresh clone supply available for respawning their characters after dying. Each respawn degrades the clone's attributes, and new clones must be used so the team doesn't atrophy- research and development system. Find a prototype weapon/gadget, and choose between using it in the field and potentially losing it, or sending it to R&D to eventually mass produce it- R&D requires researchers which must be recruited from the city. Outsourcing is available but costs a lot more to finish the project- skill trees enable multiple strategies, i.e. your infiltrator can spec for cloaking and thievery or raw sniping damage and close quarters melee stealth killing with a katana.Infiltrate facilities either by hacking the doors (using the hacking skill tree), or using your soldier's hardwiring skill to overload the door's power and trip it open. Security cameras can be hacked to turn off for a certain time, or just disable the power generator to a section of a facility- open world game play with a mission system. The main story has a mission chain, but each sector of the city has it's own set of missions that are indepedent of each other, and completely optional. More missions can be found hacking data centers spread throughout the city.Missions can be done either through stealth or brute force (harder)- mission briefings are enhanced with bribing and tips. Optional to spend cash for intel on missions, i.e. weak security at a specific entrance of a facility or acquiring keys to pass a security door- you can hack ATM's to give your team and income stream. You can also rob the central bank for each sector. Send the hacker in to increase the ATM income rate, or send the soldier to just smash and grab for a large lump sum payoutThe not so good:- no meaningful character customization. You must ""shop"" for clones to change your appearance, meaning you cruise the city and ""hack"" a citizen's brain to send him to the cloning vats if you like how he looks. That character model is applied to your agents when they respawn or immediately if you choose- camera can't rotate 360 dgrees, only about 45 degrees or so- swapping weapons always pulls them out at the same time, meaning if you want to switch from SMG to your pistol, you pull the guns out and everyone runs away screaming / police start shooting you for having exposed weapons. Swap weapons in secluded areas only- slightly buggy, but from reading past reviews this has improved with each new build "

												This game is superb.  Stellar.  Fantastic.Saying it is like Syndicate is accurate, only it is much, much better.  And I LOVED Syndicate.Sandbox cyberpunk city, a crew of different skilled runners, a plehtora of facilities to infiltrate.  All at your own pace.Want to crash the gate with all four agents, plasma guns a blazing?  Do it.Want to send in one stealthed agent with proxy hacker to kill the cameras and sneak in and out?  Easily done.Want to send your soldier to the front gate with a laser mini-gun, creating a distraction so your hacker can slide behind the firing guards so he can put a syphon on an ATM?  No sweat.How about hijacking a pedestrian and making him assassinate that target so your crew can be on the other side of town scouting out the next heist?  Totally doable.The sheer number of options available for mission competion in this game is amazing.  I've left agents deep in enemy lines so I could watch guard movements and plan the next attack for hours, all while executing a bank job on the other side of town with my other three agents.  You can do whatever you want, dang near however you want.  Every facility has multiple ins and outs, every camera and door can be taken out in multiple ways, and every carefully planned job can go to crap in a moment.  The game just feels so right, give me a crew, give me augments and weps and gear, and set me loose on a cyberpunk city.  So beautiful.54 hours in and I have not beat it yet.  Still so much to do.  You can spend two hours just planning a job if you want.  I've spent who knows how many of those hours just hijacking people for cloning to increase the stats of my agents, finding the perfect person, then figuring out how to hack them in the middle of that base.  Do I go in after them sneakily?  Or hack a cop and make him attack the gate and hope the guy I want comes out?  Such open ended sandboxian (may have just coined a new phrase) shadowrunning has never been seen before.  The game offers you a palet of masterful levels, a team of highly customizable agents (towards the end the combo of ways you can complete tasks given the various gear and augments you have makes the game open itself up more and more as you go), a great ambient sound track fitting of the genre, and the freedom to do as you please.  One of the best shadowrun-esque games ever made, and one of the top sandbox tactics games I have ever played.    Now back to figuring out how to smuggle a scientist deep into a heavily guarded corporate facility so he can hack their targeting systems and leave the Eternals with a permanent debuff to accuracy against my crew.  This game rocks.			"

												I was very excited about this game. It pains me to admit that it's not good. Here are my points:1. Save system is ridiculous. The fact that you can't save in red zone is stupid. Some missions take more than an hour to go in and out. If you fail in the very end - welcome to the load game screen and start your mission from the very beginning.2. All missions are stealth-only (at least in the beginning). It's impossible to go in force because your enemies are unlimited. They will keep coming no matter how many you kill. And stealth systems in this game are extremely limited and annoying. You can't be 100% sure if the enemy is going to see you or not. There is no cone of vision. Even cameras have weird vision, where sometimes they can see you when you stand under them, sometimes they don't.3. Every mission you do is essential a mission with some kind of a time limit. Because all the hacks of doors/cameras are limited in timed. That in combination with poor stealth implementation and inability to save makes the game frustratingly hard (and there is no difficulty setting). 4. AI is very poor. They fight like simpletons. Hiding behind the first obstacle they can see. If I just rush and flank them, they will keep shooting from flanked position not trying to flee. Forget about them trying to flank you or pull any kind of semi-intelligent manoeuvre, not in this game. Sometimes enemy patrol will just stuck walking in circles in one area that you need to get through. You have to just sit in your cover and wait 2-3 minutes until they decided to move on.5. Not sure why this game has been made multi-leveled. You get no tactical advantage by being above your enemy. I've once tried to use my infiltrator to shoot enemy patrol with a silenced sniper rifle from the wall above. He just ran to the lift and decided it's much better to do it from the same level where the enemy is.6. The story in this game is non-existent. You get some brief introduction in the very beginning about big evil corporation that you need to take down and that's it. There is no motivation for you to do any missions. No real story behind them. It's just a puzzle. You go into red zone, you reach the marked door hiding (and failing) behind obstacles, you get money/agent/prototype by walking through the door, you stealth back outside. Why did I do that? I don't know... I just have this list of missions and icons on my map. Player has to find ways to entertain himself in this world. And there is really not many options. It's not a big openworld game like Far Cry. All the missions are the same.I can also mention absolutely stupid tutorial that teaches you how to click your mouse and scroll screen, but doesn't give you enough information about what's that cloning ability that your hacker has etc... etc...All in all, this game is very mediocre. It brings absolutely nothing new or interesting to the genre. I will probably continue playing for a while, because I absolutely love cyberpunk setting, but I wouldn't recommend buying it in it's current state.			"

												EDIT - CO-OP MULTIPLAYER!!!!  Game was ok-good before. now it is AWESOME!===========================Looking for a sequel to Syndicate Wars?Unsure whether this is for you?It's a very tough call.A bullet-point comparative breakdown.Satellite Reign is the best revival yet seen of its predecessor. At about 30hrs in to the final release I am enjoying it, despite it leaving me wanting.  Aside from this game's amazing visuals - which are indeed damn near perfect, the biggest differences between this game and Syndicate are in its comprisal of main gameplay mechanics. Is Satellite Reign better? ... Personally I feel SyndWars is still the better game for its time, for the following reasons. - Stealth Did the game need this? The original Syndicate had a very basic system to discourage going in guns-blazing and it worked brilliantly... This game attempts a metal-gear-esque level of stealth gameplay and somewhat pulls it off, although at times it feels the balance of difficulty is thrown out the window when due to unpredictable AI pathing, the density/timing/loadout of enemy patrols within a single location can vary greatly between 'cakewalk' and 'impossible'. - Cover Combat is a fiddly, nitty-gritty affair with a focus on cover / flanking, energy/health regen and careful use of special abilities / cooldowns. All too often it feels clunky and unresponsive when your agents take cover in the wrong positions, ignore vital targets and shoot straight into walls despite appearing to have good line-of-sight. With the Stealth/Hacking gameplay being more stable, it often feels like Combat, which could have been super satisfying a'la Syndicate Wars, is to be avoided. - Hacking Bam! This is where the game shines. In every way the world, gameplay and entire theme of the game feels more cyberpunk because of it's brilliantly designed and executed hacking mechanics. Satellite Reign far surpasses Syndicate Wars in this respect. Nice Job, 5Lives! - Open World Freedom to roam between location-based missions with unbroken continuity. The game never presents you with ""mission start / mission failed / mission complete"".  Instead you're just always looking down from above, with or without your agents. Tackle missions any time you happen to be in the area.  Infiltrate / die / respawn / die again in the course of attempting a single mission.  Lose interest mid-mission and try an entirely different objective at the drop of a hat. Sounds better? I reckon it sucks♥♥♥♥♥ because gameplay lacks any meaningful context. There's basically no 'sandbox' style side activities to enjoy, so why make this game open-world at all?  All things in the city are ever-present and nothing ever changes besides unlocking new areas... - Immersion Sadly, this is where the game breaks for me despite all the awesome visuals and atmosphere. You are given no identity, no home / territory or ideology worth fighting for, and ultimately no sense of impact on the world.  No meaningful factions or ideologies are represented.  No interesting characters make appearances or getaways - all are just generic NPCs with random names in repetitive mission logs. The beautiful sprawling city is hollow, filled with an array of soulless robotic puppets, and who the hell are you? Nobody. Boring.This more than anything else destroys any sense of the game's STORY.   Because your agents feel instantly disposable/replacable - you never grow attached or feel the need to keep them safe. Because there is no authored flow of time or directed sequences of attention - you feel adrift in a sandbox with no indication of what's meaningful or why you're fighting the corporate oppressors. The lack of effort here totally rips me out of what could have been a super compelling experience. The game is purely mechanical, and the gameworld purely functional. Believe it or not, this is something Syndicate Wars did far better, over a decade ago. (remember Eurocorp vs The Church of the New Epoch? Awesome!)Come on 5 Lives Studios! There is great potential here to explore cyberpunk themed stories, but in avoiding the issue entirely this game feels rushed to create quantity-over-quality. I would trade one entire city district worth of gameplay for a half-decent story in this game. I hope 5 Lives Studios will carry forward and embellish this game's story - breathe some life into it's characters - make me *care* about my agents, our cause, the citizens, or the city/world we're fighting for. Beyond the obligatory surface of neon grunge, the most important ingredient of Cyberpunk is human stories, and this game don't got em.- Structured Gameplay Back then - with Syndicate Wars - each mission had an introduction/planning phase, hard-limited mission areas and extraction points, and clear Success/Fail conditions with side-objectives. This meant that new and inexperienced players could learn to enjoy the game's complex systems one step at a time, starting with the basics - never feeling overwhelmed, but rather drip-fed awesome new challenges and surprises along the way as the game's story progressed alongside it.And now - in Satellite Reign's case, There are a LOT of very cool gadgets, augmentations, skills and upgrades to unlock and combine for awesomeness. BUT it feels like the designer spits out a quick tutorial and dumps you in the deep end, saying ""Duh - I know how all this stuff works - just read my mind, explore my incredibly complex hud + menus, read all the text, learn the keyboard shortcuts and figure it out, noob!"" Not since the early days of Microsoft Flight Simulator has a developer packed so much hidden complexity into their game and expected players to master it on their own. In this case you're given way too much rope and left to hang yourself. Freedom to explore is one thing. Lazy♥♥♥♥♥game design is another - maybe not the best call. All in all, worth playing if you're willing to stick it out, but this game falls short of greatness - inaccessible to many who might've otherwise learned to love it - for the above reasons. If you're pumped up wanting a true Syndicate Wars successor, depending on what you loved about the original you may well be disappointed.Despite my misgivings I am giving this game thumbs up because in the context of kickstarter / early access indie games this leads the way! - a decent game delivered as promised in a timely manner. That is never easy to do. 5 Lives Studios are AAA-grade professionals deserving of every chance to continue improving their craft.			"

Early Access Review
								Fantastic game with an amazing atmosphere. You really get the sense that you're living in a dystopian cyberpunk future, and that you command 4 agents from satellite. It's not even alpha yet and i am very impressed with the engine and the way everything works. The sound effects are great, from the radio chatter of patrols to busy streets. Graphics are GREAT and really Bladerunner-y Lots of colors from neon lights to visual billboards. Loveit.Like cyberpunk ? get this early and support the devs. In that vein, the developers of this are experienced and will deliver.  It's like Shadowrun but with dynamic gameplay and and a huge open world. Wanna go guns blazing ? you're covered, wanna sneak ? covered.  You also have research options and implants ! THIS GAME HAS IT ALL :D			"

Satellite Reign - A quick CO-OP perspectiveI have been following this game for quite a while, though I did not back it. I am a huge fan of Bullfrog's Syndicate & Syndicate Wars games. I remember them fondly and I was very disappointed that the 2012 reboot turned out to be a FPS game.  Luckily, Satellite Reign was made by some of the developers of Syndicate Wars and it is supposed to be a true spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars. After spending several hours with the game I can definitely say that Satellite Reign scratches the Syndicate itch I have had quite thoroughly :) If you enjoyed the old games, you will enjoy this one.  I am playing through it entirely in COOP right now and the multiplayer works flawlessly. That alone feels like a natural evolution of the source material.At this point, I think I am probably about 30% through the game, so I don't know for sure that everything stays as good as it feels now. I'll revise the review once I have completed the game. Pros   Pretty visual artstyle. Highly reminiscent of Syndicate  All the good stuff is back : Researchable character augmentations, gear and weapon upgrades.  online CO-OP ! (Playing a game like this with a friend is just awesome. It is a simple implementation but it works well)  Nicely written mission briefings. (I chuckled at some of them :P )  The enemies scale with you, so they keep being a challenge as you progress Cons   The audio design is pretty bland. While the music itself is great,  the rest of the sounds are decidedly ""MEH"". Virtually no environmental sounds (city scape sounds etc.)  ""lowish framerates"" 34-60 fps on two 980ti SLI seems a bit rough. It is certainly playable, but I would've expected to run this game at my usual 100hz.   only minimal voice-acting, i.e. you'll have to read.Overall, the game is very entertaining. If you like real-time tactical RPGs then this game is a 8/10. If you are a fan of the source material then it is a 9/10 from me. So far, definitely my favourite COOP game this year.			"

Early Access Review
								[Early alpha preview edition]Things to note:- What is available today is a pretty raw alpha. There are quite a few bugs and is nowhere near a complete game. There are plenty of ""TBD"" filler text and a number of core game features missing.- The game's design team seems pretty cohesive and the Cyberpunk vision for the game is very well executed.- It has very impressive, stunning visuals and animations. For an alpha, it runs well with Fantastic mode 1080p on a i7 3550K, 670GTX, 8GB RAM. I experienced no visual glitches.- It's a mouse and keyboard RTS (Real Time Strategy) kinda game.- You won't need to be an MLG-caliber APM-Deity to play. If you are, however, you can go for a raw speed challenge (by hitting two or three different objectives at once).- Gameplay wise, the demo vids are WYSIWYG straight up gameplay.- You have four guys, each with different specializations - a brawler, a medic, a thief, and a hacker - that you can use as a fireteam or turn them loose solo.- Currently you can execute a number of predesignated missions that demonstrate the classes utility and combat. All of them are basically infiltration quests of varying degrees. - You can opt for stealth or loudness and each are properly rewarded. Loudness is a lot like GTA's Wanted system, so things can get wild very quickly.TLDR: Satellite Reign is very well on its way to becoming the Syndicate successor I was hoping for when I backed.Recommendation for anyone on the fence/skeptical of early backing: Wishlist this game and keep an eye out.

								Good ol' Syndicate with fancy graphics. In other words, a team of 4 members that you can upgrade with new weapons, tech, fancy skills and toys in a big open city with many places to visit and lots of stuff to steal, kill, etc...Game has a few flaws, like the customization that is based on luck (Basically a cloning system that uses NPCs as templates) and has a good ammount of bugs/poor optimization but looks promising so far and the game still EA.Bullfrog would be proud, in fact, part of dev team were behind the classic Syndicate. If you enjoyed games like Syndicate 1/W, Fallout 1/2, Wasteland 2, Shadowrun, etc... and love everything related to cyberpunk, this game is a must buy. Support these fellas, they have big plans post-release for this game if it is a success.			"

												Want some cyberpunk third-person strategy/ shooter/ stealth/ hacker-gone-wild? Well... congratulations. You just found the best cyberpunk game released in years, and the only insometric strategic shooter released in... more years. This is early access done right - the game has kept to a strict time table, updates are regular and frequent, developers release feedback and talk to the community weekly, if not daily, and the full release is just around the corner. Not stuck in limbo, not gestating or waiting for more funding - these guys have taken their kickstarter gains, put them to good use, and listened to community feedback extensively.As for the game itself, it isn't difficult to understand. Lead a team of 4 agents on a quest to save a dystopian world... or are you taking it over for your own gains? Either way, there is nothing happy or uplifting to be found here. Life is cheap, upgrades are satisfying, strategy is important and the game as a whole is very, very rewarding. The spiritual successor to Syndicate has arrived. The fact that it was made by just 5 guys? It feels like a triumph.UPDATE- V1.02: The full game is out, first patch is up... how is the finished game? Let's go through it in more detail. First off, I'm running the game on a GTX 960 4gb, i5 4690k (oc at about 3.8 ghz), 8 GB of DDR3 RAM, @ 1080p. I am able to roll through at max settings with the frame rate never dipping below 38 FPS. 38 sounds low to some of you - but keep in mind, this isn't a twitch shooter here. 60+ FPS is not needed for enjoyment. Also, some of the more advanced settings can be disabled for better frames. With that out of the way, the game is still excellent. I feel as if some of the negative reviews are the end result of people not knowing what they were getting into when they purchased. The game features 4 unique classes, doing missions as you see fit in an open world environment. Some things to get out of the way right up front: Character's visual customization is limited (you will literally sleeve new bodies as the game goes on... the meat is expendable, the actual agent is downloaded into new bodies upon death) - but ACTUAL customization is rich. Different bodies have different stats, new weapons can be found and researched, weapons can be upgraded with atachments, characters can unlock and upgrade unique skills, equip various gear to make them better in combat, and also augment themselves with various wetware upgrades. In short - you won't get attached to characters visually, but they will definately be ""yours"". The game does not have a ""tactical pause"". This is for balancing reasons. The gameplay as a whole, when broken down to its most basic, is rather simplistic. Grand strategies, complex maneuvers, etc are not necessarey to succeed - and sometimes are even impossible by design. This isn't that type of game. The challenge does not come from putting together and executing a master plan - but rather going after an objective a certain way and then adapting in real-time as the situation evolves, and possibly spirals out of control. This minor chaos is perhaps the best source of tension in the game, and is clearly there by design. A tactical pause would highlight just how simple the combat systems are, rob the player of much of the game's challenge and tension and bring the pace of the game to a crawl. It is inarguably better without it. Which brings us to my next point -- It is best to think of this as a simple game with complex executions. The stealth mechanics, the combat mechanics, they are simple systems. Much like Syndicate of yore, you would be mistaken for thinking this was a strategy game. But that said, it involves much more thought and strategy than a typical shooter. This game exists in a sort of limbo, and frankly, I think that might make it hard to love. Too simple for strategy aficionados, too complex for action fans. For me, it hits a perfect sweet spot - something you can play after a tough day at work, but still have to have your brain switched on. The final issues that people seem to be setting their sights on are those of story and save features. The story is limited. There. I said it. Yes... there is a story, and yes, those that read mission briefings will be treated to som great writing and have much more of the story fleshed out for them, but you have to go hunting for the story - it won't make itself known to you. And the save system... no, you can't save if you are in an enemy-controlled area (where nearly all the missions in the game take place). This can be a problem for some, but frankly, I've never encountered a mission that took me more than 30 minutes to get through. ""Failing"" a mission simply means that all your agents have died -- and you just releeve them and get new bodies. There are no bonuses for stealth, no penalities for shooting your way through, no penalities for civillian casualities, and very few penalities for death and failure. Because of this, the lack of an in-mission-save feature is not quite the crippling blow it could have been. Just like the original Syndicate - most missions encourage stealth from the outset, but will almost always evolve into a frantic shootout and death-defying escape. Know this before you purchase - it is an action game with stealth elements, not the other way around. Fully stealthing a mission is a rare thing. Overall, the game is of a high quality. It is far from perfect, and could certainly benefit from some more features (the devs say they will support the game into the future), but so long as you know what you're getting into with the game, I doubt you will be dissapointed. I hear a lot of people complain that they don't make games like they used to, the cyberpunk genre never gets enough love, Syndicate deserves a proper sequel, etc. Well, here's the chance to put your money where your mouth is.

Early Access Review
								When someone says the word ""Cyberpunk"" - what do you think of? To different people, it means different styles. To some, cyberpunk means the virtual world. Net Runners decking into cyberspace and hacking corporate secrets for cash. To others, it means a Blade Runner-esque distopia, a perpetual night glistening with neon, heavy with sentient artifical life and the brutality of an uncaring elite.To me, cyberpunk has always meant one thing, and it's thanks to a game from 1993, called Syndicate. Cyberpunk is trenchcoats. It's Miniguns. It's cybernetic implants and augmentations. It's corporate warfare where human casualties are simply an adjustment to your bottom line. Syndicate, and its follow-up in 1996, Syndicate Wars, were exactly what I wanted from a game set in the cyberpunk style.Satellite Reign is billed as a spiritual successor to the Syndicate franchise; with a number of the development team directly involved in the prior games. What they have created with Satellite Reign is a game with all the best elements of its ancestors - tactical squad-based action, with customisable weapon loads, choice-of-method for missions, and above all else - an environment that is absolutely perfect for the cyberpunk theme. The gameplay is exactly what Syndicate was, and will be familiar to anyone who played the previous games, or similar tactical squad games, such as Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel.  In a nutshell - You use your team of heavily armed cyborgs, and you take what you want. Tech. Money. Lives. Whatever furthers your company's interests. There are some negative points to Satellite Reign, however.There is little in the way of real character customisation. You can change their appearance based on the individual clone you assign to each member of the team, but these clones are randomised NPCs you chip-jack, and as such, you have no real control over what these clones will look like. Too often, the clones with the best stats will be hideous to look at - purple-mohawked men with giant orange beards that look like they were made from glued-on roadkill. In addition, augmenting your agents does nothing to their physical appearance. An unmodified clone will look exactly the same once you have replaced their arms, legs, skin and skull with machinery; and the interface for making these changes is little more than a click on a menu. But these are minor personal-preference issues in a game that is otherwise brilliant. It's easy to play. It's easy to lose several hours of your life doing ""one more assignment"". It's amazing fun.Satellite Reign is Cyberpunk. Time to take control.			"

												My friend got me this game so, I decided to give it a go. At first I was amazed by the open space free roam and the amazing graphics. I also really liked the way there was multiple corporations keeping order and ruling the city / planet but the thing is, they didn't really trust each other. This led to huge firefights between the corporations which were fun to watch, and they helped me sneak past the defenders into the facility which was a bonus. I liked the class diversity with the skill system. I liked the way that every class was able to use any weapon (if you had it) so, it wasn't limiting your ability. The missons, at times felt a little bit repetitve with the magical green door, but it wasn't a major problem. The more major problems were that sometimes your characters would occasionly get stuck in walls, which was really annoying, especially when you were in a red zone because you were then unable to save. Sometimes the AI would also be a bit stupid or sometimes they would just find you out of no where, which was quite annoying. The cover system was also glitched at times. Civilians didn't really do anything except walk around, see you do something bad, run around and then get shot by the authorities, which was sad because maybe they could of had more of a purpose. The cars were basically mindless railed AI which you couldn't do much with, except explode them which was also quite sad. The game itself ran quite smoothly. The music was well implemented and made the game more enticing. There was usually multiple ways with dealing with situations, which was nice. The game made me feel really important and needed!All in all I think it was a good, enjoyable game which constantly had me on my toes! (:7/10!			"

Early Access Review
								Your first question when looking at this game is most likely to be ""Is this Syndicate/Syndicate Wars reimagined?"" The simple answer is yes. If there had been a true sequel to the series instead of a shooter it would be this game. Even the audio is recognizable.If you enjoyed the Syndicate series from the 90s then you should pick up this title and support it in early access. The more people who do, the better it will get, and I really wish more designers would take this sort of risk, go independent and bring back the sort of games that many of us grew up with and loved.The design is really nice, the graphics are beautiful to look at, and there are cover mechanics which make so much sense in a game like this. There are variations in how you approach some of the quests and objectives in the game, you don't have to blast your way through every checkpoint, you can hack terminals and stealth your way through, of course when the time comes to go loud, the firefights can be intense. The AI will attempt to flank you, call for reinforcements, flush you out and you do have to manage your team to cover eachother and move, slipping away into the night and blending in with the crowd.In the future I'd like to see some multiplayer modes of course, and some originality in the approach to it, drop-ins would be great, as well as multiplayer specific objectives. Moddability would also be great, I'd love to see some player created cities or total conversions, I could see people making some awesome RPGs with the concepts here.I've only recently picked up the game and I'll have more to add to this review as time goes on, in the meantime pick it up while it's on sale and support the developers, at the very least it's Syndicate with a complete graphical and gameplay overhaul, and that's definitely worth the price.

												The game can be very fun, when it works. It has a nice cyberpunk atmosphere, a lot of replayability and a good ending I didn't see coming.However, this game was released way too early. It is rife with bugs and glitches that make the game much, much more frustrating than it should be. I wouldn't have minded the micromanaging and no-pause gameplay if I didn't have to worry about horrible pathfinding (my agents would often get stuck on corners), idiotic A.I. (guards continuouslty running in place/into closed gates), clipping through the environment (Agents and escort NPCs would OFTEN get stuck in the environment, or just warp through walls, fall through floors, etc.), Agents simply refusing to obey commands (not a feature, just stuck A.I.) and a long list of other problems. Nearly all of which forced me to find another way to complete a given task, which renders the whole ""find your own approach"" thing moot. I even needed to use debug commands on occasion because there was nothing else to be done in order to progress.If these issues hadn't started becoming annoying well after the first two hours, I would have requested a refund. But instead I powered through to the end, simply because, as I said, when the game works as intended it is a ton of fun. It's just a shame that that fun often comes to a screeching halt due to the bugs and glitches.By the end, I felt like I was still playing an Early Access build, not the final released product. I hope the devs keep supporting it and taking care of these bugs and maybe I'll give it another, more positive review in the future. but as it stands, I can't recommend it.			"

												Being a huge Syndicate fan I really wanted to like this game, but didn't.  Mainly because of the stealth mechanics, or lack thereof.  Satellite Reign wants you to play it stealthily, to sneak around from cover to cover, and I'm fine with that, love a good stealth game. But SR also  lacks the depth or finesse of dedicated stealth titles , like Invisible Inc, Mark of the Ninja etc. Similarly, combat feels lacklustre, with agents just standing in place firing shots until someone drops.  Weapons feel weak, enemies are all bullet sponges.  None of it gelled for me. Shame, because I wanted to love this game so hard. :(			"

												I like to love this game, but I'd like to love it more.Content wise, we have a full game here, a huge game map that has you sneaking and spriting around to key points to avoid patrols.Plenty of ways to customise your squad.and a huge map, seriously its pretty big.Satellite Reign offers pretty interesting Team Based Tactical RTS gameplay that pulls players into the world...To a certain point, then stops, abruptly. The tutorial is suitable to get you aquainted with the controls and eases you into the game nicely. Unfortunatly after you leave the little tutorial area things start to get wonky.Once I crossed that first bridge and made my way to the streets I found tons of cars, some piled onto each other, some floating, still more ramming the jammed cars. This wasn't limited to just one area either. Most streets were piled up like this, making movement across them difficult. A quick restart seemed to have fixed this issue. But couldn't fix the rather unresponsive and painful Agent movement AI...It is horrible. I often have to click and reclick areas for my agents to move into because one, or all will fail to actually get behind cover, they seem to like standing at the very edge of cover, like a dog hiding behind a barren branch of a house plant. Going up and down elevators often has my agents piling up on the side of the elevator in an endless running animation that I can't seem to cancel, and overall responsiveness to commands is rather slow.Combat and stealth are both negilible there really are no pros or cons to each. Eventually you don't even use combat or stealth. Because in compounds where you have to infiltrate and raid stuff it is usually as easy as running in and running back out no stealth or fighting required, though you will trip some alarms don't worry! Enemy AI is rather dumb, the enemy movents are also pretty slow. Often times I just find myself sprinting past them with my loot, once you leave the compound you are as good as gone because the enemy rarely follows you that far. Hell they rarely follow you around a cornor, assuming you can make it around yourself without getting caught on something.I also seem to experience some pretty random crashes.I like the game, I really do it has its moments. But there are some key things the devs need to address before I can recommend it to anyone. "

												""This game is great except that part"". You've probably said that many times. It's all the underwater levels, all the time based puzzles in adventure games, all the long, sluggish vent crawling or time consuming backtracking. Satellite Reign's issue is that this ""part"" never ends. There's a faint light of something rewarding, something exciting and you follow it, get closer to it but you never arrive. You complete numerous chores, go through same routine, keep your frustration in check. But you never get there. That's how I feel about Satellite Reign.Before I delve into depths of Satellite Reign's troubled nature, some forewords. Most of you probably heard of Satellite Reign due to it's similarity to cult classic Syndicate. The latter was a very succesful action-strategy game designed around dystopian, cyber-punk theme where corporation reached tremendous power. It was a blast, I loved it. You set up your own company, capture agents, research new technologies, implantaugmentation to your agents, fight competition, assassinate political opposition and on and on. All the means to take over, reign the world.Now, wanting to describe Satellite Reign I would have to write exact introduction as in previous paragraph. Satellite Reign has precisely the same premise with minor differences. The idea is the same. As a group of corporate agents, you fight hard to establish world domination with almost exclusively less than legal means. Dracogenics, your main competitor, owns a technology to transfer one’s mind and conscience to another body provided as a vessel. This revolutionary tech makes immortality more than possible. But even most precious and secured treasures can be stolen. With help from a mole in Dracogenics, your company acquires a crude version of mind-transfer solution. This is where you start. As the game begins, you’re guided through few introduction missions learning the first steps in neon-lit, rain soaked city. At first, everything seems clear, logical, well tailored. While ticking off subsequent objectives you learn Corporate Agent 101 but let me assure you, it won’t prepare you for what you’ll be facing, but more on that later. As soon as tutorial is over, it’s you and dystopian streets straight from Blade Runner. And that’s the first major problem with Satellite Reign. It’s dark, grimy, futuristic world is all too familiar and even trite, typical. Litter streets with thrash, give citizens some hi-tech gizmos, let oddly shaped cars roam the roads, erect loads of skyscrapers and wrap everything in bright neon lightning. At the same time it's oddly sterile. The city looks like distopy is more a local sense of aestetics than simply real disrepair. Divided into several districts, it looks all the same. I can see that they tried to make it an open world but this attempt just failed. This city is dead. Few civilians wander back and forth without a hint of purpose, looking bland and clone-alike. Only corporate and military patrols make some sense though still robotic. Clunky and glitchy animation doesn't help much. There's no fluence when people wander, god knows where and make sharp, instant turns like in early, 90's 3d games.The very same problem prevails when it comes to missions. You're promised a variety of choices on how to complete your task while in reality it's not much short of an illusion. Especially during first half of Satellite Reign you're forced to complete your quest for domination in a same, patience draining way. It's all about stealth. You access forbidden areas by either hacking, jacking security officer's minds(much like with persuade-gun in Syndicate) hard-wiring or accessing skylines or vents which in a way is fun. There are also turrets shooting you at sight and cameras raising alarms, both of which can be hacked or turned off. Every solution requires specific skill and your agents will all play their own rolein accessing secure places(up to a point that is, later they can be upgraded to do all sort of things). In the end, you'll see that every location has the same weaknesses and points of exploitation. It still requires tremendous amount of patience. Guards patrol premises in seemingly planned paths but often stray from it and wander chaotically. They collide when crossing paths and chaos emerges. Sometimes I had to stand still behind a cover for many minutes because guard got stuck climbing a curb and the rest of them concentrated in one point. On the other hand, there were times when I raised high alarm and I could few inches past guards with my squad, weapons out, and they didn't even react. That's not right, is it?Almost every stealth based game implement some kind of routine for your enemies, something you can learn and exploit. And you know that map creator did it on purpose to give you a window of time to make a go for it.That's not the case in Satellite Reign. It seems chaotic, unplanned which makes it more life-like but also very frustrating.Disasterous or more precaisly inexistent AI makes it all the harder. You have to issue every single smallest command, else your troops will stand still like a mentally challenged after extra lobotomy. All of this lead me to quickload very often which unfortunately takes some tiem. During at least first half of game, you'll be outgunned and outnumbered. And don't think of forcing your way with head on assault. If you're not careful enough, you'll deal with a lot's of reinforcements and if you take your time, they'll eventually take you down. Fortunately, that doesn't mean permadeath. Your agents are respawned in a nearest relay which puprose is to ""transfer"" one's concience. To a degree, your agents bonus stats are then diminished to penalize you for lightheadedness. Still you can ""persuade"" more potent civilians/military men to join your cause and use them as a previously mentioned vessel for agent's concience. Getting back to missions, there is a sense of satisfaction when you complete them. You receive money, technology, access to other districts or you simply advance in main story. And that kept me going to the end of Satellite Reign - getting new means, weapons and implants to even the odds and make next mission easier to complete. I think this is the most redeeming part of Satellite Regin, the part when all of your effort pays off. Later on, buffed with advanced implants and weaponry you can assault enemy bases. While you still have to hide from reinforcements every now and then, it's certainly fun to blast your enemies for a change.Unfortunately, as you rise in power, you realise that there nothing more to it. That's the whole game. You've seen all that there is to see and you know that you've spent far too many hours to expect anything else.As the story unfolded I cared less and less about it. I didn't care much for snippets of lore in hackable panels. It didn't made me to do it, I didn't feel a need. The only point where I found the plot interesting is the very ending of Satellite Reign. But is it worth spending about 30 hours to experience it? I don't think so, but it's worth a try when the price is right.If you're looking for a Syndicate successor due to sentiment, you'd be better off playing the classic once more.Note: Satellite Reign has some serious issues running 60fps even on most powerful computers including mine.Pros:- Satisfaction after successful mission completion- Researching new tech and upgrading your agents is always fun- Game lenght is just right- Good ending- More than a single way to complete a mission, though rather illusionaryCons:- Mediocre dystopian cyberpunk theme, too bland- So-so music and graphic- Disasterous graphic performance even on fast computers- Can be incredibely frustrating- Balance and AI issues- Can be buggy- Not a Syndicate successor we waited forTested on :- Satellite Reign version 1.4- OC'd i5 3570K, 8GB RAM DDR3, GTX 980TI G1 Gaming, 1440p.

												So, as someone completely new to the genre, I'm thinking of the best way to describe this game.Atmosphere wise, the game has a very blade runner type feel to it -- something the devs aren't shy about, as they have random small name references in the game like ""Deckard Corp"" to pay tribute to the visual style.Gameplay wise, it feels like a game that is combo of company of heroes squad movement (cover usage) + Deus Ex skill and augment type upgrades + diablo style angled view / hotkey usage -- mashed into a game; all of which comes across very well.Unlike some games where stealth is an after thought, this game thoroughly rewards you for making stealth based choices in your character builds. There have been plenty of times where an enemy base looks insane on the map, only to find, with the right skills, you can get right in through a back entrance with almost no resistance if you look hard enough.Only complaint is that it 'can' feel a little grindy at times. Although, in an hour or two you can make a lot of progress quickly that feels rewarding. So it's not too bad.Overall, I'm really liking the game for the price.  $30 seems like a fair price so far just based on what I've played.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an OK game that would be a LOT better with a tactical pause.  It has a love of ""Syndicate Wars"" and fans of that game do not want any of that old school game-play changed.  I can recommend the game for what it is...a homage to SW and good finger exercise...but squad tactics and the cyberpunk theme is woefully hidden behind a wall of somewhat silly mechanics. This game is ALL about the mechanics.  It can be fun.  It is what it is.  Your millage may differ depending on your expectations.UPDATE ======================================The released version of the game lets you start with a stim pack that, in effect, slows down time.  This serves as the tactical pause that I longed for in early access.  The game is very control heavy, but it's not the keyboard management nightmare it once was.			"

The future is bright, the future is neon...Satellite Reign, created by Five Lives studios, made up of ex Bullfrog employees is the spiritual successor to Syndicate and Syndicate wars. The good ones. Not the horror that Electronic Arts perpetuated, you know, the first person shooter that came with Skrillex making the theme tune (because apparently we really needed Skrillex ruining one of the best cyberpunk game themes in that era). Satellite Reign takes more of its' heritage from the somewhat unfairly criticised Syndicate Wars than the original, borrowing elements from both but then adding some unique elements of its' own, before souping up the graphics, really, really souping them up, and making the whole package relevant to today's crowd.Does it work?In a nutshell? OhmighodyesClass based, mission orientated, but at the same time, the right kind of open world mentality...The city is effectively one -giant- map, you can travel between districts at will, and the game will happily let you trundle around this huge, sprawling city, exploring all the nooks and crannies at will, various areas are controlled by the key antagonist corporations (The Eternals, Ronin, UzyKorp, Dracogenics, the Wyverns), they're deemed off limits and the moment you enter one, if you're detected you can expect a toasty reception from the guards. At the very least you'll be escorted off site and given a kick in the back, at worst you'll be served a bullet breakfast. Then again, you're not really here to just wave and say cheery words, you're in command of the finest your company has to supply, which at the beginning... isn't much. You've managed to snag a prototype version of something called ""Res_Tech"" which allows you to resurrect your agents in the field to some extent, though it's far from perfect, the version you have will not preserve clones, so you'll need to replace them as clones are shot up. You've also a small sum of money provided to you by the corp, and your agents who come armed with futuristic Uzis and the Infiltrator comes packing a sniper rifle. Poking around the skill upgrade system hints at the sheer potential for carnage your soldiers -will- be able to unleash, but to begin with, you're weak, you're small. The first jobs are going to be skin of the teeth things as you scrounge resources, get a few prototypes and start building up those all important weapons, gear and augments. In this regard, it's -very- close to the original Syndicate games, the feeling of power as you steadily improve your agents from ""Joe public with a gun"" to ""Cyber enhanced machines of destruction"". The persuadertron has been replaced with a button marked ""Hijack"", which allows you to hack the brainware of pretty much anyone provided you have the appropriate skillset for it, again, initially you can only brainwash members of the public, maybe some police officers and the odd thug, but once you skill up you'll be able to convert Soldiers and even enemy corp members and return them to the clone pool, adding valuable and highly sought after clone bodies that come with built in bonuses to your army.The flow of the game is realtime all the way, each of your agents is class based, and as a result the game oft feels a bit like a MOBA but single player, with you managing the placement, tactical cover, targetting and skill usage of your various agents. As well as managing their skill growth, gear loadouts, enhancements etc. As you gain power and start adding more skills, you'll find that you get more comfortable with managing the myriad of options available, and you'll be planning your routes in and out of complexes with astute precision. The plan doesn't -always- survive contact with the enemy, but when you pull it off smoothly, you'll feel badass.Blade runner would be proud of this world...The graphics and sound design are very, very evocative of Blade Runner, with it's permanent rain soaked roads, and it's bright, cheery neon which overlays a dying, decrepit city in the most part, with only the areas for the affluent still being maintained to a high standard. It's very much a telling commentary on what a city might look like in the future, and a very dystopian and gritty approach to world building, and in places feels like it could serve as set dressing for the very film I mention. Just throw Decker and some replicants into the world and you'd have the film to go.The music too, strikes a lot of chords both with the original games, and with Blade Runner, with a lot of heavy use of synth, orchestral overtones, and an almost Vangelis style approach to building the atmosphere. It works brilliantly, ebbing between calm during the times of exploration and stealth, and tension and drama during combat. This is a game that really thrives on the atmosphere it has created, and it really draws you into that atmosphere.Closing thoughtsSatellite Reign is an example of how Early Access and indeed Kickstarter -should- be done. No silly content stuff was hidden behind gates, indeed, the stuff offered to backers was cosmetic and if anything -added- to the game for other people rather than took away (by offering backers the opportunity to design things to be put into the game), I didn't back it for reference, but I did ""due dilligence"" (as these days a lot of devs ARE packing content into backer tiers), and the Early Access was done right, with gameplay and bug fixing shaping and informing the product until it was polished and most of the rough edges were taken out of the game. It's still -got- a few rough edges, but they'll get patched out soon enough, for a 1.0 release this is a remarkably polished game. One that stands up to repeated playthroughs, and offers a lot of game for your money, and your time.Verdict : Highly recommended "

Early Access Review
								I supported this from the moment I saw it. Let's be honest, I loved the original Syndicate, this feels like the spiritual successor to it and even some members of the development team worked on the original which shows through in spades.The tutorial introduces the basics and you'll gather together the team of 4 which will be with you throughout the game.The city is divided up in to several districts which require special credentials to access, this means initially bribing, shooting, generally making a mischief of yourself in the different areas to aquire the passes, whilst also subverting the local corporations' operation in the zone to make make things easier on your team if the need arises.How you go about it is very open ended - as you roam the city and hack data terminals, logs and missions come to light which are up to you which order to complete or take note of, if indeed you will bother at all. It seems to me that visiting the zones and installing all the ATM syphons possible in order to plough money in to research is as valid as anything else.On the subject of strategy, of course you could go in loud with guns blazing - often enough this seem like the last resort. Making use of the robust cover and stealth system allows for your agents equipped with the necessary skills to sneak around, climb through vents, hack in to power terminals and even hack guards on your way to the goal without firing a shot on the way to subvert the evil corporations. There are things in the mission which are discoverable, and not immediately obvious which give the game an immersive feel and lets the mind wander, consider possibilities, look around the map and find the weak spot that suits your team and methods rather than being a linear play through. The tools and augments at hand need to be considered, the layout of the facility and an individual's approach to a given set of objectives taken in to account.Things inevitably go wrong on missions such as these.. you get spotted due to bad planning, being over confident, whatever it is, that is where combat starts to happen. Stimulants from the support team member can slow down time and recover health, whilst allowing precious moments to reposition and set your sniper up to obtain the advantage. Or maybe you book it to the nearest vent and try to hide until the heat dies down and regroup. It's not an easy game and things can go from absolutely peachy to a maelstrom in seconds sometimes.Far from being out of the game after losing a battle, perhaps during the process you were able to ""persuade"" (or hack in this case) a guard or two on the way which will allow you to replace the clones you have, or maybe it's possible to drop them in using the F.R.E.D system. I dont want to give too much away. The game introduces early on the idea of obtaining ""clones"" from the people on the street to restock your team in the event that things go pear shaped and the city offers a wide variety of people with different abilities and benefits. Guards and police can make special prizes if you can get them onside.The scenery of the city is great, reminiscent again of the great Syndicate of old reminding me with its overpasses, huge video screens on buildings beaming advertisements or propaganda in to the street and the people wandering about, going to bars and hanging out at the market. The ever oppressive corporate police force and their drones stalk the city looking for citizens who step out of line. The cars whizz around on the tight roads in each district which has it's own vibe and layout.This game really got my heart going as I hoped not to be discovered by the drones and 5 strong security force which passed right by my hiding place in a secure area as I planned to steal some stuff. It feels like a real world where in some spots, you're really responsible for this little crew, in a world dominated by forces bigger than your own.			"

												In the original Syndicate i wandered around shooting everything until my poofy pantsed green manthings died. I might have clicked around in some menues. After 10 minutes i quit. This revamp held (and currently holds) my attention abit longer.The ""story"" is simple and told thru a single cutscene over the whole game (i assume theres one at the end) : Theres evil corporations who dominate the world and are rich so you use four super (eventually) agents to subvert and sabotage their stuff because youre just as evil but without the dominating and rich parts. After a short tutorial youre pretty much free to go wherever and do whatever you want to the various installations littered all over the world with no barriers except your dudes being to weaksauce to tackle some harder targets (theres border checkpoints requiring some extra work for passage but you could theoretically shoot your way thru aswell).To remedy that you earn xp by doing stuff and leveling up your guys rpg style (no refunds) and equipment and money by doing missions - which almost always entail getting into a place and then getting out with the items alive. But theres also other stuff like simply breaking into the sectors guard station to weaken overall security and the like.The four classes are :- Soldier : Huge beefy shooty man (or woman depending on the clone) being good at being huge, beefy and shooty. Has his own version of hacking for simple mechanical devices- Support : Scan ability (Batvision) and various increasingly powerful passive squad bonuses- Assassin : Snipz0r, more importantly can go invisible and use shortcuts other agents would need gear or augments for- Hacker : Gets the torrents and pr0n, can use drones (meh) and mindjack people for a WIDE range of shenanigansLike mentioned you level up your dudes and put points into stuff to get abilities or stronger versions of them. Then theres also outfitting with weapons, gear (from medkits to armor to zip line hooks) and augments (i asked for this) which all can be gained by buying from the black market at horrid prices or nabbing prototypes from various places and then use them right away or research for mass production X-Com style. Since the whole thing is basically a fancy breaking-and-entering sim it could have fallen flat on its butt very easily if the maps or tools provided were badly or boringly designed. This isnt the case, each place is unique and presents a unique layout and challenge.Theres more stuff like the cloning and bonus attributes and whatnot but i guess this is quite enough.

Early Access Review
								I recommend and review games rarely; most are fodder that I just churn through, especially early access titles. Satellite Reign is the rare exception to this. It takes everything that was right with the classic Syndicate and its sequel, Syndicate Wars, adds an nice dash of inspiration from Dawns of War I & II.The presentation is beautiful, putting lie to undeserved reputation the Unity engine gets from low-rent mobile developers and indie devs with big ideas and small skillsets.Graphically the game shines, even on mid-spec systems, with high-end systems taking the cyberpunk-noirish feel to the next level. The city is bathed in perpetual night and omnipresent rain with neon signs (and tonemapping) abounding, giving it a mise-en-scene evoking Blade Runner.The music is equally nice, quoting liberally from Syndicate -- no surprise since 5 Lives' first Kickstarter stretch goal was to hire Russell Shaw, the composer and sound designer behind Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, as well as plenty of other Bullfrog and Lionhead titles.The level design is also great, having an open world that's broken up into districts, giving Satellite Reign a much bigger, more sprawling feel than its spiritual predecessor, as is fitting for the cyberpunk genre. The districts each feel noticeably distinct, even perpetually dark and wet as they are, from the gritty, working-class industrial district to the gleaming, gentrified Grid, a religious enclave devoted to a transhumanist AI cult.5 Lives has also been quite good with their fundraising and delivery. Their Kickstarter was one of the most well-thought-out Kickstarters I'd ever seen, showing a sense of budgeting and proportion that deviates from the standard Kickstarter fare that deviates wildly between promising each investor a personal, life-sized replica of Europe for five dollars or million dollar stretch goals to give you the ability to save your game.With this kind of budgeting and good money sense, you get the feeling 5 Lives intends to stand behind their promise of continuing to use funds generated from the pre- and post-launch purchases to flesh out the game more. While the last leg of develop has seen fully fleshing out the four districts originally planned for that funding level (Downtown, Industrial, Grid, and CBD districts), it's clear that the game is a labor of love for 5 Lives, and it's not hard to imagine they fully intend to complete the game as they originally wanted it, with the two additional districts (Slums and Sci-Tech) and factions (Disconnected and ... well, Sci-Tech, respectively) added in as budget allows.This also raises the promise of post-launch cooperative, which the game is simply begging for. It's no doubt that this would be a massive undertaking in terms of netcode, implementation, and balance, but the design of the game itself, from the unique skillsets of the agents the player controls to the absolute scope, screams for interplayer cooperation and communication, similar to the Dawn of War games Satellite Reign takes its inspiration from.With that in mind, it's pretty well recommended that you purchase this -- the single player is complete as it stands, guaranteeing your money's worth. The very realistic promise of future expansion, as well as the smart delivery of previous promises made by the developer, only stretches your gaming buck more.There are complaints, of course: Gone is the Nintendo-hard aspects of the original Syndicate series, as anybody who's played the final Atlantic Accelerator mission from Syndicate will attest to. Or, for that matter, the first level of Syndicate's expansion, American Revolt.Part of this lack of difficulty is from the commensurate lack of squishiness on the part of both your own agents and the enemies. As anybody who's played the original Syndicate series will remember, the glorious carnage was borne in large part by how fragile and human everybody in the game was, including your own cyborgs, whose deaths never failed to remind you that they were heavily-armed bits of cybernetic hardware, albeit grafted on to hairless apes, with all the mortality that implies.You won't find yourself molested by police who quickly die in a hail of gunfire, and some of the more frenetic firefights can go from tense to protracted as you watch your agents slowly chew through enemy armor. You also won't find as many civilians caught in the crossfire, though it does happen. And with that lack of squishiness on the part of your agents, you can often go feeling particularly unthreatened.That's simply honesty, however, and shouldn't deter you from buying, playing, and enjoying the game.

 Syndicate Wars evolved	If you remember playing and enjoying Syndicate Wars from way back, then stop reading and buy this game now - Satellite Reign is the spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars. I backed this game after the Kickstarter ended and I have no regrets, it delivers what was promised and feels like a worthy successor.Game play consists of controlling 4 agents in real time, in a cyberpunk open-world setting. You break into different compounds to steal/assassinate using stealth or brute force. Rob banks and hack ATMs for money and use it to research and buy better gear. As you complete more missions, your agents level up and gain more abilities as well, in preparation for a final showdown with the mysterious CEO of the Dracogenics corporation.Pros:+ The game has a great traditional, Cyberpunk atmosphere. Bladerunner-esque neon visuals are colourful eye-candy.+ The futuristic soundtrack fits the game perfectly.+ Stealthily sneaking into a compound, hacking your target and then slipping out undetected past guards and security cameras is tense and great fun. Even when it all goes pear-shaped you can still fight your way out or run away.+ The map design is excellent - with dark, cluttered alleyways and brightly lit, heavily guarded compounds. The city feels organic.+ The world feels like a sandbox where you can mess about with different guns and explosives. Silenced sniper rifles, cloaking devices, sound dampened grenades or augmented armour/shields with mini guns and rocket launchers? You decide.+ A new co-op/multiplayer mode has been added, if you are into that sort of thing+ There is a long, initial load time, but once you are in the game, there are no loading screens at all which is very convenient and easy to take for granted.Cons:- This game was developed by a studio of just 5 devs on a small budget. They had to make smart choices about what to focus on during development so some areas of the game are a bit rough around the edges.- AI for the security guards can occasionally be a bit wonky and exploitable.- Rare bugs include agents getting stuck in the environment and one instance of an agent falling through the floor. Simply reload a savegame to work around this.- Lacks the extra polish that a bigger studio with a bigger budget could achieve: no cinematic cutscenes, brief tutorial, lacking background environmental sounds. Much of the story is revealed through reading emails and data logs. Something that would have made this game an instant classic is some kind of extra strategic layer - heres to hoping for Satellite Reign 2.- Breaking and entering compounds gets a little bit samey after a while, although the final confrontation adds a small twist.- Very CPU intensive for a top-down isometric game. Don't be surprised if you can't get 60fps with your latest high-end graphics card.This is a very ambitious game for a 5-man studio. It is tremendously fun to play and succeeds in what it set out to achieve: to be a spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars. In the end, it is limited simply by manpower and budget. I sincerely hope 5Lives Studios continue to make further games.Score: 8.5/10 "

Early Access Review
								Early Access Examination - 


YouTube™ Video: Satellite Reign Early Access Examination 

			Views: 1,107		

			Cosmic gives an early access examination of Satellite Reign an RTS in development by 5 Lives Studios. This game was provided free of charge by the developers for the purpose of critique.		

The gameplay that is actual currently available is somewhat limited. First lets start off with combat, the combat is pretty straight forward once you have switched from incognito mode to weapons ready by pressing the space bar you simply right click an enemy to start firing. The game also employs a cover system for both combat and stealth. When you have you characters selected and hover the mouse over any object like a wall you'll get markers as to where your agents will take cover should you decide to move them there. The combat overall feels very similar to Dawn of War 2 where your taking a squad in combat cover to cover and using abilities. I think the combat still needs some work to make it more interesting, first the AI needs a lot of work to make it challenging. Second they pathing of both player controlled characters and AI needs work as pathing just doesn't work at the moment. Thirdly a progression of enemies is needed to keep the challenge, you need more than just a couple enemy types in different skins. Finally the abilities that are yet to be implemented should be something cool. You need abilities that can change the flow of battle or add new options to your strategies, the combat needs to be interesting.The mission system in the current version is also limited and your progression in it is also limited due to many of the games features not being implemented. Ultimately I think the current missions are a showcase of the games core functionality rather than a view of what's to come. The reason I say that is that each mission has you doing the exact same thing which is infiltrating a facility. If that is all the missions are going to be in the final game, well, its going to be dull. That being said one thing I was happy to see was the emphasis on achieving the goal in your own way. Each objective has multiple paths, you can go in guns blazing or send in one agent and focus on stealth. There are a variety of tactics for you to use and I really hope the developers build upon this foundation. Your agents portraits at the bottom display their health, energy for things like sprinting and experience bar. They also have a wanted level to the side similar to a GTA style wanted bar. This will so you when your in a restricted area and if you cause to much trouble by having firefights or killing people, the bar will increase causing more enforcement to arrive.Agents each have loadouts and you can equip them with different weapons, armor and cybernetic upgrades that will affect stats. You will also come across designs such as weapon plans that once you have researched them which requires time and money will give you access to those items that you can then build and equip. currently there isn't much in the way of items in the game and I would certainly hope to see a lot of items in game come full release. The world itself is a simulated city, as you walk through the streets people will be going about their daily lives. Hover cars zoom down the roads which you can get in but its not a fun as you think as its essentially on rails so you cant veer from the road. The city looks both depressing and full of vibrant life as the neon lit billboards shine off the wet concrete floors.Graphically even in this early build the game is looking very nice. The animations look smooth and graphical effects such as rain, gunfire and explosions are visual pleasing. The art style the team have gone for is very eye catching, the neon colours against the sea of grey stands out well, everything in the world thus far looks very good. Visually the biggest issue is the current UI, its doesn't work well. Character portraits are too small, text is hard to read and often blurred or even outright glitched. The menus don't look very good and due to their current layout, nothing flows well sometimes you cant tell if something can be pressed. Ultimately the current menus and overall UI is a mess and definitely needs a rework, it is possible that this was just a temporary UI however if this is what they were going to be going for, please don't. Everything from aiming reticles to the character portraits needs redesigned, a clear, fluid and vivid UI design will go a long way.In this early access build currently there is no real tutorial and due to the main story thus far not yet being implemented in any big way, if your looking for a well told narrative at this point you won't find it. I certainly feel that once the game reaches full release, the writing and overall narrative will be crucial in keeping people playing. While I am all for the emergent gameplay the game is trying to provide, you still need a good story and narrative to find reason.In terms of future content the developers have stated that there is an array of features to come. Things like additional skills, abilities, weapons, items plus factional relationships and a propaganda system. There will of course be more districts to play through though whether these will be released throughout early access or saved until full release is unclear. Another feature yet to be implemented is cloning, from what it sounds like cloning could be a feature that serves as a character customization tab as well as a explanation as to why your agents can respawn after they die. At the end of the day this build is a very early build and it's clear there is a ton of content to be implemented. The future content does sound promising but we shall have to wait and see what comes of it.I must warn you there are a ton of bugs in this version and its not just small bugs, there is occasionally some progress hampering stuff in here. Not is only is there a lot of bugs but a ton of the games features are yet to be implemented as such your realistically only getting a skeleton of a game but it does have some nice looking bones. I feel that amply sums up the entire early access build currently, Yes it holds a lot of potential and looks nice but in terms of actual game to play, as of yet there's not much to it. I think unless your dead set on being involved in the testing right now you may wish to hold off until the game has a lot more content. For the price you are paying I would recommend that people wait until release or at least very late on in early access until many more features have been put in.			"

												I'm changing my review. I was impressed at first but having played final release for a couple of hours I'm bored. The lack of Pause is a problem, more than I'd hoped. In the heat of battle you need to stack commands on all your agents at all times or you'll lose, simple as that, but because everything is firing at you if you lose track or take a moment to get bearings, you'll be overrun.Combat is dull, just a war of attrition. Agents simply fire endlessly at enemies, even when they're in cover, until they're worn down. Apparently it gets deeper, at some point. Not sure when.There's a fun story, and it's nice stomping round the maps. But it seems simplistic overall. Stealth is just a case of timing. Fighting is just a case of wearing the enemy down. Pause-to-stack-actions would be awesome, it wouldn't damage gameplay *at all*.Overall, meh. Would refund if I hadn't bought alpha at full price months ago, especially as it launched for much less than full price.			"

Early Access Review
								If you loved Syndicate and Syndicate Wars you should keep your eyes on this Title. I played a bit in the current state (pre-alpha) and everything is there: the dystopian atmosphere, your four agents, the Cops, the Corps... It is like a jump into the past. Even if it is just a pre-alpha you can have some fun and have an idea about what will be the full game (but don't pretend too much it is still in dev!). Major differences from old Syndicate Titles? First the background is different. The action is all in a single City (Yeah no more World Map) and you represent a Group ready to change the Status Quo. All your Agents have a Class (I.E. Hacker) that can give you a tatical advantage (I.E. Hacker can open for a certain amount of time closed gates\doors). You get your misson while being active in the City (Currently you can only explore a single District) via the Map Interface where also you manage your team. I really like this idea of a single hunge Setting with constant action. I will probably write a better summary and review once I have more of this title under my grasp. However, give it a shot, you will not regret it, if you are an Old Gamer from 80s as me.			"

												First let me say that personally I really enjoyed this game yet I can't really recommend it because it has some huge flaws most people won't be willing to deal with.Also just to point out: This review was written from my experience with the game right after release - some of these issues might be improved in the future.What I enjoyed:- Great cyberpunk setting and visuals- atmospheric OST- the ending follows the pattern of an infamous trope but they somehow managed to make it work - thanks mostly to a good and fitting ending song - allows for different approaches - combat is rather fun if kinda repetitive - not to say that the stealth isn't fun at all but it just gets too easy and trivial pretty quicklyWhat's bad:- very poor optimization- reaaally terrible pathfinding. Some of the most unbelievable examples are that very fast characters (mostly the Infiltrator) won't even be able to turn a corner right in front of him without the pathfinding spazzing out. Instead he will run into the corner, stumble back and then thanks to the forceful repositioning he will finally be able to pass the corner without bumping into anything.- excessive unnecessary micromanagement in a real-time only game - it just doesn't give any options to manage your characters eg. aggressive/passive stances and/or any kind of sentry mode a la Fallout Tactics, let alone any kind of scriptable macros  like ""use shield recharge when shields below 25%"" a la Dragon Age. Combat stims - an ability of one of your agents - is supposed to be a bit of an replacement for a tactical pause but its execution is pretty broken, upgrading it is actually very counterproductive but once you realize this you're already stuck with it and no rollback is possible. I ended up pretty much never using it.- which leads us to the second big bugbear: The latter is intentional because 'mah artistic vision' thus the devs seem intent to ignore the common criticism the game received that it lacks many basic functions expected in a tactical RTS.- this is made worse by the fact that the micro management mostly is just busywork, your bigger picture strategy is really whats gonna be critical in deciding encounters in your favour- the story is pretty much non-existent. Not really an issue for me in a game like this but it's worth mentioning.- the stealth approach is a bit too heavily emphasized or vice versa the combat oriented approach too heavily penalized- kind of in the same vein: the pacing is very odd, you get the best stealth gear/implants midway through the game but the best combat gear barely before the game ends. I even had to aimlessly idle around attacking random stuff I already had raided before while the research on said combat equip finished up before the final mission.- the save system is too restrictive - while you can save any time everything in the word will be reset and you will be relocated to a relay/""safe area"" upon load. It's impossible to resume an infiltration/attack and considering that it can take around 2h for large compounds later in the game if you wanna hit all facilities this can be a real problem. You don't have an option to shut down the game with the word state intact and resume next time either. You can use OS functions like hibernate as a workaround but the game itself really should offer solutions for this.In conclusion this game is a 'more than flawed' gem, a bit of a wasted opportunity really. Kind of flawed to the degree where it burst into pieces but instead of trying to piece them together the devs are stubborn about leaving it at that and calling it modern art.The sentry/stance issue and the hideous pathfinding that never should have made it past early access are the biggest reasons why I can't recommend this game in good conscience - especially because the 'mah artistic vision' attitude of the devs indicates nothing of this will be improved in future patches.Personally I still enjoyed this game a lot but that's mostly because I played enough old games with similar issues (too much unnecessary micromanagement, bad pathfinding) to have grown a bit numb to these issues - but I still call them out for what they are: flaws, not ""artistic quirks"" worth striving for. If anything even if you have a fetish for this stuff just give the player more options.Some food for thought: One month after the release global stats show that only ~3.5% of players actually finished the game. Completion rates tend to be surprisingly low for all games in general, but 3.5% is just awful.Edit: Small update: It's getting close to one year since release and on a whim I checked the game out again. The good news: the Infiltrator seems to be able to round corners without the pathfinding bugging out now.However the completion rate for this game is still only around ~5-6% which is a good amount below usual rates and a good indicator that a lot of players didn't seem to find the game interesting enough or too flawed to stick with until the end.

												This is one of the best spiritual successors to date!!!If you are not a fan of the original Bullfrog Syndicate games… go to GOG, try them out, and understand how amazing this game is.As far as the market standard, this game is 100%As an indie developer, please don’t make the same mistake as AAA publishers. Keep developing this title. Please.>There is an opportunity for procedural missions that could span different Zones. (From existing mission points) >There is an opportunity to be able to upgrade current equipment, to hold more ammo, have more slots for enhancements and generally put the OP in prototype.>There is an opportunity to combine the above.Since the engine is working, there is an opportunity, to have another kickstarter to create more zones, and have “prequel campaign” expanding the experience.Could we have a home base, one that even gets attacked. Could the city breath a little more?-When a camera is shot down, a maintenance crew is called and the repair the camera… if your agents take these guys out, another check is made after a certain amount of time and another crew is sent. Same with all destructible objects. Adding depth and another gameplay consequence.  -Could VIP’s carrying new weapons and augmentations be escorted by tanks and guards from quest point to quest points?-Cars… this seems to be in need of cleaning up.-Can mechs and tanks patrol?Missions that require specific # of agents and a cap on equipment. –these could take place in specific areas “inside of buildings” with only specific controls to and a predetermined set path to complete. Mission editor… needs it’s own crowd source campaign.Based on your performance as a development studio, I would fund another aspect of this project. (why work on another game when you can keep building this one into a monumental experience, that you as a team can obviously pull off?) You aim to deliver and are building trust in your brand by creating what you promise.#5livesMakesAwesome "

Early Access Review
								@beta status: well allright, it's playable and it seems all content is inside. some bugs are still there but this guys are fast in development (for a team of this small size). i like the open world city gameplay and ""do your own way"" style to get control over the city and finish missions, so it is a more advanced successor of syndicate. i love it and need to spend more time in this game... so it is worth to buy ?if you like ""cyberpunk themed real time squad based strategy/tactics/managment with rpg elements in an open world city and a free choice mission system"" ... YES !!! you want this game...@ EAwell it's a pre alpha. there is one buggy level, most functions not implemented, things would not working (that maybe should work) and even routefinding is horrible. so lots of work to do for the devs.however, finally damn f**king yes !!! basics are fine and we get a real ""syndicate (wars)"" successor. even in this version the cyberpunk atmosphere is great. show some love and support if you want original syndicate gameplay.everyone else should wait for release or more playable version.

												Can't spend too much time writing a review, must play more Satellite Reign.This game hits all my buttons. Multiple approaches to free-form problems allow for dynamic puzzle solving feel to infiltrating corporations. Combat is there for when I get restless. RPG advancement, at a reasonable pace, helps me to feel invested in the progress of my crew. Death is punishing enough to feel painful, but with some time investment you can get right back to where you were.Interesting art/style/music to the game keeps me wanting to come back as soon as I'm able.Brilliant game; perfect for my play style.Biggest negative to this game is that I know it's going to be over at some point and I'll be left wanting more.

												Pretty amazing little game. Looks beautifull and plays fun. To be honest I never played Bullfrog's Syndicate, but I have some idea, so I think it's pretty close. But with all that flashy cyberpunk I feel like the game is a little hollow inside. And by that I mean it lacks some character, or charisma. It actually doesn't do a lot of exposition and the story is there just to be there. I really want to compare it with Shadowrun Returns since they are kindof two sides of the same coin. Shadowrun is really engaging, so interesting to follow, but not actually ""a lot of fun"" to play. SR on the other hand is damn fun, but man I wish there was more reason for all of it. Also I recall Syndicate had some indoor interiors which this game has not. But other than  that it's surprisingly good and that issues can be fixed if not this time around, but maybe for Satelite Regin II if that ever happenes, or any project they want to do next actually.PS AI is a bit wonky as of now.

												Very good game, but I think that it's for one time play only. At least in single player mode.The graphics are very colorful with neon lights and a general cyberpunk atmosphere. The city looks very alive with a night life.The music is identical with the original games and it's great! The sound is at same levels full of shooting, lasers, explosions and various city effects.The gameplay needs a little bit of time for someone to get used to it and master the various key combinations. Still most of the commands can be selected through the GUI. The enemy AI is at good levels. They will investigate something strange, sound the alarm, bring reinforcements etc. They may even fight each other, according their faction. However, your agents are not so clever. Almost always they will await you to command them for everything. They will not counter-attack or after killing some enemies, they will hold fire if they are out of line of sight. That means that you will always have to stay close to them and pay attention around them. Each agent has special powers and a different role in the game. If someone dies, his/her consciousness can be transferred in another body with different attributes.Generally, the game feels more like playing Commandos, but in the world of Syndicate. You will have the liberty to move inside a very large city, separated in areas and regroup your agents at various points scattered around. I am also a fan of Syndicate and Syndicate Wars. When I first saw the trailers and the gameplay videos, I was so excited, having in mind that I would play a modern version of Syndicate Wars. Satellite Reign brings a very similar feeling, but it lacks of some features. I still remember back in those days of Syndicate Wars. I could make four fully armed terminators with strong exoskeleton bodies, devastate an entire city and kill everyone, making a full army of persuaded citizens to follow my agents, I could use cars or I could sneak behind the enemy lines and accomplish a mission with less killings.In Satellite Reign there is not such a thing. You can't destroy buildings, so there are not weapons of mass destruction, such as the awesome Satellite Rain (at least not the way it meant to be) and you can't persuade and control many civilians at the same time. You can use full force to kill enemy units, but you'll have to expect constant reinforcements of them, so you will eventually lose agents or retreat. You also can't use cars, but you can destroy them after some effort.The missions are a little bit repetitive. They have similar or almost the same main goals in each area of the city and after researching some basic technologies, you can accomplish them easily. For example, equipping all the agents with medikits, armors, shields, energy add-ons and stealth kits, plus leveling their main skills and that's it. You can go until the end without the need to modify your gear.The game is still enjoyable and very well made. If you have played and enjoyed the original Syndicate games, you might get disappointed, but I think it's still worthy. For the current price and the fact that it supports co-op and multiplayer, that adds a lot to its value, because you can dedicate yourself playing and have a better control with specific agents, so you may have a better gaming experience with your friends.

												Before people jump the gun, and think this is a total negative review, it's not. I've been a long time fan of Syndicate. When I heard this announced, I was very excited. Shadowrun had recently come back to life, now a spiritual successor to Syndicate was on the way. Life was becoming awesome again.I'm going to start off by saying I like the art style of the game.  It's very well done. Visually, I really like the game. Tracking down and bribing scientists to join your cause, people to help sabotage cameras, etc. is all good in my books. Even the fact that I primarily get funding by robbing people and banks makes it even better.My biggest gripe, and what gives me so much frustration, and subsequently, this title a negative review, is the combat.My squad is dumber than a sack of potatoes. They have, zero AI.Getting shot? Cool, just take it bro. No need to react on your own accord.Click to attack an enemy on the other side of a wall? Just keep shooting the wall! Don't try to go around then fire, that's just crazy.Taking a lot of fire? Why take cover? Just stand there while the opponent's AI makes smart decisions. Like opening fire, then running to cover, then waiting a few seconds before firing again.While I don't totally regret buying this game, mostly because I got it on sale, either the player team's AI needs a serious overhaul, or the game needs a pause function so I can issue orders to my team of marauding lobotomized clones, so they don't die in 10 seconds during a firefight.edit: I should also add, that I play this game on Ironman. So when a clone with high physical stats dies, it can take a while to find a replacement body with similar stats. Otherwise, you're stuck resurrecting them into the lowest-tier body available, which makes life difficult if you're doing a difficult mission.			"

												This game was an absolute delight from start to finish. It 100% delivers on the kind of experience it promises.What I liked:  It's never punishing. It's not easy, but I could play casually for an hour or two at a time, and I had no problem experimenting with very different styles of play. Every awesome combo you think might work? It works awesomely. Nothing feels nerfed or unsatisfying, and I felt rewarded for experimenting.  It's a truly open world. My favorite part of each mission was panning over the target base, considering the tremendous breadthe of options. Sneaking from cover to cover with cloak, hijacking guards to open doors, turning off the generators to lock out reinforcements, blasting everyone to pieces... virtually any strategy can work if done right.  The city and theme are perfect. The city is vast and full of little details (the names of the businesses cram in every sci-fi reference imaginable).  There were dozens of bases for the ~100 missions, and they never felt repetitive.  I am hard-pressed to think of a game setting more richly realized.What I didn't like:  The interface will be your biggest enemy. Firefights happen very fast, uninjured opponents blend into the scenery, and killing the enemy radioing for back-up can be the difference between victory and a Bolivian army ending.  This only gets worse as your units will gain more abilities requiring activation. The Team Stim ability functions a bit like an active pause, but it has too many quirks (it slows down scrolling too, it requires a recharge, etc).  It's buggy. Nothing game breaking, but the bugs are plentiful. One example: NPCs in my party frequently couldn't use vents and got stuck in the geometry. Another example: At the moment I finished the game, I had an ability on which slowed time to 10%... which then stayed on for the entire final cut scene.  The rules aren't clear or consistent. It was often very difficult to determine the consequences of a given action, and there were many instances where the AI behaved in an odd or inconsistent way.  One example: Hijacked (mind-controlled) enemies can walk by most opponents just fine, but turrets invariably blasted them to pieces, for no clear reason.  Another example: Cloaked melee attacks resulted in no response about half the time, and all the opponents immediately going on alert the other half.  The plot and characters could be more interesting.  The overall plot and the individual missions aren't much more than ""those guys are bad"" and ""theres money and weapons here"".  There were several game elements (resurrection, cloning, hijacking peoples brains) which had huge potential to deal with complex body horror/human nature themes, but were never really explored.Ultimately, I loved this game.  It left me hoping 5 Lives makes a bigger budget sequel with more plot and polish.			"

								Updated review:I must add with the latest updates and patches this game is getting amazing! Nearly all bugs gone a gaint map, lots of tactical game play. GREAT!Its an open game play word now with different districs and great things to discover!!!The game drastically increased in complexity with makes it great on the long run!Definitely worth the money.Great game, reminds well of syndicates and a little of syndicates wars.Now most of the bugs are gone and the game is great to play!I enjoyed it quite a lot. - It already has an amazing Map, which I think is a piece of amazing Artwork!The playtime for this game with these gaint maps is more than 72 hours the maps with the new districs are huge.(b.t.w. I played it on a macbook air on medium settings.)Many new features have now been implemented, which is great.- Among other cool things such as getting airdroped into an restricted zone.- Many weapons, gears, tools, drones.- Cloning people to improve stats  - Vents and ziplines, high vents and ... What I would love to see:- Hell there isn't a big enough weapon :D (You know what I mean)- The ability to play as a small company which can invest into other companies (stock markets)- Even more cyberware, weapons/ weapon types and gear what about (grapling hooks?)- More skills (and no limit)- Tanks / Bombers ?- Enemy agentsMinor bugs found:- When your Agents sit at a corner and you let them move fast to another side,then they tend to run forward and backward for a while before they eventually go to the position.

								If you love Sci Fi, or if you Fan of Metal Gear solid, The original syndicate games, or even Dues Ex series. You well love this game. The game gives you freedom of what ever you want to do from going in stealth or going in guns blazing. Its a very slow paced game at the beginning but if you ever played ""Commandos"" than you well love this game. Each class play differently and you have to make them work together to complete your missions. Overall its to hard to judge the game now but from what am seeing it has a lot of potential of becoming one of my favourite games out there.			"

Yes but with a caveat...It is Pre Alpha Early Access so bear that in mind when you play. It is incomplete but the potential is there.There are lots of bugs but the design of the first area is nice I love the looks it reminds me of Blade Runner for some reason.There is no customisation of your agents at the moment so again if you are going to buy it then review be honest don't be negative its just because the feature or for that matter any feature is not in game yet.The potential is there and I am looking forward to the full release.

								I am a fan of the original Syndicate games, thus, I have been eagerly awaiting this game for some time.At the time of the writing, I am playing the pre-alpha build and as expected, it's far from the finished product. However, it does give a glimpse of how this game will play and I am happy to say it does capture the atmosphere of the original Syndicate. However, it still needs a lot of polish before it's ready for release. A lot of the features / graphics have yet to be implemented, and it's still buggy. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the final product will be a polished gem. If you are fan and can't wait to play the game, I'd recommend that you jump on the bandwagon and get this early release. If not, would suggest that you wait for a later build so that you'd not be disenchanted with the present game.			"

								The game is currently in very early alpha, so it has A LOT of bugs. But even with those bugs, missing UI elements, tutorials, gameplay tips etc. you can get a pretty solid feeling on what kind of game we are talking about.As an old Syndicate and Syndicate Wars veteran I'm really liking what we have here. You get to control a group of four (4) mercenaries, all with their different skills and weaknesses. After you've done some missions, you can upgrade your troops with skillpoints, unlocking skills like mind control, stealthy cloak, melee katana skills, more hitpoints, more firearms skills and so on.While you move around the (quite big already!) map, you can hack cameras and closed doorways to help you approach your mission site from your chosen direction - and siphon ATM machines to get some extra credits in your own account.As the game progresses, you find different types of prototypes you can research for your team to use. Those vary from cybernetics to body armors, weapons and explosives. Everything you need to make yourself more effective on the field.As you launch the game, you get an early access warning saying ""absolutely nothing you see here is final, nor does it include all planned features"" - nothing we early access fanatics don't know already - so you may want keep that in mind while playing the game.So far I'm very impressed and can't wait to get my hand on the full release version in future. This game has huge potential!			"

								When I was a teen, I played this amazing game called Syndicate. I sank hundreds of hours into it and loved every single one of them.  21 years later now aged 40, I got to relive that magic in Satalite Reign, a game I backed as soon as the kickstarter launched.The team have done a fantastic job in retaining the overall feel of the original whilst taking advantage of more sophisticated graphics and gameplay mechanics. This is a remake, not a reboot!Right now in pre-alpha there’s not a great deal to do other than explore the map and infiltrate a few bases. The original was mission based and when these are injected into the game it will be awesome. Can’t wait for the full game.I do think the xbox generation might find this game a little basic in the graphics department, but if you’re an old school gamer who loved the original series, then you’ll love this game!http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(series) "

												TL;DR: Minor flaws, but great fun to be had in this open world squad based tactics RPG.Gameplay revolves around infiltrating compounds through a combination of stealth and wanton bloodshed, stealing cash and prototype gear, and abducting innocent civilians and fellow corporate scum alike to use as hosts for your murdersquad, should they fall in combat.What the game lacks in plot, dialog, character design, meaningful choices, etc. it makes up for in fun, challenging, varied level design. I'll spend 10-15 min running around the edges of a compound scanning the infrastructure to see what nearby generators power, where doors and cameras can be hacked from, what vents are accessible- planning my entry and exit from the facility down to the last detail. Scans only go so far in though and once the outer defenses have been breached there's a point where you just have to wing it; this transition from strategy to improvisational tactics is thrilling and a high point every time around. The combination of the game's format and mechanics allow for this to shine like no other game I've played. Xcom does the squad tactics thing better with its cool, clearheaded tactical assault approach, but Satellite Reign has no turns, no pause, no stopping to think (and no saves behind enemy lines ;) ). When♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan its chaos, and its glorious.			"

												I would recommend the game but the dumb A.I. both your and enemies makes combat  not enjoyable. You can rush base and kill everything you see and just run away from rest of enemies and they will forever forget your face. There should be either pause in game (because slow time is blurry and turtle speed is no fun) or option to set aggressiveness for your units to auto attack from cover without moving for example lvl 0 - hold fire , lvl 1 - shot nearest enemy not in cover, lvl 2 - shot nearest enemy.  Stealthy approach is feels like commandos and combat feels like cannon fodder. Enemies don't react to dead bodies or explosions only when you are nearby. They should increase security permanently and leave stationary guards when incidents occurred. In general its not very challenging for experienced player. Probably that’s why most games got difficulty options. There is plenty of good things about the game and you can read about them in other review and I agree with them I just focus on the bad.			"

								Well - i have no idea why we now need ""pre- alpha"" releases after an era of bad early access titels.Next stage is probably ""early pre brainstorming phase release""Anyway - why d I say this?Cause no one can say sth about the game yet. The controls are jerky the graphics and UI need more work, pathing doesnt work well and most of the hopefully included gamefeatures are more or less only placeholders at the moment.I think it has potential if the devs manage to improve usability and overall a better control over the agents and implement decent upgrade functions.It also seems as if you have a set team - Bullfrogs syndicate gave you the options to buy new cyborgs and tune them - one of the bigger parts i really liked. maybe going for harder missions to get very special cyborg parts and so on... but we will see. I fear it will be messed up...Its a thumbs up because I will support any remake of the originalbut to be honest its too early to really give a recommendation			"

												The world-building and the story are all classic cyberpunk, with corporations taking over the world, technology advancing too rapidly for its own sake, and so on and so forth. The storyline is mostly about listening to audio messages and reading background information, it features few characters and the ideas being discussed aren't particularly noteworthy. The ends justify the means in this world, and anything from open street warfare to civilian brainwashing and hijacking is permitted. The player controls four agents from a corporation trying to rival the all-powerful Dracogenics, their goal to bring it down via espionage, sabotage and street fights.Each soldier can take a hit like a champ and is able to sabotage vital power generators and mechanical targets. Hackers can hijack security systems, enemy drones and even civilians or soldiers thanks to their brain implants. Support is responsible for healing the squad and, more vitally, scanning the world for targets of opportunity or weaknesses in enemy fortifications. Infiltrators are basically ninjas who are able to get into areas others can't via air ducts and zip lines. He or she can also wield a sword or sniper rifle with deadly precision. Every agent is distinctive, and all the roles can be further enhanced as they gain more experience.The early game can get a bit formulaic with the limited options, but the more you play, the more possibilities you have for various situations.The city is divided into several sectors with different themes ranging from industrial to high-end residential. Each has their own main and side missions to complete to help with bringing down Dracogenics and their allies.AI pathfinding is somewhat of an issue for both you and the opposition. You troops can get stuck between a ledge and a potted plant while running for cover. Enemy troops can get stuck on a door, furiously trying to run through it even if it's closed.It might not be a bug-free, smooth experience, but it probably offers the best real-time cyberpunk that's available right now.THE GOOD- Cyberpunk setting- Agent upgradesTHE BAD- Pathfinding- Weak storyDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												I'd like to update my review now the game is out of Alpha and has been released.Below for comparison is my original review.  I'll let you read it first, and then I can say what's improved since then.  (or you can skip if it's tl;dr)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is pre-Alpha.   As such, I went into it expecting bugs, and I certainly found them:Agents forgetting how to hack, doors mysteriously not working, people with invisible bodies, cars doing forward flips occasionally and refusing to explode when shot at for any length of time, also not letting Agents out and having to do a Total-Party Kill, occasionally forming many many car traffic jams for not always obvious reasons, the game either having periodic moments of lag or hitting a complete wall of unresponsiveness that killed the game entirely and requiring a complete log-out to fix.   Yet still, I recommend this game?Why?Because it feels like Syndicate Wars.  It looks different, sure, better graphics, more colour, but the atmosphere of the city feels like Syndicate Wars.   The top down iso view feels like Syndicate Wars.   Controlling 4 guys feels like it, the weapons feel as satisfying.  It's got hover cars!   Whatever it's kept or changed since Syndicate Wars, it feels like it's either matched it or done it better.Money no longer comes from mysterious sources, but from hacking ATMs and robbing banks.  Rather than blowing them up, you actually get to sneak into a compound and take it over.Research comes from actually finding blueprints that you can send off to R&D for upgrades.   You can acquire doctors and researchers for improving your R&D lab capabilities.You don't get to have whole persuadertron armies following you around, but whilst they were deeply satisfying and fun, they were a little OP, now you get to hijack people instead and have total control over them and their movements, which means it's a lot more balanced and you have to think more carefully about who you're going to persuade.I do miss blowing things up, but I'm hoping that will make an arrival in due course.   I'm also glad they got rid of the masses of clones that you'd never use in the original games (who ever completed a mission with an Agent down?  you'd lose so much tech and weaponry it was genuninely not worth it.)   The specialisation is a neat feature and allows for the possibility of some interestingly varied tactical game-play.I love the additional depth you get from the side-missions that you can unlock for money.   The ability to get security card access to an entire facility for putting in that little bit of extra effort is a nice reward and makes them worthwhile doing.All this, and it's still pre-Alpha?   Loving it so far and looking forward to seeing it develop further.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So, it's been released.   Would I still recommend it?YES.So, all those bugs that were causing problems have been squashed, there might be a couple lingering around, but I've not noticed them yet.   I'll get this in early in the review in case you get so excited hearing me rave about it that you want to dash off and play it.  If you plan on reading the Novella, if you can restrain yourself from playing the game, go read that first if you don't want the Novella to be spoilered, or conversely, if you don't want the game to be spoilered, and you want to find all the information terminals that add some lovely fluff to the game's backstory, then play the game, then read the Novella and enjoy seeing what led up to the start of the game.In my original review, I said I was pleased they got rid of the clones, and now the game has them, you might think I might be a little 'meh' about them.   Get yourself a Grade 4+ hacker, go hack some base commanders to have as your clones and then see how 'meh' you feel.I'm normally a fan of PC Gamer, but their review (a not entirely shabby 80) felt a little like they'd just played the game for a bit and then moved on to something else, the most damning line being'Your agents movement is slow and heavy, making the battles feel sluggish'  This might be true when you've got a newly started game with a bunch of rookies, but once you've trained them up and given them access to bigger hardware, there's a bit more punch.   Throw in an extra squad of hijacked soldiers and then suddenly firefights become a lot more punchy and you can happily mow your way through the enemies.Oh, and the explosions are back and as glorious as ever.   Also, you can throw them around like candy when your Agents are at their spawn point as it instantly reloads.  It's a nice way of having a safe area you can run to if you've got an entire army doggedly chasing you down and you need to rest and recouperate.Also, I love the freedom to choose how to tackle missions.   There are so many different approaches you can try and switching between them is a simple case of swapping out weapons, augments and gear and you're good to go.   If I had to recommend an addition, it would be the ability to create 'sets' that you could switch between, but that's a fairly minor point.Oh, and the book, I like it, it's very well written and has inspired me to try my own hand at writing something.I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves a good bit of tactical strategy, enjoys blowing things up, and loves their cyberpunk dystopias.

												I'll try to get around to an update after having played about 20 hourssince Satellite Reign has hit its release. For now, it is everythingI'd expect from a spiritual successor to Syndicate, and more.The design is very well executed. Design direction, atmosphere,the soundtrack, interface implementation, there's not only heartand soul in this, also skill and a good perception of scope, ofwhat is achievable, and how to do it well. The performance is surprisingly good and stable on my7 years old machine on highest settings and 1920x1200.Satellite Reign is released, but it is far from done tellingits story, there's more to come. The prequel novella isalso worth a read, if you're interested in it, and werewondering about the quality of the writing. Initial Review:Satellite Reign is still in Pre-Alpha but it already oozes the charmeand the atmosphere of its predecessors Syndicate and Syndicate Wars.It surely does not hurt that the old Bullfrog design lead is also in charge here.You feel that there is a strong foundation, great ideas and a clear concept,that lets it all grow together. I found more in this Pre-Alpha than in manyfinished games released over the last decade. I'm glad to have backed this project and feel its already its money worth. The team is very communicative and can handle criticism. I'm not one for early access myself, I got because I supported theKickstarter. I won't say 'Buy it'. Read the other reviews, look at it,maybe get to play it at a friend's and decide for yourself, if you want to support this idea becoming real with your wallet, or towait and see it grow. Some updates in, the game has already come a long way. The developers are constantly dropping by in the forums.A decent bunch, that really care for their project, you feel that their heart and soul go into it. They're alsoquiet fast with deploying emergency fixes, if somethingis reported as broken. It's coming together nicely.Cheers!			"

												Great concept but for an RTS the controls are inelegant and some commands are ignored, with little to no feedback as to why. Visuals are amazing cyberpunk style and it feels like the lore of the world is well thought out. If not for fiddly controls and poor info feedback making the stealth come down to luck rather than patience and planning I could forgive it, but as it stands my frustration just builds over time till I have to stop playing and then I get more and more reluctant to return to play it.

												Satellite Reign is a real-time, class-based strategy game, set in an open-world cyberpunk city. That basically means it's Syndicate with more colors and a little bit of Shadowrun. The city is not that open and the game does not require that much strategy, but it's a nice, less grim and more colorful, Syndicate lookalike.You control 4 agents - soldier, support, hacker, infiltrator - through four districts of a cyberpunk city. The agents can be enhanced via leveling their skills, augmenting them with new cybernetics or equipping them with new gear and weapons. Plenty to all that to choose from. The main story is rather short, but there are many side missions along the way to keep you busy. Each mission allows for killing or stealthing your way through and there are always several ways you can handle given mission, which is nice. The visuals were a little bright to my taste at first, but after getting used to them I think it's actually quite a nice cyberpunk setting. It took me less than 30hrs to finish and apart from nonexistant visual character customization I enjoyed Satellite Reign immensely.I liked:* cyberpunk!* possibility to stealth your way through everything* visuals* plenty of side missions* musicI disliked:* controls can be inconvenient* last mission is a bit mehGet this if:* you would like to play a more colorful Syndicate* you like cyberpunkDon't get this if:* you're looking for open world gameplay* you expect deep story "

												Kickstarted this and sure am glad I did.  Devs have made a great game that is a modern take on what Syndicate was (as I remember, has been quite a while).  Setting is beautiful, combat is fun, and this game has me wanting to ""play just a bit more"" each time.  Haven't had any game breaking issues, maybe a couple minor audio or path finding bugs here and there.  Really is quite an achievement considering:1) This was crowdfunded and we've seen how that can go to crap with mismanaged projects barely delivering (or not at all) 2) Big studios have spent way more money, had bigger dev teams, and taken longer to make games less fun than this oneIf you like cyber-punk and can handle RTS, this game is one to get.

												I picked this game up at release, and very much enjoyed it. I recently picked the game up again to try out co-op - and I wasn't disappointed!The game plays as a tactical real-time RPG; think XCOM in real-time. Each player can control 1-3 characters simultaneously, all with different classes and abilities that feed into a succesful mission.The map is open-world, and filled with elements to explore; the entire world seems to be hand-crafted, without repeated scenery of any sort. The individual touches throughout the world make it very immersive and cool to just be ""in.""If you're looking for multiplayer cyberpunk RPG action, this is the game you want!			"

Early Access Review
								I've been following Satallite Reign for quite some time now. I almost bought in to the Early Access a while back but after having a bit of bad luck with other Early Access games I figured I would wait a while. I got the announcement that it was 2 weeks from launch and couldn't believe it, I had to give it a go especially from all the good reviews it was getting. This game is amazing. Plain and simple. It takes me back to my Syndicate Wars days but with that little bit extra that keeps you even more hooked and not feeling like a carbon copy. You can feel a little overwhelmed at the start with all the options and freedom but just pick your missons and continue, you will get the hang of it. Just don't go in to a compound guns blazing for the moment.It's got stealth, abductions, great music that suits and guns. what more do you want from a cyber punk future?? If you don't have this yet I strongly suggest you do.			"

												I really wanted to like this game; the concept is great, the aesthetics are on point, and it offers freedom of choice to tackle objectives however you want. But the controls, to put it simply, are awful and some of the commands work inconsistently. And although I appreciate the open world structure of the game, it makes it difficult to tell when I'm ready to take on certain areas. One thing I've learned in the short time I've spent with Satellite Reign: stealth in an RTS is infuriating. This is a good game, don't get me wrong. I recognize the quality. I can see the fun in it. But it's not fun to play when you have to wrestle with the button mapping and interface every step of the way.			"

												If you haven't played Syndicate, you might misjudge this game. Because many decisions are based simply on the idea of ""because this was like this in Syndicate"". 4 agents - check, cybernetic parts - check, weapons and weapons research - check, cyberpunk setting - check, corporations - check. SR is really, as devs say, the spiritual successor to the 90s classic.But still, SR is more than that. The open world, gun fight and stealth, it's all so fun (emphasize on fun, this is not a mind-blowingly hard game that you need a lot of tactics). Still game allows a lot of different playstyles. R&D and gearing up your agents is just as awesome as Syndicate. There are problems, especially with visibility, but this game makes you want to play. Also the Blade Runner-ish new style world looks really good.One thing - I hope we can get into vehicles on the expansion or sequel.			"

												I really want to like this game.  I really loved the syndicate games.  But after getting to the end of the game and losing the mission because two of my guys inexplicably fell through the floor,  I had to write this review.  The game is extremely buggy in the current state.  It is a beta at best.  Don't get it.My guys fall through the floor and die.  Sometimes my characters or mission NPCs get stuck inside buildings that don't have openable doors.  I've not gotten mission rewards or completions for completed missions.  I get the pacifist achievements even when I just fight through all the checkpoints.  Sometimes after the mission NPCs die for inexplicable reasons they don't respawn.  The mission is stuck incomplete.I'm sorry but that is a huge number of serious bugs for one person to run through on a single playthrough.  It doesn't crash, though.  So I guess there is that....

Early Access Review
								Spent a long time sitting here about what to say about this game.  Ive never really been into doing reviews but this game I feel needs it.The game over all does alot of things right in my opinion.  They mission system is diverse enough that you actually can spend the time to plan out how you wish to complete it.  I spent a good deal of my time locating zip lines, watching patrols, and looking for doors and cameras to hack before I ever even attempted to do the mission.  I was able to complete some of them without even firing a shot.Combat is quick and easy, but if you dont use your agents correctly you will very quickly find yourself respawning outside the mission area while your enemies reinforce.  Had to do that several times as I was to eager and tried to run and gun.Advancing your agents is decent, could have more skills per agent, but as it is early access what is there is still a good mix.  In the future I hope there will be more advancement options.The game really does require you to think instead of just saying here, watch some pretty flashing lights, read some dialouge and gratz you win.  Dont see this one being easily beaten.  And replayability is there already.Awesome job devs, really looking forward to what else you put into this gem of a game.TLDR: Bringing back Syndicate style game with good modernization, just buy it you wont regret it.

Early Access Review
								The game is now launched. Over 200 some odd hours later, I am going to go and shamelessly declare Satellite Reign as a Game of the Year contender. You wont be dissapointed.---------------------------Having missed out on the original Syndicate games by Bullfrog, I was very excited to hear the original team was developing a spiritual sequel of sorts to the series. After occasionally monitoring their post Kickstarter development and hearing about the game on the controversial ""Early Access"" que on steam, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a full early copy of the game... I am glad I was not dissapointed. Let me first state that the game is VERY much still an unfinished Pre-Alpha, and warn that anyone expecting a fully polished product should wait. However if you are a tinkerer and don't mind spoiling the game a little for yourself, go ahead and spend that $30 dollars and get an early glimpse at a very promising game that is gearing up to be as immersive, deep and multi layered as any surprise hit or ""Game of The Year"" in its class as you can imagine. This is my first review and first move in experiencing a game on a community level as it finishes and I will say I am very happy to have chosen this Neon Lathered Cyberpunk Beauty as the first ""leap"". I look forward to putting in as many hours as I can in the game and who knows, help the Design Team deliver nothing short of an A+.			"

												Coerce. Employ. Steal. Deploy.Track. Stalk. Assault. Destroy.A bit of history.Computer games were something of a wonder back when I was in school. They enabled me to live adventures that I was otherwise unable to realize in real life. Each new game had something fresh in it, but one that stood out for me was called SYNDICATE. Released in 1993 by Bullfrog, it stuck me with its SVGA (640x480) isometric graphics, vast open maps and freedom to achieve your objectives as you saw fit. Armed with a huge arsenal of useful weapons, the sheer carnage you could unleash on the screen with your four cybernetically augmented agents, made it one of the most memorable games of the 90’s. In 1996, a sequel called SYNDICATE WARS was released, using a modified engine from Bullfrog’s, Magic Carpet, it added fully 3D level maps and changed some of the mechanics. It also ramped up the difficulty of the missions with the final ones being nigh impossible to beat. The sequel struggled beneath the shadow the original it would be another sixteen years before a fresh attempt was made. In 2012, Starbreeze Studios tried to remodel the game as an FPS and, while I appreciated the effort, most didn’t.  Paradox Entertainment considered a spiritual successor, The Cartel, which has still yet to pan out. The foundation gathered dust. And then, a kickstarter project called Satellite Reign was launched.So what is Satellite Reign?It is the year 2188 and Steven Dangler the head of Dracogenics had developed a way of transcending death. His technology of copying human memory and consciousness to cloned bodies has made him rich and powerful. But power never lasts. You were chosen to lead a group of four cybernetic agents to topple Dangler’s rule. Mechanically, it’s a remake of Syndicate Wars rather than the original Syndicate game (the lead designer of Satellite Reign and Syndicate Wars is the same person – Mike Diskett) with the addition of stealth elements reminiscent of Commandos Behind Enemy Lines.The Agents.The first major difference, compared to the originals is that your agents are not identical. Each one is a different class of a field operative, with distinct skills which can be further upgraded, adding an RPG-like twist.The Soldier is a walking tank. He can carry the most weapons and equipment, has the most hit points and offers purely combat oriented skillsets. Second is the Support, who works as a medic boasting useful support abilities such as the World Scan (for highlighting connections between cameras, gates, power sources, hackable terminals etc.) or the Team Stims which slows down time. The Hacker is responsible for controlling CCTV cameras, doors, gates and taking control of NPCs like civilians or soldiers. Or even call in armed drones to aid the team in firefights. The Assassin uses a monofilament sword to kill even the most powerful enemies with one swift blow without alerting other enemy combatants, bypass security checkpoints in thermoptic camo or zoom above their heads using zip lines scattered around the city.The Setting.The game is set in a big seamless city that takes cues from Blade Runner, featuring even the constant rain. Divided into four main districts, each with its own unique architecture and feel, it makes for an interesting cyberpunk setting. You are absolutely free to roam a given district, and later the whole city, as you see fit. Of course, there are places your agents will not be tolerated, often pointed out by your handler to undertake missions inr. These hot-spots are navigated entirely as you please: guns blazing chaos, full stealth infiltration, or murdering silently from the shadows. There is no set missions order, leaving you free to play as you choose, but the missions are not that varied and some of them (especially the ones that give you distinct wide bonuses such as slowing down CCTV cameras’ detection time) are identical in nature in every district. What salvages the situation though is the layout of each areas remains unique.Guns and R&D.The arsenal at your disposal is varied. Throughout the game you will have access to dozens of different weapons from pistols to plasma cannons. Combined with auxiliary gear like force fields, medikits, grenades and body augmentations means a strong degree of customisation is available. New weapons, gear and augmentations are acquired through various missions. Some of them will be available as blueprints ready for immediate manufacture, some are prototypes which have to be researched first in order to produce more. Funds and scientists used to do this are almost literally lying on the streets of the city. To get funds flowing you hack ATMs scattered here and there and to get you lab stuff you use the World Scan ability to locate them among regular citizens (just drag the mouse over each of them to get to know who is who). This system works well and the only thing I found lacking about it is the fact that there is no graphical representation of the augmentation process.Combat and Stealth.Cover plays an important role in Satellite Reign. In combat, it provides cover from incoming enemy fire,while, in stealth,d it hides your agents from enemy sight. It’s not foolproof - smaller pieces of cover can be destroyed by concentrated small arms fire or with explosives. Enemies themselves come in different shapes and sizes. Lowly grunts sport rifles and a bulletproof vests while power-armoured enforcers wield miniguns.  Giant four-legged walkers stalk battlefields, showering overkill. They react to your play style, taking cover or calling in reinforcements. Most of their actions are colour-coded with their flashlights – white is normal status, yellow for alert and red for hostile. Fire fights are enjoyable and frantic at times, sometimes putting you up against 10+ enemies at once. If your agents happen to fall in combat they can be revived by other agents but each revive decreases the window of rescue. If a fatality occurs your agents can be brought back to life at special beacons you activate in the city, which also act as fast travel waypoints. You have to remember though that each time your agent dies, they lose stat bonuses. Death is still bad.The Graphics.Satellite Reign is a mix of colourful neons, commercials, holograms, clean stylised areas, industrial spaces and dirty little streets realised brilliantly on the Unreal engine. It all looks and feels right  Efforts have been made to ensure different corporations and organizations as well as enemy type each have their own look and style of armour to set them apart. There’s some criticism regarding your agent’s uniforms looking too bright but it does help them stand out of a crowded screen. The lack of free camera rotation is a bigger obstacle. Conclusion.Satellite Reign is a worthy tribute to the Syndicate franchise and should be of interest to fans of tactical combat games. It leaves room for player improvisation, allowing several different tactics to find success in each objective. It’s a smart cyberpunk homage that’s worth checking out.			"

Early Access Review
								Syndicate Wars will always be my favourite game, and Satellite Reign has all of its attributes and many more. Imagine taking the 4 group real time strategy of SW and throwing in Deus Ex Human Revolution. Strange, I know, but it actually works. And works well. You can hack and cloak and probably do all sorts of other things that I've not discovered yet. And it looks beautiful.It is a great game with a wonderful cyberpunk atmosphere. If you like Bladerunner you'll love the fact that in game it is always raining with the neon adverts adding to the environments.At this _Early Access_ stage it is understandably rough round the edges, but other than one of the agents (I guess that's who they are, not just disgruntled members of the film actors guild) gaining the ability to teleport on top of a building without order I've not come across any serious bugs so far.As far as I can tell there doesn't appear to be a shop to buy guns, and the ability to customise the four characters would be a nice idea as well. After the demise of a faceless bad guy via ozi(?!) there was the option to research an SMG via price chart which is a great throughback to SW. Though there was no alert to this, or the levelling up of the agents that I was aware of, I'm sure there will be in the finished product. Also while I dig the Tron inspired trenchcoats that they wear a variation in colour at least down the line would be good as well. When you start picking about the colour of a coat, you start to realise the game is pretty flipping good.Though all of the above may all be possible and I might just be being dense. At this _Early Access_ stage nothing is described particularly well, and why would it be? There are far more important things to deal with than messing around with detailed tutorials and colouring coats. Satellite Reign is great and it could be fantastic. As long as we can rain laser-bombs from satellites in the end product and build a Terminator with fire-proof skin, what could possibly go wrong?			"

												This is an excellent game.  Most games these days don't come out with this much polish.  Yeah there are a few bugs, but far fewer than other games I have played lately.  The first thing to comment on is obvious: the visuals.  It is a gorgeous game and I love playing it with the lights off.  The colors and the details on max settings are so nice to look at.I have read people complaining about the combat and I have to agree to a point.  The agent AI could be better in regards to pathing and just sitting there when they are being shot at.  The enemy AI needs some improvement because they just run right towards you and stand on top of you and sometimes taking cover.  Once an enemy calls for back up, that's it.  There should only be so much back up in the area.  The game forces you to slow down and think about your surroundings.  You can still go in and kill as long as you are aware of where the other guards are because sound matters.  I personally like the stealth mechanics.  Get a decked out infiltrator and you are good to go.  I enjoy the fact that I got him in almost to the goal and up to a zipline which nearly eletrocuted him.  I wasn't expecting that.  I had to sneak in my soldier so that he could find the power source and my infiltrator continued on to the goal.  Then I had to sneak them both out.  It was very rewarding when I did it wihout the loss of a single life.  You can't just run across a lot 30 ft from an enemy and get away with it.  They will see you.  Excellent.  I don't want to see their cone of sight.It is right to compare this game to Syndicate and I remember it enough to be able to compare the two very well.  Syndicate was very easy.  It was a game that appealed to the lowest common denominator and there wasn't much strategy to it.  Satellite Reign requires more thought and planning which I love.  I am glad it isn't just a run and gun kind of game which some people seem to have expected.  It isn't an FPS game and it should never be.Not since Deux Ex: Human Revolutions has a game had me excited to come home from work and skip the gym to jump back in.  Yeah, it has been that long.  I love this game and I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not playing it.  Especially when trying to fall asleep.  It is obvious the amount of work that went into it.  Good job!  I WILL buy DLC and I WILL look forward to watching it grow.			"

												This game is very well done for an indie game. I do recommend this game. I was one of the original backers of it on Kickstarter and I am happy I was.  The graphics:performance ratio is decent enough.  The artstyle is a great choice, and implemented quite nicely.  There are moments when the atmosphere is very present. Especially with the music, and other audio noises in the game. The lighting is a great mechanic. I have a thing for cyber punk universes, and while this one isn't as well defined as Shadowrun, its closer to that of Blade Runner/Deus Ex as far as style. It does a good enough job, I am sure that the sequel will be more fleshed out. Story typical of most dystopian games as such. This one with a flavor of completely ""privately owned & regulated market"" society.One thing I like about this game is choice, there are many different paths you can do, in any order you choose almost. Plus there are different ways you can do them.   The gameplay is fun, running around stealth is a blast. The firefights are intriguing, if even mostly streamlined.  Most of the abilities are warranted and useful.  The level distruction is fun. The weapons and upgrades are pretty cool, but this is something I expect to see expanded further upon in 5 Lives Studio's next game like this, such as more explosives.  Some other things I would like to see in the successor are hacking billboards to promote propaganda... distraction focused gadgets... more in-doors gameplay... have vehicles play a larger role... perhaps a Co-op option for the campaign... better AI?Overall I say this game is great fun, a throw-back to games that were around when I was a child. It can use some improvements but its pretty solid as of now.  I haven't completed it, but I am a good 2/3rds through it, and if there is anything substantial I may edit my review, but if not I will leave it as is. 5 Lives Studio definitely has my attention for their next game.

Early Access Review
								DISCLOSURE: I backed this when it was a simple Kickstarter Project.I spent an hour causing trouble and fighting off a security force for fun (and fun it was!). The idea behind Satellite Reign is that it's a spiritual successor to Bullfrog's classic Syndicate series. You have 4 agents that you control in this open-world RTS. You start with 3 (you have to rescue the Heavy guy) agents. While a lot of features are not in the current build, the fundamentals are there (a working combat system, decent AI, beautiful aesthetics, an open world) and it's enough to say that 5 Lives are on the right track to reviving what was considered a dead style of game. What shocks me is just how vast the city sandbox is, whilst I do expect 5 Lives to make a larger city for the full game, the city is already quite big and full of ""life"". Another little detail I thought was quite nice is how the characters stumble and react to getting shot, a character stumbled as I shot him something that we rarely see in this genre and it's just a small detail but regardless it's nice to see that for all that this pays homage to the originals it's a very modernised take on it. Whilst it's by no means perfect, and if you aren't fussed for Early Access I'm very unlikely to change your mind but I do recommend keeping an eye on this game if you love RTS', or even just the classic Syndicate games. This is the game you were looking for when EA announced Syndicate a couple of years back.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm recommending this only to people who actually like Early Access games and the old Syndicate games by Bullfrog.  If you're looking for something that will take you more than 3 hours to reach the end of, check back later.  It is also a massive resource hog right now; at times it was devouring close to 3GB of RAM and almost 6GHz of CPU on the lowest graphics setting.  I'll update this review in the future with what I notice going on spec-wise.Ignoring all the bugs and issues you'd expect with an alpha release, this game is actually pretty fun to play for something that I tried from 30 minutes after it landed.  It is a spiritual successor to the old DOS Syndicate series and has a lot of the same feel of their gameplay.  Unlike those games, each of your characters has a specific role on the team (that will eventually have meat to them than at present), which gives some heft to the strategy elements and options you have for proceeding.  At the moment you really only have two paths fleshed out.  You can either smash your way through everything with brute force, or you can use your Hacker to break into things, disable them stealthily, or take control of someone and use them as a distraction/key where the opportunity presents itself.  From what I've read it looks likein the future you'll also have your Infiltrator as an option for slipping in, with the rest of your team presumably as backup if that fails.Graphically it looks like Syndicate Wars and Bladerunner had a baby (this is a positive).  The UI you access on the street is probably the only part I'd say needs to be thrown out and replaced.  It's nearly impossible to change which weapon is being wielded or make out the icons.  I'd rather have a small icon to remind me which unit is which (they're in a fixed order you can't change anyways) and a big icon to indicate whether or not they're shaking an SMG at passers-by.  The characters also need work... though it's likely they are just placeholders.AI is hit-or-miss at this point.  Some enemy behavior is actually pretty realistic, and your units do usually follow your orders.  There are some issues with not firing from cover at an enemy who is further behind the same cover you are, the team's Infiltrator occassionally running 3 feet from an enemy to show him the sniper rifle he's being shot with, and agents sometimes getting locked into shooting the same corpse/empty space despite your pleas for them to return fire at someone who's killing them.The game really shines in letting you know there's direction.  The early missions showcase where the game might be heading.  In one mission, a jailbreak with multiple paths to success.  In another you're stealing tech to research it.  Along the way you might hack into some ATMs to fund your venture.  Then you rob or hack a bank, giving you a big score all at once or a slow, permanent flow of money that will eventually outweigh it.  Then you have to have your hacker hijack someone and use them as a key.At this point I'd recommend people who like being playtesters and want to fund this thing into completion give it a try.  I'd also recommend it for fans of Syndicate, its expansions, and Syndicate Wars, because you'll probably want to have some input on the game.  People with older PCs should check back later.  Anyone else should probably wait on buying it; understand that right now you're looking at about 3 - 4 hours to run out of game, not counting crashes.			"

												Final verdict: A fun game brought down heavily through mechanical issues. With enough patches and fixes, it'd be a gem. For now, it's hard to go mad about but still quite decent.Please note that this review is written while the game is still undergoing some development and you may be reading this after said patches and fixes are put in, making a lot of the complaints outdated. A multiplayer co-op mode is soon to released also.The general gist of the game is you're a team of cyberpunks looking to take down an evil megacorp, as usual. It's realtime strategy with 4 characters all of whom must be controlled manually. There is a pause function in the form of a character skill that slows time to 90%, which you gain by levelling up - an option when starting a new game is to have this skill fully levelled from the start which I chose. This allows you to take your time and play the game with more strategy involved than running away a lot of getting blown up.Overall your goals are to sneak or shoot your way into a fortress, get to the well protected door at the end then get outta there. This is pretty much all you'll be doing the whole game, but well made level design and a multitude of ways to reach and escape from your destination is what keeps things from ever being repetitive.Now that the concept of the game is explained, I'll keep the rest of the review as simple bullet points: THE GOOD:A pretty good 15-20 hours for the price. Quite simply, it was fun and there was quite a bit of it. This was with all side missions completed though some may take much longer to beat the game.Every area has multiple approaches, no obstacles cannot be overcome so long as you use the right tools. Or you can pay your way through, at times.Looks very good, excellent implementation of cyberpunk aesthetics and mechanics into the world, decent worldbuilding through logs/breifings, though some item descriptions break immersion a little.Never got bored, always had fun infiltrating despite it seeming like it'd get reptitive to do constant heists.Good change of pace from purely turn-based similar games released within the past few years such as shadowrun, if you're on a cyberpunk run. The game however has a lot more similarities to ones made many, many years ago that people have been clamouring for more of.Respawning on death instead of reloading a save led to longer play sessions of hours at a time. Enemies respawn over time but total progress isnt lost such as blown up doors, though they also refresh on quit and reload. Keep in mind you may spawn a lot of patrols that thenEnemy factions leading to infighting if you lead them to eachother is a nice touch, as are all the times you can hijack a turret or an enemy's head.Loot was always impactful when acquired, as were skills gained. It was nice to feel like I was becoming much more powerful, even if it did mean early on was way, way harder.THE BAD:Poor pathfinding, often inputs are unresponsive and characters (though this effects enemies too, just as often) shoot at walls/floors or get stuck pathing. Characters would often either not follow commands given, or do dumb things like shooting at cover rather than from it, which is deadly with heavy weapons equipped.Poor AI in general, both player and enemies, leads to a lot of necessary micromanagement and ways to exploit. Namely with grenades and verticality. PC's will not automatically fire back or run away when fired upon, all 4 characters must be controlled manually.Sub-60 FPS on-load, degrades over time with session, eventually becoming unplayable stuttering. Running on a GTX 970, i5 SSD system with latest drivers. Apparently this is a recent issue caused by a patch but sadly I had to deal with it the whole time.Difficulty curve in general out-of-balance due to avilability of gear, skills and upgrades being too low early on and massive late in the game. Enemies do become harder, but not smarter, and simply being able to heal/respawn-on-site or throw a grenade makes things massively easier. Stealth is necessary early on but later on you can go in guns blazing easily. Soldier abilities especially break the game, as do grenades as enemies don't respond to them very much.For a long period in the middle of the game you'll have a lot of money with nothing to spend it on. Then right near the end of the game you get a ton of interesting new items that you can only use for about an hour, makes me wish for a new game+.NITPICKS:Stealth/pacifist achievements are currently given incorrectly on loading saves so no reason to attempt them legitimately unless you simply enjoy the playstyle.Pause mode is strange as it slows the camera and is an ability reliant on energy and a single character being avilable. It is however very strong and makes the game much easier once you have healing items unlocked.Some parts repetitive, quests like laying down relay beacons or hacking ATMs. Rest of the game isn't however.XP/money gained over time rather than being a limited resource is weird, there are a lot of time-based costs unfitting to SP game. To clarify, you can farm XP just by sitting still while trespassing or killing patrols over and over, while money accumulates over time from hacked ATMs or in lump sums from missions or infiltrations. You can essentially idle in a good sneaking spot and come back to the game with a ton of levels and money. Don't do that though.Some missions did not give all listed rewards with no indication of how those rewards were lost. You can however expect to have missed information due to not paying for it in the briefing screen.No character model customisation, gotta hope the guys you hijack and clone for better stats dont look ugly.Ending was... something...I like the game and won't turn anyone away from it if they're interested, but understand that it's far from flawless. Mostly in the technical sense. I look forward to seeing what the devs do from now on, whether this will get DLC, a sequel, or whether they'll put out another series. I'd also like to mention that for a 5 person team, this game is amazing.			"

Early Access Review
								Although I reccomend this game, my reccomendation comes with the concept and the futur final product of the game rather then what it is in its current form. The concept is neat, a more free roam top down point and click with four unique heroes, a soldier, support,  hacker, and stealth operative. Each hero has unique abilities specific to their class, the support has passive aoe heal over time, the hacker can hack atms and hijack civilians to scope out areas, the soldier has a stoneskin ability which allows him to take massive damage, and the operative can stealth and sneak attack a single target. The missions are spread throughout the city which entail sneaking or shooting your way through heavily guarded facilities throughout the districts for various passive bonuses in the district and in some cases some upgradable gear to outfit your heroes. The majority of the missions also have an option to buy information which can give insight as well as bonuses in your favor.Being that the game is in the early access phase, i wouldn't recomend paying for the game as joining in any testing phase for any game is not only a privelage to the player, I view it as a service to the gaming companies as well. Being that we arent employees for five live studios one cannot expect to be paid to do their work for them which lets face it, that is what we do in beta phases for games, but at least allow a smaller community to be able to test the game without having to buy into it. Sattelite reign in its current state is filled with more bugs and incomplete objectives then most games typically have at this stage. I would think of it as more of a conceptual playtest demo thrown together to keep people satisfied with what they funded via kickstarter. Characters get stuck in the most random places, some of the missions are undefined in their explanations or downright impossible to complete, the auto pathing is horrendous, and the law system gets bugged at times to where your infamy never goes away in certain areas causing the cops to keep shooting you without being provoked or given reason.  Most of the features for the game are completely nonexistent, more specifically some of the mission rewards, data terminals which provide more insight into the wide array of city locations, and civilian descriptions which would make missions much less confusing. Most of the missions are more easily completed by shooting through them rather than sneaking, for which you do not gain any experience based rewards ruling out individual skills among the four heroes, useless.All of this in mind, as previously stated, the game is Conceptually one of the better top down games ive seen, conceptually. I am severely interested in seing a more finalized rendition of the game and had a frustrating amount of fun in the game as is, despite the fact that it definately needs some drastic improvement. I wouldnt suggest buying it until the game is more complete.			"

												Back in the golden days of computers, I used to play Syndicate all the time on my trusty AMiGA 500 (and 1200 later on). I remember seeing this game on some blog years ago, but kinda forgot all about it. This year, I noticed that I had a game called Satellite Reign in my inventory and decided to check it out and found out to my surprise that is was basically Syndicate 2016!  Sure, the camera angle might be a bit more zoomed in, and the cars drive around in circles, but it is pretty awesome, even without the Pause Button (that you can mod in from my understanding).I think it wasn't until hour 10 or so that I noticed that you could actually blow up a lot of stuff, and that lasers (pew pew!) will put trees on fire if hit enough.Rating: Good times, need sleep.

Get it - with dozens of equipment and possibilities in cyberpank future.It`s looking amazing, and in some moment you really need to work you brains and make a plan....ballictic/plasma/laser miniguns, drones, explosives, destroyable environment, taking remote control, infiltrator-ninja with remote connection to hacker (with proper equipment), time-slowing stims, cloning, augmentattion, invisibility...Awesome for me. Second really-really fine game of last year (first one is Elite Dangerous), 100/100.			"

												I'm really trying hard to love SR but I can't. The world is beautiful (and the artbook is great), soundtrack is amazing and atmosphere make oneself at home. But gameplay pacing breaks down everything for me.- my squad can't fire back, even if they're under fire. I have to baby sit them and manually assign targets every time- stealth is lacking, boring and it's really hard to understand if you'll be seen by enemy or not.- shooting is erratic, weapons fire without any impact- leveling up is weird: I seem to get most XP just from running round on enemy territory, not for killing/carrying missions- balance: after aquiring some upgrades/techs the game became ridiculously easy and boring- path tracing: very frequently my agents and enemies simpy shoot walls and can't hit one another- missions are mostly identical: get to specific door in secured area and then go backI had some fun in first hours but now unfortunately the game became a routine :<			"

												This game is Amazing! Admittedly I find early access difficult to support after a few bad experiences, I regret not buying this sooner!If you're a fan of Syndicate (1993) and Syndicate Wars, you'll love this! The game has everything you'd want from a tactical squad game, researchable weapons, gear, augmentations, skills for each of the four classes. Tactical gameplay and most of all choice! Want to go the pacifist route, the ninja silent killer route, or just blow a hole in the front gate and mow down everything in your way... Why not a mix of them all!All the classes are well defined and have their own benefits, the Support character can scan wire systems so Sec Cams can be taken offline, The hacker can take over systems or people, these are a few you've seen in the videos, I could tell you about many more cool skills, but its best you find these out yourself, some will make you have that warm feeling inside as you figure out cool new ways to Assassinate people or tactics that will make your squad a crack Commando team.I could go on for pages, about how the music is cool, the graphics are great and the neon really feels like Cyberpunk and Bladerunner. How some of the missions I've done have been tense chases to get the prototype weapon safe. Or just more about how this game nails the feeling of being in a living city. It has minor things that I'd love to see change, but this is due to resources, hopefully future titles will have more than weapons change on your characters, though every clone switch gives you a new look and colours can be set. The Augmentation screen is gone, while I miss it the game doesn't suffer for it, and the devs have said they wanted to add more content instead due to time limitations. I'm sure it will come back!On top of the game, what I've seen are dedicated devs, I'm picky with devs because so many don't support their communities, 5Lives are a good team and really want to make this game great, they have mentioned about how extra features may hopefully make it post release. These guys are Great!To close it off the game extras such as the Novel and Art book are great, I recommend anyone with a kindle read the Novel, its only 150 pages but is written very well with some interesting twists, it has the odd word out of place but doesn't distract too much. I can't recommend this game enough, enjoy it!			"

												I don't understand why I like this game so much. Satellite Reign 1.02 is buggy and just slightly unfinished - especially in the final district and ultimate mission. Optimal play in combat requires reflexes I don't have, but fortunately most combat doesn't need to be optimal. Some design decisions are baffling - such as the way stims work and how 'fire at will' involves a-click and having your agents move out of cover. You also can't really lose until the last mission, which just bugs out if you 'lose'.That said, the game is probably the most fun I've played all year. It's not replayable like Invisible Inc, but the shenanigans you can get up to are amazing, as are the explosions when you decide to go loud or get spotted. Hijacking makes a triumphant return from the original Syndicate series, and is more useful than ever. There's nothing quite like mind controlling a gangster to kill his own boss, then run through a military compound shooting out all the cameras so your team can infiltrate silently from the OTHER SIDE of the commotion. Throw in remote explosives, plasma cannons and the best grenades in ages and you have a winner.I enjoyed the original Syndicate but never really played it to completion. I never touched Syndicate Wars. I hated the Commandos series. Yet I love Satellite Reign.I'm really looking forward to a sequel that addresses the remaining issues and gives us more to play with.

												Satellite Reign is a tactical squad based game that focus on the efforts of a shadow corporation in a cyberpunk world that wants to take down the world's current business leader: Dracogenics enterprises. It is played much like the syndicate game and has a pleasant 'X-Com' feel to it, but many design choices hinder this game in many ways.PROS:+Huge and beautiful cyberpunk multilayered city filled with lore that you can explore. Easily the most beautiful environment I've seen in any video-game.+Combat is fun enough, as should it be since it is the bread and butter of this game, even if it does lack quite a bit of content.+Many ways to approach the execution of many missions: do you want to kick the front door or try to sneak in, get what you need and bail?+Each agent feels different and specialized, with a progression system that, although not inovative in any way, doesn't take away from the game either in my opinion.+The agents skills all work together to bring a lot of pain to your enemies, making your 4-men squad really formidable force if you can tap into all of their potential. More of that on the Cons section.+The research is easily the best aspect of the game for me, since the game gives loot to you in the form of prototypes. That means that you will have to counter-engineer that sexy flamethrower before using it. Some players will find it annoying though.The combat is, at first glance, great. You can feel the corporate espionage theme when you go after your mission's objective inside your enemies facilities, and the combat initially feels awesome, if a little clunky. But as soon as you leave the very early game, you start to see many things that could use some improvement or, in some cases, a complete rework, that were hidden due to the lack of challenge from the initial areas.CONS:-All 4 agents are controlled individually, requiring great speed with mouse and hotkeys controls from the player, not unlike games like star craft. However, hotkeys are also shared between many abilities, meaning that some skills and/or items can't be used reliably through the hotkeys.-Cover system is absolutely horrendous for the lack of reliable control you have over your units, making you lose ammo by shooting something that is hidden behind a huge wall and won't be getting out of its cover any time soon. Even if realistic, it increases exponentially the micromanagement needed to unnecessary levels.-Speaking about ammo, all the primary weapons can run out of it during combat. Again, due to lack of reliable control over your agents' aiming, you might run out of ammo on all your agents before taking down your opponents, effectively downgrading your force to pistols for the remainder of the mission, unless you have the Ammo Pack item.-Enemies can call for reinforcements. While good (and needed for the game's challenge) in itself, you may find yourself overrun from all sides, as enemies that are on the other side of a wall will keep calling for back up. That wouldn't be so bad if the next factor wouldn't come into play with it.-You can aggro enemies that are far away from your line of sight. Those enemies in turn will aggro more enemies that are out of your line of sight and then call for reinforcements, creating a huge domino effect that is more dependent on your luck than skill. If there aren't too many enemies in certain radius beyond your line of sight, than you will win. If there are, you will lose.-Weapons use the ""Jo-Ken-Po"" system, where one type of weapon beats one type of defense, but is horrible at passing through other types of defenses. Plasma weaponry, for example, has immense bonuses against armor, but can't even touch energy shields. The opposite is true for laser weapons, bonuses against shields, penalties against armor.-Talking about defenses, both shields and armor are literraly the same thing: more HP, the only difference being that shields are hit first, than armor, and than finally your health.-This next topic has been the subject of much discussion in the forums, but many of the problems that I had with this game would dissapear if this feature existed: tactical pause. While the Support agent has the stim packs ability, which slows down time considerably, that ability is dependant on too many factors to make it work as a real tactical pause: the support has to be alive, the support has to have stamina, and the skill has a lengthy cooldown for its purpose.In short, this game does not try too much to please the players that hate micromanagement like me, while people that really loves RTS games but want something more low scale and/or cyberpunk might like this game. Additionaly, the weapons and defenses are really unimaginative and just feel like a copy paste of each other, just with different numbers instead of being something that allows the player to customise his experience.This game is fun overall and has a really different feel to it since there is almost nothing cyberpunk-related in gaming these days, but it could be so much more with just some tweaking. 4-6/10 for those who want this type of game but with tactical pause dependiong on how crucial you feel the feature is for this types of games, and 7.5/10 for those with the skills to micromanage their agents. This game has a lot of potential though, and the devs seem to be listening, so if we have some luck, we might have a real gem here in the next months, hence the recommendation.			"

												Backed on Kickstarter, buying the heir to Syndicate ad talk and such. The end result doesn't really resemble Syndicate at all beyond some similarities in details like team size, the overall cyberpunk theme and research. The touted emergent gameplay ends up being little more than annoyingly random guard patrols and the whole game feels poorly tested and was released too soon from early access. Had to play it through since I had invested in it in many ways, but can't recommend it unless the bugs are fixed at least.+Good music+Pretty graphics...-...which come at a high price. You'd think GTX 970 is enough for this kind of game for all the bells and whistles but it's not even close-Horrid loading times-Loads of bugs such as missing mission rewards, glitched NPC movement etc. even after early access-Endlessly respawning enemies, cameras, security doors and so on-Game seems to heavily favor stealthing as combat against superior firepower and numbers seems suicidal-Tends to sucks as a stealth game due to the random enemy patrols and patrol compositions-Crummy assassination mechanics: you have to shoot people in the neck from point blank range even with a sniper rifle to kill them quickly-The weapon variety for soft targets, armored targets and shielded targets feel forced and most of the weapons are not very satisfying with default settings. For example, a missile launcher may create a big beautiful boom but doesn't seem to take down doors nor can it kill many of the enemies even with two hits.-Bad player character AI and control problems. I've lost count how many times I've ordered a silent kill and the agent has done nothing but run up to the enemy.-A few mission descriptions are woefully lacking and some of the gameplay mechanics are explained rather poorly			"

INTRODUCTION""Satellite Reign is much like the spiritual successor to Syndicate"" they said.I followed this game here on steam and had it on my wishlist for a while, then bought it in a sale and installed it right away, but I did not start it.Why, you ask? Because I was afraid to be disappointed.I played the original Syndicate in 1997 as a kid and I loved it to bits. I replayed it so often that I knew every map like the back of my hand. Last weekend, I was forced to cancel all my plans because of a flu and so I said to myself, lets find out if the critics are right about this one. And boy oh boy did Satellite Reign deliver!REVIEWThe game is indeed best described as a spiritual successor to Syndicate. The world, the lore, the style, the music and the tech is much the same. The gameplay is similar but much refined which I want to elaborate. GameplayWhile many of Syndicate's features can be found in Satellite Reign, their implementation makes for a better gameplay.The biggest difference between the two is that there is no hard cut between the missions and briefing phases. Syndicate sent you on missions but every time you reached your goals you got to the extraction point and found yourself and your agents in a safe, far away briefing overview. In Satellite Reign, you get your briefing on the go, while your agents are still in the thick of enemy cartel controlled terrain. You can get briefed, buy additional intel, research tech or outfit your agents all while ""in mission"".This might seem like a small cosmetic change, but it changes the whole feeling of the pace. While in Syndicate you sometimes escaped into the extraction zone, while being shot at by dozens of gauss guns and it didn't matter, because the next screen was a safe place far away, Satellite Reign keeps you in the game and it feels much more interesting and immersive.But there is more. There are some key elements that were added to the Syndicate formula that make Satellite Reign even better. Classes Skills CloningWhile in Syndicate all your agents were identical and only what equipment you gave them made them take on a certain role, Satellite Reign has introduced classes.ClassesYou start with a Soldier which is the tank of your team who also can dish out good peak damage.You get a Support-class agent next, who can scan the environment and augument the whole team.You have a Hacker next, who can hack terminals, ATMs, and take control of civilians, enemy agents or drones.And you get the Infiltrator who can cloak, stealthily kill with a sword and use ziplines without additional tech.This leads us toSkillsAll your agents can be upgraded in Health and Weapon Proficiency, as well as learn to carry more Items.Your Soldier can learn  Rage - which for a short time amplifies all damage he causes. Draw Fire - which for a short time causes all enemies to concentrate fire on him while granting him damage reduction. Harden - which for a short time grants him damage reduction at the expense of movement speed. Explosive Specialist - which increases carry capacity for explosives as well as damage and radius of explosions. Hardwiring - Ability to short circuit energy couplings to disable doors, security cameras or turrets.Your Support can learn World scan - which gives you information about individuals in range, wiring of tech around the world as well as other useful info Field Medic - which heals your team continuously. Team Stims - which effectively slows time around you for a short time. Leadership - which gives your whole team more health, energy and reduces cooldown of skills.Your Hacker can learn Hijack - which lets you take over the minds of civilians or, with higher level, enemy agents and drones. Hack - lets you hack terminals and ATMs Drone Puppeteer - which lets you summon 1-3 personal drones that fight on your side (you have to buy and equip them first) Mark target - which lets all of your team focus on one target while the damage it recieves gets amplified additionally.Your Infiltrator can learn Melee Attack - basically a one hit kill with a sword against most targets. Higher levels increase the damage to meke it a one hit against higher end enemies. Cloak - which makes you invisible until your energy runs out. Master Assassin - Increases sniper rifle range, damage and accuracy. Also passively increases the agents speed. Master Thief - which grants more and more money from infiltrating facilities. Level one adds the ability to use ziplines without ever falling. Level two gives access to high vents without the need for Leg augumentations.So with all these skills there is much more tactics involved, some tactics are slow and safe, some are bold and reckless.And some are very risky and your agents might die. In Syndicate if you took your Persuadatron into town, you had an unlimited supply of bodies to fuel your war. Whenever one of your agents died, you lost a bit of money for the cybernetic implants, but after a couple of missions money was plentiful and you did not care about your death toll.Satellite Reign is similar, but different.When your agents die, ther is a short countdown during which you can pay money to revive (reclone) them right away or wait till the countdown reaches zero and you can send a fresh clone of the deceased agent in for free. But it still comes in at a price.CloningEvery individual in Satellite Reign has stats and every agent does as well.There is a baseline for the stats: Movement Speed Health Health Regeneration Weapon AimEvery time you reclone your agents, they degrade and get worse in one or all of these stats.It is a good tactic early on to Hijack enemy agents, which have better stats than the average civilian and send them back to cloning. Then clone your Soldier, Support, Hacker and Infiltrator into these bodies with better health, speed and aim.But when you find a nice individual with +55 health +20% speed and +15% aim, you think twice before you let him die.This is a nice game mechanic to balance out the free of charge revive and it adds another layer to the immersion where you find yourself thinking in the same perverted way about human bodies like these syndicates do - as just assets to add to your company.ConclusionThis game is a jewel. I only played it for a weekend and I found myself googling if there will be a sequel or expansion to it, because I already fear that I will play through it too fast.If you loved Syndicate, you must play this. Don't worry, you won't be disappointed. "

												 This is a fun game with lots of optional stealth choices.  It took me 32 hrs to complete every available mission, and while many missions are somewhat repetative (And the ending of the story is very weak), the fun is in the subtlety.  While two mission's objectives might be exactly the same, you need to look around the map and figure out the ideal way to slip in and out, (unless you want to just brute force it.)  I enjoyed the game, and will likely buy a sequal if they ever decide to make one.   "

Early Access Review
								I'm not not going to lie, this game is currently in a very, very early stage. The car traffic system is buggy, pathfinding, especially with stairs and doors goes wonky, some data terminals don't work and most importantly, the save/ load system niether saves nor loads. So it says a lot that I'd still recommend this game. The city is wonderful, full of character and just begs to be explored. The gameplay feels right. You can storm the the gates or stealth your way in. Need a civilian to be distraction? That's possible, too. Crucially, it feels like an evolution of Syndicate - it nails the feel and then builds on it. In short if you love Syndicate, you'll adore this. Buy it, play it once, then lock it away until it's finished. You won't be disappointed			"

								This is how an Early Access Game should be.Played it as soon as it became available on Steam, and, though unpolished, it was fun from the very start.The developers continue to focus on making the gameplay very enjoyable, but the looks of the game (both graphics and artistic direction) could stand on their own - a bit of Blade Runner, a bit of Ghost in the Shell.My advice is: get it. Not only does it look very promising, but it already is an enjoyable game.Edit 2015-06-26: The crash has been fixed the same day (!!!) I wrote about this bug in my review:""My only complaint is that the game currently crashes on profile log-in on my Debian GNU/Linux; it didn't before, and I'm confident it will stop doing so closer to release.""

As a fan of the original Syndicate games. this has been a long time coming.For Pre-Alpha, it is looking very promising, aside from the gorgeous visuals and Syndicate inspired music, the research is there, the cyberpunk feels, the guns, the indiscriminate murder of possibly innocent civilians.I'll definitely be checking it out as it progresses.

The game is still under development so there will be a few bugs and glitches to encounter but so far so good a very enjoyable early access game to play.I wonder if they will introduce a multiplay aspect?

												Right, well this is one of the games I enjoyed following around and stuff, since I'm always on the lookout for a good Cyberpunk game and I'll be perfectly honest I have never played the Syndicate series and I am not a kickstarter backer of this game. Well that being said here are my pros, cons and misc.Pros:-Good graphics-Light game-Play it your way(Go loud if you want to go loud, be quiet if you want to be quiet etc...)-Interesting methode of devellopment and resource collecting-Lots and lots of gear-Decent soundtrack-Good artworkCons:-Still has some considerable bugs-Tutorial is bad(My advice, look for a guide that explains you everything you need to know)-No customisation options(I would have LOVED a possibility to customise your squad like in XCom)-No view cones for infiltration(Well you can manage to learn the enemy sight range but... Makes it kind of tricky)Misc:-NEON LIGHTS EVERYWHERE!!!!-FREAKY HAIRDOS!!!!-Lots and lots of rain-TrenchcoatsWell, in my opinion this is a good game, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys an unconventional RTS, however, if you buy this game, check online for a decent beginners guide because the tutorial is that aweful.

												This is more than Syndicate.The environment with rain and neon, the music and the darkness, it all adds to an excellent Cyberpunk themed, Blade Runner inspired setting.The gameplay is not easy, but with time you start getting the hang of it. I'm not a big fun of stealth so I usually just go guns blazing with the help of some mind controlled enemies.The variety of equipment and abilities also helps to diversify the missions you'll have to accomplish to progress in-game.The developers have continuously supported the game, they added multiplayer co-op and even slow motion to help those more accustomed with turned based games.

												I played Syndicate on the Amiga when it was new and loved it, mostly because of the explosions. The game never really pulled off that cyberpunk feel but remained a good squad based RPG for the time. Satellite Reign is the same sort of game as Syndicate and it nails the Cyberpunk feel. The maps, the characters the text and corporations all just work and work well. They really make it feel like a Cyberpunk world in ways games like Shadow run totally failed to achieve.It plays like an open world game, only it is actually a large level based game that you unlock new areas as you progress, all part of the same world map but definitely not open. Still it is about roaming around and choosing your next target your self. Which is the core of most open ended games.The game play is fairly straight forward, break in to a company compound, steal money, prototypes etc, research them and upgrade your squad and do it all again. You can raid the same company twice if you like, the company seems to restock some of its loot over time but so far I have not gotten the rich rewards that I got after the first raid when revisiting the same company. As you progress you unlock new areas of the city to explore and raid for loot and other valuables, doing missions, levelling up, adding skills to your squad of 4 men. Aside from the slightly clunky interface which you do get use too, this game is a very good game.I cannot help but feel I am playing the original Syndicate again on the old Amiga, the difference being, Satelite Reign does a better job and because its new, it feels fresh and exciting. Strongly recommended.			"

												                Satellite Reign is in a paradoxical state of being a disappointing game despite being pretty good. Its extensive potential is sadly (once again) limited by an indie development which didn’t allow squeezing more quality because of a tight budget and so another great opportunity goes away just partially explored. Its gameplay mechanics feel unpolished and incomplete at times while the need of more production value is visible at every corner. Despite being flawed, Satellite Reign stays strong with its liberty of action reinforced by great level design and in depth mechanics which allow the players to approach the game in their own unique style.                The strains of indie development might stop Satellite Reign from achieving the greatness it deserves, but surely don’t stop it from being a cyberpunk delight that the fans of this setting are going to consume despite its problems.Pros:+ Amazing neon cyberpunkish style graphics+ Great level design+ Suitable music+ In depth character progression and research system+ Plenty of tactical options+ Interesting game mechanics+ UI designCons:- Repetitive missions- Problematic combat system- Sluggish controls- Performance problems- The story needs way more development- The city feels lifeless- Lots of bugsRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2015/11/satellite-reign-review.html "

												Just not my cup of tea, but perhaps my own fault. The gameplay isn't bad, there are quite a few strategic options to get into and out of a base and how to deal with enemies. You can research new weapons and gadgets, level up your 4 soldiers (1 of each class, i.e. a sort of ""tank"", a hacker, a sniper and a tech guy or whatever, I forgot the details). Each of them has unique strengths and weaknesses and you can control each one individually, i.e. you can just invade an enemy base with a stealth ops guy if you're good enough of you'll try and blast your way through. You earn money at the end of missions usually and by hacking ATMs. Even the graphics are relatively pretty and flashy. The main issue I have with the game, however, is the world and the narrative. The world is bland. Yes there's lots of neon and lots of people walking around, but that's it...they're not doing anything, they're milling around and are just doodads imho. Same goes for the enemies. These lack character. The whole world feels...""empty"", which brings me to narrative: There isn't really much to speak of. Everything is text-based, ok, no biggie, BUT there's not really much going on. You get thrown into the game right away (without being able to enter options, which is annoying as hell, then someone tells you to fight the bad corps and that's really it. You then proceed along a ""main story path"" and can do ""side quests"" to gain xp, money and prototypes for use or research. There's just no motivation to continue on. I finished the first ""zone"" and entered another one (you can go to 2 more afterwards), but it's just more of the same. Nothing really changes: tap ATMs, infiltrate enemy bases, level up, read boring background stuff. That is my biggest gripe with the game. If you're looking for something similar to Shadowrun in Real time, this is not it. Shadowrun Returns and the 2 other recent games had soul, their world was INTERESTING, the characters were each unique and had a purpose and you pretty much chose how the game goes down, but Satellite Reign is a boring husk in my opinion. If you want some semi-challenging and open-worldy RTS squad action and that's all you're looking for, go get it then.			"

												Syndicate returns. Game has some bugs, and control issues at times, but nothing you cannot get used to. Outstanding game for such a small dev team (5 people afaik). The city is gorgeous, and while individual assets repeat, the overall layout never looks identical. The story is mostly conveyed trough data logs, however they are written really well. It is fun reading them. The game's style and aesthetics are really spot on. The whole world presents itself as a blend of Shadowrun and Syndicate. Gameplay wise, you have to struggle a bit to get the hang. It can be frustrating at times, especially at the start. Once you figured out how stuff works and how to avoid getting into certain-death situations, the gameplay starts to shine. There is some tactical Commandos gameplay there, where you approach with stealth and hit & run. Though if you are strong enough, and♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan, all out guns blazing secnarios are just as likely to lead to success. Given that you know what you are doing. It can get quite hectic at times, and a fast and precise mouse-hand should be part of your skillset if you favor brute force.In terms of character development you have a limited but quite nicely paced progression. Limited in a way that you do not have extensive skill trees or extremely exotic abilities. The classes stay mainly inside their intented function. However, breaking into compounds to gain new equipment is a big part of the game, giving you another layer of development through gear, ranging from sniper rifles to flamethrowers or grenades. A third layer of development is the bionic augmentation.To me, this game is a gem. A bit unpolished around the edges, but with a vibrant soul and a great atmosphere.			"

								This game goes way further than Syndicate Wars. It's just pure awesomeness. You've got 4 very different classes, each one having its specific abilities, allowing you to chose between infiltration tactics. A the moment, the game still has a whole bunch of bugs but keep in mind it's a pre-alpha version. I bet the game will be epic when the full version will be released.			"

YouTube™ Video: Satellite Reign Review - The Successor of Syndicate Wars is Here 

			Views: 40,409		

			5 Lives Studios strategy based action game Satellite Reign comes to PC in its complete form after months of residing in Steam Early Access.		

Satellite Reign, is a worthy successor to the classic Syndicate Wars as it does a far better job than the first person shooter EA made a few years back. The game's looks are impressive and the gameplay whilst a little repetitive is engaging enough to draw you in for hours at a time. It has to be said, this isn't a quick game and does require some time investment to get the most out of it. It's also not a flawless experience where at times agents can get stuck in doors or their pathing leaves little to be desired as they try to enter restricted areas rather than going around - so some baby sitting is required at times. Sadly the removal of vehicles which were present in the earlier builds slows the pacing down a bit, making navigation a little tiresome, although the fast travel and no loading between areas makes up for it in many ways. As a game for action strategy fans, this is well worth checking out due to its engrossing structure and fine presentation. There's a lot of fun to be had here for those with time and patience, although if anything, the game's lush visuals alone are worth the price of entry. "

												Given to me as an Xmas gift.  I was told it'd remind me of good ole Bullfrog's Syndicate.  Loved that game and not at all surprisingly I enjoyed playing this one through too.  Thankfully your characters intuitive pathfinding is somewhat improved compared to syndicate however I won't lie, it could do with a bit more work.  There are lots of skills to spend your experience on and plenty of utilities to make your team more versatile.  The expanding city map was great and the difficulty curve wasn't too challenging.  It seems to be a game that favours tactics and stealth rather than brute force but if you have your tactics and gear just right then you can just about get away with brute force if you keep an ammo crate handy nearby for infinite grenades.For me the augmentations and weapons were a bit of a let down.  I was hoping for more of everything but alas it was not to be.  By end game you're wanting a squad that will be immune to poison and heavy armoured, or fast legs that can jump into those high vents but you're generally stuck with one class of augmentation.  The biggest let down though, the size of the game... It could have done with having multiple cities on a world map rather than just the one and perhaps a bit more financial management rather than the ATM hack that once in place just steamrolls cash and makes purchasing every upgrade something I considered too easy.  Maybe they'll make a Satellite Reign 2 at some point and remedy these things?  Who knows eh?			"

								This game is one of the best squad based tactics games out there. It has fantastic graphics, an open world city, lots of way to play through, and the game was made in such a way that you don't ever feel like you are being forced to do a mission you don't want, as there are so many missions to choose from, and you can do them in any order you like. Additionally, the developers are very active, and constantly improving the game as well as fixing any bugs. However, do note that as of now, you would require a rather beefy computer to run this game on maximum settings. I am getting 40-50 frames per second on a GTX 980M, i7 4710HQ, and 16GB of RAM. Apart from that, this game is really solid and very fun.			"

												Almost has it, but too many problems to be great.Pros:- Great style, huge fan of cyberpunk stuff.- Sneaking through areas feels great.Cons:- Enemies scale (like in ES4: Oblivion, etc). This is such a terrible design choice, it never works well.- Destroying equipment (like security cameras), does not persist when you reload your save.- Pathing is pretty badOther- You can cheese drones by going to hack, aborting it, then the drone paths to you in an 'alerted' state, you can do this to clear entire areas of drones.

												I love it.I played the original game Syndicate years ago, and then Syndicate Wars a little later. I loved it. When I read the title ... my heart was pumping, could it be real? And yes, it was, a continuation of that game.The missions have the same feeling, the same intensity. They require you to have a playing style and keep with it, no split personality leadership. It's a hard game, but in the right way.The only thing I regret is not buying it earlier.			"

								Great game, specially if you have played Sydndicate / Syndicate wars you will fall in love with it.  Be warned however that  this is quite unstable in Alpha. I have spent fair amount of hours on both PC and Mac versions, in more recent updates both have become highly unstable :-(   Unless you have the patience and are happy restarting the app almost every 5 minutes I would suggest to wait for Beta releae or even the final release. Game crashes seem to be quite random :-( I'm  gong to stop playing for a while and wait for a more stable release. Great work though and congratulations so far, can't wait to see the final product.Update:  2/8/15There have been constant updates of this game being rolled out which is great news, but sadly the stability issues has not been resolved. As soon as you try to move your team around the map, the game will freez. In some ways the game playability has dropped to a few seconds in comparison to a few mintues :-( I did try this on both windows and mac  with latest update and results were same. Would love to see the final product but at this point cant even give this game a fair try out. Few of my friends have also recently purchaced this but have also reported same issues. They all use different spec windows PC.To ensure I had every thing right, I have reinstalled my system recently [yes I backed every thing up]  and tried Sattelite Reign on clean system, I am afraide no luck. So much potential, I am confident that developers will pull this off, thought release date is getting closer.So we wait and see.			"

								Another happy purchase :)This game is everything Syndicate was plus more, this is very sweet.Just recently I picked up Syndicate series to replay them as I was longing for those Good Old Games, only to find this ""remake"" to be such a great jewel hidden in the haystack, heck I wouldn't have even known about this game, if it were not due the Steam Summer Sale 2015 :pFor an alpha product it's very nicely done already, there are a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing serious.The only thing I'd like them to improve is the graphics, currently it's a bit blurry even at the Ultimate graphics settings, by blurry i mean the graphics texture are not sharp, either that, or perhaps lower the neon colour a bit, make it a little bit more dark like in the Syndicate series.At the moment the screens are too busy, too much stuff all over the screen, specially the rain or water effect, it's not quite getting the proper effect, or perhaps just too many ripples making things looks fuzzy on the floor, dry areas are not so bad.Anyway, looking forward to the full game release.

												For those unfamiliar with Syndicate, Satellite Reign is sort of like a real-time version of XCOM, except instead of aliens you're fighting private military types and instead of regularly missing on 95% shots you have a reasonable chance of hitting your targets.Right from the start, you're given free rei(g)n to go and do as you wish. There's a big cyberpunk city to explore and plenty of missions to complete, plus a bunch of stuff to do during the downtime like assimilating new recruits, hacking ATMs for funds and researching new upgrades and weapons for your guys.Though there's a lot to do, there are a few problems with the above which make the game bland or frustrating at times.  All of the best toys can't be researched until near the end of the game (read: you probably won't get a chance to use the rocket launcher) and the cloning system, while an interesting plot device, takes away from the tension of being behind enemy lines by making all of your men disposable. The lack of variety in the missions can make them kind of a grind. Steal this, hack this, assasinate them... without a meaty plot, it all blends into an indistinguishable mush after awhile. The difficulty curve is way off as well, meaning that while you'll initially be struggling to complete missions, by the end you'll be so OP that you can march in anywhere with guns blazing. There's less incentive to think up clever tactics when you can use the same method every single time and succeed, which sells the game's decent tactical options short.Even taking all of that into account, I must say that I really enjoyed this game a lot. There's something distinctly satisfying about using a group of brainwashed soldiers to create a distraction or sneaking your Infiltrator in and out of a compound unnoticed. The class-specific skills, when levelled up, add some nice options for sneaking in your entire team, if need be. Or if you prefer brute force, there are dozens of weapons, implants and upgrades to choose from, so you'll never be short of options when fine-tuning your team.Lastly, the art style is absolutely gorgeous. The perpetual rain on the neon-soaked streets is both soothing and ominous and the designs for the various denizens you'll encounter are just fantastic.As a sidenote, the ending is insane. Not good insane or bad insane, just insane. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a plot twist before which has made me so confused about whether to feel shocked or furious. Well played, 5 Lives, well played.Not without its flaws but, in my opinion, a worthy spiritual successor to Syndicate.			"

												This game is not done, however I would recomend it anyway. All games will have problems and this one is not an exception. Things can be glitchy or downright broken... BUT I love it anyway, fun gameplay and intersting mechanics give you a game that is a bit patchy in places but great fun to play. When I say patchy, it is small things that show that it's still in developement, without those I would be surprised to find that this game would still be in developement. The main things that are lacking from this game are simple quality of life issues.GameplayThe main thing i like about this game is that you can go stealth or loud. If you fail at the escape part of stealth it doesnt matter too much as long as you get your people moving out quickly. If you are spotted, it is not the end of the world (somthing i enjoy allot), kill all the witnisses and you wont have a problem.Loud is a different story, it is harder than stealth and therefore not recomended but still fun to do. It is not a deathwish and i love that, fireing a bullet wont send an army after you. As long as you stop them calling reinforcements (not too much of a problem if you are paying attention) you can survive the encounter without a sweat. Beware of nearby enemies though, if you shoot near a lot of bad guys you will pay for it. What you can do is create a bubble of silence, allowing you to kill in the area without a worry of other people noticing.A thing that needs to be added is an overwatch ability, sometimes when stealthing into a base I will leave my teamates, what I would like is that they dont just stand there and die. AI is a large problem in the game, one of the things that really breaks the fun. That said I am not having much of a problem with it. If your troops arent positioned right and cant have a LOS on the target you want them to shoot they will sometimes just shoot at a wall, wasting their bullets. Ammo is not a real problem in this game, I have never had a time where my units are all out of bullets and you have a slot for secondaries that has an infinite pool.There is a way to slow time but it slows camera movement as well. Micromanagement is something you will have to learn if you want to play this game. Although the micro management is not particularly hard.Whilst death feels like a failiure the game doesnt punish you much for it, somthing I enjoy allot. There is a minor loss of xp or money (your choice) but it is not the end of the world if your badasses get shot to bits on the fieldThis game is STUNNING, love the graphics, Nuff said.In conclusion, the AI and lack of quality of life improvements are the only thing that I have a problem with in this game. This will not be for everybody though, I had to give it time at the start, little options at the start make it a bad intro to the game, this changes dramatically later with your characters gaining an individual skill type and role. I would recomend this to anyone who likes RTS and cyberpunk. As it is I think that the price is a bit high but constant updates mean that soon this game will be more than worth the £20 you have to pay for it. If you can ignore the games sins you will find a fun and rewarding experence.			"

												Syndicate is one of my earliest PC Gaming memories.This game isn't exactly the same as those original Syndicate titles, but it captures the feeling of my memories for those games.I'm having a blast with this game, and I can't wait to play through it again with different strategies.If you enjoyed any of the Syndicate games, I can't recommend this enough.

Early Access Review
								Although I would recommend this game you need to me the right type of player to appreciate it. To start with it looks great and has the feel of the original Syndicate. Its really a good achievement. I find the controls good, but you need to learn some of keyboard shortcuts so you can do some things quickly well things go wrong. Supposedly the game is only a few weeks from release but it still has a number of bugs. The sound and music and good and the overall presentation is top quality. However there are issues with the game play.The balance of the game is unforgiving in the early parts of the game. I'm still in the first district and have only researched a few extra items yet I'm facing guards with far too much armour. The only way to play the game in the beginning is to use stealth which should be fun. However the guard routes are erratic, the guards move across large areas meaning it takes too long to work out guard patterns. I thought it was a nice touch when another AI unit ran in to an area and the guards shot at them, however this messed up all the guard movement pattern and makes the game just too difficult. There is no indication of guard visions range. They carry torches which should be a nice indication of range and would be a good way to telegraph such information however they can see way further than the touch light would indicate. Due the lack of armour and weapons my team have, the easiest way to play this game is try and sneak in, and if you get discovered just run out. Your team can take a lot of damage and so can just run past the guards, flee the area and hide. If you try and stand and fight, the team will get wiped out. There should be a lot less guards with shorter vision ranges and smaller patrol routes so they can be plotted correctly. That is the standard design pattern for this type of game and its been well done by other games so I'm not sure why the game designers would try and do something different.I'm sure at later stages of the game, with a heavily armed and augmented team then combat will be much easier but at the start the guards in the first district are just too touch. Stealth and running away is only strategy that really works. However stealth is still too unforgiving due to the vision ranges of the guards. I would understand if my team was running around but if they are ducked down in a dark area then even a guard behind them should need to get very close to detect them, especially in the early parts of the game when you are learning how the game works. As there is no way to save the game during a mission they do need to be made easier. I think there needs to be  a difficulty level setting for those players who want the play-die-repeat challenge and those players who want to play for the story line. Currently the game is just too frustrating for the later type of players.If you like to complete games and go through the entire story-line prepared to get frustrated with the game and be prepared to put in a lot of hours. If you are old enough to remember the original Syndicate you probably have your own kids by now and will find you just don't have the spare time this game requires. The balancing issue may get fixed but then again may not. As the developers are an indie studio I do wonder how much time they have put into balancing and the designers have been playing this game for well over a year now and will get very good at it and may have balanced the game so they find it a chalange. Hopefully they will be able to put in the time required to balance the game for us mere mortals.			"

												On the surface, Satellite Reign appears to be a four-unit RTS with RPG elements. Kind of like taking something like XCOM or the recent Shadowrun games and turning it real time. Maybe something like a cyberpunk infinity engine RPG.Well it's not that at all.Satellite Reign is a real time stealth strategy game with RPG leveling mechanics. In general, you do not want to get into firefights. Particularly early on, where you're more likely to get your units killed than anything else if you alert the enemies, alarms start blaring, and you decide to stand and fight.Hell, the combat isn't even very good once you've got agents strong enough to just murder everything in sight like a squad of action movie heroes. The micromanagement it takes is quite cumbersome. In general, none of your units will target enemies without you specifically telling them to do so, and telling them to shoot someone outside of their line of sight often ends with your unit standing outside of cover. This means that if you want to send units around  the field taking up postions, you have to tell each agent individually their new target whenever an enemy goes down. Frankly, combat ends up being a matter of taking all of your agents and focusing fire on one enemy at a time, cover be damned, because frankly, I couldn't be arsed to deal with cover if my agents were just going to run into the open on their own if an enemy just happens to be standing in a slightly inconvenient spot.Where the game shines is planning. Lots and lots of planning. Execution, too, of course. Before entering a hostile facility, I spent a lot of time scouting the exterior, trying to find the best path in. I would hijack one of the enemy units, and use it to scout out the entire enemy facility to figure out common patrol routes, camera postions, generator postions, locations of useful vents, etc.. While doing this I planned where my agents would enter, what path they would take to the target, and what path they would use to excape. If all went well, there would be minimal combat.Coming up with a plan and excuting it flawlessly was extremely gratifying. Even when my plans failed, it was a lot of fun trying to figure out how to get my agents out alive (early to mid game anyway, in the endgame I just shot everything if I got caught).  There's a lot to love about Satellite Reign. It's a fantastic isometric stealth strategy game set in a gorgeous cyberpunk world. It's a very easy game to recommend. Just don't buy it expecting a deep combat tactics experience, because you won't find that here.			"

												I tried for 3 hours to like this game. I really really tried. I don't usually write reviews but I have to say that I do not recommend this game. There are a lot of really cool Ideas that the devs (for the most part) implemented well. The sad thing is that combat & stealth are just not fun and are often frustrating.  -Stealth- You cannot tell when you are going to be inside a guards vision. -Combat- No pause command function. Now this would be ok if the game wasn't such an exercise in micro management. Your agents WILL NOT return fire when fired upon and there is no ""aggressive"" stance for them to pick thier own targets. Basically this means the game becomes a speed click fest. I did not have fun. I wanted to.			"

												I've only played for 76 minutes so far, so these are just my first impressions.I like it.The controls could be tweaked a bit, for instance a hotkey to allow dragging the view would be nice instead of having to keep pressing the middle mouse button and full 360 degress rotation would also be nice, since sometimes it's hard to see what's going on behind a building.Also some things were not really clear to me, which gave me a little trouble in the beginning, but after I found out what the problem was it was very easy to avoid in the future. A little thing such as being unable to attack the guard in the tutorial bit because I got my agent deselected and I didn't understood why he would response to my commands anymore. Also the ""suspicious"" sub-system could do with a little more explaining.As for playing, it feels open-worldy to me. There is a big city, divided in districts which you need to unlock. Then there are missions, some of which are optional and others that are story missions. It appears that doing optional missions will give you and advantage.The city has a good atmosphere, there are a lot of people walking around and cars driving.Right now I've just completed the beacons mission, which will give you more optional missions as a result and will give you a nice walk around the first district.And there seems to be lots to do.

												I followed this game since it was fundraising, and voted to greenlight it on Steam as I played Syndicate (the game its themed after) a TON.  After almost an hour in this game I think the original Syndicate had way more content, fun, and freedom then this game, which is sad I wanted to love it.  It seems to me all the time went into making the game word pretty and the level design, AI, and missons were put on the back bench.  A real let down for me personally as its pretty much on rails how you complete your mission.  The civilian AI is nothing to get excited about and the world does not draw you in and feel alive.  No competing factions to worry about along with your target its just you VS the security forces.  Every mission objective is behind a door you have to get in and then get out.  More focus on clicking on terminals and runnning from one to the next.  Just a big disappointment so if your a former Syndicate fan like myself and thinking this is the next coming don't even bother right now.			"

												Overall I can recommend this game, it is very fun to play for the most part. Yet there are some issues with it, which to some extent are ruining gameplay.The major flaw of the game for me is economy. You get small amounts of credits from hacked ATMs in real time, which means you have to wait to buy toys you want. For most part of the game it is not a problem, because you are waiting by doing missions and you also get bigger amounts of one time money from them. The issue appears in the end game, when you run out of almost all the missions and you are left with only the hardest. Most likely it is not a problem for a stealth player, but if like me you like to go guns blazing, then it is tremendously important to have the best gear and team setup available. Sadly such team setup is incredibly expensive. I would love to have all the things I want exactly in this moment of my playthrough, where I will be doing last missions, but I don't have the money for it, so I have to wait till I get it, or replay older missions for very small amounts of money (which is basically pure boring grinding). There are still many toys I could get for my agents, but I am far from having money to get them. On the other hand I could just wait for the money by doing nothing at all instead of grinding, but the issue here is that the game pauses itself automatically after some time of player inactivity, which is most likely a protection against exploiting hacked ATMs mechanic.Therefore I ended up in a situation where I almost completely lost my motivation to finish the game, which for me is a sign of either bad game design or unfinished game. In case of Satellite Reign it is the latter. It can clearly be seen in both, item variety and item balancing. In short there are plenty useless items in the game, like for example implants version 1 - why have v.1 when you can get better version 2 later? It is clear waste of money. Another example is there are three splash damage end game weapons: plasma, laser and explosive. They work in the same way (like a rocket launcher) and the difference lies in their shield/armor/health damages, where plasma has slightly bigger damage against armor, laser has slightly bigger damage against both shields/health and explosive has balanced damage on all defenses. It is like this with every weapon type in the game, but in case of weapons with splash damage the explosive seems to be the best (at least in my opinion), where I cannot say the same thing about miniguns, because energy miniguns are much better, with probably laser being the best. Balancing is only one thing as I said earlier, another is variety and there is zero variety in end game plasma, laser, explosive splash damage weapons, because they work in exact same way. It is literally copy-paste, same issue with miniguns.To summarize this is still a very fun game to play even with its flaws, but it really could use more work and it would also be great to see more content being added to it.

												You are compromised! Enemies spotted your Soldier trying to hardwire an automatic door, and are rushing to cover while firing assault rifles wildly. Your Support and Hacker are caught flat-footed in the open, leaving you to order them into cover to return fire. You activate your Hacker's attack drones to give you an edge, and watch in glee as quad-rotor robots fly up to blast your attackers with energy bolts of sapphire death.Now the alarm status has gone up. The pressured guards radio for backup, alarm klaxons blare throughout the compound, and you hear rushed combat chatter and the sound of cargo doors sliding open. Your Infiltrator spots another group of much tougher guards on the approach and, desperate to buy time, you have her take a sniper shot.Their officer is knocked on his♥♥♥♥♥by a kinetic impactor round, stunning him. While his fellows sprint to cover and start returning fire, your Soldier has now managed to open the door -- but now you realize that your Infiltrator is too far away to rejoin the group in time. You frantically order your Hacker and Support through, to cover your Soldier from the other end while he locks the door behind him to deter pursuit, even though they've taken quite a few scratches themselves from the brief firefight.But by now, you've been made. The alert goes up even further as your corporate mercenary enemies realize they're dealing with individuals who are heavily armed and extremely dangerous. Desperate to protect company secrets, they authorize the use of extreme force, and soon you hear the sound of a bipedal mechanized unit stomping towards you from the other end of the base.Will you get your Infiltrator to safety in time? Perhaps you could have her zipline over open space and use her cloaking device, bringing her close enough to stealthily pick off a few enemies with melee assassination strikes. Did you bring enough firepower to deal with this operation, though? Should you hide and wait for a more opportune time? Do you exhaust your supply of frag grenades to blast a way to your objective? What are you going to do about your Support operative's low health???Choices. Satellite Reign is all about choices, and making them under extreme duress, because this is a tactical squad-based RPG that does not have a mid-battle pause button. The closest you will ever get is time dilation (slowdown), and that's from one of your Support operative's skills, so you'd better keep his Energy level high enough to use it! What I love about this game is that everything can go to hell in the blink of an eye, so now you actually HAVE to be smart and plan your movements carefully. You are up against superior numbers, and sometimes superior firepower. This game rewards you for being quick to think and quicker to act, and punishes you for getting caught with your agents out of cover or for having no backup plan.Satellite Reign now has multiplayer co-op that is in open beta (as of the date of this review), which allows different players to take control of any number of the four agents available for play in a given game session. This gives it some solid extra replayability, I think.Is the game worth it to buy? Well, it will likely take you around 30 hours to beat, less if you already know what you're doing. I think that the rewards from playing smart and successfully passing the tests of quick planning and execution that the game throws at you are well worth it; in fact, some of the best experiences in any tactical game I've played since the new XCOM: Enemy Unknown series. Satellite Reign can get a little repetitive late-game, though, I'll admit, and stealth is a little... too powerful, especially once you can afford to get every agent a cloaking device. But yes, I'd say Satellite Reign is very worth it, with or without a sale discount.			"

												The game recreates Neuromancer-esque cyberpunk vibes with its generous servings of neon lights, grey skies, and perpetually rain-slicked streets. The gameplay is fun and unquestionably worth the price of admission (especially on sale). Nevertheless, there are some negative aspects worth noting:- Pathfinding system breaks regularly. Breaking your commands into multiple stages via shift-clicking does not help; your agents (and even the AI) will regularly get stuck on walls and twirl around in circles.- Agents sometimes require inconvenient amounts of micromanagement. For example, there is no proper ""fire at will"" command, and agents will stand still until you explicitly instruct them to attack. There is a time dilation-type skill (Team Stims) which helps mitigate this somewhat by turning the game into turn-based lite.- You will quickly realize that the city, while atmospheric and well-crafted, is simply a facade and filler between the restricted compounds that make up the rest of the game. It feels like some opportunity was wasted to give the city more life. E.g., the majority of objectives are given to you as soon as you enter a city quadrant for the first time, instead of say, distributing questgivers throughout the city and giving the player more reason to explore.- There's a narrow period of equilibrium in the game's difficulty where your agents' equipment and skills (and your own skills) match up with the challenges the game presents you, and each agent brings something unique to the table. But, eventually (like, after all your agents are able to cloak and hack), you'll pretty much be able to steamroll through the zones even with a single agent.Nevertheless, definitely worth picking up! I highly recommend listening to the Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon soundtrack while playing.			"

Early Access Review
								This game for me is what I've been waiting for for many years.My love of Syndicate Wars got a little silly. I had the Playstation version and would sit in my bedroom for days exploring the city blocks and trying to find hidden items.Looking past the current limitations of the Alpha release, what we should end up with at the end of Beta is a gloriously cybergoth cityscape with a multitude of options as to how to take on each scenario.That's the real strengh of the new class system. It gives you a flexible tool set to play the game your way. That's the sort of gameplay you find in Half Life 2 or Skyrim and it should make for a very replayable experience.I'm personally having a ball creating mayhem in the district that's been released so far. Cops are still rather dumb but its still fairly challenging... and I'm yet to get through all the missions currently available...Things I'm really hoping for in the final release:Some kind of mission editor (Oh please oh please cos the community will go mad with it)I'd like to see the players actions having more of a visible effect on the city districts. At the moment damage is repaired after a period of time.More random events... to breath life into the cities population...Recommended buy... but if you're not as crazy as me you may want to wait until Beta to pick this up as its still not very well optimised and frame rate drops are common right now.

												I came from the age where it there was Syndicate and Syndicate Wars. Loved it to bits until my games just couldn't load anymore due to bad media/old age.then there was the Syndicate reboot (kinda turned me off due to the FPS ishness) which is meh in my book.And then there was Satellite Reign, and I fell in love again all over again.Call it nostalgia or what you will, the fact that this game still resonates years on after the 1993 release speaks volumes of how original it was at that period in gaming history and how it has evolved into what it is in its current state.Yes, the Unity engine isn't exactly well optimized for multi-threading, yes the game has it's flaws (consencutive loads in rapid succession may cause a CTD, weird AI behavior, erratic pathing) but by god I like how they moved from back then till now.Pros+ Spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars+ options to pursue your objectives + multiple paths to reach an end point+ tone/style fits the era / atmosphere on the world the game is based on+ a thinking game - where going loud isn't a very good idea to start somethingCons- Unity engine optimization needs work- rapid reloading of saved games may cause CTD- some actions of the agents tend to be erratic at times- that damned robo dog.Verdict : 7.5/10 will hijack robo dog and send him into the poisonous gas again.

												BEAT! 35 hoursSatellite Reign, for those who have never play the syndicate series, could best be described as Dawn of War 2 meets Deus Ex in an open world with a retro-future look.  You play with 4 soldiers - each with their own skills and abilities.  As they level up, you get points to unlock or upgrade class-specific abilities.  You take on missions which (for the most part)  involve infiltrating complex ""fotresses"" (essentially) with the main objective to be to reach a door.  This is made complicated by the need to be stealthy - especially in early game.  Get spotted, and reinforcements will come to flush you out.  Missions can also involve escort missions, finding crates in protected areas, and a few others.There is also a research system. On missions, you will be stealing prototypes of weapons, augments (think Deus Ex), and Gear.  You need to spend money researching the prototype to be able to build multiple of them for your squad. So the loop is get prototype->research it->buy at least 2 of them.  Once bought, you can swap in any purchased items for any character.  Pros:- Fun open world. It feels like a real place.- Beautiful- Good progression systems.- Challanging gameplay. The objective may be clear, but getting there is a fun experiment.- Each character has their own unique purpose.- Lots of gear, weapons, items.- Everyone dying on a missions doesnt mean game over. You keep your xp. You just respawn and try again (unless playing ironman).Cons:- It might be a bit slow paced for those looking for an action game.- Can feel a little repetitive.  This is partially countered by new gear that makes doing similar things easier/more exciting/differently.- Not much if the idea fits your tastes. - (MAY BE A NEG) - Your soldiers wont lift a hand without you telling them to. Neutral:- Enemy AI tends to give up kinda easy. This ends up being a positive, because otherwise the game would be stupidly hard. They pursue you enough to make it a challange.-It would be rather easy to almost ignore the upgrade and research system.  For better or worse.  If you do research and such, there is a TON to research so having some direction (when you do) is necessary.Pretty fun. Not without its flaws, but they didnt prevent me from playing the game or want me to stop playing.			"

I enjoy the real time gameplay as it makes things feel that much more frantic and serious when you get trapped in a bad position and are trying to fight your way out.The game is far from perfect I found it a bit hard to figure out at first as the tutorial does an ok job but doesnt guide you very well on what the next step.  However this might be intentional as the whole game is very open and you are just given a set of missions you can complete in any order you prefer.  as im not super far into the game yet I cant say its a must buy at $30 but if you see it in a steam sale I think its definatly worth giving a try if you enjoy the cyberpunk style and want to experience more of it.

Must have game for all the RTT loversSatellite Reign's story, unsurprisingly, like most of the other rtt games, is indeed rather austere looking & doesn't really do a lot to impress us. No cut scene or lack of scope for acting, no dialogues or interaction from & among the protagonists, only text based narration like the old school games may tick off the interest of some people but Satellite Reign protrudes itself from that dilemma & becomes something special.What really hooks you up & get things going for this game is the gameplay elements & the mesmerizingly dark neon themed futuristic city; rumbling & soaring with the lives of the people & armed patrols alike. Four agents, controlled by the player at the same time, which may get convoluted at first but after getting a hang out of their skills, their peregrination from one point to another within the city will rain havoc & destruction. Well, that is if you choose so. You can decide to complete a mission by going completly gun blazingly hot or be a little bit oblique in your tactics & take them out from the dark, in utter silence. Whatever you do, none shall remain alive!The game offers vast character customization. You can upgrade the skills of each of the four agents. Numerous amounts of augmentation parts, gears & weapons are there to compliment the fighting style that you prefer.Also did I mention that it has co-op story mode multiplayer featuring upto 4 players?! It's humongously satisfying!!			"

It has a very similar feel with the steam punk theme, and even more to do than the original. It does feel a bit more challenging with an almost FPS flavor to it, how you have to coordinate your team sometimes. Overall I highly recommend it for anyone that enjoyed the original game, and if you haven't take a look, it is a unique game compared to the strategy/action releases of the past decade			"

Satellite Reign is an engaging and stylish homage to the classic Syndicate. It includes all the improvements you'd expect from the last 20 years of game design theory: A high-contrast neon cityscape replaces the pixelated and slightly washed-out look of the original; your operatives now have classes rather than being interchangeable; the game is set in a single sprawling, explorable location rather than being a series of separate maps; and, of course, it now has multiplayer. Far from marring the original, Satellite Reign feels like the game Syndicate would have been if it were conceived with the advantages of 2010s design theory and hardware. Highly recommended to fans of the original, or anybody who likes cyberpunk ambience and realtime squad-based action.			"

Early Access Review
								Okay, I never wright reviews for anything so here is my best attempt.I spent around an hour with this game and I can tell you now it defiently offers a fun experince. The atmosphere is near impeccable (I think that how you spell it :/ ) and it really has the bones of a solid tactical squad based sci-fi game. I would even go as far to say it improves some, but not all, of Syndicate's mechanics. I do caution anyone who wants to by this game that it is still in an earlly stage of development and that you will encounter many MANY bugs for the time being.if I had to rate this game as it stands now I would give it an 76/100 and slowly rising :]			"

												Is an interesting concept but flawed by one absoultely infuriating issue, the AI is so weak. My characters just stand with their hands in their pockets while enemy soldiers fill them with lead. Issuing commands ALWAYS causes them to stop, the delay costing me many hours of headache when what would've been a perfect run is derailed. No stance choices (like retialate when fired upon) which doesn't help the already weak AI issue. I'll give credit to the difficulity of the game, they did make the world seem super controlled and monitored, too bad the 'saviors' of the city have been spending their time eating lead chips and picking their noses... while being fired upon by a random cop who's IQ outweighs the entire group you're suppose to control.

												Dear 5 Lives Team,Thank you for this great game!I bought it when it was still in early access and after a few tries I put it aside, because I was already convinced that it would become a good final product.Now that I've played it through, I must say this assumption was correct.For everyone who's into tactical games with a taste of puzzling and everyone that likes cyberpunkish scenarios, this is a must have. I used to play Syndicate and Syndicate Wars (I have the original package proudly hanging on my ""wall of game"") and this is a more than worthy successor.The graphics are beautiful: dark, rainy alleys and colorful strip malls filled with citizens in futuristic fashion. Impressive weapon effects. And I was able to import my cyberpunk logo into the game to use it for my company. Loved that!The controls were well thought out, enabling quick reactions and easy use of special abbilties in combat situations.The sound effects and music match the game very well, they could have been a little more bold and rumbling. I played the Syndicate Wars and Blade Runner soundtracks in the background- great atmosphere!Don't I have anything to criticize? Well, in this very complex city the characters, especially mission-relevant persons added to the team, sometimes had problems finding their way. A few times they got stuck between doors. Not so bad.I will be watching out for your future projects, godspeed!			"

												This game is placed in by beloved Cyberpunk setting! I have played in for 23 hours now but I have to say at the beginning it is rather confusing. You barely get into the mechanics at first, its like ""Oh whats this and wait... how can I do that"". Though after some try and error and learning by doing you get into it fast. You can play the missions in different styles like brute and simply bombing your way in or you got stealth and take out the guys silently or you are the pacifist then you rather hack and stealh you way through strong protected castles.Pros:+Cyberpunk setting+beautiful graphics and details+controll of team with each different strengths and weaknesses+you can change outfit and lvl up each character+interesting world and setup+stealth n stealth weapons+NPCS n enemies react to explosions, gunshots and my even encounter innocent people+Updates and patches by devs!Neg:-missing sounds. Music is fine though but no people talking no loud city spots. Doesn't feal immersive at most times-you are lost at the start of this game-a bit repetative after some time-missions can be sooo hard-the AI can be strange sometimes-a bit buggy (haven't played since the new updates though)At the moment it doesn't feel finished like if they are waiting for community reaction. The devs are still working on this game and are really listening to the players. Still I hope they will add more voices and sounds, a good example is the game: ""Dex"". The city feels alive even its only 2D and beautiful pixel style. I would love to have such a soundset put into Satellite Regin.  If you are a cyberpunk fan this game is a must-have.			"

								*** First off remember this is PRE-ALPHA****If you're looking for a finished game,keep your money and wait six months,if you want a chance to play pre-alpha and watch what will surely be an awesome game than maybe this is for you.SR looks beautiful and still has a long way to go,I'm happy to contribute to what is sure to be an awesome project to revive the SW series,this game will be a show stopper,but it's not there yet,don't buy this expecting a finished product and then leave a bad review,this game still has at least 6 months of development left,with bugs to fix and LOTS of new features to add.The hallmark of the SW series was the cyberpunk dystopian atmosphere and unique plot lines,with immersive stategic real-time gameplay,already I can see all those elements,and was delighted to here they even got the original guy from the SW series for the music/atmospheric soundscape .So far so good,keep up the good work guys.

												the controls are not very tight so it is frustrating to play.it is real time no pause, needing to control 4 people in the manner and complexity of ""xcom turn based games"" which becomes nearly impossible.especially since the controls are not very tight you cant rotate the camera very much and it results in not being able to fast and effective get your people to the spot you want them on.the tilt of the camera as well is a problem because it is hard to decide where characters los exactly is etc.the game seems to be well made besides that, but without good controls i couldnt be bothered playing it more since frustating controls and camera is a no sale for me :)if they fix it i will try the game again ^^			"

												This is the spiritual successor to ""Syndicate"" an old-school 90's game. I never played Syndicate but I really like this. Pros: top-down, squad-based, real-time, tactical stealth and combat, in a near-future Cyber Punk setting classes have very distinct roles and abilities, most of which are quite useful controls are like Baldur's Gate, but without the tactical pause, and less control of units to make up for lack of ""tactical pause"" there is a ""bullet time"" skill that slows down time graphics are great, the city is HUGE, and there are no loading screens emergent gameplay in a giant sand-box city awesome music and atmosphereCons: I'd give my left nut for a tactical pause key I'd give my right nut for a ""fire from position"" key due to massive city and no load screens, the engine isn't kind to lower end machinesDraw: 100% game play, 0% roleplay, no real character development or choices besides skill points or which mission to do nextDespite the fairly minor drawbacks, the game is pretty damn compelling and fun. I didn't try multiplayer. Finished the game in 32 hours with 88% completion rate.			"

												Can't recommend in current state. Main problem is that you have to play stealth as combat is not an option and the stealth itself is broken. If you go with regular combat enemies will swarm from everywhere infinitely no matter what you do.Stealth in itself is broken as the cone of vision of enemies and cameras is unknown and sometimes random - one time you walk next to a guy and he doesn't see you, another he spots you on a roof of 4 store building while you're ducking behind a low wall. Enemies and cameras have a cone of vision shown by lights they use but it does not reflect the actual cone. Also sometimes when you order a stealth kill your character will not do it - just because.Also it's weird that killing a regular enemy grants you few times more experience than completing a mission. So in the end the game pretty much forces you to use stealth and to stealth-kill everyone you meet. The experience for kills is not divinded among the team as far as I can see, so you end up sending you hacker alone in the enemy teritory to pull some headshots and thus get the exp needed to develop your hacking skills (hacking does not grant you exp or it's so small that not noticable).AI is broken both for your characters and NCPs - sometimes they spin in place, freeze or start shooting at walls rather than go round the corner before shooting.I find the UI cluttered and not clear, especially inventory, map and quest log screens - lots of unnecessary clicking and vague descriptions (like you have a description of an item but no items are selected - so what does it describe?). It's also not helpful that you don't know which missions are main line and which are side quests. No indication to mission difficulty make it really hard to pick something at the start as you keep hitting walls everywhere. Also it would seem there is no plot in the game? Map is barely readable for me as well.On the good side though, I like the visuals and a general atmosphere of the game. Soundtrack is also very good and fits perfectly with the game. It has a number of interesting mechanics like research and cloning but it takes a while to figure out how they work.If they at least fix combat / stealth and AI, I'll be happy to get back to it and give it a go one more time.

												Satellite Reign is a little masterpiece combining game-designs from very old games, reviving those great ideas with  excellent improvements. Titles like ""Syndicate"" and ""Commandos"" came immediatly to my mind after playing Satellite Reign for a few hours. The game obviously has been made with a lot of love into the level design and the riddles how to solve the missions. For those that dont like riddles, brute force is an option too. I havnt tried Multiplayer until yet, but so far i am enjoying this title a lot and can only recommend it to people that like this mixture of RTS and RPG with economy and spiced some good action.			"

												Why didn't I start this game ages ago?Satellite Reign is a spiritual successor to Syndicate, a classic strategy game from the 90s. SR creates an impressive open city that is fun to explore walk around in. You can zoom the camera all the way down and get a good look at the advertisements on the buildings and the dystopia of cyber street life.The open city is split into 4 districts each with relays (fast travel, gear stations) and ATMs which can be hacked to increase your steady income. In each district are guarded areas to infiltrate in order to get bonuses to the district. And the regular story missions will take you into these areas to proceed through the game. These guarded areas make the game. It truly is free form in nature with  multiple ways to sneak in or shoot your way in. I once got my infiltrator on a high roof and sniped every guard in the place without being seen. Another complex had my infiltrator stuck behind enemy lines with no easy way out, and my other 3 guys went through HELL to try to get her out only to have my entire team wipe during ex-filtration. On the way back into the complex to get the blueprints I found an air duct that lead to a much easier way in. Since there is little penalty for death, you are free to try something, fail, and then try something new. There is a sense of satisfaction of finding the right plan of attack, getting in and getting out with no problems. Or even getting in quietly, getting the objective, only to get into a massive firefight on the way out, then getting everyone out alive. It's like beating a hard boss in Dark Souls but I felt this way after every mission. Each mission was its own story in a way.  SR is a real time strategy game, with an option to turn on ""team stims"" which turns on bullet time so you can get your bearings and issue commands. I was finding new stuff to do in the game right up the every end when I discovered that hijacking was very powerful. I recommend this game. But you need to go in with an open mind. It's not for everyone. I actually bought this a long time ago, but only got into it recently. Once I started playing, I was hooked tho. So your experience might be different.			"

												A stealth RTS with 4 (and at times more) units that have their own skills that focuses on get-in-hit-target-get-out gameplay. I've never played the Syndicate game that people keep comparing Satellite Reign to, but as someone who's played tabletop RPGs, Satellite Reign to me is essentially Shadowrunning: The Game. No, it's not Shadowrun because there's no magic, the story isn't anything special, and it's not turn-based, but it's hard not to compare SR to SR when you case a joint and bribe a janitor for information before you sneak in to assassinate some wage slave that upset a rival corp to get some creds to buy new ware.Pros:+ Gets the cyberpunk feel down perfectly. From the terminal memos, to the megacorporation subterfuge, to the rain, to the clothing, to the neon.+ Excellent gameplay. Difficult but fair. Mechanically sound. Works no matter how you decide to play it.+ Open world. Not all games can pull off an open world setting, but it fits like a glove for Satellite Reign, and SR wears it well. Choose what missions you do, if you do them, and how you do them. Is this a sneaking mission? Is stealth optional? You decide!+ Death penalties are small. The only downside of dying is clone degradation, but you can easily grab new clone stock.+ Lots of customization for characters.+ Multiplayer support for up to 4 people. Part of the difficulty is controlling four different agents, and being able to micro them at a high enough level is made easier if you play with friends.+ Music and sound are good. Nothing outstanding and nothing poor. Music hits the right tension moments, and sound design works.Cons:- Unpolished in the sense that the game occasionally bugs out. Usually for me, characters just get stuck inside objects along walls. It's frustrating to be seven minutes into a sneaking mission and then someone gets spotted because they clipped through a pipe, and the only way out is death. Multiplayer is occasionally buggy in various ways, like lag during a gunfight. There are some other bugs as well. I can't judge this too harshly because this game was developed by five people, but it's still a negative.- Game mechanics a little bit unintuitive. Dead guard bodies don't alert anyone, disappearing guards don't cause alerts, smashing drones with a katanta makes a loud noise over your speakers but nobody else hears it or notices, drones will immediately start shooting at you, but guards will investigate the drone's gunshot noises instead of what the drone is shooting at, you can't cloak if you've been spotted, and other such nitpicks.- Unoptimised. You might experience poor performance even on decent machines.- Very minimal story. The comparison to Shadowrun is most evident here: you're a group of runners on one long shadowrun, and that's pretty much it. There's a few snippets of story here and there, but they don't matter and I was not compelled to care.Meh:? Strange AI behavior that both does and does not make sense and may or may not be intentional. More funny than anything else, but I felt it was worth a mention. One time I hardwired a door to a corporation compound open, and the city patrol went inside. The compound guards thought the patrol were intruders and a gunfight ensued. This happened at another compound later, and the city guard didn't know they were doing anything wrong. Another time, a guard investigated a dead civilian body after my agents fled the scene and thought a nearby bystander was responsible. Yet another time, I was going through the district scanner, and the door closed behind me while my agents were being scanned. The civilians in the scanner queue started walking around the closed door and went into a secure area where they were immediately gunned down. ? The game is repetitive because it focuses on one particular game mode: get-in-hit-target-get-out. This isn't in the Con section because the game doesn't get boring because each compound is unique and has different approaches. There's probably not a lot of replayability because part of the appeal of this type of game is finding the weak spots in security. Once you've figured out a way in, it will work most of the time. You could think of some ways to handicap yourself, such as no murders, but the game won't enforce it.? Long up-front loading time, but no loading time during the game. I'll take this one as ""mostly positive.""Verdict:Recommended. A very solid game with a lot of game to it, but a bit homogeneous and rough around the edges. I look forward to possible mission packs that offer new locations or better story, or a sequel.Edit: having finished the game 100% and played with friends, I have to commend the game (again) on allowing either the sneaky approach, or the ""stealth is optional"" approach. It's not often enough that games allow both to be equally effective. Of note, this does add a fair bit of replayability to the game. I also felt like the last mission in the game was a lot more polished, with better music and a better integration of story into gameplay. A great capstone to the experience, and makes me excited for 5 Lives Studios' future work.			"

												Do note that I played this game mainly while I had no access to internet. The estimated time I spent on this game is around 30-40+ hours.Gameplay wise I will say that it is quite fun. I spent quite a lot of my time while not playing thinking about it. It is a game that makes you think and plan before going in, though there are times where you'll need to think on the spot when things didn't go as plan or when you misplaned.Pros:-Each team members felt needed, they don't seemed totally unnessary.-Enemey AI is pretty great, it is able to react realistically most of the time. Not stupid ai nor map hack ai, just right.Cons:-A few game breaking bugs that could be solved by reloading. Encountered 3 of them in my whole playthrough.--Not sure if pathfinding failed or collision failed, but i managed to glitch through the ground once.--Another glitched through the wall where it should be inaccessible, allowing my characters to be stuck there and got murdered by the onslught of enemies, unable to escape :<--Escaping into a corner that should be accessible, but unable to get out of it afterwards(nothing could be seen blocking)-Pathfinding again, for when stealth killing enemies. Sometimes the character will stop at one spot and just twitch, unable to find which path is better to reach the enemy.			"

								When I heard this was in development, and who was involved, I had to donate to it. I played the old Syndicate games, I'm a big Ghost in the Shell fan, and this looked like everything good and right with both of them...Damn am I glad I did. Syndicate was brilliant. Syndicate Wars was epic. Then, EA became a large, corrupt organisation, just like the previous antagonists (and released a crappy shooter under the Syndicate title). Then this little group (5 Lives) came along and kicked their asses WITH THIS.This makes Satellite Reign a new, amazing ""Syndicate"" game *within the original Syndicate*.If the final boss turns out to be Keyser Söze my brain will fall out of my ear.

												Backed in KS and waited until last week to play. What a game! Just finished it and had a blast.I won't talk about syndicate, although I was a huge fan. This game takes Syndicate to a whole new level. You walk around the city carrying out missions. Admittedly the things you can do in the city is limited but that is not really a problem, because the game is strong in where it counts. The Missions. There are so many ways to pull off a mission... What you will do depends on your play style.  Each base you raid is well thought off and how you upgrade your agents determine which paths are open to you. Speaking of agents, there are tons of skills, augments, gear, and weapons to customize your team to fit your playstyle. I invested a lot of points on the hacker and the hijacked soldiers of rival corporations provided me with pretty strong clones to base my agents off. I have seen in places that the story was not all that enticing. I think it was not so much the scenario but its presentation that made it inaccessible. I like reading, thus finding and reading every last log entry/mission dossier was something I enjoyed. Still not every one may bother and only the main mission has VO. I had an idea what was going on since I read every last line, still the surprise ending caught me by surprise... Rabbit is a better guy than he lets out :)			"

												the game is supposed to be a spiritual successor to the PS1 game Syndicate and Syndicate Wars and i feel this game is that. It's a 3rd person, Isometric, cover based shooter, in where your team of humans, over the course of the game, end up turning into cyborgs and where you go from ballistic ammo to lasers to plasma weapons.The game plays very well in regards to commands and path finding, i've come across a few issues where my team thought that running through a poisoned area into a locked a door was a faster method than going around the building but over all, pretty solid.The team is split up into 4 members: the solider, the support, the hacker, and the infiltrator. The solider can carry heavy weapons, has the most hp and gets skills of doing more damage, taking less damage, and getting aggro. the support can scan the world showing where wires lead (so you can disable doors or cameras), scan civilian and enemy stats, locate targets for missions, etc. He is also the medic and has skills to raise the party's HP, Energy, and regens for both. The Hacker can hack into doors and cameras allowing your team to get into areas, can hack ATMs for you to get money, and can hijack (mind control) civilians and baddies alike (as well as drones). he also gets skills to summon a few drones of his own. The Infiltrator is your melee/sniper, he can access high to reach places and has a personal cloaking device.The game is an open world game where after doing missions, you can buy upgrades for your team but for every successful mission, the baddies also improve their gear. It's because of this, i find the game to suffer a bit though, because the game doesn't stop. If you're in enemy territory, the alarms get raised and an infinite amount of baddies spawn thus making running and gunning a really bad idea. as (for all, most) missions require you to run into these territories and infiltrate a building, the sniper (with this cloaking) turns into the most over powered class of the game...really fast. most missions are normally him running through the area while the rest of the team hide somewhere.Combat is real time and if you turned on the option of pause (default to D key....) time slows down enough for you to issue specif orders to your team. however, they also give you the assassinate ability which allows you to one shot anyone making the starting pistol the best weapon of the game. The weapons you get are all highly fun to use, but as stated earlier, if you're going to run in guns blazing, expect to die.Overall, i'd easily give this game an 8.5 - 9. it has some issues but is still pretty solid			"

												For anyone that's a fan of the old Syndicate series (not the FPS from a few years ago, which I refused to play), this game is going to feel very nostalgic. I bought the early access earlier this year, and though I enjoyed it, I stopped playing so the game would feel ""fresh"" when it launched. I started playing again early this week, and just finished it today.The environment is very immersive and dynamic. Most of the terrain is destructable, much to my surprise. I found out on accident when using a short barricade as cover under heavy gunfire - so that was fun and welcome.Pros:-The gameplay is only as repetitive as you make it. You're at liberty to sneak, hack, or blast your way through to an objective. All of which are fun.-It's as story heavy as you want. While just crusing through the gameplay won't yield much in story, if you take the time to enjoy the game you learn more about the background of various NPC's and events that are happening or have happenned.- The entire game immerses you in a Cyberpunk setting. In game visuals, music, and sounds don't leave room for gray area. There's no doubt about the setting your playing in. It's not just another sci-fi game. It's Cyberpunk. Even the menu UI's immerse you into this genre.- Funny easter eggs refferencing other media across science fiction, most of which inspired the cyberpunk genre.-Very customizable characters. Many comibinations of equipment provide for almost limitless possibilities - this is only limitted by each of your party members classes, but even then not limitted to the point where a player feels confined to predetermined roles.-The autosave helped a lot. I have a little boy who is very curious about computer buttons who nearly cost me a few hours of progres, bless his heart.Cons:- Balance in character advancement. For the first 70% of the game, character advancement sort of trickles in terms of acquiring gear. During the last leg of the game, characters start advancing by leaps and bounds, but it takes considerable time and resources to achieve this equipment - sometimes forcing the player to ""idle"" for no other reason to acquire  end game equipment. It's only my first playthrough, so maybe I've missed something in the proccess. (I'm also not a big fan of reading guides on my first playthrough in a game, I like flying blind)- Pathing and movement functions flawlessly 99% of the time. The last 1% of the time a mobile might get stuck on a corner of a static object. This proved to get a little annoying when I absolutely needed one of my agents to move in a very precise way at a very precise time. This wasn't unique to PC's, but also NPC's. Though helpful in ensuring an easy kill, it wasn't as fun or rewarding as besting an unimpeded mobile. It would have been nice if there was some sort of course correction implemented. This was most frustrating when a vital NPC would get stuck inside a static mesh, or in a door transition.- The game might be too short. I think I'm only saying this because I really, really, enjoyed the game and I didn't want it to end.Personal Gripes:While I know the kickstarter didn't reach it's multiplayer stretch goal, I'd looooove a multiplayer function. Syndicate multiplayer was one of my favorite multiplayer experiences, and I think it could only be improved on in Satellite Reign. I'd even be willing to back an expansion that only offered a multiplayer function. Please 5Lives, consider this. "

								Fantastic cyberpunk atmosphere, art, and an immersive environment. ""Open-world"" and ""emergent gameplay"" in the description -- these are for real.1. Run up to the front gate. Get in a shootout. Have to retreat.2. Sneak inside. Set off alarm. Get killed by drones while trying to escape.3. Steal a car and drive past security. Hide inside the complex.4. Blow up a generator to kill the lights and security cameras. Sneak around assassinating guards and completing objectives. Walk out a side entrance like nothing happened.Gameplay is real-time tactics like Commandos or Fallout Tactics, but there are no loading screens, briefings, or linear campaign. This is also not a rougelike, platformer, or minecraft clone so if you're bored of those (like I am) you will have fun with this.I haven't played the full story yet but the devs have laid a lot of promising foundation and I'm excited to see where they take it.

												A game of interesting ideas.  I'm not sure there is quite enough meat on the bone for the price, but then there are economies of scale in videogame development.  (my hour count is inflated by my tendancy to fall asleep at random times and places)It's more about strategy then execution - you have a number of toolboxes with disparate and overlapping parts.Each agent has their own skills, and then there are a weapons, gear, and augments with their own effects.  I found my strategy evolving with each new skill, augment, or gear option.  It also pays to look over your target areas - plan your path of entry and exit.Because it is a game of strategy, I don't really want to tell anyone ""how to play"" - figuring that out is the game.But there are some frequent complaints that I want to address.""No pause""  There is a pause - it's a skill the support gets.

I would suggest grabbing all the relays when you get to a new area and then carefully look through your available targets.""Syndicate wasn't about stealth..."" The game doesn't have to be about stealth.  Initially your options are limited, and you have to work with the tools you have, but again - look at your targets and the available awards.

I would appreciate a 'defend position' command or Fire-at-will toggle.  There is an attack-move command, logically defend is just attack-move without the movement.

												I played Syndicate Wars on the PC growing up.  I loved that game and the wonky things you could do with your agents and the people around you in order to complete missions.  The ambience, setting, sounds, etc, really immersed me in the game for what it was at the time.  Flash forward to Satellite Reign.  Does the game live up to Syndicate Wars?  I can't say.  It certainly looks like Syndicate wars, and the way you interact with your squad and acquire new gear is very similar to the old game.  There are some new mechanics, a fresh take on the series story wise, and the ambience and setting really captures the old syndicate wars feel.  Even the music DLC had some jamming tunes.  But that's about it.  That's about all the good I can say about the game.  It falls flat and becomes repetitious and very uninteresting.  The open-endedness of this game compared to the mission based style of Syndicate Wars is the game's downfall.  I will clarify: there isn't much interaction with the world, save hijacking people's brains, bribing, hacking, or killing.  You can't get in cars or drive, and you don't go inside of buildings and have social interactions with people.  The game is just one fluid, top down view and inventory menu, hack the same terminals, bribe the same yellow, kill the same yellow, and send agent into green door X to clear mission Y.   The research, item acquisition, cloning, and skill tree menu is about the only other thing you will see save mission briefings.  Even the level design is built like some maze where the hacker opens gates and turns off cameras, and various other dude's can turn off power or zipline, but the design fails at allowing for multiple strategies for any given security compound or mission.  Some of the locations feel cookie cutter, or uninteresting.  The reward for breaking into security compounds just feels empty because they are all so similar.  And the large military compounds are just annoying rat traps.  I am genuinely uninterested in finishing this game.  The combat, maze running, and lack of a ""hook me in"" with the story just makes me feel sad that a seemingly cool remake of an old gem fell short of the mark.			"

												Bought game with a friend, played for 11 hours straight the first day. Slept for 8 hours, played for another 12 hours straight. This game is amazing. In what I can only describe as a hidden gem of greatness, this game is far more then worth the money. The games reviews don't do it justice since the game just recently released their multiplayer open beta, (a kickstarter goal that was never met but kindly made anyways) and the reviews are frequently before multiplayer was a thing. The game is singleplayer but it was meant to be played multiplayer. The gritty grunge feel of a futuristic dystopian world, the combat and cover system, all works smoothly in this game. Of the 23 hours I've played so far, the game has yet to have a single network hiccup, *cough i'm looking at you dark souls 3*. Highly recommend, highly addictive. Can't wait to see this studio put more games out.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW 31 DECEMBER 2014Boys, the game is far from complete, but even in it's current state can be fun to play.Personally, I'm taking a small taste and walking away, will try it again at release (or at least closer to release).I just wanted to share that this looks like the real deal.A lot of EA projects provoke disappointment from their supporters... but this looks like it really re-captures the mood and tone of the Syndicate original title.  (not sure if I'm supposed to go *cough* Syndicate *cough* for licensing reasons ?).OK just in case - this game obviously has nothing to do with Syndicate intellectual properties, but the game art style and tone looks really really good.  Sound is good, civilians and environments are good, and after killing a few police, the combat feels good.Not sure about giving me 4 cyborgs in 4 distinct archetypes (soldier, hacker, support, something).  I'd personally prefer more freedom to completely choose and design my team (and potentially screw up for certain situations)But yes - I think this project is definitely worth following and supporting, it looks really good, even this early along.I'm forcing myself to walk away after a small taste of the environments and combat, I'd much rather first experience this when it's complete.

												This game is amazing! It reminds me of SEGA Shadowrun with some killer graphics. It brings a whole lot of new stuff to the table as well, things I never would of imagined in a game of this type. It offers a great deal of options when it comes to how you choose to play or accomplish your goals in game. It would appear that the game designers wanted to simulate that threat of breaking into a secure complex and getting caught! You can sneak in and ninja your way through by dodging cameras and hacking systems but if you get caught you better be ready to fight all the way back out the front door again. My only wish for this game is for them to offer another kickstarter or something, I wasn't aware of this game until it hit Steam and honestly I wish I had, I would love to invest in this game and see it be everything I know it can be. The Devs plan to add co-op modes and lots of new zones and features but they didn't hit some goals during the initial run on kickstarter. They have said on forums etc. that they still wish to see this happen so I'd love to suppor them as this game is just that damn good! Also, it would be beyond epic if we could actually go inside complexes! Anywway, buy this game now! You want it, trust me.			"

												Great game - this is what I remember Syndicate being like, without the appalling UI.4/5 - great soundtrack, engaging story, and the novella (in the DLC) is pretty sweet and well written.  Let down from a perfect 5/5 by a brutal initial difficulty curve and some tricky control mechanics.I find now I've finished it, I'm missing it - and that's a solid gold recommendation right there.  If you want a nice tactical cyberpunk game, I doubt you'll find better on the market today.			"

								Has some fantasitic potential. Its a stable huge environment to play in, not all features enabled yet, and yeah some bugs you can work-around or ignore. I played syndicate back whenever for many many hours, but what I love is just how far the technology has come - not to try and re-create a concept, but to expand it - the playable map is Huuuge and you have so much freedom to move around in and make up your own methods of achieving the many goals. I'm still dipping a toe in the water and mostly just using my hacker to break into compounds and steal stuff - but I can see the potential to involve all your team fully and pull of some awesome heists.I'm cautious where I flick my money around - i'm 11 hours in and still very much working out how everything works, and very much looking forward to a finished release. Can highly recommend - if you have played syndicate before then this is a must-have, even in its current 0.7 state. "

												I really wish I could submit a ""Meh"" review because this is pretty much how I feel about this game.The art is absolutely fantastic  and the first heist is pretty fun. Beyond that the game seems to just become a chore. So let me just list some quick pros and cons and keep it moving Pros - The general aesthetic of the game is pretty perfect- 4 Player co-op is great- The ""prototype"" system is pretty cool- Tons and tons of missions and player progression.Cons - The menus, especially for the ""clones""/""operatives"" are extremely ♥♥♥♥ing confusing. Seriously, after 13 hours I still have no idea what I'm doing on the clone screen, for the most part.- Repetition. As a fan of Shadowrun and Cyberpunk savage worlds, A majority of the kind of missions I'm used to running are ""heist"" types. This game does that. Great. The only problem is that it does it badly. There are no interiors to the buildings you are stealing from. You spend your time stealthing all through the vicinity of a building, and once you reach the entrance, you watch your character enter and exit. That's it. Then you leave.... What? That's not satisfying. Not at all. Try doing this over and over again with no plot to grab you, and characters you don't care about.. which brings me to my next points.- Clones. I get the clone thing, it's ok. I get it. But this causes you to be playing characters that you don't give a single damn about. They're exactly that, nothing more than clones. Talk about boring. I'd like to be pulling off heists(or ""runs"", as I call them), and worry about the death of my characters. I suppose this is a matter of taste, but it's my stance.- Sound design. The sound  SUCKS. There's nothing else to say about it. It sucks. Even the ambience, it feels as if the city is completely lifeless.- The environment. Even though I said the aesthetics of the game are great, the city still feels completely lifeless. There's no other way I can think of explaining it. It's lifeless, everything is the same.- Micromanaging during combat is hell. Plenty of abilities to use, 4 characters to move, and no pause. Conclusion Look, honestly, I'm going to continue playing this game. if it wasn't for my absolute love of this genre, I wouldn't play this game. It's the only thing holding me in. Honestly, I should just go play Shadowrun Dragonfall or Hong Kong for the tenth time.If you're not an obsessive fan of the whole Cyberpunk scene then I can't recommend this, and you're probably better leaving this one in the dirt.

												Sadly right now I can't recommend this game. I wanted to love it and I do love huge swathes of it. The city looks amazing, the agent upgrades are genuinely inspiring to get to higher levels and the reimagination of Syndicate - such a huge early part of my gaming life - is excellent.For me, it fails as a strategy game.Firstly, much of the information about how to play the game is unclear. I didn't get anywhere until I checked message boards to find out how this game is supposed to work. For me, having to ask somebody else how to play a game is a clear failure.My agents have all levelled up about 10 times. Right now I could not tell you what they earned that XP for. One of them levelled up while he was standing in the street doing nothing.The line of sight the guards employ is a mystery to me. The tutorial suggests that staying out of light keeps you hidden, but this does not seem to be consistent. I have no idea what the guards' range of sight is. I have to assumed infinite, i.e. if you can see them, they can see you. I can't count the number of times a previously succesfully infriltration was ended by a single random guard able to see me from some unclear position.SInce, the original syndicate was not really a stealth game, I have also tried going in guns blazing but have found this to be a path to certain death. I have made some progress in shooting matches but only by grinding and failing the same missions over and over again to get enough XP and equipment to make my agents competitive. This is not a fun way to play games for me.Even having completed some missions I was quite unsatisfied. Many of these can be completed by rushing the main objective and getting killed in the process. Doesn't matter, the mission completion is still ticked off and you get a well done when your dead agents respawn. This is not a satisfying way to pull off a heist.In summary I can't recommend a strategy game that does not give you sufficient information to play strategically. Guard lines of sight should be clear or displayed. enemy patrols should be in some way predictable. Given that even the slightest sighting gives all guards ESP to your current and future positions, until you have retreated from the entire mission area it forces you to play all heists on a kind of Ironman mode. You have to do it all perfectly first time.I would agree that there is an argument to say that the Satellite Reign approach is ""realistic"", but in reality four agents cannot successfully assault a fortress with surveillance cameras and an endless supply of guards and hover drones. I just prefer games to be a representative experience of player levers and rewards. I'm less interested in this game as a simulator.It's hard to know whether the faults of Satellite Reign are elements of polish that are missing or fundamental gameplay faults that should have been corrected at the design stage, but as this version stands I can't recommend it as more than a paean to a former classic and a wonderful tech demo, leaving me to wonder how much more it could be with gaming added to it.

								Early Access - Pre-Alpha Build 0.2.9.1Game doesn't run very well on my computer for some reason. I get 15-25 fps but it is still playable if bit annoying. Reminds me alot of original Syndigate games so I will dig deeper at some point and definitely when they patch it to run more smootly. Atmosphere is already there thanks to gorgeous lighting, rain, fog and brilliant cyberpunk-ish synth music on top of that. Truelly very much LOVE IT! AI is bit lacking at times like emptying 5 clips on wall for no reason because enemy is hiding next room and sometimes my guys are spotted because they didn't like spot I clicked and run directly towards enemy troops, but we need to remember this is still PRE-ALPHA and there is more than enough time to fix all of it. I will try and give better review when I get some proper hours under my belt. Gladly follow this project as it goes on.			"

												if you're a fan of RTT games, like commandos, etc. especially syndicate ... this is something you should pick up. this feels like a ... true spritual successor to the original syndicate game in many ways, with lots more features and of course much better graphics.sure, there are still a good number of bugs in the game, but personally, none so frustrating as 6 completely broken achievements that you can never get (unless the devs fix it, or at least remove it, any time after i post this). it'll be like an itch you just cant scratch especially if you're a completionist.however, the gameplay, the story, and the ending, is good enough still, for me to give this a thumbs up. i really enjoyed my journey through the world.

												This game might be a great revival of the syndicate series, may be not. I can't tell, I never played the original series , so I am in no place to judge. What I can tell you, though, is that the devs failed basic game design. So, quick summary:Combat:  The game won't ping enemies attacking you, or warn you which of your units is actually under attack  Your chars are extremely hesitant to return fire, weapons drawn or not. There's no option to change their behaviour, to attack on sight, only return fire or hold fire. You can order them to hide their weapons, but it only affects enemy behaviour.  Cover mechanics are a mess. Sometimes things that should be cover aren't, things that shouldn't are. Sometimes your character detects cover, sometimes they stand on the wrong side of it.  Half the time your characters will move around obstacles to try and shoot at enemies, the other half they'll try to shoot through a wall.Thus, combat becomes a mess that relies on your team dogpiling single enemy units.Stealth:  You have no way of actually knowing if your unit is hidden out of view. Ocasionally, team members standings behind high-walls will be detected because they are not using it as cover.  Objects and walls that should block line of sight don't. Some that should'nt, do.  Assasination and other stealth skills are broken.  An enemy moving or changing direction seems to cancel assasination.   The infiltrator is useless as a stealth character as he doesn't have access to any practical skills like hacking or hardwiring. Even abilities like assasination force him to stand a couple of meters behind an enemy, even though he's holding a sniper rifle.Stealth is a disfunctional bore.The two main aspects of this game, combat and stealth, are broken or badly designed. This doesn't even take into consideration the bugs, broken missions or poor optimization. "

												I’m very much in doubt on whether to recommend this or not but this is my first impressions. I really want to like it and will give it some more time.The things that’s been bothering me:There’s an odd pace of perceived speed in the game but maybe it’s just because of the way I’ve played so far. Walking around the district, reading stories, learning how things work, etc. takes a long time. Then when combat comes it seems very high paced and its over almost before it has begun. Aparently you can slow the game down by upgrading a skill of one of the agents but it seems odd that this mechanic is locked for newbies.Combat, well, maybe I’m crap but every time I’ve been in an all out firefight with all my agents I’ve lost big time. Despite using cover, moving around to better cover, I just keep dying. This feels very unsatisfying that my supposedly tough agents dies at the first sign of danger. This is of course at the start of the game without any upgrades, so they’ll get better but I really should be able to handle the enemies at my current level.With combat being impossible, I’ve been forced to playing the stealth game making the game feel even slower. Don’t get me wrong, the stealth game is quite fun and works well, but progression just takes too long. This also means that I’m pretty much only using my hacker and the world scan ability of the support. The rest are just tag alongs.Then there are some minor issues that keeps bothering me. Somethings the UI isn’t as intuitive as I would like and some help messages aren’t really helpful enough. Sometimes a tutorial message pops up but if I’m in the middle of moving an agent the message disappears without me getting a chance to read it, leaving me wondering and frustrated about what I’m supposed to do next. That’s terrible design, right there.Finally, the sounds of the city seems oddly missing. The music is good and sounds following your actions are good, but you’re in a big and oddly quiet city. I’m really missing some ambience sounds. I’d also like that the NPC’s had some more to their lives than randomly wander in circles. Maybe I’ll see it with more play but in a modern game I would expect people to go about their business and having a daily routine. The good:The game feels and looks good, and is a good successor to the Syndicate of old. The graphics are in most cases beautiful, the theme grim and dark as it should be. The story is as you would expect if you’ve played Syndicate (this is a good thing) and there seems to be a lot of side quests you can do.The agents are responsive and mostly good in their pathfinding around the map. The cover mechanics works good (except in those cases where cameras can see though it). Sneaking in and hacking the different terminals is a lot of fun.I supported the Kickstarter and was thrilled to see Syndicate revived. I tried it a few times during beta but in the end, I wanted to wait until it was finished. Now that I’ve finally picked it up again I’m still unsure about it. It feels right and good but there are still some polish to do before it becomes great.			"

												A game with tons of potential let down by some truly sloppy UI design.  There's a delay on seemingly every action, and when the game is real-time and some actions demand good timing... it's an inexcusable flaw.  If you can't get snappy, precise timing on actions, then don't make the game real-time!  The amount of time it takes your apparently developmentally disabled units to respond to an order given and then execute it is absolutely absurd, particularly for important actions like silent assassinations.I also ran into an issue where, after loading a game, the game forgot I had completed the tutorial earlier and started spamming the screen with the tutorial pop-ups... and there's no way of clearing those out of the way.  It's very clear that, for all its strengths, Satellite Reign is held together with duct tape and spit.As far as actual gameplay goes, it's quite fun.  It's just a huge problem when you develop a real-time game and then design such ludicrous delays on so many actions.  The game probably would've been fantastic as a turn-based game, but as a real-time game I'm going to have to recommend people give it a pass.The absurd delay on units executing your commands and doing simple things like sprinting, apparently refusing to return fire even when you have their weapons out, and just general idiotic behavior by both player characters and NPCs (who don't seem to give one whit that their colleagues' corpses are strewn all about the alleyway they're patrolling around) just... I dunno.  I can't recommend this game.  I picked it up at half price and I still feel like I paid too much for it.  There's a lot of potential but the dev seems to be focused on adding irrelevant and unimportant things like multiplayer instead of ensuring the game is responsive and the controls are tight.  Playing with more than one person would just mean more than one person is simultaneously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the sloppy controls.			"

It still has a few bugs and unimplimented features (which is to be expected, a lot of people on early access don't seem to know what that means) but on the whole is great fun, very atmospheric and impressive, well done 5 Lives Studios for reigniting my love of cyberpunk.

Early Access Review
								Pre-alpha version is already pretty impressive. This game has a great vision of Cyberpunk fictions, the work they are doing is not only a resurrection of the true spirit of the Syndicate serie, but also a fantastic hommage to Ridley's scott ""Blade Runner"".As it's a in a pre-alpha state, they are bugs, but the quality of the work done so far make the gameplay already fun, and make the player wants to complete all the missions available at the moment.

												I kickstarted Satellite Reign because I am a huge fan of the Syndicate games by Bullfrog, especially Syndicate Wars. Satellite Reign is the spiritual third game in the series, as anyone who has played the first two can see, as well as the fact that Peter Molyneux's gave his blessing to the making of this game.If you haven't played the first two Syndicate games, go and play them! They are brilliant. But seriously, if you haven't, the game is set in a dystopian future, where the world and society are run by large corporations. You play a ""business executive"" in a shadowy corporation who has arisen to topple the current world order. Fairly generic in terms of plot, but I like how this is delivered in-game due to the fact that the world is continuous. In the old syndicate games, you would go to a central ""command hub"" to choose your next mission, conduct research, build weapons and gear and equip your team etc. But in Satellite Reign you never leave the world. The menu brings up your missions, research, equipment and so on, but when you leave the menu you're still in the world, which I think is a great feature. You control, from a 3-D isometric viewpoint, a team of four agents, each with a specific role and skillset:The soldier specialises in combat, mainly in tanking, but also has a useful skill called ""hardwire"", which allows him to hack certain terminals in the game to give the squad an advantage. Of course, he also has offensive soldier-y abilities, like grenades and ""rage"" to temporarily increase damage.The support provides your team with a myriad of ways to improve, from increasing health and health regen to distributing stims to them for use in combat to slow time to a crawl, as well as acting as medic when necessary. They also have a ""world scan"" ability, which shows you various things: the background electronics of the world (so you know which power terminal to disable in order to take down those security cameras) or citizens of note (researchers to bribe or assassination targets to, well, assassinate).The hacker not only hacks computers, he can syphon money from atms dotted around the city, as well as hack people to fight for your cause. Yes, hack people. It's the future, everyone has microchips in their heads, of course. But hacking a person makes them fight for you, but they can also be sent back to your main base to be used a clone. More on that later.The assassin is a sneaky stealth character who's a mean shot with a sniper rifle. He can use a melée strike, but this doesn't scale well with the game at the moment. He can also learn to become a thief, boosting funds if you send him in to raid a facility, or an infiltrator, allowing him to cloak for longer, use ziplines with ease and climb through ventilation shafts.There's more to each class but I don't want to give everything away. You are given assignments in each part of the city you need to complete in order to improve your agents skill levels, cashflow and research and development. You can complete the missions with stealth or by just arming to the teeth and charging in, guns blazing. If you need to reduce the heat, hit a security facility to reduce the enemies ability to call in back-up. If you need funds, hit a bank. Additionally, you need to hit certain targets with specific agents to reap a reward. The bank is a good example: if you get a soldier in, you get a lump sum of cash. If you get a hacker in, you increase the amount you syphon from the atms by a certain amount, increasing profits on a long-term basis.Equipping your team is one of the main driving forces of the game. You start with uzi submachine guns and a basic pistol, no gear, no augments and only a couple of skills. Raiding other corporations gives you access to prototypes and blueprints, which you can give to your RnD department so that you can build them yourself. The guns fire one of three types of ammunition: ballistic, laser and plasma, each of which is more effective against flesh, shields and armour respectively. You can have a pistol and a main weapon on each member of the team; the pistols have unlimited ammo.Gear is equipped on your team and ranges from drone controllers (allowing an agent have a drone following him around) to stealth generators (so that everyone, not just the assassin, can cloak) to personal shields to medkits and more.Augments are implants, and each team member can have one in each of the following slots: head, body, arms and legs. You can increase agents' stats, as well as give them immunity to poison or even put a self-destruct mechanism to make them a human (well, cyborg) bomb.There are bad points though. The AI, enemy and friendly, is bit hit and miss. The camera angles are somtimes unhelpful. It can be a bit overwhelming choosing what to do first. Sometimes guards have supervision, seeing a ""hidden"" agent from two miles away through three walls, while sometimes they ignore a friendly drone exploding right in front of them as I shoot it with a silenced weapon. But overall, I love Satellite Reign. They've done Syndicate proud so far, I'd say. I particularly enjoy instigating a fight between the different factions then hiding and watching the carnage. This might be a bug; I thought everyone else was united against me, but oh well :)			"

												Satellite Reign doesn't shove the game's story down your throat. Instead you're thrown into an open cyberpunk world complete with feuding mega corporations and Blade Runner inspired sets..You have great freedom in this game and what you do from there is up to you: you can do missions (in whatever order you choose) or just fool around the four huge city districts. You can also choose how to upgrade your team (be it skills, gear, weapons or clones).How you go about your business is also up to you... you can break into huge fortresses by force or use hacking and stealth skills to do it totally unnoticed. As your team grows in skills and equipment so will the enemy. The developers have recently added new game modes that have added difficulty and will make the game even more challenging for experienced players.The Good:- Frequent updates up to and even after launch- Graphics / sound / atmosphere (the cyberpunk world is awesome)- Open world- Soundtrack- high replay valueThe bad- Map is a bit confusing to use- controls aren't really bad but could be better- some bugs here and there but most have been fixed by nowI really wish there are future updates or expansions that allow our team to go inside the city's buildings. So should you buy this game? if you're into cyberpunk settings and real time strategy go for it. If you loved Syndicate then definitely go for it!			"

												I'm really loving this game. First play-session ended up in 7 hours straight and that rarely ever happens. Despite being realtime, once this game gets started it very much has this ""one more turn"" feel to it. Although in this instance I should perhaps rather put it as ""one more try,"" after your break-in attempt is brutally smashed by overestimating your own ego.It is a little overwhelming at first, but I really recommend just cutting loose and experimenting. While you're still just starting up, you can really only gain through trial and error (unless you're the kind of person who thinks that ""no bonus"" is a penalty).EDIT: Looking back at this game is weird, I never actually completed it. While I did state that the mechanics are great, they're also very simple and they do not really evolve as the game goes on. After you've played the first quarter of the game you've practically tried everything already. If you love it so much that you feel like you can keep doing that four times longer than what you've already played, then I suppose you can get yourself to complete it. But unfortunately this game feels like it is too ""stretched out"" for its own good. Either it needs new mechanics to be procedurally implemented into the existing environment, or the whole experience needs to be shrunk into a much smaller gamespace.I'd still recommend this game to people who REALLY like the cyberpunk setting, or are fans of the original Syndicate games that have clearly inspired these. The ambience and nostalgia might be enough to carry you through, but unfortunately this was not the case in my own unfinished playthrough.			"

												Really enjoyed the game, both stealthing through and going in all guns blazing - there are some nice touches to the UI and the game system which you realise over time, but it does also need you to be a little patient sometimes as there are other aspects which lack some polish or are glitchy (as mentioned in other reviews).  I also enjoyed piecing together the story through the data terminals, it worked nicely for me as a narrative style.  Overall would definitely recommend.			"

												Fun stealth - Action strategy game with some light RPG mechanics (upgrading stats through XP and augmentations). Feels like a mash-up between Commandos and Syndicate Wars. The first part of the game heavily relies on stealth but as you progress through the game you can start unlocking some more serious firepower and really go to town if that's more your style.The visuals are fantastic and they really got the whole dystopian Blade Runner style world down.I think I would have preferred a mission style setup instead of the open world they have going now since the mission variety can sometimes be a bit lacking but the base game remains fun throughout.  Definitely a Kickstarter success in my book			"

In co-op, of course, it's more interesting.Cons: not very smart AI and some stupidity of agents - if you order him to shoot at someone, he will shoot despite of walls, stairs etc.Anyway, it's beautiful and atmospheric cyberpunk game about planning and improvisation. =)8/10			"

								This is the game I've been waiting so long for. If you're a fan of the Syndicate series (especially Syndicate Wars) then you'll be right at home in the world of Satellite Reign. The visuals are stunning and fit the world perfectly while the quality sound really brings back the old days. Having the original composer of Syndicate Wars onboard helps on that front.The gameplay itself takes what we know already with the equipment and augmentations, and expands upon it with the addition of skills for the different agents. Even at this early stage, the gritty world of SR already feels lived in and it's a world I'm glad to be back in after such a long break.If you're into cyberpunk, do yourself a favor and give this game a shot.

												I am recommending this game but I say only buy it on sale. I am glad this kind of game exist and I hope to see more like it, but it definitely needs some work done. I was hoping this game would be similar to Shadowrun. It is not. The setting of this game is similar to Shadowrun (i.e. cyber-punk anarchist anti-corrupt government/corporation), minus the magic. However, the missions are less defined and basically the same. The missions are all about getting to a restricted location, going in a building, and getting out. Overall I am not bummed I bought it, but I am basically playing it just to finish it. Pros•	Visually beautiful from the environment to the characters. •	Customizable characters •	Interesting story environment (i.e. futuristic cyber-punk)•	Living environment. People are walking around and react to your actions. For example, if you kill a random person people will flee. If they see you taking control of someone’s mind they run in fear. Cars stop if you walk in front of them. •	Open world exploration and fun.Cons•	Missions are basically the same. “Run to X location, which is a restricted zone, stay hidden or shoot your way through, get into building (which equates to stealing information), then get out so you can save the game.”•	Punished for changing characters, even from beginning. If you change your character class you automatically lose one skill point on all your skills. Therefore, even though you can change your skills there is serious motivation not to do it. So if you want to make all your characters the same, say you want to make them all soldiers to shoot your way through a mission, your characters are weakened for it.  •	Team-AI are essentially non-reactive. You really need to micro-manage your team. If you don’t tell them to shoot, they will just take stand in the open taking shots. This game would benefit from either turn-based combat or at least a pause feature. •	Can only save when all of your team are in a save points. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem but when characters bug out and fall through the map you have to load the game from an earlier save point. •	Certain features don’t seem to save. For examples, I was trying to get an achievement for shooting all the cameras in a district. However, every time I load a game the cameras are back. I can’t figure out why it won’t save.  "

												There are some bugs and glitches and I hope the team will continue to update the game, but it's very enjoyable. I would suggest more spontaneous events, like bounty hunters that went after the player at random intervals.  There are also too many 'walk here, bribe this guy' type missions that should have more choices -- but the fundamentals are quite sound.  More irreversible decisions would also be merited. Combat is fun although there are also too many 'heavy' weapons that seem basically the same, and a bit more variation in opponents would go a long way. Above all, it's a terrific game that nails atmosphere and fun gameplay but could do w/ some more variation.			"

												The graphic, art, the atmosphere is outstanding, but the experience is not satisfying, rather teeth-grinding rageous. Each member of clone squad needs a very high micromanagement. They rarely would retaliate against enemy attack unless told to do so. Even if they did, they would halt after a one fallen enemy not the other enemies. I'm assuming it is clearly designed for stealth only missions. The hit-point design is also very poorly designed. Enemy will take a long time to get killed and sometimes the weapons feel like somekind of potato guns. Very linear plot and mission design.You have a list of what to do shown on the map, and has some text describing what they are for which isn't inspiring. EXP progress is pretty slow as well, and the enemies are designed to be evolved along with clones level system in order to  out-number, out-gun us all the time. As mentioned earlier, this must have been designed to be stealth play only. having less freedom in combat and linear story-telling without much satisfaction upon completion, this title feels incompleted. It feels like GTA2 with cyberpunk atmosphere, but even GTA2 can have fun messing around in the public despite unsatisfactory story. It pulled the fun-combat-sandbox factor out.			"

												I played all the way through the game, and while it has moments of enjoyment, it is more bad than good.First off, the bad. * The game plays fine for the first 15 to 16 hours, but after that mark, bugs begin appearing in mass, most of which effect gameplay in frustrating ways. Pausing respawning all enemies in the world, for example. Soldiers aiming in a completely different direction than their indended target. Soldiers refusing to move or shoot, and getting stuck in place or in terrain. * The game has a poor progression system - that is, linear. There is no reason to use Plasma over Laser based weaponry, for example, when both are unlocked so close to one another. The game pauses during inactivity, which hinders the research function whenever you are waiting before infiltrating an enemy region. * The story is next-to non-existent, as is the environmental interaction. * There are traces of unfinished features all over the game, leaving a feeling of yearning for what could have been. Vehicles are present, but pose no threat and serve no purpose. * The relay system should have been either removed or toned down drastically.* While there are plenty of hotkeys, some of the more trivial tasks that one must always do in momments of fast-paced high-risk action seem to have been overlooked.* Certain graphics settings have either no effect on the visuals or frame-rate, even when disabled. * Lack of narrative progression after tutorial and before the final ""boss.""* Lack of enemy variety.* Enemies do not use many tactics, and are keen to sit and shoot until killed.Now, the good.* Exceptionally long game. Each area takes roughly 10 hours to complete on a speed run.* Customizable difficulty. This makes the stealth-play far more important, and removes the triviality of death.* Good setting, but not fleshed out due to lack of interaction with it and the limited civilian life. There are also no indoor areas.* Has potential for modding.* Better than Syndicate, this game's predecessor.* Excellent character growth; difference between beginning characters' weakness and ending characters' strength is outstanding. Blowing up even the hardest, largest enemies in mere seconds in amazing.Overall, I give the game a 4/10. I wanted to like it, but it just feels like it needed another year of design and programming.			"

Plenty of choices in approaching your objectives.  Not a turn based combat game like Shadowrun or X-com, more like an Action RPG.  Huge Isometric maps with multiple levels.

												As a fan of the original Syndicate, I couldn't help but get excited even at the name of this game.  A few months later, I have mixed feelings.  Satellite Reign certainly evokes Syndicate, and moreso Syndicate Wars, but lacks the finesse that made those games such classics.  Point by point, everything's there: the Blade-Runner visuals, the cybernetic implants, the mind control devices, but they all feel stale and lifeless.A lot of this has to do with the change in pace.  While Bullfrog's classics had barely any animation for most actions, your agents take ages to do pretty much anythingin Satellite Reign, with detailed but unnecessary animations for getting into cover, pulling up a gun to sight, etc.  The consequence is that what was originally a fast-paced, tightly controlled game now handles like molasses.  It takes upwards of a second for your agents to actually act on your orders, and the fiddly nature of the contextual controls means that when they finally do, you might be surprised by what they actually start doing.  All the punch and feel of the original is missing, and this shatters any sense of nostalgia for me.  Contrast games like Sublevel Zero, which capture the movement and experience of their inspirations, and it's hard not to feel disappointed.  In fact, if they fixed the controls and combat pacing, that would be enough for me to recommend this game, despite its other flaws.There's a similar problem in the tone and setting; while the visuals are very pretty, they don't quite convey the sense of oppression in the originals, and the world doesn't have the sense of mystery and misinformation that Syndicate Wars did.  The story places you as an almost-valiant underdog, and without the clearly amoral tone of Syndicate, where you are exactly like your opponents from the very beginning, the narrative elements are just bland.  The story and tone, like the gameplay, capture the surface elements of Syndicate Wars perfectly, but miss the details of execution and performance, and consequently the impact.Ironically, this game shines brightest in the ways it's not like Syndicate.  The class based stealth and problem solving has echoes of Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines.  Whilst not as well developed as that game's strategic challenges, it is engaging and balances freedom with puzzle design well.  Whilst not as evocative as Syndicate Wars, the bright neon colours of Satellite Reign are more beautiful than anything I ever saw in that game, and not just because of modern hardware.  There's the beginnings of a game that can stand on its own two feet here - but I don't feel it's there just yet.  Perhaps 5 Lives need to find the courage to take their ideas from out of the shadow of Syndicate Wars, and let someone else do justice to a remake.			"

												Short, for those with the attention span of a text message: BAD: bad tutorial, bad saving system, information overload, everything looks the same. Too confusing and aggravating to be fun.GOOD: Music, city atmosphere.Long:I know I only played a few hours, and I will adjust my review as my gametime increases, but I feel the need to write a review right away, because there are several things that greatly affect my expectations and enjoyment of the game right from the start.There are several things wrong right away, and potentially ruin the game completely.First, the tutorial is way too short. Only a few things are explained, and there is no way to go back in the tutorial, nor is there a way to save during the tutorial. And there is no manual!So very early on in the game, you run into stuff that is not explained, like for instance the ""hijacking"" skill.Now, there are a lot of ""tutorial"" moments that try to explain stuff. You are constantly bombarded with messages that you have to read, which interrupt the game. Some of those even at crucial moments! While you are waiting for timers on camera's for instance, the game annoyingly wants your attention, Hey, Look at me! Forget the game, let the guards catch you! Really annoying. (Especially the ""Fast Travel"" moment is very bad. The message stays in your screen, overrides everything, and makes your travel to a point you don't want to go, without the option to travel back. Major design flaw here!)Another thing that is very confusing, is the city itself. It is beautifully made, but every inch looks exactly the same. There are no visual indicators to easily see in which area you are, or where you are relative to certain objects. It is so easy to completely forget where you are, and there is no full overview map, only a minimap. Where the hell am I? is something you will ask yourself, trust me.There is no mission order. The game starts with 2 missions. Seems easy enough. However, as soon as you start doing those, and explore the city more, you start getting more and more missions. You are swamped with missions, objectives and stories. So much so, that it is becoming confusing and annoying. You have no clue what to do next. Every time you turn a new corner, some annoying message alerts you to a new mission, and more lore, while you are just trying to focus on your current mission. Sure, it is nice that there are a lot of missions to do, but the game overloads you with info and missions so much, that you lose track and get annoyed, and want to skip reading all the lore all together, which can't be good.The saving system is terrible, and believe me, this game needs saving a lot. If you don't save right from the start, you will quickly stop liking this game. The game gives you the idea you can save anywhere, outside of restricted areas and combat, and return where you left off. Sadly, when you reload, you start at the last/closest beacon from where you were, which is really annoying. And since you cannot save in a restricted area, you basically cannot save during any mission. It means that every time you come back to the game, and want to continue, you have to remember what you were doing, and walk back to the point you were, and start your infiltration all over again.  Why??? If you can save at a certain point on the map, why not on any point? This mechanic is stupid, aggravating and unnecessarily penalizing. It ruins your fun. If there is one thing that is unforgivable in a game, and very bad design, and poor judgement, is penalizing a player when he is not doing well in the game. Sure, a game can be hard and challenging, but punishing a player for not performing well is a flawed and very bad idea. One of the core purposes of a game is to entertain, to give you joy, even when it is challenging. It should make you want to come back and try again. Making people suffer with bad saving and walking back half the city, not knowing where the hell they were when they screwed up, is not much fun.The few good things of the game are the music and the atmosphere of the city, but for me it is clear that the designers have very little experience playing with other games, and are terrible at the construction of a game, don't know what entertainment really means, and lack empathy for the average new player. The fact that you can code, does not mean you are a good Game Maker, and this game is an example of that, for me at least.Edit: I know I only played a few hours, but the fact the game already annoys me, and makes me want to stop playing, is not a good sign! I don't feel the sense of excitement, or need for discovery, that other games give me. That, in itself, counts heavily.			"

Product received for free
												The game has a lot of potential, but at it's current state I can't recommend it. I've encountered some ridiculously long loading time and extremely annoying bugs (that often forced me to reload the game).As for gameplay:Like many others said before me, the micromanagement requirements are too extreme for a game that has no tactical pause. From comments made by the devs, this is a feature they don't want to add, which is fine if they make micromanagement less of a chore, but currently it's just annoying. At least give a checkbox to turn auto-attack on or something!The missions (or at least the ones i've done so far) are designed for stealth. But the stealth mechanics are very simplistic and occasionally frustrating, and the missions ended up just not being fun - Not to mention every skill not designed for stealth ends up being practically useless. I think that, other than loading times and bugs, all issues with the game can be solved by adding a tactical pause. Hopefully that will happen. If not, at least make it so I don't have to wait 2 mins for the game to load, then immediatly run into a bug (like the tutorial suddenly starting over, 3 hours into the game) and have to load it AGAIN. When I can play the game without having to reload constantly because of♥♥♥♥♥♥like that, I'm willing to give it another chance			"

												I really wanted to like this game but there were a few design choices that made it frustrating to play.+ Nice cyberpunk art style.+ Variety of weapons and powers to aquire.+ Earn money over time by hacking ATMs, so no grinding for currency.- Focus on stealth, but no option to save scum.- Team is always Soldier/Support/Hacker/Infilitrator, no changing this, limits team compositions.- AI have long, complicated patrol routes, makes sneaking hard.- High enemy health (shields and armor) limit options for sneak attacks.- Alarms can create infinite enemies.- Hacked doors reset after a time, often blocking escape if stealth fails.- Complicated controls, e.g. assign group selection to F-keys needs to be redone each time the game loads or the team dies.- Little penalty for dying, so the game seems to intend for it to happen a lot, but that doesn't make it less annoying.- Missions are mostly flavor text, little-to-no voice acting.- Real-time combat + lots of abilities + four team mates + no tactical pause = micromanagement hell.- Cannot turn camera, makes it hard to view some locations.I played for a few hours, then reached a mission where I spent 15 minutes sneaking in, only to make a mistake and my team gets killed.  OK, no matter, I'll try going in from the other side.  30 minutes later, after 2 emergancy retreats and dozens of masterful assassinations, a freshly spawned guard spots my team running behind some dumpsters, fires of a few shots, and seconds later two dozen armored guards have us pinned down and we got slaughtered again.  That was when I rage quit.Honestly, save scumming would have redeemed this game for me, but I'm rather a stealth perfectionist.			"

												A fun sandbox game with squad tactics, hampered by bugs, poor UI and targeting issues.7 hrs into the game I loaded a saved game and all of my 3 heavy infantry that I'd persuaded were gone.Also I had exactly $1000, no equipment, and some tutorial telling me to press left click twice or F.There's something seriously wrong with the save files.I tried to load it again and now it's saying ""Falied to launch game as host"" even though this is a single-player game.Then I couldn't even exit the game from the main menu.""Are you sure you want to exit?""Yes I'm sure but selecting OK does nothing.I had to force close the game from the main menu.. crazy.I reloaded the exact same save and while I have my money and equipment back, the units I persuaded are still gone. The game also suffers from targeting issues which has caused many deaths.My soldiers' accuracy is over 100% but they still refuse to shoot someone that's standing on stairs. They often don't attack units that I select and I have to select them a second time.If I press G to use a grenade then ALL of my units throw their grenades at once and waste them.There's no single-use option.Also the UI around assigning clones to soldiers is poor and not explained well at all.You need to select the soldier class in the bottom right then select a clone in the list of the left.It doesn't help that the soldiers are also listed in the list making it a very confusing process if you don't see the bottom right options as the game will let you select a soldier from the list then a clone in the list and let you click apply, though the result will be unexpected.Still feels like an Early Access game.If the Devs fix these issues then it would be a definite upvote from me but as it is it's a very frustrating experience when 90% of deaths are not the player's fault.If this was still in EA then I'd be confident that the devs would fix these flaws, but considering it has left EA already it is a sign from the devs that they think the game in it's current state is ok so it gets the thumbs down.[Update: Next time I reloaded  a later save due to another death where units refused their commands I'm back in the same situation: $1000, some other tutorial, no equipment and unable to exit other than via task manager. I've given up with the game now as it's too punishing for it's own glitches with more glitches on top, and I've requested a refund]			"

												This isn't a review yet (due to limited time to play), it's just to confirm for other gamers that SR runs very well, it's very optimized.My specs: i5-3570K, 12GB, AMD R290X. Ultra settings, 1080p, 60 FPS inside the main city zones.So far, polish is excellent, something on-par with AAA development but these guys are a small 5 man team. Squad movement is fluid, combat is fluid, stealth works, very vibrant and cyberpunk atmosphere. Graphically it puts most other games of this genre to shame, even ones from big studios.Will update when get some free time to play more.			"

												Yes, it has nice graphics but this game is VERY frustrating. Theres NO SAVE option during missions, which means you will have to RESTART them a hundred of times. Why? Because of AI and cover system that doesnt work. Your agents will get spoted where they shouldnt, like behind walls, and enemy will start shooting, reinforcments will arrive and its game over for you. 30 or more mins of game time wasted.Enemy drones will get stuck in places you need to pass through, making it immposible for you to procede with the mission. Your agents will fail to execute orders, etc... If this game doesnt get patched soon, its just not worth it !!!			"

												TLDR: Interesting game with optimization issues. If you need a score... 5.5Satellite Reign is a small scale RTS set in a cyber punk universe. Imagine a modern XCOM game with a cyber punk setting and real time combat. There are some interesting mechanics and it's very pretty world. As you can see I haven't played a ton of Satellite Reign just yet and I really hope I can play a lot more in the future. Sadly, at this point I won't be playing any further unless there is some major improvement to stability. While I have liked what I've seen so far the game is very poorly optimized. Most of the video settings had very little effect on how well the game ran for me. The most effective were resolution and bloom. Yes this is fairly typical but I had almost no improvement from disabling ssao or shadows completely and almost no effect from dropping the image quality or anti-aliasing. To be honest, things were fine in the beginning. I was getting between 40 to 60 fps even though I exceeded the recommended specs for the game. The problem came later when going into areas loaded with NPCs and traffic. Suddenly I was getting 12fps. There is a setting for civilian population but again that had almost no effect on the framerate for me. All in all I hope that I can come back to Satellite Reign some day (and I'll update this review if I do) but right now I just can't stand the poor performance.			"

												PleaseThis game very badly needs a difficulty settingI love this game, and I loved Syndicate (its ancestor), but I’m stuck because the difficulty is just set too high.    Every path is now blocked and I cannot advance.  I have 2 missions left in the first sector (Wyvern and Dracogenics.)  I cannot complete either of them by fighting, because my guys are too weak.  I cannot complete them by stealth because even the tiniest mistake means you get caught and die, and get degraded, and it took hours to get that far.  I cannot go do easier missions in order to level up and get stronger, because there are none.    I cannot research any better tech or gear because I have no money.   I could theoretically turn the game on and go knit for a few hours and wait for money to accumulate, but at that point it crosses the line of being a game you “play.”    I am not a hardcore gamer, but I’m not a casual, I play video games several hours each night. Please put in a difficulty setting so that people who are less clever, less sharp and less brilliant can nevertheless still enjoy it			"

												It's time to write a review now that the multiplayer is out of beta and is working....Kind of. The multiplayer still (28.8.2016) has some rubberbanding issues, but it's in a playable state (mileage may vary). The game has some other performance issues as well, and the FPS can tank when in highly populated areas....But who cares?! It's a spiritual successor to Syndicate! Single player experience is great, and it only gets better when playing with friends. When you're only controlling one agent you can actually start to use the agent's special abilities and items tactically without having the reflexes and finesse of a Korean Starcraft player...There are a few balancing issues when using the optional über damage mode (why shouldn't you use it? Otherwise the combat is like watching The Bold And The Beautiful on TV; boring, dull and you're not going to die because of it): for example shotguns will destroy anything from blast doors to the toughest enemy soldiers - with one hit. It might sound great to some, until they realize that the same ridiculous damage applies to enemy shotgunners as well. If he gets close enough to fire then you're going to lose 1-4 agents in less than 100 ms, no matter how much shielding, armor and health you have.			"

												All the reviews say Syndicate, I'm not gonna tell you otherwise, that's exactly what it is.  Only it actually looks cyberpunk-y, the SNES-era graphics couldn't really muster that back then (Syndicate came on floppies! Do you have a shelf that still has floppies on it? YOU PHILISTINE, throw them out, and buy this.) And it looks good, always a sucker for a pretty isometric style game. The camera is locked into one angle (unless I'm overlooking something) that sort of oscillates like a fan, which helps give you a better view in some areas but for me it can be a mild annoyance.If you dunno what Syndicate is, because it came on floppies, think Shadowrun, and if you dunno wtf that is either then think RTS XCom, and instead of aliens, the enemy is....um...""The Man"" (literally in this game's case, according to the backstory).  Seriously, in the beginning, some chick is like, hey this guy and his macguffin suck, let's kick him in the balls; but honestly that's all it needed, if it even needed that much. But yeah, very click-to-move, hotkey style game.You're in a city broken into districts; you're free to go wherever you want from the outset, although in a style familar to Grand Theft Auto fans, in that if you leave the starting area without doing the proper pre-reqs first, you're gonna have an army on your♥♥♥♥♥ or at least you'll have to fight through one, after you've done that I suppose you're free to shed the ""wanted level"". Within each district is a number of base or fortress style areas you can send your 4-man team (any or all) in to recover this or destroy that or rob a bank or shoot this prick or escort that prick (those missions can go to hell btw).  You have a thing in your menu that gives you some sense of direction if you want it, or can you ignore that completely systematically (or randomly) raid each little ""base"" within a district until you've got everything; granted if you do it that way, I think you can miss out on some upgrades, though I believe if so you are allowed to purchase them later on for a steep price.Its not turn based, a game that looks like this reeks of turn based gameplay, but its far more in line with an RTS, each of your dudes has certain abilities, and within that you can outfit them with varying weapons and gear that can lean towards stealth or kaboombooms or whatever you like, once you've researched the tech (which is fairly straightforward, you find and recruit scientists within the city and allocate them as a resource on whatever blueprints you have available).  Stealth is fairly heavily incentivized because if an alarm gets set off you can find yourself in really nasty situations, there seem to be tiers of security or law enforcement and once you've♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off ""The Man"", you could be looking at 20+ dudes charging your location, some carrying plasma miniguns or laser sniper rifles, another guy in that group might be jamming your support abilities, and they might have those annoying♥♥♥♥♥spider drone things that run up and explode in your face and knock everybody down so they're defenseless to the aforementioned plasma minigun toting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so in short, you'd do well to hide behind cover and used silenced weaponry to eliminate patrols, or use your infiltrator and hacker (in order to enter a ""base"" or restricted area, you generally have to unlock/blast open a security door or find some other route in) to open up alternate routes that bypass the goose-stepping asshats altogether. Eventually you're gonna have to open up the whupass can, but you will want to do everything you can to stack the deck first, just charging into a restricted area leeroy style is a tough row to hoe even with the best gear and upgrades.I'm having a lot of fun with it, for me its like a far less linear Shadowrun, although there's never gonna be any dialog options that're influenced by your skills or anything like that, the shotgun does all the talking in this game.  Definitely worth whatever I paid on whatever sale, I have 15 hours in it and I JUST got done with the first area (I think), considering the non-linearity of the game I could see it easily reaching 40+ hours for me.  I was sold when my hacker got the ability to take control of any person she encounters, and can then send that person to be used as a host for one of my squad if they die (or want an upgrade), how do you not love that!  Want to look like that hot eurotrash chick on the corner? Have your dude creep up behind her, type some commands into his arm, send her to your lair and then....take control. She might even give you a bonus, like better aim or moving faster. Strongerfastermorealive. With lasers.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I'm a backer of the game's Kickstarter, though I honestly haven't been paying attention to the game's development until I was reminded that it existed. I don't even remember what level I backed at (probably $50?). So a little disclosure that this review is biased.Anyway, the tl;dr is that the game has potential, but it's not especially fun in its current stage.The longer review is that, in the state it is right now, the game isn't very fun. It's not especially buggy - I had a few collision problems and got stuck once, but that's also called ""any given session of Skyrim"" so it's not something to go crazy about on a pre-Alpha.The big issue is that so many systems are not yet implemented that it's hard to get a real feel for how the game really will be. Plus, since the agents all start out effectively at level 1, with no points in any but their core abilities, I can't really play with any special abilities or get a feel for what makes the classes different outside of appearance and a little gimmick. Combat is just pointless at this stage - my guys get torn apart, even in cover, which might suggest a balance issue as well. The interface is messy and the fonts are too small, making it hard to read, and, though I have lots of missions available I wind up very confused as to where to go and what do.But, again, it's a pre-Alpha. This is effectively working code, and nothing more. It's not until Beta that you have everything implemented, so it'll be a while until I get to play ""Satellite Reign."" What I have right now is just the barebones of what will one be that game.The potential is there, though.Firstly, the graphics look great, though the game isn't optimized at the least and runs like crap, though my computer is fairly decent (I run most modern games on max settings). The city map oozes detail and is both reminiscent of Syndicate AND very, very Cyberpunk. Just wandering around looking at things is nice.Next, the missions are varied and usually have multiple ways to complete them, including mulitple site entrances, hackable terminals, and even side missions that make completing the main missions easier; for instance, one side mission has me suborning a cyber-clinic to hack enemy agent implants, thus making combat easier across the board. Another has me contacting an info dealer which leads to better intel on other missions. This means you've got a lot of flexibility in how to do things. Or you can just run and gun.The Combat, at this stage, feels unbalanced and my agents are very weak. However, it's got potential. The cover system is very organic, resembling a real-time X-Com: Enemy Unknown, and watching firefights unfold is impressive. The enemies seems dumb as dirt right now, but hopefully that will be improved. In any case, they are smart enough to take cover and call for reinforcements, and the game incorporates using hacking to shut that nonsense down, so, as with eveything else, the potential is there.I can't tell much about the rest of the game, but what I played feels like a decent taste of things to come.So, would I recommend you BUY it? No, not at this stage.However, I DO recommend that, if you love Syndicate, Cyberpunk, or, heck, X-Com and other top-down tactical games, following Satellite Reign and picking it up when it hits Beta or goes Gold.

Early Access Review
								Let's just get this out of the way: this game has semi-recently come out of alpha and it shows--it's a bit rough around the edges.  That needed to be said so you can understand the full context of the following: it is totally worth it.  This is a great game that I just sit down and sink hours into.  The open world is there for you to explore and has enough to keep you busy and engaged without eventually feeling mundane.  The skills and tools your agents have offer a variety of possible solutions to your various challenges (although some are easier than others).  Additionally, using informants doesn't feel like a cheat so much as proper heist planning: casing the joint, greasing a few palms, and getting insight into who has the actually run on the vault.Also, wIth the open world with open ended solutions the developers made a great choice: death of your agents is not the end nor an unbearable setback.  It's problematic and costs you time, XP, and/or money but it's not crippeling.  Agent resurrection is always available, new clones can be acquired, and passive syphoning of ATMs for cash allows you to make up for mistakes or ops that did not go as planned. This encourages the experimentation a game like this needs to enable while still keeping a steady difficulty curve.All I can say is this game is very fun and doesn't straight jacket you while still feeling all proper and cyberpunk.  The gameplay experience is worth the rough edges and I eagerly look forward to every update.  Keep on keep'en on 5 Lives.			"

												Caveat: I have a STRONG bias in favor of cyberpunk espionage, and long for the day a mainstream, AAA Shadowrun game (that's actually good) hits the scene.In the mean time, while Satellite Reign is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and can get pretty repetitive, it's one of the better games at what it does, with a stylish veneer and loving loyalty to its inspired origins. And they even added co-op! (Just be prepared for a few issues here and there with connections, as of this review.)			"

												(Story Complete) Satellite Reign is a squad based RTS where you take 4 opratives into enemy headquarters to steal sensitive intel, weapon prototypes, kill targets, or help informants escape. I went into this game thinking I would like it and came away loving it. The highlights to Satellite Reign- Atmosphere : The story takes a backseat but neo-future artstyle and sound design are great.- Infiltrator & Sniper : The best two classes of your squad by far. Stealth ops is generally the course of action. These two classes are much more useful than Soldier or Support.- Infiltrator Hacking : Making enemies kill enemies.- Enemy Patrol AI : Satellite Reign does a great job of balancing the predictability of enemy patrol routes & reinforcements.The low points of Satellite Reign- Cover system : the cover points on the map are great in the beginning of the game and sketchy/missing in the reamining areas. You can find yourself stuck in walls at times.- Soldier & Support : The game will keep reinforments coming if you are alerted so a full on attack never feels like a viable option. Support has some great abilities but nothing the feels like you care if he is on the mission or not.- Headquarter resource respawn : clearing an area just is see the cameras and turrets respawn is not fun.

												 I kickstarted this and I played it! Something that never happens. In any case, it's fun. Isometic, real time Shadowrun basically, but not like the stupid shadowrun turn based game. This one seems to have some neat mechanics (you hijack people off the streets to use as your body clones when your guys die but the people you hijack have their own stat boosts so potentially you could hijack like a sniper savant or something) and its fun to play. Sorta like the original syndicate perhaps?			"

												Fun game, lacks polish in some places but overall well done and entertaining.  I particularly enjoy the open world flexibility and ability to apply stealth, hacking, shooting or a combination to get the job done.  The atmosphere and ambience of the world is also good at sucking me in.			"

												My first experience of the Syndicate Universe was playing the ""Bullfrog"" Syndicate Wars port on the Playstation when it first came out. Never played anything like it at the time. It was completely alien, cold and heartless in a way my younger gaming self hadn't experienced since Doom, or possibly Mechwarrior. I sunk countless hours into that game and have yearned for something similar since. So when this game was announced, I crowdfunded it and followed it from inception.I have to say, this isn't Syndicate or even Syndicate Wars. It's something of a blend of the two, with a nod towards modern sensibilities. I like it. I like this alot. For a start, it's beautiful looking - everything is slicked with rain and dingy. The soundtrack is spot on. It's the cold synth hell of a totalitarian neon-nightmare in audible form - very Vangelis. I'd liked to have seen some of the augs visibly change the clone models though, or maybe the various attachments on the weapons visibly change the look of the weapon. That's me being picky and probably spoiled via ""AAA"" titles. The visuals are lovely in any event, but could have done with being a bit more ""grim."" Sometimes it reminds me of the World of Warcraft graphical style, which I don't think suits the source material or the feel of the title.The open world maps are large and simply gorgeous. The various districts seem alive and populated, there's traffic etc. The only problem I have is that it doesn't seem ""alive."" Again, this is probably an issue with me: the many years since the original Syndicate have given us GTA and FarCry - large, populated worlds that respond to player choices etc. I just wish the cities in this game responded to the gun-fights and hacking activities of the agents. It does seem somewhat lifeless, but in retrospect this is probably more a nod to the ""feel"" of the original games. It doesn't detract from the fun though.There's a multitude of choice in terms of how you can approach the various missions and a myriad of ways to actually infiltrate a base or assasinate a target etc. It really does offer that wide ranging choice to individual playstyles.Give this a go. Support the developers on this one. "

Would be tempted to do a rerun. Very cool sandbox and defintely captures some of the old gritty cyberpunk feel that the original sydnicate had.			"

								One of the best games I've ever played on PC. I'm a big fan of other RTS-games, especially XCOM-EW. This is a game among few for me that makes time fly, seriously addicting! It's a little bit hard to get a hold of all technical stuff and the terminology, but when you get into it, the game is AWESOME! I reckon the replayability is quite high since you get a hang of it pretty much after about 50% of the game. It becomes somewhat easy when you level up your characters (most recent missions I've been able to use stealth with the soldier and infiltrator and clear one mission every 10 minutes). I've been playing this in version 0.93 so there are some bugs, but not many at all (even though NPC:s getting stuck after about 30 minutes into a mission makes you tear your hair..).I give this game 8,5/10			"

								This game is going to be a modern classic for the more hardcore-minded PC gamer crowd.  I can tell just by the design so far. Right now, the game is not near anywhere done. But you can already tell its going to be a winner. I'm probably not going to put more than 5 hours in until beta, because there is a long road ahead. But just with this design (total throwback to days before the conventions of genre were not universal like they are now) and the cyberpunk esthetic (looks great) and off-the-rails freedom this game allows, and ... well let's just say its going to be a lot of fun. For those who aren't super-old and familiar with the originals:   top down view. Real time tactical gameplay. Four [set] character types on your team you control.  Non-linear gameplay (you have your choice of missions in large city map). Guns. Research. Murder, hacking & corporations. What could go wrong? Put this on your wishlist and buy it next sale, you won't be disappointed if you like the look of the screenshots or videos, you'll like this game.			"

												Just bought it yesterday and 7,5 hrs on one day!  I loved syndicate and this game gives the similar flavour.  Finding new weapons , recruiting new agents,a big mega city with all kinds of corps and cops are always on you. I am just in the first city zone and I hope there are more zones than 3.  Its not fair to compare may be but there were more guns and equipment in syndicate.  But I am in the first zone and hope to see much more equipment and destruction in the coming zones. A small flaw, I couldnt use vechiles( may its me) and collision with cars doesnt give damage. Sometimes AI is acting weird especially enemy doesnt see you despite you are in front of them. but it doesnt happen oftern and most of the time you will spend your time escaping from guards. If you like cyberpunk buy it, if you liked syndicate definately buy it. 8/10			"

								True to the original Syndicate with so much more. It really is like playing in a sandbox of Bladerunner.The Good:-Customisation - augments, gear, weapons, cloning and many skills for each different agentResearch - so much to capture and reverse engineer for your own useThe town - so many facilities and different ways to breach each of them from sneaking in to loading up, knocking out the cameras at their front door and blasting away until they stop coming.Enemies - so many different ones, including an ED-209 look alike I blundered into...team wipe and respawnCloning - Hijacking enemy soldiers that have good stats and cloning them for your own useGuns - lots of them and mini-guns too...The Bad:-AI could be better, the enemy doesnt seem that intelligent when trying to flank your position, they just try to run straight past and get mowed downAt some point I will run out of content (25hours so far and have done Downtown + industrial maps). I just hope it doesnt happen too soon (X-COM enemy unknown I'm looking at you!).			"

												Satellite reign puts you on charge of 4 agents that have to fulfill missions in order to gain authority and climb the enterprise ladder. You can either choose to shoot your way through or hack and sneak your way to the objective.This game could have been a really good one, but it only will get a 7/10 from me for some things it just does horrible and that could have been done way better easily.Pros:- More or less open world to explore and seek missions- Different classes that can be tailored toward your needs- Good looking world design and graphics- actually challenging- you always have the choice of playstyleCons:- Repetitive after a while. The missions are always the same: get into base X, sometimes get NPC X and escort him, but nothing really interesting.- Horrible menus and map design, all characters, map and loadout are put into one menu you have to click your way through- Abilities are really the boring standard cyberpunk arsenal, nothing that is even remotely interesting or new (hacking, drones, for hacker class, tank ability and berserk mode for soldier, field heal and squad buffs for support, melee and cloak for infiltrator)- Cannot save when you actually need it, no quicksave (in enemy tarrain not even out of combat)- Unclear what actions award what quantities of EXP, many things are not well enough explainedI can recommend this game, however it would have been nice if more interesting stuff would be added and the menus need a clear rework. Apart from that I had fun with the game and it kept me interested, I can say I do not regret buying it and it is worth its money.I will update this review as additions or patches will get released.

												FInal Verdict-Finished game. PLUS THE ONE MAJOR FLAWProbably a lot of people bought the game because it reminds them on syndicate, and it truly gives off that feeling.It's a great game, let's get that out of the way. Sure the pathfinding at first is a pain, but after a few hours you will understand it. The game does lack a story line, but like most cyber punk stories, big biz runs things so you can fill in the gaps.The game has an awsome idea, you have four clones who each have a role. A soilder, support, hacker, and infiltrator which I'll get into detail about the roles at the end of this. Your hacker can hijack people who have better stats and send them back to be cloned, so you can switch into their bodies...Or you can form a little army and make them follow you and fight with you. Game play is what it's all about. This is where it may lose some people. You are tough but the baddies are as well, it's like not like you can have 2 hold a choke point,  while two other clones go ahead because you will get beat down.  There is very little out flanking moments because generally it feels like you all have to aim at the same baddie at once. Plus since it's point and click as well as a far number of keyboard commands which are a mess because the button (G) stands for your bombs, but more than one clone might have bombs. It's possible to do flaking when you have a small little army with you, but everyone you hijack is labled as number 5 in response to keyboard button control. You can go into a combat zone and say this is group one and group two because if you hit ""1"" or ""2"" it will just select one of your clones.So in other words, your fighting in a cluster. I'm not sure if this is meant to be like this, but I don't think it is due to the roles of your clones. Your support clone even can slow down time to get people to a different location but your energy level goes down really fast. Which is anothe flaw with the game, even running takes away your energy fast, faster than any ability. In the end I really enjoyed it stil, I hope there is a DLC.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Roles of your ClonesSolider: No heavy weapon penality-though they don't come in till mid-to late game. He has a few abilities where he can take or give more damage but the energy depeletes so fast you bearly will use it.  He can hardwire generators and turn gas pipes. Support. Basically your healer but he can scan for targets and read peoples stats. Other than that he is just sort of there as another gun.Hacker: Probably your most usable character. He can hijack soilders and people to either fight with you or send them back to clone. Of course he can shut down systems and take control over doors. He also has drones. Much of the time he will be running around hijacking people. infiltrator: Sort of like your theif/sniper. The clone can clock which doesn't last long, and the sword ability can kill with one thrust, yet again you run into recharge time and energy issues. They can also sneak into places, which you can augment your other players to do so as well.Since there is a gizmo called a hacker proxy, basically this clone becomes important because the clone doesn't have to equip the stealth generator and your hacker generally has almost no energy because he is controlling hijack soilders. They can sneak in and turn off cameras. The sniper riffle is powerful but very slow, you don't have to use it, there are only two sniper rifles in the whole game, but using it does give you some special abilities			"

												It's just not very good. I tried to like it. I slogged through the whole thing, but it's just sort of empty and soulless.First off: preformance is just terrible. Even on minimum with a 3770K and a 980ti I get about 40 FPS at 1080. During the course of play, it slowly drops down to sub 20. It's just not acceptable considering how ugly the game can be.The mechanics are... meh. A lack of auto-return fire means sometimes you'll have a dummy who's not fighting back because of the really bad AI. Your guys will get stuck on things constantly, often getting blown to pieces while you try to figure out how to free them. Research is sort of weird, and honestly I could never really care to dive into it.I had no attachment to my agents. Upgrading the clones was a tiresome chore where you hunt through the city, try to abduct a civilian/solider, and then hope you don't set off an alarm. If you do, you'll be forced to run around town, Benny Hill style, until you lose them or run off to a safe point. You'll do this a lot to upgrade your guys, but you'll also be doing a lot of the same 5 or 6 or so activities through the city about 90 times each.I can't even speak about the story because it was pretty much conveyed by a British woman that was hard to hear during all the gunfire/etc.I wanted to like it. It's cyberpunk. It's just not very good.			"

												Loved this GAME! I'm huge fan of Shadowrun, but this was ever better.Game give you lots of options for solving problems:If your breaking into a facility and there are cameras you can solve this in a variety of ways; sneak around them, cut the power, hack in and put them on a loop, or just shoot them with your gun. This is just one of many examples of how the game lets you change the way you approach different missions. You can post a sniper and clear the area or just detonate the door and go in guns blazing. Or maybe hack the brains of the enemy soldier so they start fighting each other as a distraction, or have them join you and start building an army to clear the place out with (I always found that to be the slowest method since reinforcements are endless).There is a lot of mission variety too. Stealing: prototypes, information, money. Rescue. Assainate. Sneak in a spy. Hack in to their network. Even as you approach the mission you can take the bruteforce method or gather intel: pay off a disgruntled employee or do a few favor for them to make the job easier.			"

												While I ams preparing for final infiltration to DG tower and, I have to drop a few words here. When I heard during the KS that someone is going to re-create the Syndicate...or better...create game that would look like, feellike and play like Syndicate, I was like...Whoy. Shut up and take my money!Waiting for the game, waiting for every new piece of information, backer update etdc...I was patient. When beta was out, Ive tried a few minutes, maybe hours, and thought...well this is looking good, Ill wait for the final. And once final was out...I have 71 hours in the game now, if I can trust Steam, and it was time of pure pleasure and fun. The game didnt try to amuse me. It allowed me to amuse myself. Playground and toys are all at players disposal, the way he chooses to use them is up to us. I was wandering around those four districts, and after finishing nicely prepared missioopns I have repeatedly infiltrated oponent bases, making fun of those, dehonesting them,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them in their houses and in their most private moments.Because that is what the game feels like. It is terrible, brutal and inhuman/transhuma/posthuman world, where you can sntch mans body and puppetmaster him to the grave, and once he is of no use, you throw him away. Bussiness is build on this, religion is built on this, and possibly even immortality of those in power. And you are nothinhg like savior of the world. To compete those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, you act exactly the same way, doing whatever it takes to get the job done. Syndicate was mess. This is ultra. One can sy, that the game lacks the blood...I say it doesnt need it. Plasma burns dont bleed.Variety of playstyles is IMO overhelmming. From silent individual infiltration, well coordinated team operation to heavy weapons assault with rockets and plasmaballs flying everywhere. Silencers, Katanas, machine guns, laser minigiuns, suicidal bombers...hell it is a ride to hgell and back again. Multiple times.I certeinly hope 5 Lives take this as a start to continue in the same...or better...kind of production to the future. Because the game is simply brilliant. See you on the Bullfrog bridge whemn I am done with the tower, and we will discuss what else. In case it is all a set up and I wont make it back, good work guys.			"

												Satellite Reign is a modern take on Syndicate Wars. You control a team of agents that complete various missions in real-time squad-based tactical combat and stealth. If you like this kind of game there's not a lot of options out there and Satellite Reign is a good entry into the genre. Check out gameplay from the release version on PC (ultra settings) here:

												I had to make a new review for this one due the last update they did, the game no longer stutter from time to time, not as bad as before and I think the solution for that was with this annoying new feature. The darkening of unseen areas makes sense, but if you're commanding the action via a ficticious satellite, then the idea doesn't look very smart. But the game stills great, and I still think they should call this game differently. Something like Syndicalizer, Syndicator or maybe Bullfrogger. When you subdue a civilian, old times calls you, only the spinning sound effect is missing. Maybe a mod can do it. Just don't mess with the music, it is dark enough to rule other people's mind.			"

												Sorry guys. I'm yet another Syndicate fan, crazy-biased in favor of this gem.It feels like the original Syndicate through-and-through. The amount of customization, research and complexity is just right. The game has definitely evolved from the original clumsy controls and hard-to-keep-up-with action. So far every compound I had to infiltrate posed a unique challenge, forcing me to use wide variety of tactics, quiet and loud.I was hoping in the future updates to have slightly greater aesthetic impact of various augmentations and weapon mods on the actual model of the character. Knowing Unity, I don't think it's that hard.So at this point do we consider Bullfrog back in action? Or are we calling it Bullyfrog now?			"

												In fairness, this game is well made, and you can tell alot of development time has gone into it. That being said, that is not the same as this being a good game. Overall I'd say this game is decent, but your agents won't really react unless you tell them to, wich means they have to be controlled in all and everything they do.Another thing that shows this game has had alot of development put into it is the amount of things you can do straight away in the game. There's alot of different missions or objectives to follow up on, either to get cash, information or something else. Problem is, it's almost too much. The amount itself is managable, but the problem is it's very difficult to determine what's most useful, and what different objective will provide the most gain. In short, it's alot of information, and it becomes tedious to digest it.If you do have alot of time to spare to get into this game, and you don't mind micromanage your agents all around, then I belive you can have alot of enjoyment from this.For the casual gamer though, I'd say only pick it up on sale.

												A nostalgic revisitation of the venerable Syndicate, being a tactical action game in a Cyberpunk setting with a retro style. You can feel the effort put into it by developers through the recreation of a number of qualities, such as a beautiful city, research of augmentations and weaponry, and character classes as well, but game falls short on a list of issues. Mainly, gameplay feels a bit repetitive as quests are basically very similar; the scenario is always the same city, and I haven't a found a single building in which you could enter; there are few characters that aren't well developed through the gameplay, lacking a more atmospheric background, not to mention AI issues.It is a good game, but even a bit more polishing would have greatly improved its overall quality, and as well some more structural development.

												This game is a great throwback to Syndicate!It maintains a lot of the feel of those games, but with some interesting reinvention, and improvement. The game is very pretty, and the map is huge. Being open world with free form missions works really well for this title.The combat took a little while to get used to, so I did a lot of dying at the start, but it's good fun once you're on top of it.Very much hope this game gets a sequel, I'd love to see basically more of the same, but perhaps with some more time spent on vehicles, destruction tech, etc!

												I really wanted to like this game. I've played it over and over and it is just too clumsy to achieve what it set out to. Agents are restricted to what they can do. You are encouraged to use stealth but there is very little way to see what is the stealthy path and avoid obstacles. Opening doors has an unneccesary timer. Camera controls are basically non existant. It's a great try to revive a classic game and style but it doesn't make it.			"

												If you buy it for the coop: DONT. The game is playable in coop, but the game design and the level design are not adapted:When you play solo, you control 4 agents and you always have something to do. When you play coop with 3 friends, you control only 1 of the 4 agents. And each of them is very specialized. So, in a lot of situations, you have nothing to do...It's like playing an RTS where one player build the structures, a second one control the ground units, a 3rd one control the artillery and the last one control the air units. Well, actually, it's worst than that... Because it's also like playing QWOP with every player controlling a limb!			"

												looks like a promising game but I can't stand the controls especially not being able to rotate the camera more than a tiny cone but needing to find cover behind buildings and such out of good sight. I can't play it because of the terrible controls. And all the keyboard controls make no sense at all and I'd have to basically remap them all. Any dev who puts assigns random stuff to wasd and then puts a directional control on arrow keys and has non-remappable mouse commands probably doesn't play pc games. if they improve the controls and hud in future maybe I'll give it another go as the actual game still seems promising.Also if the little time I played lots of graphical glitches of missing textures on maps and squad. The starting guy has no head! And even some of the ""working"" textures make no sense. ""hmm how can I get up that 6 ft ledge. I wonder if my guys climb. oh, they can go past that but it's not actually a ledge it's just flat""			"

												To claim this is the 'spiritual successor' of Syndicate is a dishonour and an outright lie, shame on 5 lives studios.No drivable cars, no environmental destruction, no 'weird/crazy' weapons/gadgets like Syndicate, semi personalised characters, no world/corporate domonation... group feels like petty armed thugs running around the 'dead' streets killing and stealing with no purpose, not some organised, professional group fighting for or bringing down mega corps working from some secret base/HQ/whatever (I think my 'agents' live on the street, I mean you couldn't assume anything else as there is no home base).... it feels pointless and without meaning.- AI both NPC and character AI is horrible and frustrating.- Bugs, glitches and poor performance.... still today (2016)- Weapons are boring and simple and seriously lack diversity... no strange and weird weapons like Syndicate or SW and weapon attachments are no subsitute for the weird and awesome weapons of the originals- Augmentations are weak and boring in terms of diversity/types.- No tactical pause, which is needed with terrible AI pathfinding and no combat mode/stance.- Cities feel hollow and dead, things move around but its no living city.- The environment is beautiful- Cannot configure my agents as they have 'personality', clones/agent are meant to be a base/stock unit I can configure and build how I like but they are pre-defined archetypes I can only slightly modify them from whats forced... imo ruins the whoile idea- Backers still haven't received the physical rewards.- Game world looks beautiful, but then so does thief2014.... both are boring lackluster game.Please devs, stop ruining classics by remaking shallow, boring junk... if you're not going to do it properly f'k off.... a remake of Syndicate/SW with the tech and knowledge of 20 years should have been a master piece, a classic.... sadly into just another bad remake in a long list of bad, money grabbing remakes....

												Don't know what to say here; I've played this for a few hours and encountered nothing but annoying bug after irritating glitch. I've lost at least an hour to autosaves that didn't actually save, being forced to reload half way through a successful stealth through a compound because a drone glitched out on a set of stairs that happened to be the only way to continue through the level, AI that can 'wall-hack' and spot you half way across the map behind cover for no apparent reason, etc, etc. For every two steps forward I made, the game forced me to take one step back because of the lack of polish. I could forgive it if it was me making the mistakes but in almost every case it wasn't.Combat is boring and ridiculously simplistic. Don't expect the AI to do anything more than stand in the open and spray bullets at you until people start dying. There's no skill, tactics, or strategy required here and it's pretty disappointing. Some mechanics simply don't make sense at all. You need a skill to use a zipline? Seriously? I've got a belt and two hands that will let me use any zipline I ever wanna use. Who thought this was a clever idea?The tutorial in some parts just flat out forget to mention some game mechanics - to warn others, when the game teaches you how to hijack people, your target's under a camera. Thanks for letting us know that cameras can somehow see a person getting hijacked! Then shoving the console for turning them off half way across the map. Wait, the guy that needs to hack the console is also the guy that needs to hijack the person? Aye yai yai. This game has potential but it needs quite a bit more work. Based off the experience I've had with it so far, I simply can't recommend it to others at this time.Edit: So after several patches, I decided to come back to this game and see if it's any better. I've made it to the final area of the game and completed most of the missions in the game in all the prior districts. So reading this, you must think, it's a lot better now, right? No. I'm not going to bother finishing this game. My characters are more powerful, they have great gear and I'm quite used to the game play and all the glitches that can and will happen throughout a mission but that doesn't mean this has been much of a fun experience. It's the little glitches and jank that add up. For example, I missed out on the entering CBD peacefully achievement after going through the giant mess to get the cards you need to enter because when my guys went into the second scanning room, the entering door closed first instead of the exit door and blocked three of my four guys from going inside the room. So what did the AI do? It decided to go around the door and right into the restricted zone where everything turns hostile the moment you go into it. I had no control over this, it happened within a second. Great. Thanks, a little bug/oversight and all that hard work gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ I suppose I could have reloaded a save but you know what? I'm tired of doing that. I had to do that constantly just to play this game to deal with all its little problems and issues and it was the final straw. I could give example after example after example of all the little problems like that but it doesn't matter.The devil is in the details and it's a measure of the quality of the game. This game is rife with small issues galore and it's massively disappointing. So 20 hours in and a few hours away from finishing the game, I give up and wave the white flag. And to think that instead of fixing up their game they're adding co-op to it to further compound the amount of stuff that could go wrong. Yikes.			"

												This is definitely a worthy spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars. The cyberpunk setting and art are beautifully presented and the squad based action gameplay is solid. Running amok in a dystopian future run by greedy megacorporations, dishing out countless violent deaths with an arsenal of weapons at the hands of my cybernetically altered agents, while carving out my own place in this world..what more could you want from a game. I would have preferred a classless game with agents totally customizable (including an option to wear the classic trenchcoats from Syndicate) instead of the specific agent designs. Another thing I noticed was I quickly acquired plasma weapons, before even getting the prototypes for the ballistic weapons and other gear, which made alot of it seem pointless. Seeing references to Bullfrog in the game was also pretty cool and gave me nostalgic memories from the golden age of PC gaming. A fair priced game worth checking out if you have played the older games, or even if you're a fan of squad based strategy games. Look forward to seeing what 5live do next.			"

												This game definitely needs a bit of polish, and the areas that do need polish definitely show, but overall it is an amazing game. The tag strategy is a bit misleading, since it has as much ""strategy"" as Far Cry 3 does. This doesn't mean that planning an attack is unnecessary, since the player can easily get outnumbered and gunned down if they are not careful.The music and aesthetic are amazing. The sound design is spot on, and generally the game is truly immersive. Not in the sense of story or plot, since most of the backstory for the missions are text based, and most of the plot takes a backseat to the action. As stated before, the gameplay is great. The fire fights can get pretty intense, and the stealth mechanics (using cover, cloaking, hacking, and hardwiring) are awesome as well. Cover provides defensive bonuses, and most cover is destructable, making late game fire fights even more hectic. As it says in the trailer, it is open world, meaning you can approach a compound however you want. There are some balance issues, such as minor weapon imbalances, being able to replace single use items (grenades, etc) with an infinite- use ammo box, and the proxy hacker.Now for the bad parts. I saved this section for later in the review, since it shouldn't disincentivise someone from getting the game. NPCs and player controlled characters sometimes get stuck on the map geometry, the cover system can be difficult to work with, and teammates may randomly become slower or faster, regardless of equipment.I'm not good at writing conclusions, but if I were to recommend this game, I would recomend it to someone who wants to get into real time strategy, but normally finds them boring. It is an intense yet easy game to get behind, and definitely worth playing. To be honest, this game isn't worth 32.99- I would say it is more worth 20 bucks, but that is just me. Definitely buy it when it goes on sale. If I were to give it a rating out of 100, I would say it gets a solid 78 out of 100.			"

												Syndicate Wars reborn, and the closest you'll get to open world coop Shadow Run.This game is amazing, it's everything I wanted and more.  When I was in highschool I'd play Syndicate Wars with my friends.  We'd plan out intricate hits on corporations, brain wash groups of civilians, and cause tons of cyberpunk mayhem.  Satellite Reign is that plus more.  It's a sandboxed world, and at many turns feels like the original Deus Ex but multiplayer coop (which I've always dreamed of).  The classes are unique and balanced, and as your characters grow you go from feeling like you have no power to completely over powered (which is incredibly awesome when you're wiping out a wave of troopers responding to an alarm and blowing up giant turrets).Another interesting component, I picked this up with my friend that played Syndicate Wars back in the day.  Slowly, our other friends that enjoy cyberpunk and Shadow Run, would watch our stream and start buying the game.  We're about 5 people deep now, and each person's game (you can drop in drop out) has a different progression of technology.  In mine, we have fully augmented bodies, in my friends we have high powered machine pistols and plasma rifles.If you liked anyone of these games this is for you: X-Com, Syndicate, Alien Swarm, Shadow Run, basically any tactical game.The only con I've found so far on the game is in the UI department.  But that's been pretty easy to navigate once you understand the nuances.			"

												SImple short and to the point yes?If you are old school and loved Bullfrog titles then this is a no brainer, its not only as good as Sydicate Wars, it's better. My biggest worry was it would be a short game, HA about 13 hours in at the writing of this and im not even out of the first district. the map look as if there is 3 but since you cant really tell with FOW on im guessing there is more. tons of missions, tons of ways todo them, and the atmosphere is something i have been really missing from current titles man the nostaliga is amazing to me.And agent wise you can ""clone"" anyone in the game, yes anyone, guards, cops, enemy crews, anyone. even your own agents, ugrades are very plentifull and they are all here, cybernetics, armors, guns, silencers, lots and lots of research and prototypes to find.kinda a jumping around review but this is all top of the head and i really just wanted to get it on steam it really deserves one.DEVS - please add more content? dlc's? or maybe another title? really impressed with this game and will be looking out for more content from these guys, really great job overall.

												I have waited so long for a Syndicate Wars successor to come out and this one nails it! Research cyber augmentations, weapons, and gear to enhance your clones and deploy them around the open city with the goal of penetrating enemy corporations strongholds to steal more weapons, gear, and aug plans. You can hack ATMs to slowly siphon money from them, bribe researchers on the street to work for you and guards to give you information or forget your crimes, and hardwire doors shut so that enemies can't get through. They even kept a type of ""indoctrinator"" mechanic from Syndicate Wars, only they call it ""Hijacking"".All in all, I would highly recommend this game, especially with a friend. With each player having two runners the game feels very well balanced. I hope the devs continue developing this game and in the process continue raising the bar on coop tactical combat.			"

												I doubt there are too many reviews of SR out there that dont, at some point, reference the classic game The Syndicate, so there, I'm getting it out of the way early. A lot of the play is along those lines, except in a persistent, semi-open world environment. And that's a good thing! It takes that old atmosphere and modernizes it very well, while adding in a somewhat more freeform gameplay style. The ability to affect the environment (cameras, doors, etc) definitely adds a lot of interesting possibilities to a given run.So if pointy-clicky strategy games or strong cyberpunk environments are your jam, I recommend it. That's not to say it's perfect. I'd definitely have to say that it gets repetetive after a while. I also wish the story was much more fleshed out. There's a lot of potential for storytelling here, but even with the included novella it seems somewhat thin. And as a consequence of that, now and then I found myself getting into that mentality of ""wait, why am I doing this mission again? Does this one matter or is it just for resources?"" Still, I definitely enjoy it. And although I didn't get it on it back when it was a Kickstarter, I'd hold it up as a success for crowdfunding in general.			"

												What an epic game ... I mean I have had more fun with this for $10 than other titles I paid upward of $60 for, this shows me there is still hope in getting back to the days where you would get an Amiga demo disk or game and actually really enjoy the title.These are the types of titles that need more publicity.Fantastic!Dont stop making more and getting better and better ... excellent work all invloved.

Early Access Review
								   As many reviews have stated this is what the Syndicate reboot should have been.  That being said, for a pre alpha the game shows lots and lots of promise.  I played for almost an hour as of the writing of this review and it is painful to tear myself away because I have work in the morning.      I was expecting a lot of nonsense that didn't make sense, with little or no intuitive gui and a glitch ridden experince that I *might* think about playing if they put several more months of work into it... you know the standard early release.     What I got was a well put together alpha that made lots of sense, has a great minimalistic gui and delivers a good game experience (for an alpha).   Are there glitches?  Sure.  Can I get in a car an play destination roulette while flying through barricades?  Sure.   ...but in an alpha those glitches are good glitches that make fun anecdotes and often lead to interesting things the developers didnt expect.  The core gameplay (run, cover, shoot, kill, complete) worked great.  I had some issues picking up new weapons at first but I learned that: 1. double click and 2. if at first you don't succeed try again   Other comments....  The environment is good.  Dark, Futuristic, Dystopian but not dysmal.   Lots of intrigue and places to explore.  Performance is good, I have everything cranked up and am using my DSR on my Nvidia to run at 1.5x native.    Combat seems pretty good, the AI was sharp enough to flank me and seek superior cover and setup interlocking fields of fire. (...or maybe my bots got lucky and I got over excited...  I mean one cop did freak out and try to run back into the police station even though the door was closed so I might be assigning too much credit...  So the Devs may have to confirm that one.)   All in all very, very excited to see how this game developes!!!  Can't wait to finish the existing material.			"

								I grew up on games like Syndicate/Syndicate Wars, and Satellite Reign absolutely scratches my itch for a worthy sequel to that franchise. It has all the elements from the old games that made them great, and a lot of new systems that weren't present before (hacking is one example, and it's crazy fun). If you're looking for a solid cyberpunk RTS full of espionage, subtle (or open) warfare, cloning super-agents, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up. It is LOADS of fun, even in an unfinished state, and I'm really looking forward to playing it more!Incidentally, I voiced one of the newscasters in the new intro. It's pretty neat hearing that in-game. :D			"

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW, 25th April 2015:I purchased this the other day purely because I was delighted to find that someone was creating it (It had gone completely unnoticed by me up until that point).I loved Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, so I was very excited when I came across this.I bought it to support the developers and help ensure that this becomes what I hope it will be, and a part of me was curious enough to want to see what they have done with it so far.In its current state the game is definitely playable (and visually very cool if you like that cyberpunk feel, as others have said) but I think all you'll get from it right now is a feel for the environment you're going to play in and some of the basic mechanics. I've played it for a couple of hours now, but found it got tedious very quickly - I wouldn't recommend buying at this stage *IF* you're hoping for something you can already get your teeth into.You start straight into the tutorial which teaches you the very basics, and are then left standing in the city with little idea of what to do next.There are a few missions accessible through what I'd call the map screen which seems to be playing the role of the in game menu, with tabs for research, missions, system, etc. - It's pretty naff but it allows you to do what you need to do which I'm sure serves the purpose of the early access release. I'm sure the UI will be developed further.There's no sense of purpose yet which is the only reason I got bored so quickly, and I'll probably refrain from playing any further until the game is either much further along in development or actually released.Really excited about playing it again when it's finished, or at least once the aforementioned lack of any sense of why you're there, why you've got beef with the other groups, why should you infiltrate that facility etc. has been rectified - as someone else said in a review, story is important! Openworld / non-linear can be great, but you still need a sense of purpose or you're just working through a mundane list in a menu.Some kind of background story should also give you some context as to what is right and wrong in this world - Does murdering innocents carry any real consequence other than a few police showing up? Does killing the police mean anything more than a flashing exclamation mark in a box and perhaps a couple more police showing up? You get the point.Overall, would I recommend buying it? When it's finished, if it becomes what it's shaping up to be: YES!Is it fun to play right now at this stage? Not really - I would only recommend buying right now if you want to support the devs like I do, or actually get involved in the development process (which of course is the purpose of Early Access).

								The Atmosphere, the visual, the music, the futuristic stuff. It's very good. It's like Syndicate you know the classic old games. Very fun but graphic wise it needs improvement (i mean game lags) and controls need some polishing but hey it's currently in Pre-alpha and contains bugs here and there in the game. You need to expect that.I would recommend others trying it out if they like the old classic syndicate games.You have a group of men being commanded by you just like in x-com and you need to avoid cameras and guards by sneaking past them or you can gun'em down. It's your choice. And consequences are there in the game for example shooting a camera will alert the guards to the area.Thumbs up!!			"

								This game looks like it has alot of potential once its completed, currently it is a very nice showing of their engine and a small taste of their game. But with time this game looks like it will be one amazing cyberpunk game. On a gameplay note I love how they are implementing a stealth system into a RTS style game. Currently they have a few missions and a weak AI.but as said this is still in Pre-Alpha so they are just giving us a little taste of whats to come, and I cant wait. An example story of a fun little expensure I had is below:""Early On you have to sneak past some guards in order to open a gate, and get to downtown. In order to do so I ran my hacker to hack the security cam and turn it off, after that I got my soldier to run into cover while a guard was looking. The guard slowly started to move over to investigate finding my soldier ""hiding"" immediately he started walking him away hands above his head. This allowed me to run my other man to the door and my hacker to open the door. Once the door was opened I ran my soldier away from the guard and over to the opened door... Sadly, the guard didnt put up any fight, he didnt try to shoot me or even chase me that fast. Let alone open the closed door with a keycard or passcode. But then again, this game is still in Pre-Alpha so the AI is obviously going to be a bit weak as said.			"

Combat seems pretty good, the AI was sharp enough to flank me and seek superior cover and setup interlocking fields of fire. (...or maybe my bots got lucky and I got over excited...  I mean one cop did freak out and try to run back into the police station even though the door was closed so I might be assigning too much credit...  So the Devs may have to confirm that one.)   All in all very, very excited to see how this game developes!!!  Can't wait to finish the existing material.			"

								Its an open world rts. Very buggy but to be expected. Gameplay is superb and would recommend. I remember the hatred towards the police and the sick satisfaction of hacking into a minigun toting super cop and watching him blow the others away.			"

								At this point, its definitely early, early Alpha. Even so, the graphics and feel of the game are very much on display, and its clear this game holds a ton of promise! Syndicate Wars was one of the best games I played in the 90's, and this game has the potential to match or exceed that experience. I'll definitely be playing each new update as they roll out!			"

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW, 25th April 2015:I purchased this the other day purely because I was delighted to find that someone was creating it (It had gone completely unnoticed by me up until that point).I loved Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, so I was very excited when I came across this.I bought it to support the developers and help ensure that this becomes what I hope it will be, and a part of me was curious enough to want to see what they have done with it so far.In its current state the game is definitely playable (and visually very cool if you like that cyberpunk feel, as others have said) but I think all you'll get from it right now is a feel for the environment you're going to play in and some of the basic mechanics. I've played it for a couple of hours now, but found it got tedious very quickly - I wouldn't recommend buying at this stage *IF* you're hoping for something you can already get your teeth into.You start straight into the tutorial which teaches you the very basics, and are then left standing in the city with little idea of what to do next.There are a few missions accessible through what I'd call the map screen which seems to be playing the role of the in game menu, with tabs for research, missions, system, etc. - It's pretty naff but it allows you to do what you need to do which I'm sure serves the purpose of the early access release. I'm sure the UI will be developed further.There's no sense of purpose yet which is the only reason I got bored so quickly, and I'll probably refrain from playing any further until the game is either much further along in development or actually released.Really excited about playing it again when it's finished, or at least once the aforementioned lack of any sense of why you're there, why you've got beef with the other groups, why should you infiltrate that facility etc. has been rectified - as someone else said in a review, story is important! Openworld / non-linear can be great, but you still need a sense of purpose or you're just working through a mundane list in a menu.Some kind of background story should also give you some context as to what is right and wrong in this world - Does murdering innocents carry any real consequence other than a few police showing up? Does killing the police mean anything more than a flashing exclamation mark in a box and perhaps a couple more police showing up? You get the point.Overall, would I recommend buying it? When it's finished, if it becomes what it's shaping up to be: YES!Is it fun to play right now at this stage? Not really - I would only recommend buying right now if you want to support the devs like I do, or actually get involved in the development process (which of course is the purpose of Early Access).

								This game is basically an open-world syndicate. You get set down in a city and then set free to raid facilities, kidnap scientists and assassinate executives.As of right now, there are a number of flaws making the game really easy to cheese the facilities, but this is a really solid experience.  It feels right and play well. If you're a fan of Syndicate, you probably should pick this one up.			"

								Dubbed a spiritual successor to the Syndicate series (of two games), this is an early access that has potential. However, currently is a rudimentary game that promises fun, but only delivers shooting, cool visuals, and MMO style gathering through ""hacking"" of ATM's.Alot of things have to change before I recommend this title, but I do hope that I will soon be able to.If the tactical options are expanded upon, the game becomes better optimized, and the lvl-designes improve, then yes.Currently I play this on a 970 windforce g1 gaming edition, and my frames pewter at 24, dropping down to 10-11 after an hour or so of playing. Only spend money if you are prepared to support more than you play.			"

 Satellite Reign  Hobo Assault   Genre Open World Squad Based Stealth Tactical RTS   Plays Like Syndicate, Star Trek Away Team, Dawn of War 2   Positive   True to the root genre.  Challenging. Interesting if underdeveloped cloning system.    Negative   Long load times. Lack of feedback on enemy vision cones or audible detection. Poor performance.    Recommendation Yes. Another great genre has been resurrected. Satellite Reign is the crowd funded spiritual successor to 1993's Syndicate by Bullfrog and Ocean Software. That's quite the pairing of companies, which makes me sad that I never played Syndicate, because from my research, I'm sure I would have loved it. I have however played other games in the genre, so I am at least familiar enough with Satellite Reign's roots. SR is a tactical RTS set in a dystopian future à la Perfect Dark, where city services are privately owned and PMC soldiers roam the streets with assault rifles and drones. You control a specialised 4 man squad of terrorists as they roam the city, destabilise the PMCs, rob banks and kidnap hobos.The game drops you into a tutorial sequence that teaches you the basics. Just the basics. A lot of what happens in this game, you're going to have to work out from experience, because the only place you're going to get information after the tutorial is in the quest log. It's not too bad as long as you have a modicum of common sense, but it would be nice to see some of the features expanded on. The cloning aspect of the game for example is only mentioned in vague terms. When a soldier dies, their consciousness is transferred to a clone which degrades each time the process occurs. You can hijack anyone's neural implants to control them and send them back to base to add to your pool of clones. What I would have liked to have seen is some mechanic where you can combine the genes of 2 clones to create a new source clone. As it is, cloning is just an inconvenience meant to give you some way to maintain your soldiers. The hijacking mechanic has other interesting uses though. I had to infiltrate a shipping yard, so I scoured the backstreets for as many hobos as I could control and sent them on a suicide assault at the front of the base while my squad slipped by unnoticed. Moments like that are memorable, and it's great to see a game that gives you the freedom to think outside the box. Also featured is a prototype research system. When you successfully complete a mission, you will probably steal a prototype. This can be a weapon, gear or implant. Your soldiers can equip the loot, but if you research it, you will be able to mass produce the item. I like this system. It reminds me of XCOM's method of loot progression. Like XCOM, you recruit scientists to research your prototypes. The early researches take about 15 minutes of real time to complete and will constantly drain your funds while it happens. Partnered with this mechanic is the ATM siphon mechanic. You can rob a bank for a one time large sum of money, but the bulk of your income will come from the ATMs around the world that you physically go to and install a siphon virus onto. Most will give you around 20c per second, a rate that can be improved by infiltrating a bank with your hacker. This small trickle of funds means that your researches have to be prioritised. Thats a nice, organic way to involve the player in what I call ""budgetting strategy"". Both systems work well together and provide the backbone for the progression throughout the game. The game looks great, despite its modest download size. The aesthetic is the same classic cyberpunk that we've come to expect since Blade Runner. Lots of neon decorate the streets and the people who populate the world have crazy hair, tatoos and sci fi sunglasses. It's pretty great. What isn't great however is the performance of the game. I have a decent system which sufficed to say should have no issue with this game, but unfortunately I couldn't seem to get more than about 40fps on a regular basis. I was having a blast with the game, but it's a shame that I didn't have the most responsive experience given that the game is largely about precision in execution. Of course, with many technical issues, your mileage may vary, so just be aware that you may also encounter less than optimal performance.The soundtrack in my opinion is serviceable, providing the appropriate cyberpunk techno that you would expect with just a dash of 80's sci fi thrown in for a bit of character. There aren't really any memorable tunes here, but the soundtrack may serve as ambient sci fi music if you have use for that sort of thing elsewhere. I found it decent enough to add to my board game playlist. The soundtrack is available in both mp3 and flac formats.I really liked this game. It's great to see genres returning via crowdfunding that wouldn't otherwise be produced. Satellite Reign is a competent tactical RTS that held my attention for hours and probably one that I will want to replay at some point. It's a nice mix of genres that satisfies several itches, whether you want stealth, tactical firefights or hobo assaults. Highly recommended to fans of the genre who want something new.			"

												This game definitely needs a bit of polish, and the areas that do need polish definitely show, but overall it is an amazing game. The tag strategy is a bit misleading, since it has as much ""strategy"" as Far Cry 3 does. This doesn't mean that planning an attack is unnecessary, since the player can easily get outnumbered and gunned down if they are not careful.The music and aesthetic are amazing. The sound design is spot on, and generally the game is truly immersive. Not in the sense of story or plot, since most of the backstory for the missions are text based, and most of the plot takes a backseat to the action. As stated before, the gameplay is great. The fire fights can get pretty intense, and the stealth mechanics (using cover, cloaking, hacking, and hardwiring) are awesome as well. Cover provides defensive bonuses, and most cover is destructable, making late game fire fights even more hectic. As it says in the trailer, it is open world, meaning you can approach a compound however you want. There are some balance issues, such as minor weapon imbalances, being able to replace single use items (grenades, etc) with an infinite- use ammo box, and the proxy hacker.Now for the bad parts. I saved this section for later in the review, since it shouldn't disincentivise someone from getting the game. NPCs and player controlled characters sometimes get stuck on the map geometry, the cover system can be difficult to work with, and teammates may randomly become slower or faster, regardless of equipment.I'm not good at writing conclusions, but if I were to recommend this game, I would recomend it to someone who wants to get into real time strategy, but normally finds them boring. It is an intense yet easy game to get behind, and definitely worth playing. To be honest, this game isn't worth 32.99- I would say it is more worth 20 bucks, but that is just me. Definitely buy it when it goes on sale. If I were to give it a rating out of 100, I would say it gets a solid 78 out of 100.			"

												It was one of those very promising early access projects that actually delivered later on, and I bought it at it's relase. Sadly, at this point the game had severe crashing issues up to the point where it was unenjoyable because of the crashes occuring every 10 to 15 minutes.A year later, the game has been patched up nicely, I was able to play 5+ hours without any technical issues, so the real game finally started to flourish. I'll do a quick listing type of review on this one:What are you getting Atmosphere: Ghost in the Shell and Deus Ex just had a baby who likes to play Commandos and XCOM. Loads of written information, background lore, severe lack of voiceacting (nobody speaks but the mission info reading women).  Surface: extremely good looking visuals both technically and designwise, good music if you are into 80's retro electro effects and overall wibe (check Dynatron, Magnatron, NewRetroWave on YouTube). Gameplay: team coordinating Commandos-like gameplay with a cover system in an open world (city devided to districts), you go whereever and whenver you like, if you are good enough. Mistakes are harshly punished, but there is a safety net to fall back on and start over. Several layers of character customization (not so much visually), skills, equipment, core body stats, upgrading choices having real serious impact on gameplay. Somebody may use a zipline to get in to a fortress, or you upgraded cloaking instead and have to take an entirely different route, always keeping in mind that you have to work with 4 disctinct characters. Playtime: 6 hours in I'm about halfway done with the first district of the city. I expect at least 3, more like 4-5 disctricts. You are taking over the industry, so if that has as much thought behind it as the rest of the design choices, it's definitly not going to be just 2 or 3 districts.Positives+ Atmosphere, graphics and music.+ Surprisingly deep gameplay features (bribing, information gathering, finances, stealth, the networking of the city and how we take advantage of it).+ Decent playtime, filled up with interesting, really challanging gameplay backed up with excellent world building.+ Well supported by the developers (cooperative multiplayer got added much later for free).Negatives- Gameplay features such as kidnapping and bribing also show the lack of other features (such as being able to try to bribe anyone with a chance of failure and alert, instead of bribe = always works, and you can do it only with certain people, not any guard or citizen to create a disctraction for example). People feel like assets and throwaway tools, and while the story is literally exactly this, it feels wrong on the user side for all the wrong reasons (see below), instead of fulfilling this story.- Only one character has voiceover, and the game is REALLY silent. There are no smalltalk chatter on the streets filled with dozens of people, the floating cars make no noise at all, far more than often you only hear your footsteps in a busy city.Should you get it?10 / If you like retro-neon style injected into modern cyberpunk done well, stealth oriented gameplay and RPG elements with the freedom of choice about what to do and how to do it, I can recommend this game for you. If you are specificly interested in this game, give it a shot somewhat below 20 euros, it won't disappoint. If you are interested in the setting / atmosphere, you want to wait for a much deeper discount (9,99-12,99) and look for other cyberpunk titles in the meantime. "

								The Atmosphere, the visual, the music, the futuristic stuff. It's very good. It's like Syndicate you know the classic old games. Very fun but graphic wise it needs improvement (i mean game lags) and controls need some polishing but hey it's currently in Pre-alpha and contains bugs here and there in the game. You need to expect that.I would recommend others trying it out if they like the old classic syndicate games.You have a group of men being commanded by you just like in x-com and you need to avoid cameras and guards by sneaking past them or you can gun'em down. It's your choice. And consequences are there in the game for example shooting a camera will alert the guards to the area.Thumbs up!!			"

												I spent the first hour stumbling around, confused by the game world, fighting the slightly clunky (Unity 5) interface, and remapping all the keybinds.  ""Pah!"", I thought, ""I guess this game's not for me!""But then I found that couldn't stop thinking about the game for the next couple days; the immersive game world, deep character customization, and heart-racing heists had drawn me in.  After another hour or two of figuring out what I was doing, I really started to love the game.  Highly, HIGHLY recommended. P.S.: If you like cyberpunk and RPGs, don't be put off by the fact that it's in real time!  You get the ability to slow down time considerably, and while you may fail miserably and get your entire team killed early on, the consequences of death are rather minimal.  You'll get better!			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I loved Syndicate Wars. It is one of my favorite games on Playstation. Unfortunately, Satellite Reign is nowhere near as good. This game has potential, but it will not be reached until Satellite Reign II, if that ever comes out.The thing I absolutely hated in Satellite Reign is mouse controls. The agents feel unresponsive sometimes, certain actions are very hard to get to activate at maximum camera height. It's also hard to get the agents to stand exactly where you need for the same reasons. Overall, the controls feel laggy and not precise enough. This makes the game unplayable at times thanks to the fact that it is real-time. I was struggling to control my agents and get them to do exactly what I wanted them to in fights where more than two enemies were involved. Then there's the fact that the game doesn't save your location or certain game state elements. When you reload a saved game it simply places your agents at the neares respawn location. Basically, you can't try a certain approach and when it doesn't work just reload and try again. You'll have to run back from the damn spawn point, get all agents into positions, wait for the enemies to move into their positions... Basically, the game actively punishes you for reloading and tries to force you to live with the consequences of failed actions.This could work for you, but it doesn't for me. I could ignore this if the rest of the game was tight, but it's just not.Enemies keep respawning almost instantly if you take them out silently, makes clearing compounds stealthily to try and make a path for your Hacker completely pointless. It all boils down to two approaches: sneak past all the security cameras and guards or fight your way to the objective and back. If at least the missions had a bit more variety to them, but most of the missions in the first grid are just the same routine over and over again with nothing to do between them except for trying to get better clones. Unless you're REALLY into Syndicate and want something to scratch that itch, go ahead and grab Satellite Reign. Otherwise, I don't recommend it.			"

												This a fantastic game. Balancing strategy, timing and going ham/balls to the wall. It offers mutliple ways to succeed in any mission depending on how you are choosing to play. This flexibility isn't just limited to how to how you skill your team but can be changed between missons by switching equipped Augemntations and Gear. Something that has left me very satisfied when I had to run away from some seriously heavy firefights and came back with my heavy hitting Augments. It is simple and addictive. I would write more but I have to go inflitrate a top security facilityto get me some bigger guns. "

There are no smalltalk chatter on the streets filled with dozens of people, the floating cars make no noise at all, far more than often you only hear your footsteps in a busy city.Should you get it?10 / If you like retro-neon style injected into modern cyberpunk done well, stealth oriented gameplay and RPG elements with the freedom of choice about what to do and how to do it, I can recommend this game for you. If you are specificly interested in this game, give it a shot somewhat below 20 euros, it won't disappoint. If you are interested in the setting / atmosphere, you want to wait for a much deeper discount (9,99-12,99) and look for other cyberpunk titles in the meantime. "

												I really wanted to like this game. I loved Syndicate Wars. It is one of my favorite games on Playstation. Unfortunately, Satellite Reign is nowhere near as good. This game has potential, but it will not be reached until Satellite Reign II, if that ever comes out.The thing I absolutely hated in Satellite Reign is mouse controls. The agents feel unresponsive sometimes, certain actions are very hard to get to activate at maximum camera height. It's also hard to get the agents to stand exactly where you need for the same reasons. Overall, the controls feel laggy and not precise enough. This makes the game unplayable at times thanks to the fact that it is real-time. I was struggling to control my agents and get them to do exactly what I wanted them to in fights where more than two enemies were involved. Then there's the fact that the game doesn't save your location or certain game state elements. When you reload a saved game it simply places your agents at the neares respawn location. Basically, you can't try a certain approach and when it doesn't work just reload and try again. You'll have to run back from the damn spawn point, get all agents into positions, wait for the enemies to move into their positions... Basically, the game actively punishes you for reloading and tries to force you to live with the consequences of failed actions.This could work for you, but it doesn't for me. I could ignore this if the rest of the game was tight, but it's just not.Enemies keep respawning almost instantly if you take them out silently, makes clearing compounds stealthily to try and make a path for your Hacker completely pointless. It all boils down to two approaches: sneak past all the security cameras and guards or fight your way to the objective and back. If at least the missions had a bit more variety to them, but most of the missions in the first grid are just the same routine over and over again with nothing to do between them except for trying to get better clones. Unless you're REALLY into Syndicate and want something to scratch that itch, go ahead and grab Satellite Reign. Otherwise, I don't recommend it.			"

												This a fantastic game. Balancing strategy, timing and going ham/balls to the wall. It offers mutliple ways to succeed in any mission depending on how you are choosing to play. This flexibility isn't just limited to how to how you skill your team but can be changed between missons by switching equipped Augemntations and Gear. Something that has left me very satisfied when I had to run away from some seriously heavy firefights and came back with my heavy hitting Augments. It is simple and addictive. I would write more but I have to go inflitrate a top security facilityto get me some bigger guns. "

												If you've ever played the card game Android: Netrunner and want a real-time, singleplayer (or co-op) version of it where you play as the runners, here you go.This is not a stealth game like Commandos or Shadow Tactics, if you try to stealth through everything you're going to get frustrated. This is a game about staying hidden until the right moment and getting your squad into position before taking out the generator with a grenade from your cloaked infiltrator so that your soldier and support can zipline in from a nearby rooftop while the cameras are down and security is tied up at the generator, then hacking into the commander's mind and opening fire on his minions while your soldier lays down a hail of plasma and your support unleashes nanobots to heal and the distraction ties up the garrison long enough for your hacker to steal the important files AND for your infiltrator to hit the bank vault and walk out with a money sack.And it's good at that.

												Well, I purchased this game back in April, just to support the devs. Now that it's released, I decided to go for a full playthrough. EASILY one of the best games I've ever played. Nevermind entirely topping the genre. All four of the character types have very individual skill focuses, but the whole team is needed to complete most of the missions. The ones that don't require everybody are even more fun than they would have been because you get the feeling of rarity in focusing on one or two characters every once in awhile.The enhancement and gear system is AMAZING, giving you the option to give up stat enhancements in order to add extra abilities that the character normally wouldn't have access to. The ""research/prototype"" system is a GREAT balance of risk vs. patience. The missions in each area gradually increase in difficulty and do force the player to think more as the game progresses.This game is by no means perfect, as the visual customisation is very limited for characters, the doors and NPCs will sometimes bug and mess something up, and the player character movement is definitely not flawless. However, this team of devs has worked ASTONISHINGLY hard to fix as much as possible, as quickly as possible, and hasn't skipped a beat with the official release. Truly one of the best dev teams I've ever personally experienced. They deserve so much credit.TL:DR/Final comments: When all is said and done, if you like a game that allows you total freedom to choose how to accomplish things, requires constant teamwork between all of your controlled NPCs, has a fun reward/loot system with LOTS of possibilities, has gorgeous graphics, and will make you think and pay close attention, this game is a MUST have. Also, if you played/loved the original Syndicate, just go ahead and buy it. There's no way you won't appreciate it.			"

												An excellent cyberpunk action strategy game that is worthy of being reffered to as the spiritual successor to the Syndicate series. The visuals are stunning and the gameplay engaging and fluid, coupled with a great little storyline and intense atmosphere makes for one of the best games I've played in this genre. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer though maybe modding can help that.Here's hoping for a sequel to what could be the start of a great series.			"

												Didn't finish the game yet, I imagine I'm 25% in after 12 hours. So it obviously is lengthy. I did everything there is to do in the first sector, though.I'd consider this game as a mixture of Syndicate and Commando, a real time tactical shooter with heavy stealth elements.You can interrupt circuits, hack doors, bribe officials, cut power, destroy cameras, steal access codes and hack drones to get your task done. Varied approached are valid and yield results.I really recommend it.You need some patience,  but it's nothing compared to e.g. the commando series. Also it's not really punishing if you screw up. You don't lose more than a few minutes of progress.			"

												Pros: almost everything.Have not quite reached the end yet, but so far this has been a deep game with many systems and features, an open world, multiple ways to approach a problem, good writing, good cyberpunk graphics and sound design, and good value for money.Cons: There are two big cons. The first is the AI, specificlally the AI pathfinding. It can get infuriating when your team gets stuck on geometry when you only have a one second window to move them into cover. An enemy team can also get stuck near an entrance you need to access. A shame really.The other big problem is that the game gets repetitive after a while. There are 4 sectors to unlock and by the time I was nearing the end of the 2nd one I was more or less done with the gameplay. You break into the base, you sneak around and you get out. Rinse, repeat.Still a pretty good game though, at least until you get tired of it.			"

												recomended . At first I tried playing none stealthy which was a total fail. If you go the rambo way through the main door kicking everyone the hell out it's almost impossible. The key is reading all the dossiers and entering and hacking the bases and prototypes the way the dossier recommend, that's the way the game should be played. Read everything !!! and fetch all the intel you can, that's the key. I really don t play stealthy games a lot but I liked this one, haven't finished everything but every mission is refreshing and well presented, maybe one flaw is that it has zero replayability because the maps are fixed none procedual. Neat game recommended .EDIT: Finally I finished it, I was not wrong before, it's a really good game. At the end it gets more combat action especially in the final mission. So maybe you can play stealth three or two scenarios but then avoiding combat is really difficult and has to be well planned. It's not stealthy in the way of Invisible inc, is something else is trying not to bring to much units over you, if two or three catch you it's ok you can deal with them, (when you get stronger and update perks and skills you can deal with much more enemies), but if all the enemies that are in the base are at your tails you are done. IMO is a tactical game more than a RPG as other comments suggested , it's the tactis of dealing with the right amount of enemies and taking the best route to the objective and inflicting damage to the enemy where most it hurts. That's how I can summarize it			"

												I'll start off by saying, I've never written a review on steam. I feel I need to now because this game is worth it. I met the devs of this game at PAX Australia. First thing I thought of when I saw this game was ""Syndicate"" and thats what I said, and one of the devs game me a very pleasant smile and said ""One of the devs from Syndicate worked on this game"". Now as a 90's PC gamer and a cyberpunk fan, I was sold. I went back home later that day and purchased Early Access to this game. I'll admit there was nothing really to do when I first played it (e.g. no questing/tutorial). Then I logged back into this game a couple of weeks ago. I am impressed. In the 10 months since I spoke to the devs at PAX this game has improved in leaps in bounds. If you have a couple of bucks to spare definately support these guys because this game needs a sequel.

												As of writing this review I have just finished the final mission, credits rolling etc.In a nutshell, if you have the patience and skill for micro-managing 4 individual characters with a variety of skill-sets in real-time, I think you will enjoy this game. Obvious comparison being the Syndicate series, which this is supposed to be the spirtual successor. Story (4/10) It is a little flat in terms of presenting its story, which amounts to major developments when you move from one district to the next with a little audio snippet from your Handler, but other than that you get most of your story from blocks of text relating to the mission objectives, or the assorted terminals scattered across each district. It does round up nicely, if somewhat very abruptly with a nice piece of music playing which adds some nice atmosphere. Gameplay (8/10) While not completely flawless, and somewhat slow (as if viewing a video at 3/4 speed, though this might have something to do with my PC) it is a very well put together game. I only had a couple of moments where it glitched out, mostly where 2 of my Agents would either stand still regardless of input, or get stuck in the world geometry, and I mean only 2, during my last 2 hours or so of gameplay, though some mechanics did require some key spamming to get the desired effect sometimes throughout my playtime. Gameplay can be somewhat repetitive, as for each district you generally have the same set of objectives to complete in order to continue your long standing goal, but the thing that offsets this is that because of the mechanics and set-up for said objectives, it feels different each time. A good example is the Bank. Each district has a large branch of the Cities major corporate bank, which you can go and smash open for a lump sum of cash, and increase the amount of money you get over time from the hacked ATM's which scatter the City. While the same objective exists in each block of the city, they each have different defenses and physical layout, prompting you to approach each objective in a different way.The shootouts your agents get into can often feel frantic and overwhelming at times, and more so as the game progresses and you meet more impressive enemies. Careful positioning and use of your Agents abilities will see you survive these encounters, or alternatively, just run away, as the Enemies do seem to suffer from short-term memory loss now and again.That said, with regards to the Stealth aspect, its is very hit and miss. While the enemies you encounter tend to follow the Sight/Sound rules much like Splinter Cell for example, if you do wind up in a colossal shoot-out for which you are not prepared, breaking line of sight and moving a good 50 metres away from the hot-spot seems to cause the AI to think ""No problem anymore, back to patrol."" which does seem odd, considering that there is now a massive whole in that gate which I blew open with a grenade not 5 seconds ago.All in all, while Stealth is certainly viable with assorted EMP gear/Sound Suppression/Cloaking equipment and silencers for your weapons, take the advice of Gabriel Angelos, ""Walk softly, and carry a big gun."", because if your luck is anything like mine, you may need it. Your Agents With regards to the 4 Agents under your control, you have your Soldier, Support, Hacker and Infiltrator. Each has their own skill set up, with both passive and active ablities relating to the role they are designed to fill.  The Soldier is the man with all the guns and explosives with a side of technical gadgetry, allowing him to rewire certain bits of hardware such as doors and power generators. The Support helps keep people alive with med-kits (although these can be equipped by anyone, the support gets the most use from them) and increased passive healing for themselves and the team.  The Hacker gets you into fun and exciting places by opening doors, disabling surveillance cameras and hacking into ATM's to help with cash-flow, as well as the various enemies you encounter, by ""hi-jacking"" them. The Infiltrator can get into interesting places via vents and ziplines without any aid, can use a sniper rifle to decent effect, and pifler anything shiny thats not nailed down when sent into a building.Each agent can be equipped in various ways with the variety of gear, weaponry and augmentations that you will pick up over the course of the game, new items of which will require researching before you can mass produce them for your Agents, because while you can equip your shiny new weapon or augment immidiately onto an Agent, should they be killed in combat, you will permanently lose it. So I thorougly recommend researching anything new that you may want sooner rather than later. Graphics (7/10) While certainly nothing to get excited about, the visuals of the game to make for an impressive display, even with the almost over-powering presence of neon lighting all over the place, but this can be addressed simply by turning off the bloom. Sound/Music (10/10) The sounds and music of the game are a joy to listen too. Gun fire and explosions feel just right, with a satisfying weight to them. The music is very atmospheric for the most part, each of the 4 districts having its own ambient track, both when wandering the streets and getting into trouble. Overall, I would recommend this game, though I would advise to buying it on sale along with the soundtrack.			"

												When it comes to dark future scenarios few capture my imagination more than roaming through glittering cities full of neon skyscrapers and augmenting my fleshy bits with chromed up hardware all the while fighting the large corporations that pretty much run the world. Cyberpunk stories have been around for decades and there’s a reason that they’re still popular today. They’re mostly modern retellings of David and Goliath, the “little guy” versus the “untouchable juggernaut”. And Satellite Reign certainly holds true to these tropes in an action RPG that’s a very viable alternative to Shadowrun Returns and its expansion games.http://cliqist.com/2015/09/09/taking-big-boys-satellite-reign/ "

								Awesome, as long as buyers keep in mind...THIS IS A PRE-ALPHA DEMO! IF YOU BUY IT, YOU ARE SUPPORTING THE FUTURE PRODUCT! *DO NOT* buy if you are expecting to add a new game to your library, becasue we probably won't see the final version for a long time. I'm not sure when release is projected, but based on their progress so far I wouldn't expect to see it for another 6-12 months.Based on what I've seen, I can't wait to see the final version. While 5 Lives Studios has a lot of work to accomplish before release, they are clearly on the right track.While some may bring preconceptions to this game--many want or expect it to be a modern version of Syndiacte Wars--I recommend accepting it for what it is: the modern era's first cyberpunk RTS game.So if you want to see this game improve, buy it now, play the demo, and give the devs the chance to put your money to good use.

								Pre-Alpha version:Ok so picture Syndicate Wars, with a big injection of future-sauce. That's Satellite Reign.As a fan of the Syndicate series, I immediately felt at home with the feel and atmosphere of this title.Graphics look good, AI/pathfinding is mostly ok (a little bit of getting stuck on walls, but otherwise fine), sounds are good (though could use some music), controls feel how they should (when they worked - some bugs in switching between characters, would also love a quicker way to switch between weapons. Hopefully this gets implemented in future versions.).Keeping in mind that this is early access I was suitable impressed, and while I am recommending this title I would still say hold off until the game is a little more complete - it's little more than a gameplay demo at this point.

												A fresh take on the old Syndicate game.You run a team of Cyberpunk agents and you can brainhack civilians. Sometimes the brainhacked people might have better stats than your agent. So you make the civilian your new agent. Kinda similar to syndicate missions to run around persuading everyone to join your syndicate.The combat is fun, the stealth is fun and basically the whole game is fun.It isnt to hard for beginners and is well worth the money.

												Solid game.  Nice environments and doesn't try to extend to more than it should.  They could have made this turn based like XCOM but I like how they made the fluid fighting style work.  I do wish they had allowed you to instill a bit more personality and customization into your crew, but it wasn't a big detractor.  I will also say you should wait for a sub $20 or $15 price sale though, as it isn't worth $30.			"

												It does feel like a spiritual successor to good old Syndicate. The atmosphere is where this game shines. Unfortunately, gameplay is not that great. Enemy movement patterns are so random that stealth is not an option during the longer missions deep into enemy bases. No matter how long your guys stay hidden, eventually multiple patrols will circle in on your guys from multiple sides - with no way to anticipate or evade that. Still worth buying, but do wait for a sale.  "

												I really like this game.  It's graphically gorgeous, the tone is savvy, the missions make you think, firefights make you break a sweat every time.Then there's a few hickups, or heart attacks, depending on the player.First issue I had was the lack of tactical pause in the game.  I can buy into the 'this is a RTS, no pause and giving orders' but I've played a number of games that featured that construction (Pillars of Eternity, Starcraft, Age of Empires 2, a few others).  They have this bullet-time thing to replace it, but it costs energy and it covers the screen in this effect that makes me dizzy. If you're not going to impliment tactical pausing, then there should be number 2.Auto-Attack.  I don't know how many times I lost my... we'll call them minions, because they were detected and rather than go hot, they just sucked up the damage.  It gets worse when you have three squads (one of your minions can 'hijack' NPC's and make them allies) and I'm making a firefight while one of my minions sneaks into the fortress and does her mission.  Well... in the course of that time, Squad 1 kills its target and goes to cover, squad 2 goes to cover, I select another target and another, I'm flipping between three squads trying to keep them alive.  It's not fun, it's stressful.  If that's your thing, all power to you.Another issue is that the game still feels like a beta (probably because it just left it).  I haven't seen an issue with graphics (through there is this haze that makes me want to clean my monitor sometimes) and I've only had two instances in 10 hours where my minions got stuck; but pathfinding is sketchy, the auto-attack is missing, places where your minions should take cover aren't available to be used as cover, the sniper (while powerful) is missing a stealth kill function (they have a one-shot kill system if you've not been detected, but your sniper takes about 2 seconds to fire which is 2 seconds your character will be seen and shot at, if it takes that long to make a kill like that, make the time frame longer and with the sniper's range, or half the range, not point blank).Combat feels like a punishment than a method.  Unless you're a excellent micromanager who can manage up to eight characters at the same time.  The auto-attack would make it feel more viable, instead I usually reload or retreat when combat hits because (at the start) your characters are underpowered compared to the opposition which forces you into the stealth system (fortunately, the devs implemented a mission system to relieve the strain after a little work).On the up side:  The Devs are very active and the community isn't toxic.  I've posted a few times and the community was quick on the uptake.  The Devs are explaining their thought process and are open to suggestion,  and I'm hoping that my issues are resolved in the next patch (I mean, if you add auto-attack, this game would rock and roll with a bass drop).Hopefully this game is like a wine that get's better with age (and I'm excited for them to open a workshop/mod system because this game would rock more when the modding community get's its hands on it).  It has so much potential and (for the most part) it's living to that potential.  But it needs a few layers of polish still.  If you decide to purchase this game, you'll get a strtegy game that forces you to plan your movement and the decision to attack is a heavy pro/con system, but you'll get some of the lack-features that really can be irksome (check in a few weeks and hopefully all those issues will be patched!)

Early Access Review
								Saw this at the tail end of browsing before bed, read up on it, most sources said that as it was Early Access there were some bugs, but that the game was more than worth investing in, even taking those bugs into account. I paid, installed, and then forgot about sleep altogether until past sunrise. It fits well with the nostalgia of playing Syndicate, while bringing enough of its own charm to the table.I'd recommend this game to anyone who played Syndicate, wanted to play it, or is simply entranced by the neon lights, music, and bleak environment. Buy it now, buy it at release, buy a copy for you and a friend when it's on sale. Just buy it.			"

												Outstanding, if occasionally uneven game.  The good:  cyberpunk stealth and occasional direct action.  More importantly, it is just plain fun.  I cannot remember the last time I got up in the morning and went ""Oh, I want to try..."".  The game is deeper than it appears with multiple paths to most solutions.   The bad:  The missions and loot appear to be entirely randomly driven.  This is not a show stopper, but I will say that through some poor luck, I had several missions all ending at the same heavily fortified location.  The answer...go somewhere else in the city for a while.   Don't get stuck thinking you need to clear a district to leave a district.  The other major negative is that your operatives have just enough AI to be stupid in a firefight and will not retreat or move when instructed in some cases.All in all, this is a great game and only getting better.

												I've been gaming for 25 years, loved the original Syndicate/Wars, backed this via Kickstarter and was suprised at the level of quality from the game based on the funds raised.Unfortunately at release the pathfinding was broken.  I gave it 3 months (which you've pretty much had to to with all PC games from the beginning of time) and its now improved.  But still kind of broken. I won't go into the great moments and missions I had in the syndicate games, but the greatest thing about those games (which has yet to be replicated) was sending all 4 agents off to do different strategic tasks, like assassinate, blow up bank, stand ground with persuaded citizens and mow down enemies, infiltrate base steal hover car and fly to a point where all agents meet from all corners of the map to extract.Although it might be a performance issue:i7 Processor6GB DDR3 Ramx2 HD5870 ATI Video cards64 Bit Vista OSBut until they get it working you'll never get those moments in this game because pathfinding doesn't work.  I'm gonna shelve it for now, and see if 5 lives patch it some more.  It's a step in the right direction as I didn't expect to see a game like this ever again.  If it is a performance issue then maybe I need to hack into the national grid with an upgraded machine and make the winter nights even darker by the amount of power needed to run the game.			"

												I'm seasoned enough in this industry to have bought and played Syndicate Wars when it original came out.  This is probably the best revival of a series I have experienced.  The team at 5Lives created a deeply immersive environment of futiristic corporate espionage and outright assault.  Environments of gorgeous wet neon glows sprawls that feel like a part of a large megacity.  Each enemy corporation is uniquely differenciated.  Enemy variety and AI are all on point.  Replayable, co op play and mod support.   Can't beat the quality of gameplay and hours of game for the price.			"

												Top notch game. I was a big fan of Syndicate and Syndicate Wars. This game was fantastically new and familiar. I would recommend, but my feedback for the developers in the sequel would be please try to make it a little less linear in terms of development. The way to play is supposed to be non-linear, and this works. However, all you really do is steal blueprints for the next dev, and when you have them all the game is over. I would like to have things still to do once I have upgraded all my units. Also, in the original syndicate there were a lot of different types of missions, like assassinations and so on. These are minimal here, really the whole deal is about getting hold of blueprints. I liked the assassinations and persuading scientists missions from the original games. I also liked getting an income from owning regions, which isn't really present in Satellite Reign. So, I would DEFINATELY recommend this beautifully, playable and addictive game for anyone who played Syndicate or anyone who missed out, but I would like a few more options in future releases.			"

												First time ever I had a hard time deciding to recommend a game or not.I came in lured by the beatifully crafted dystopian world and the promise of a Syndacate gameplay,and to be honest, for the first 4 hours it delivered.Now, after 10 hours and a bit of reading here and there I'm sorry to say, this game falls short gameplay wise, and it really would hurt me to downvote it, because I tried to love it, I love the graphics and the feeling of it, but there's little in there to be called ""Game"".Plenty of reviews already out there that explain exactly why the combat and the overall experience is lacking, it's a game full of style but no soul.If you're wondering why, after all this charade, I'm still recommending it, it's for the main good point this game makes, and to me, that is we NEED developers and games like this to try and give justice to all the franchises EA and its merry friends nuclearized over the years, this game falls short, but it's a sincere attempt, not a cashgrab.That means while I didn't enjoy it to the end, it is a game worth trying nonetheless.

I love sneaking around and overriding security systems, hacking into banks, rewiring power stations and the like.

												So I bought this as soon as it came out of early access and so far it has been great. Very cool cyberpunk atmosphere, an open world, good selection of abilities and equipment, and lots of other things that all add up to one excellent game.I particularly like how every mission can be approached in multiple ways. For example say you have a mission to go steal a prototype piece of equipment, well you can just run in guns blazing and hope you can fight your way through waves of guards and steal it. If that isn't your style you could pay an informant that might lead you to an employee who will, with the right incentive, unlock a back way for you to fight through more easily. Heck, maybe you like stealth and would prefer not to fight anyone, well you can do that too.I do however have a couple things that I am not the hugest fan of but in reality are relatively minor. My biggest gripe is that the game does not make it very clear as to how far or what the guards can see, and sometimes that can make stealth a bit of a pain. Also I find that often when entering and exiting stealth your selected unit will get confused if you try to give it a command immediately afterwards, which when you are short on time can lead to being spotted out by a guard.All in all though, Satellite Reign is a unique experience and worth checking out. If you are on the fence and looking through reviews to see if you should buy this game, all I can say is that I have been having a blast so far and that it was money well spent.I give it a 9/10.			"

												It's a pretty good game but I'm reluctant to recommend it at the current price.  It's rather short and there isn't a lot of replayability in it.  Unless you're really into these kinds of games or you're a fan of the original Syndicate, I'd wait for a Sale.As a fan of the original Syndicate, Satellite Reign really does feel like a true spiritual sucessor.  But like other spiritual sucessor games made years later through crowdfunding (I'm looking at you in particular Wasteland 2) too much nostalgia has crept into the more recent game, and not always for the better.Some thoughts:Aside from the first area and the final encounter there was rarely any need to use tactics, especially once you're well armed and have a highjacked unit or two in tow.  I did just as well mid-game with all my units running and gunning together than I did trying to be creative.AI can be a little wonky at times.  Nothing too major, but you have to babysit units since they won't always return fire or find cover and sometimes they'll try to fire through objects in the environment rather than go around for a proper shot.  Some pathfinding issues too, but again, it's fairly minor.Having four units with different capabilities was a nice touch, but more often than not it just meant the other three stood around while one guy used his unique abilities.  I found more utility in using their skills on the interactive bits in the environment; hacking doors, cameras and guards or shutting down generators to avoid combat.The interface is clean and intuitive.  The skill buttons were on the small side but I didn't end up using many of them aside from Scan, Hijack and Grenades.Some players have an issue with the lack of an auto-pause, but I never found it to be a major issue.  There is a ""Bullet Time"" type skill that's a close enough analog.The research and trickle-in income system (through hacking ATM's) is a mixed bag.  This is one of those nostalgic bits that feels like it needed work.  At least 6-8 hours of my 27 hour playtime occured while I was tabbed out, waiting for research projects to finish or money to accumulate to buy new upgrades.The visuals and atmosphere in game was excellent.  They nailed the cyberpunk aesthetic.  Although the story was forgettable the flavour text in logs, notes and descriptions had some nice touches.All in all, it's a solid little game thats worth a playthrough.			"

												I want to preface this review with ""This game could be a solid game, but it has a long road to achieve that.""To start with, and what I think is the most disturbing issue I've faced so far: there's something horribly wrong with how this game writes data to disk. The game locks up when loading/writing save files or game content. The graphic animations stop, the game gets jerky. It can, and will, lock up on you when it tries to overwrite your autosave file. When it does crash an autosave file its going to set you back hours of gameplay and I hope you had a backup save slot. If you didn't, well. That's unfortunate.The other major problem I have with this game is the pathmapping and how the player interacts with the environment. Both are, well, they're bad. Use an ability while you have a unit in cover? They stand, but they don't return to cover. Now they're spotted. Any tile with multiple, overlapping, cover from different directions can sometimes render it impossible for you to select the cover direction you wanted. Unit decided to use the cover facing north instead of east? Now you're spotted (which leads me to question why units can only benefit from a singular direction of cover instead of two+ when utilizing corners. It makes sight-lines very awkward to predict). There are times when you must fight the camera to get cover ticks to appear so that your unit won't stand in the open. If you miss this opportunity they'll simply stand over the cover tile instead of actually getting in cover. Now you're spotted. The pathmapping doesn't properly recognize doors. If you click on a platform that has either a vent or a door between the two, you'll find your unit stopped, facing the wall instead of using the door or vent. If you're needing to escape this can cause you to lose units unnecessarily. Several units can ""stack up"" on one cover tile, which, while amusing and sometimes exploitable can be a serious problem. Having ""run"" be a double-click function of ""walk"" leads to an issue where your unit will stutter in animation and can lead to delays in getting a unit where you want it to go. Having a two-key run function instead of a one-key two-stroke would have been better as then you wouldn't get animation stutter nor would it slow your unit down. Not that this matters too much as the AI is just about as bad as the pathmapping. If you manage to hide in cover, even if the enemy knows exactly where you are and could easily walk around a corner or crate to engage you, they won't. They'll get into cover themselves, and eventually forget your existence. This leads to a rather exploitive gameplay style where instead of having to out think the AI, you just let it get bored and return to its predetermined routine and shoot it in the back of the head. There is no point in upgrading guns or taking clones with any stat beyond run speed and energy. Once you have the silencers unlocked the standard pistol becomes the most dangerous weapon in the game. Any time you are engaged by the AI you can run, hide and allow them to forget your existence. If one does manage to engage simply have your hacker mind-control them and the rest will sit there until they disengage then silent kill all enemies.Honestly the game becomes very repetitive once you get good at manipulating its flaws. Its an endless cycle of equipment grinding, which, thanks to hte black market, its rather pointless. You can simply hijack all the ATMs, have your units sit somewhere safe, then walk away from the game and allow it to grind cash for you. Go make a sandwich. Read a book. Play Poke'mon. Then, when you're done, come back. Buy the blackmarket upgrades. You're not punished or penalized for this style of play. It saves you from having to grind out missions to get the gear that you could simply wait and obtain anyway. If these issues were addressed I'd be happy to change this review. I don't think it will happen. While the development team is active in fixing bugs, they seem to be struggling with issues that crop up... and what I've complained about would require complete overhauls for how the game handles objects, cover, pathmapping and AI. If they're stuck on clothing crashing the game I don't think they're going to have the time, resources or talent to rebuild the game from the ground up. So it will remain flawed and my review will remain negative.			"

												A couple of hours into ""Satellite Reign,"" I thought to myself: ""This is going to get stale soon.""It never did.In terms of raw gameplay, 5 Lives hit the ball all the way out of the park, down the street, and into the next park. Every overall gameplay element - combat, stealth, hacking, world traversal, hardwiring, character management - fits into every other element with near-perfect fluidity. For maximum effectiveness, you'll be asked to combine various elements at various times, on short notice and under pressure. I suppose it might be possible to set up a near-total stealth run, but the game is much better when you're smoothly blending stealth, combat, and just plain-ol' running away as fast as you can.Oh - and remember that world scan ability, because you're going to need it to figure out how the world is wired up.And it's seriously entertaining.Every infiltration turns into a realtime, high speed tactical puzzle with multiple solutions - including subverting the fast tempo and taking a super-cautious route. The amount of thought and care put into creating a large number of viable options for each problem is very noticeable, and highly impressive. The game is great at making you feel smart; There's a special satisfaction to scanning over a target area with the camera, and finding a really sneaky way to get in.Of course, there are also the pulse-quickening moments where you suddenly realize that you've kicked the hornet's nest, and the way you came in is NOT going to be the way out.If there were some way to Frankenstein this with the recent ""Shadowrun"" offerings, you would probably have the ultimate cyberpunk RPG. Just by itself, Satellite Reign is 100% top-shelf, and a must play.			"

												I played a lot of Syndicate and Syndicate Wars when I was younger and they were the best games I had ever played. Satellite Reign is a worthy successor to the first game.It takes the idea of the original Syndicate and expands upon it. Instead of 4 identical agents, they have roles: Soldier, for carrying the big guns, mitigating damage and ""hardwiring"", Support for healing, buffing and debuffing, Hacker for, well, hacking, and Infiltrator for getting silent kills or getting into restricted areas without being seen.It's fully open world, unlike Syndicate which had separate maps, this game takes place in one large city with different sectors. All research and equipping is done on the fly. The real joy with this is that you can be walking down the street and come across a restricted area. You can look at the facility from the outside, maybe using your support to scan for more information, then plan your way in. Do you go in guns blazing or sneak in, grab the loot and sneak out? It's entirely up to you and either way can be extremely satisfying. In many places they may look intimidating and dangerous at first, but should you study them enough, you can usually find a very easy way to get in and out. I love that.I won't lie, it took me a bit to get used to it and get into it but now I'm hooked. At the time of writing this I'm about 27 hours into the game and it looks like there is still plenty to do.Problems: The AI pathing is atrocious. The amount of times I've lost agents or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off enemy corps because the ai decided to take a short cut through barriers of poison gas or to glitch themselves into a restricted area...Another small problem is that, now I've had so much time in the game, I can really exploit the mechanics of the game. I know how it will react when I do something and it's just starting to feel very easy now. Maybe that's down to the power of my fully augmented and equipped agents somewhat too. It's still a lot of fun though.This game is great, despite some really dodgy AI and pathing. I would have liked to have more customising on the agents, but you can't have it all. Not only is this game good, it's also precious. There are far too few books/movies/games with cyberpunk themes nowadays, and this game does a great job of keeping that amazing genre alive.			"

												Satellite Reign isn't like Syndicate precisely, it isn't like Syndicate Wars exactly.... this is what would happen if all your favourite RTS, tactical, squad based, grand strategy games got together, had a gene swap and made a single offspring. The depth of approach, multiple methods of completing a ""mission"" (there are no real missions, just milestones on the road to victory which can be achieved in any order), tactical options and impact of team upgrades is massive. Whilst remaining true to the spiritual predecessors of the Syndicate franchise the leap forwards in game design and evolution of the genre is as much a surprise as the previous 2 games. You have NOT experienced anything this deep, replayable, diverse or rewarding. I have lost count of the number of times I have attempted the initial objectives in the ""wrong"" order because I didn't really have the right skills and didn't realise it until I got in to the objective zone. I have attempted to do things I don't have the equipment for, the right agents for, the right weapons for. None of this mattered, each failed attempt mearly made me more determined to push fowards, try a different route through a base, try a different approach etc. I am only a few hours in to this game and can already see the next few weeks of my life being devoured by it. Any fan of the Syndicate franchise NEEDS this game. Any fan of RTS, tactical squad based, strategy games in general SHOULD need this game.Anyone that has a PC should at least TRY this game, it is genre setting moments like this that defined the PC, Amiga etc. and placed them above consoles, REJOICE, the golden times are here again.

												Got this in a humble bundle. Thought it looked like trash. Decided to give it a go and found it's actually really good. It's an open world squad based RTS with elements of Shadowrun, as well as Fallout Tactics. It's a shame I didn't try this game earlier. If you like Squad based games, if you like RTS, you would probably really like this.Unfortunately, I have trouble getting more than 30fps on it, even on the lowest settings, but it isn't the kind of game that needs 60fps, since your view isn't constantly moving. It would be nice to get an optimisation update, but it's not essential.			"

												Made by an Australian developer, 5Live Studios, based in Brisbane, this game pays homage to Syndicate of the early 1990s but in a way that more resembles XCom Enemy Unkown insofar as: - it's a very pretty game, - there are significant streamlinings to the game systems- the emphasis is on fun, rather than on punishing the player...Some people think that XCOM casualised for the console market, but I disagree, and believe that it was an excellent example of how to make a game for people that no longer have the time to invest in games as they once did. Satellite Reign is such a game that it respects the players' time, with a brief but very helpful tutorial system that orientates you to the game world and a number of streamlinings (fast travel) that make it so much easier to have a play for a little while in between feeding a baby (personal example) or cooking dinner...The game looks fantastic, it plays brilliantly and is intelligent in design and very well-structured. A credit to the studio - you made a triple-A game on a shoestring budget. Thank you for your work, I hope you are all very well rewarded. Congratulations ! :)			"

												This game reeks of slopiness.The load times are painfully long.The game stutters on perfectly adequate systems.Almost all the missions I've played thus far have consisted of sneaking or fighting your way through an enemy base and then going through a door.Pathfinding and agent movement is terrible so you'll regularly find yourself getting spotted because your character did something dumb.Agents regularly simply ignore your commands, getting you killed.You can't tell for certain whether you're behind cover or not.It's 2016 and people in this game are still trying to shoot each other through the walls and floor.I could probably go on but a laundry list of flaws doesn't make for a very good review just like it doesn't make for a very good game.

												I can't say that I was a huge fan of this one. I bought it for co-op play, but then found it to be quite dense and somewhat confusing. There are a lot of interacting systems, and very little to no tutorial on how to navigate them. In addition, even with another player, you find yourself controlling multiple agents at once. It is difficult to coordinate these two characters at the same time, when attempting to pull out weapons, avoid cameras, and time your routes.I feel that the game would benefit greatly from a more in-depth tutorial, as well as turn-based stealth and combat.  However, this environment seems to have a lot of potential.			"

												I will never understand why this game's performance has never been good since launch. I beat it on singleplayer with poor fps that would range from 30-55 on any setting and constantly fluctuate. Months later when I would try the co-op multiplayer, the performance still has the same problems on any setting. ""Low"" yields worse performance than ""Ultra"" which is not ideal. For reference, I use a GTX 970, an i7 4790K, and have 8 GB of RAM.The game itself is fun, but has a repetitive mission structure throughout its zones. In general, you'll hack ATMs and/or data caches, walk into a bunch of green garage doors as the final objective, escort people, and escape the area with or without prototypes. Co-op allows for some much faster gameplay as responsibilities are divided up between players. Alone, handling four characters with different abilities, managing any drones, hijacked people, and escorts can be difficult because it's all real-time. I'd recommend the co-op experience over the singleplayer one. The planning and execution aspect can provide a real good time. For example, deploying your sniper to play guardian angel on the top of a building while the other three team members hoof it to the green garage door to complete the mission using grenades, hijacked enemies, and the support healing everyone. There are also many different approaches to reaching objectives. You can be sneaky, disable the power, use hijacked guards as passes, hack doors, look for side entrances, use ziplines, or even utilize vents. I found it satisfying to plan routes, evade detection, and fight my way through places.Still, it's not all good. In addition to performance problems, there are many bugs still present. I've seen my co-op partner and enemy npcs become stuck in buildings. I've seen the enemy walk through buildings. The pathfinding can be terrible for the player. The cameras still respawn so those achievements are still impossible without using some kind of magic. I also remember falling through the world once during the final mission (near launch date). You also can't save the game in a hostile zone, even if it's just a single team member present, which can be real annoying if you're deep inside. I suppose you could just sacrifice the character to the guards and take the degraded clone penalty (less bonus stats from hijacked people used as bodies for your main team) and then save. I still think the biggest problem is the abysmal performance. If you can look past the unstable frames, you might be okay with Satellite Reign. Otherwise, consider looking elsewhere (Frozen Synapse for a non-RPG, turn-based tactics alternative) or waiting for a sale (so you can play with a friend).			"

												Disclosure: I'm a backer of Satellite Reign (lowest pledge level for getting a copy of the game). Being a backer of Satellite Reign, I was expecting a game pretty close to the good old Syndicate series, as I have very fond memories of that title.Having played Satellite Reign during Alpha, Beta, and since release and comparing my gameplay experience to that of the 90s 'Syndicate', I can wholeheartedly recommend 'Satellite Reign'. In this review, however, I'd like to point out the major differences of 'Satellite Reign' and the original 'Syndicate'.  Feature Satellite Reign Syndicate   Game Goal get access to and dominate all city districts complete all regional missions for world control   Level Design open world, seperated by city districts containing public areas and restricted areas, further restricted by cameras, locked doors, NPC patrols fixed levels, very mission-directed   mission / objectives approach stealth, lethal / combat, decoy - may need to be adjusted ad-hoc based on current situation persuadatron / hijack all enemies and/or combat enemy agents   combat less meaty, more tactical, requires good mix of weapon types (laser, pulse, mechanical) and character abilities to play effectively meaty (miniguns!), heavy abuse of the AI (hiding behind corners and pinpointing enemies)   character progression agent experience acquired via ""doing agent things"" (mostly) in restricted areas, improve agent stats via acquiring stat-wise better clones through hijacking, and looting & researching better equipment from missions character item based progression (new implants, new weapons)  "

Some people I've spoken to seem put off by the real-time tag but it's worth noting that it can be played as real-time with pause if you so wish. Regardless of how you choose to play it it's a very nice isometric squad based tactical game with a decent cyberpunk feel. It's no Shadowrun but then what is.			"

												Satellite Reign is very much a successor to Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, and not just in a spiritual sense. The aesthetics, the music, the angles everything is very much Syndicate Wars 2.0, sadly this includes not only the good parts, but also some of the warts.Once the action really gets going, it can frankly be impossible to react, not only because stuff can happen in the blink of an eye, but also because agents are often very unwilling to abandon actions they're already in the process of executing, and because if two things that can be interacted with overlap, the game sometimes insists that what you REALLY want to do is click that vent, not the enemy trying to gun you down. Agents also aren't terribly clever, they occasionally have navigation issues, and you'll NEVER want to use rocket launchers, because they rarely think to shoot OVER or AROUND obstructions immediately in front of them(and there's no indication of the rocket's trajectory or blast radius to you, the player, though there is for usable items such as grenades. Perhaps the rocket launcher and its siblings should have been usable items, not main weapons, if it's an issue with the interface?).There are also a few weird bugs left over, largely related to extreme height differences. For instance, I had an escort mission where an escort, upon entering a vent would, rather than leaving its exit point, leave its exit point... but be severely displaced on the Y axis, resulting in me not being able to take him on the same path as my agents.Overall, I enjoyed Satellite Reign, though it was definitely at its best when I could maintain stealth, because the combat... wasn't very fun. The weapon stats almost all looked basically the same, with few indicators of when something was more efficient than something else, and combat tended to be over pretty quickly in any case, because there was rarely any strategy that worked better than liberally spamming grenades(crazily overpowered if you maxed your Soldier's ability to carry and use them) and then focusing fire on the survivors(you rarely have any real reason to split up your guys except in the early game before they can all use the same navigation options thanks to augmentations, so focus fire is an option in 99% of all cases).Triggering an alarm was also often not a huge deal, even without silencers it was often possible to just off the guards with no reinforcements coming, and at worst it was an extra wave or two. On the one hand I like that one mistake didn't send me zooming off to the quickload button like in some stealth-involving games, but on the other hand sometimes it felt just a tad TOO forgiving, too.The AI also tended to have some weird decision-making at times, triggering random repercussions against civilians and even inter-factionally(as another group than the one owning a given compound would sometimes show up to investigate destroyed security cameras there).The ending was also a major letdown. It was over just a bit too quickly, though thankfully it maintained a health level of challenge(getting cocky almost got me totally gibbed), and then the ""reward"" at the end  was just hearing some British woman yelling swear words and insisting that ""She"" betrayed us! Oh no! And then everyone explodes. Considering that I could probably figure out who ""She"" was, and who the British lady was, from reading plot snippets discovered during the game, it's not exactly out of left field but... ""She"" never features in the actual gameplay at all, and the British lady's only function is to chatter during the tutorial and then at the end of each city district. The setting obviously had a decent bit of writing and thought put into it, but most of what you encounter, setting-wise is just in text snippets... you never really interact with any of the major players(bar one, at the very end), and functionally the factions are much the same except for their outfits and that one of them seems to deploy big minigunners a bit sooner than the other two. It would have been nice if the game had done more showing and less telling.Ultimately, this review is pretty critical, so it may sound like I'm going to NOT recommend the game... but I can't in all honesty do that. It easily dragged me in for hours at a time, and I guess that the reason the issues it had grated on me as much as they did was because it was really, really close to being really, really great. As it is, though, it's just decent.			"

												The game is great, but these two aspects were deal breakers for me:Enemy level scaling. Break into a complex, steal some prototypes, get out, equip the prototypes and get back into the same complex, and the guards will have magically been upgraded. To me it breaks the open world feeling because whatever you do, you can't an edge on the enemy.Your agents won't auto-attack. I don't like having to micro-manage my agents for every single kill they do. This makes open firefights so tedious that I ended up relying mostly on stealth even though my agents were not built for it initially. "

												It is the best game ever... on the trailer. The art style and atmosphere is great when you just look at it. The numerous customization of squads are crazy. However, the lack of pause function and terrible AI cancels all my tactical options whether in stealth or combat. The ambitious level design presents you some really cool spots but the set up of guards are so mindless that it results in some bizarre difficulty curve, jumping from impossible to milk run and then back every other hour. The writing is so bare-bone that it abandons any personality or background of characters and organizations appearing in the game.For more reviews and other article about games, visit my blog[silverthorns.kinja.com] "

												I was excited for this game and hoped it would be good, and when I finally got it in the steam sale I couldn't wait to play it. Unfortunately, it was far below my expectations. It's rare a game makes a bad enough impression in a short enough time for me to refund it, but this game pulled it off.TL:DR at the start: Game sux, I refunded it.Longer Review:At first the game seemed fun, like a sandboxy commandos-esque awesomefest. I love cyberpunk in general and cyberpunk games with RPG bits especially, so it had already found a way into my heart. The tutorial made the game seem good, everything worked and I didn't see any of the bugs or control issues people reported in the early access. And then the game proper started and it♥♥♥♥♥♥itself.This was my experience: I attempted to sneak into a location, some corporate warehouse whatever. On my first attempt, I slipped past the cameras, and herded my agents/cats into a corner to wait for a patrol to pass. As it did, it left one man behind, and I thought ""Perfect! Stealth kill time, I'll pick them off one by one"". Then I hit the stealth kill command, and my agent spun around three times and unloaded a clip into the box beside her, alerting every guard in the world to my location. I was swarmed and reloaded a save.Then came strike two: Loading a save puts you back at a checkpoint anyway! To me at least, this game seems like one rife with experimentation; all stealth games are. Yet if my experimenting leads to failure and I die or reload, I just get sent back to the start of the level anyway? That sounds insufferably annoying.After I made my way back, came strike three: I shot out a camera. I did not realize that this was, in fact, the greatest crime that would be committed within a century of my purchasing of this game. I had been warned that shooting out cameras would attract attention, I'll admit. I had not been warned ""attention"" meant nuclear countermeasures. Every guard in the level swarmed me. Dropships sent in elite troops. The Future Navy Seals sent in every man they had, plus some kind of terminator/rambo hybrid armed with a minigun shooting rockets. Even employees of the rival company of the facility I was infiltrating showed up to stop me. Finally, they all just decided ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and glassed the entire city to stop my heinous rampage of destroying 1 camera. I felt this was slightly excessive. Exaggeration aside, the level of response to this, and I assume every violation of stealth, was insane. I enjoy playing stealth games through my mistakes, but it feels incredibly intimidating knowing one ♥♥♥♥up with call down the entire wrath of the world's militaries. Finally, after receiving another sound thrashing, and beginning to question whether this $6 was worth it, the game decided to answer me with a fourth strike. Along the way to try again, I stood next to the door to a restricted area. I did not enter it: I was standing in the street. I don't know if a camera spotted me through the wall, or if the guards are just that paranoid, and I don't care anymore. All I know is, despite doing nothing and standing in the middle of the street, and alert was sounded, and for the third time in an hour every guard in the entire level began swarming my position.I closed the game, saw I had played 111 minutes thus far, and took it as I sign that the universe wanted me to refund it. So I did.			"

												This is my first review. I guess I was that disappointed with this game.I really wanted to like SR, as I have been a fan of Bullfrog's Syndicate since the 90s. But I got frustrated really fast and had to push myself to finish it (and only after boosting my agents with some cfg tweaks).The game can be a bit addictive at first and it does have its moments, but I found the experience, as a whole, lacking and underwhelming.(1) The world is visually nice. The graphics, atmosphere and lighting are all great. But my first and biggest gripe is that you rarely get to see this vibrant world, because 95% of the time you have to be in tactical mode (World Scan) in order to see objectives and targets etc.(2) My second biggest issue is with the mission design. While the ""theoretical"" choice to approach missions either via stealth or direct conflict is nice, the game pretty much forces you into stealth, which is more like Invisible Inc than Syndicate to be honest.Open war is out of the question since enemies spawn endlessly and are stronger, unlike the original Syndicate which was all about mayhem and being a superior badass agent. I found that agents' damage was inferior to the enemies and lackluster (except for a few guns later on, e.g. cannons). Also agent survivability is inferior, even when using cover. I found myself dieing constantly while being unable to kill enemy soldiers fast enough. What's funny is that the same soldier was doing a lot better when not hijacked, as if hijacking reduces the damage and survivability of units?!Other problems include:(3) Getting into cover was a problem, since the click indicator is small and finicky (unlike XCOM for example). I died many times just trying to get into cover.(4) Too much micro-management and keybinds: I found myself skipping or nor using many skills as it got overwhelming in real time combat.(5) Path-finding issues like agents or enemies sometimes getting stuck in terrain.(6) Performance issues: FPS dips, low FPS and occasional crashes, even on a high-end rig (GFX: GTX 980Ti, CPU: 4790k @ 4.5GHz, RAM: 16 GB @ 2400 MHZ, SSD for OS and Games, <1080p res).(7) Missions bugging out and not finishing even after completion.(8) Missions getting repetitive after a while.(9) Very annoying ""can't save"" alert.PS: I was running the latest build v1.06.05 on Win7 SP1 64-Bit.I just hope these things get fixed!

												I saw all the reccommended reviews so I picked it up on sale.  Game was really frusterating until I figured out how to level up.  I had a few bugs which prevented me from being able to get exp but I got that sorted out.   I think the concept is really good and I really liked it at first but the game just tapered out and I have no desire to spend anymore time with this game.  Didnt even finish it, hell, I bareley got to the industrial area.  Clunkly controls, Ai that is too smart 1 second then dumb as a rock the next, the guns feel like nerf guns, you have to click like 5 times to get the character to move a block and then they stop halfway, sprinting takes too much energy, and the enemies seem to infinitly spawn at times.  Theres more but I would rather just say that I didnt like it at first, gave it a chance, then I really liked it, and now I feel really disappointed in this as it could have been so much better.  I may try the multiplayer but trying to controll all the units at the same time in active combat is just way to much to do when you die so quickly.			"

												Suprise, suprise they did not fix the framerates issues before release.  I have been a long time supporter of this game from early kickstarter days and I am really disappointed in this studio.  It was brought to the developers attention very early on and constantly throughout the alpha and beta that the framerates and optimization were horrible for this game.  Every time the developers would respond with a one sentence response of ""the game is cpu bound"" with no explaination as to why or a fix for the performance issues.  Why on earth in 2015 would you make a game that is cpu bound.  The minimum and recommended system requirements are a joke, don't expect more than 20-30 fps with a system well above the recommended specs.  Ultimately I have to give the game a negative review because of the above issues.  I think this small studio bit off more than it could chew, the game needs a lot more optimization.  If these issues are fixed in the coming months then I will change my review to positive but at this point I would not pay $20 for the game.			"

												This is a good game, HOWEVER, the speed in which the game plays is horrid. I know that the Devs are working hard/researching on ways to make it run faster, but as of now, it's choppy. Performance aside, like any game around here, you start with nothing but a pistol. As the game progresses, you earn a rifle, then you upgrade your skills so that you are harder to kill. You can clone your teammates with stats from a gaurd that you stole (Literally stole). Everything in that game is technology.You have a Soldier (Whose Mr./Ms. Bad-A tank), a Support (Mr./Ms. field medic with stims that slow the world down), a Hacker (Gets you the money and blinds the camera feeds) and a Infiltraitor (Cloak and dagger lady/man). These four are your ""Corporate Espionage"" team. You steal from others and claim it for yourself. Oh, and you can do bank heists, but remember to take all of your team through the doors for a lot of cash.All in all, until the Devs ramp up the processing speed, this game is only for the patient.

												Successfull succession of Syndicate/Syndicate Wars! Great gritty cyberpunk atmosphere with great visuals and soundtrack. You can slink your way around or go out in a blaze of glory!A couple of improvements could be made to this game:1. More customisations to your characters (like XCOM). If you put bionic arms on or add a silencer to a gun you should see that on your peeps!2. Most of the guns sound weak sauce (pew pew), they should sound way more brootal!3. Fix the performance issues! Please add Crossfire/SLI support.			"

												Great squad control action game!  This game is a tribute to the timeless sci-fi classic Syndicate Wars.  You control a group of 4 agents in this dystopian future controlled by corporations.  It has a Shadowrun / Blade Runner environment and the end game is ironic to say the least!			"

												Just played through the single payer, was good for about 30 hours.For anyone who doesn't know this is like a reboot of the old Syndicate games.I must admit though after having my eye on this for ages I am somewhat underwhelmed.The game looks stunning, the style of the game is great and in keeping with the whole ""Syndicate"" feel. It sticks relatively close to the originals, so you have a reseach queue, you can upgrade your agents weapons and augmentations (body parts) and you can get gear. They have also added some extra features such as skills and cloning.My gripe with this game is some of the stuff that they changed is worse, and also the lack gameplay features. Lets base the differences from Syndicate Wars, released a mere 20 years ago.    There is only one ""team"" to play    You cannot seem to drive cars/or blow them up    Infact in Syndicate Wars lots of stuff was destructable, in SR basically nothing is    No flying cars    No huge tanks that shoot missiles at you or those huge spider tank things (infact there are spider tanks in Satellite Reign but they are patetic)    Lack of explosive stuff in general    You cannot pick up/drop weapons (this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)    No trainsThe level design is also less creative, basically evert part of the game is the same in SR. The gameplay throughout is just very samey. Basically you go to various sectors of this one big city which all look the same, break into certain locations to gain stuff and thats pretty much all you do. There are very few missions that take place in the public areas, and the few that are will be to pick up a package or kill someone, they are straightfoward. No ambushing you, or surprising you like the old games did.They have added a stealth system in, so when you enter locations you can disable security cameras etc, and sneak around, however it is clunky, to the point where jsut walking in and shooting is better. They have set it up so you can go through the vents or side passages or whatever, but there is little point when its easier jsut to walk in the front door shooting, and when did a Syndicate game become about stealth anyway??? The combat is slow compared to the old games. There are no also enemy agents, only police and security, which do differ in strength, however even the elite bad guys are no real threat and the only real threat is when you become outnumbered.The tech tree is also messed up. The way the game works there doesnt appear to be any major order in which you gain tech, or for my playthrough, I ended up getting the second best weapon about a quater of the way through the game which means I only ever ended up using about 4 weapons in total. As you can easily jump ahead, most of the weapons/gear/augmentations effectively become redundant even before you get them, which is a shame.They also want like £22 for this on Steam which for what you are getting, is a rip off. I got it on a deal but I would say unless you can get it really cheap dont bother.I know I've slagged it off pretty royaly, its actually not that bad, but Bullfrog did it much better.			"

												Sweet setting and concept. Mediocre gameplay hampered by braindead AI, constant backtracking through the same infiltration levels with randomized guard placement and pathing, and a core gameplay loop that becomes ""repeat the same missions in a more complicated area"" with very little variation. Asking $30 for this is crazy.EDIT: Finished it since I bought it. Definitely some balance issues with the classes (Infiltrator is a god, soldier can get built stealth and solo literally everything, hacker sits there and support is a tron view toggle), the weapons (heavy weapons blow) and the augs/Gear (Anything that gives you the ability of another class is nuts). Ending is meh.			"

												Considered that I only paid 12€ on one of the Steam Sales this is a must have for every Syndicate fan. Although there a some minor bugs this not only looks great but plays great as well. The only thing I can complain about is the lack of updates and upcoming content. If you want to spend some hours in a great indie game you should go for this one.Pros- nice graphics- nice story- soundtrack- arsenal, research and lots of stuff to equip your agents withCons- sometimes your agents won't find the right way to their target location (happened only on long distances)- very few glitches where cars drove in circles while glitching a few pixels- AI shoots against walls or tries to run shortest way possible which ends up with guards running against walls. (also happened only a few times but it's there)			"

												This is a wonderful game! it is such a good idea, such polished graphics... there is so much to look at all over the neo-noir place. Did you ever play digimon world 3? if so, you can kinda realize the feeling im talking about but without all the sheity backtracking and grindfest.the idea of making your characters immortal by successive clonning is just brilliant.  please disconsider how they look like something out of a disney villain plot. progression is kinda str8 forward, but hey, this is a minor issue and the game is still very enjoyable characterwise.so why the negative review you may be thinking...well... this game does not run like poop. no no no no! how would they, the developers, do that? they could do better :DIT RUNS LIKE A WHOLE LOAD OF DIARRHEA! D:quite frankly, i never thought a game could be so underoptimized. Im not talking about some fps clunkiness, no no no!I AM EFFING TALKING ABOUT BLUE SCREEN WHEN I FRIST TRIED TO LOAD THE GAME. ok, now i am done with all the /capsyelling. sorry. it is just that it is revolting how such a promising game can run so much like poop like this. true, the AI is dumbest than some president's followers very bad most of time, and the pathfinder a bit better than crap, but still useable. to add to this whole load of poop, it doesnt look like the game is going to get any better in this sense. very sad...

Intense and gripping game play ranging from diffucult firefights to complex and tactical infiltrations into corporation strongholds, police stations and armory's.

Early Access Review
								I stopped playing this game for a while after initially buying it in early access and I am blown away by how much progress this small indie studio has made in such a small amount of time. Gameplay has improved, loads of content has been added, the game has been substantially optimized and loads of bugs have been fixed.So what is it? Short answer: it's a reboot of the original 1994 Syndicate. For those of you that haven't played the original Syndicate: It's a cyberpunk themed game where you command a specialized team of agents. I guess you could call it a RTS with action and stealth elements. As you play your agents gain skills, you research new weapons and technology and can outfit your agents with augments.The developers have created a very believable dystopian future city that you can explore, do missions in, sneak around in, fight in, and in some cases manipulate systems in to give you an edge over rival corporations and security forces.You have to play this game for at least a few hours to appreciate why it is so good. It reminds me of Deus Ex in that the more you upgrade and outfit your agents the more possibilities you have in terms of infiltrating compounds. It's up to you whether you'd like to go in guns blazing or if you'd rather take a carefully planned approach.For example, you can hack an enemy drone and let it fly past all security to check the place out before you go in. Then you can have the drone attack key security cameras that you'll need to get past. The enemy will destroy the rogue drone, but they'll have no idea you were controlling it. Then you send in your infiltrator, using stealth to avoid being seen, climbing through vents, and picking off lone guards with melee attacks and a silenced sniper rifle. The tactics in the game are really deep and really well thought out.The only criticism I have is that I'd like the clone, augmentation and inventory management interfaces to be revamped to feel more tactile and impactful. Augmentations were a big part of the original Syndicate and it feels a bit hollow in this game.Overall though, great game!			"

Posted: July 31, 2016
												For those who want a short, snappy review:This almost beats Masters of Orion 3 as my most regrettable gaming purchase.I love Syndicate. I long ago lost track of how many weekends I spent on my SNES, happily using the Persuadatron to mind control drones, and later I did pretty much the exact same thing with Syndicate Returns on the Playstation (never did find the Graviton Gun). I was utterly delighted when I found out a game billed  as a spiritual successor had been released and as soon as I could, I snagged a copy.And now I kinda really, really wish I hadn't.The game is supposed to be set up so you can go through in two different ways - guns blazing, old school cyborg killing machines slaughtering everything or stealthy, in and out before anyone ever knows you were there. I decided to try the stealthy approach (the game actually encourages this, you get more experience for your goon squad by sneaking into places. Hell, there's a string of achievements for doing it!) but good god it is AWFUL. One of the main rules about making games is that the player should always be involved - you should always have something important happening for him/her to react to. There really shouldn't be a point where the player has so little to do they think 'why am I playing this?' Well, if you try and go stealth, that's exactly the question you'll be asking yourself as you sit there waiting for the various guards to sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowly make their way somewhere else. I have a book here. To read while I wait for the AI pathfinding to decide to move the NPC guards away from the place I need to go. At no point in a video game should the person playing feel the need to pick up a book to keep entertained while waiting.I suppose I should give a few points for actually setting up random pathing for NPC's instead of just having them patrol the same route for all eternity though. It even spawns different NPC's every time you load. The developers were obviously trying to keep things from getting too dull and to give the game some replayability (the various weapons and items you can aquire are randomised as well, or so I've been told). I just wish the NPC's didn't also seem to have randomly determined sight and hearing as well - sometimes the guards can't see you if you are stood right in the open twenty feet down the road directly in front of them and sometimes they can see you from off the screen and through the wall you are trying to hide behind.I don't think I'd be too bothered about all of the above save for one thing - the save system is completely awful and probably the worst I can think of. You need to be near relay beacons to save. Okay, save points. There are plenty of them, and you can warp directly to them. That's not so bad, right?Well, you can only warp to them if you A. have all your team alive, B. not under attack or C. not trespassing. Whenever you go into a mission area, you are most likely going to be trespassing. See where I'm going with this? (Here's a hint: go reread the bit about randomised NPC's, I'll wait here. Done? great!) You want to sneak into somewhere, you can't quicksave, so you can't chop it up into managable little bits, you need to do the entire section in one go. Trial and error time, right? Oh, wait, no, because the NPC's change where they are everytime you reload! It pretty much comes down to pure luck, and that's a slow and miserable way to do things.There's also the obvious problem of not being able to save if you need to leave suddenly or whatever - you can't pick this up for a quick five minute session, set aside an hour or so or just don't bother.What else? well, the graphics aren't utterly terrible. They aren't amazing, and the way the camera pans slowly from side to side doesn't help. At all. It's actually giving me a headache. It does look all retrofuturey cyberpunkish but it just looks utterly washed out. It's raining, of course - pretty sure there's a rulebook somewhere that states any game in a dystopian future is only allowed to have scenes set in the rain at night.All told, for anyone who wants a game like Syndicate, you could always snag an emulator from somewhere and play the actual SNES version instead.Edit: Okay, like ten minutes after I type the review and I'm back, I need to add this in: There literally are psychic guards in the game. I just spotted one who couldn't have seen my team at any point suddenly stop patrolling, turn around and run right over to where everyone was hidden and only then stop and turn on the 'Gosh, these people aren't supposed to be here!' orange flashlight of doom. This wasn't 'oh, I got a bit too close and he spotted me', this was 'he suddenly knew where we were from across the compound while my team was hiding behind a wall that was itself behind a second bigger wall'.

Posted: September 16, 2015
												This is my first review, so please don't judge too harshly.For the record, I just beat the game and it took me 45 hours to do it.In terms of visual design this game is an absolute delight: it really looks like a full-fledged city. There are night clubs with music so loud that you can hear it oustide, video advertising on buliding facades, futuristic cars, neon lights, parks, restaurants and so on. And yes, you can zoom in to savour every detail or zoom out and just take in the city in chunks. The mission areas are part of the cityscape, only walled off and guarded, so no loading screens that disrupt the continuity of the experience.In terms of mechanics the game has its pros and cons.You get four distinct agents to complete various missions: soldier, support, hacker, infiltrator. They have common skills that you can upgrade, like health or weapon damage, and unique skills that justify their presence in the team. They also have rather distinct weapon preferences. Overall the game attempts to grant you many different ways to tackle missions depending on your overall loadout and play style and you are certainly welcome to try different approaches. However, this is where the problems start. Mission areas were obviously designed with stealth in mind, but despite my best efforts in 75% of cases i ended up shooting my way through. This is due to several reasons: - the AI sometimes just knows where you are. You stealth several guards, hide, another guard comes running and starts shooting in your direction which immediately gathers the attention of everyone around, and now you're facing 6-10 guards. All except the one shooting have no idea what the're doing there, but you end up being forced to shoot your way through them - guards can simply spawn. You quietly clear a path to your target and on your way back you find that every guard you've killed has simply respawned - the second point also makes planning an operation close to impossible. There is no way to find out in advance how many patrols there are, what are their routes, who you should avoid and who you have to take out. On the one hand it makes the mission more challenging and realistic but on the other simply irritating and unpredictable - for some reason the gurads' cone of vision is not limited to their flashlight. To be on the safe side, assume that if he's facing you and you're not hiding, he'll see you - most annoying, you can't save during a mission. So if things go south, you'll be forced to retry. Again, more challenging and realistic or simply irritatingIt is also suggested that you can clear some missions using only a single agent, but I found that to be highly impractical.Most likely you will either be unable to get to the location you need, or simply get swarmed by the AI.Finally, I would like to mention what is in my opinion the game's two greatest shortcomings: the game world and the story.Your actions have absolutely no effect on the game world. Just blasted your way through a corporation's manufacturing and business center, killing half the guards, hacking the other half and stealing everything you could get your high-tech greedy hands on? Fine, no one cares. As soon as you're in the safe zone, assume it never happened.And last, there is virtually no story in the game. After having beat it, I have no idea why the world is in the shape that a saw, how did the corporations come to be and what they are about, why was what I did important. I was hoping that the ending would answer these questions, but it never happened: it simply made no sense and raised more questions.Overall, if you're looking for a fun way to pass the time or ""try something else for a change"" (like I did), this is a great game.

												So, Satellite Reign, where to begin... the game is a spiritual succeessor to the 90s Syndicate games. For those, who are unfamiliar with those games (like me), it is an open-world RTS about corporate espionage set in a dystopian cyberpunk setting. Gameplay-wise, the game plays like real time open world XCOM which can be played guns blazing, using stealth or combining those tactics. If you liked those missions in RTS campaigns, where you get no base and a few hero units, this game is for you. The game has absolutely stunning visuals and manages to sustain the atmosphere of dark and depressive future whether you are exploring a rich business district or a dirty, soulless industrial district. The music is beautiful and fits perfectly, working in harmony with a symphony of neverending rain. The story is quite intriguing, but only if you are willing to work for it a bit. It is spread across 40 pretty well-written log files, which are scattered across the world and revealed by interacting with log terminals. If you ignore them, the ending will make no sense, so I suggest you don't.  The gameplay itself is really solid. You control a team of four agents (Soldier, Support, Hacker, Infiltrator) in your quest to undermine other corporations by assaulting their compounds, stealing their prototypes and money, killing their top employees. Each of them has unique abilites that make them useful and even though you can solo many facilities with a well-equipped Infiltrator, using your whole team is more satisfying, earns you more cash and sometimes even extra prototypes that can only be acquired by bringing a specific agent to the compound. The missions can be quite long, but some shortcuts can be often found outside the box. Hacking a terminal or shutting down a generator well hidden outside of an enemy facility can greatly increase your chances. Even though the game aways sticks to the formula, I was entertained for my entire 30 hrs playthrough, because it can deliver challenging and butt-clenching moments when you don't expect it.  The only downside is that the game is quite buggy and a bit clunky. Nothing too game-breaking, but there are numerous issues like bad pathfinding, disappearing NPCs, stealth kills not working properly, VIPs failing to use vertical vents, etc. It is very annoying, but it is a thing that can be fixed. Regardless, even in its current state, I can recommend this game, not only because it is solid in most regards, but because the setting is unfairly underused in games and Satellite Reign manages to pull it off perfectly.

The feeling and the Cyberpunk setting is done very well, it is worth the money and I always try new ways to resolve the challenges.

												It's Syndicate Wars. And if i may be so bold, IT IS BETTER THAN SHADOWRUN. I grew up playing the original Shadowrun for SNES and Sega as well as the Syndicate Wars for PC and PS1. That being said, this is the most faithful modern re-creation of the aforementioned cyber-punk games. Very well done shooting and squad management system that is nostalgic and fun. I love the newer PC Shadowrun games, but that tactical grid based♥♥♥♥♥♥is whack. Play Satellite Reign in honor of the old times and blast NPCs the way they were meant to be blasted.			"

												This is my first review, so please don't judge too harshly.For the record, I just beat the game and it took me 45 hours to do it.In terms of visual design this game is an absolute delight: it really looks like a full-fledged city. There are night clubs with music so loud that you can hear it oustide, video advertising on buliding facades, futuristic cars, neon lights, parks, restaurants and so on. And yes, you can zoom in to savour every detail or zoom out and just take in the city in chunks. The mission areas are part of the cityscape, only walled off and guarded, so no loading screens that disrupt the continuity of the experience.In terms of mechanics the game has its pros and cons.You get four distinct agents to complete various missions: soldier, support, hacker, infiltrator. They have common skills that you can upgrade, like health or weapon damage, and unique skills that justify their presence in the team. They also have rather distinct weapon preferences. Overall the game attempts to grant you many different ways to tackle missions depending on your overall loadout and play style and you are certainly welcome to try different approaches. However, this is where the problems start. Mission areas were obviously designed with stealth in mind, but despite my best efforts in 75% of cases i ended up shooting my way through. This is due to several reasons: - the AI sometimes just knows where you are. You stealth several guards, hide, another guard comes running and starts shooting in your direction which immediately gathers the attention of everyone around, and now you're facing 6-10 guards. All except the one shooting have no idea what the're doing there, but you end up being forced to shoot your way through them - guards can simply spawn. You quietly clear a path to your target and on your way back you find that every guard you've killed has simply respawned - the second point also makes planning an operation close to impossible. There is no way to find out in advance how many patrols there are, what are their routes, who you should avoid and who you have to take out. On the one hand it makes the mission more challenging and realistic but on the other simply irritating and unpredictable - for some reason the gurads' cone of vision is not limited to their flashlight. To be on the safe side, assume that if he's facing you and you're not hiding, he'll see you - most annoying, you can't save during a mission. So if things go south, you'll be forced to retry. Again, more challenging and realistic or simply irritatingIt is also suggested that you can clear some missions using only a single agent, but I found that to be highly impractical.Most likely you will either be unable to get to the location you need, or simply get swarmed by the AI.Finally, I would like to mention what is in my opinion the game's two greatest shortcomings: the game world and the story.Your actions have absolutely no effect on the game world. Just blasted your way through a corporation's manufacturing and business center, killing half the guards, hacking the other half and stealing everything you could get your high-tech greedy hands on? Fine, no one cares. As soon as you're in the safe zone, assume it never happened.And last, there is virtually no story in the game. After having beat it, I have no idea why the world is in the shape that a saw, how did the corporations come to be and what they are about, why was what I did important. I was hoping that the ending would answer these questions, but it never happened: it simply made no sense and raised more questions.Overall, if you're looking for a fun way to pass the time or ""try something else for a change"" (like I did), this is a great game. It is pleasent to look at and it will keep you busy.But if you're searching for a story-rich game to become a favorite title, this just won't do. That is why I am forced, despite the game's numerous points of appeal, to not recommend it.I hope you find this review useful.			"

												As a huge fan of syndicate wars (hell I had a muriel based on some of the artwork drawn on my wall) I was excited to say the least when i heard its spiritual successor was going to be released by members of the original dev team. I was disappointed when I got my hands on the fruits of their labour. Don't get me wrong the graphics are decent, as are aspects of the gameplay, but the finished product had some bugs (incompletable missions etc) and was quite expensive considering it felt quite short in comparison to syndicate wars. The game play quickly becomes quite repetitive as there isn't much variety in terms of missions once you've completed the first area of play. In syndicate wars you could play through as both the goodies and the baddies, here no such luck. If you want a bit of cyberpunk action you can dip in and out of then as they've worked out some of the kinks and the price has dropped, it could be worth a look. If however like me you wanted to relive you're miss spent youth, I'd probably give it a miss. Syndicate Wars it ain't. 5/10 "

												This game has a lot of nice flashy sci-fi cyber punk UI and sights, but it fails in game play. Not only is the stealth system completely broken (guards will randomly charge your hiding spot from a mile way to shoot you without changing into the ""noticed"" light scheme, while you could walk up right behind them in a different spot), but the difficulty and balance scale is a serious concern. This game gives your characters guns but it is pointless to use them because you can never win a shoot-out! NEVER! They will only call endless hordes against you (even after completing the operation that makes it 50% reduced reinforcement speed), and even the low-level guards in the first major zone are easily over powered over your pathetic agents that can't kill them faster than they can raise the alarm. On top of the glitches and line of sight imbalances, you can only save when outside of secure compounds. There are so many chances to make a mistake and some compounds are gigantic and can take hours to fully sneak around. This current save system makes it impossible to complete some compounds without giving up in frustration and seems to only be a ""punitive"" system, a barrier against player freedom and enjoyment for no good foreseeable reason.2/10, and that 2 is for the hot sci-fi chicks in the posters on the streets.

												Nietzsche was right: ""Against boredom even gods struggle in vain""Missions quickly get repetitive.All fights feel nearly the same, all weapons feel nearly the same, endgame is too easy with maxed hijacking and it's all boring to the extreme after first several hours.Performance problems on i5-3570K and GTX980 Ti, graphics is good for an indie title, but performance is bad regardless of what your PC specs are.The story is virtually non-existent, the ending leaves you thinking ""That's it?!"" Yeah, it is. There was nothing there to begin with. Character development is done well, but once you are maxed out, there is pretty much 1 strategy to rule them all: Hijack heaviest minigunners with shields, Rage with Soldier, Slow time with support if a lot of enemies -- steamroll everything.Endgame is not challenging.Summary: This game is a trainwreck, don't waste your time even if it is on Sale, it's just that boring.

												For those who want a short, snappy review:This almost beats Masters of Orion 3 as my most regrettable gaming purchase.I love Syndicate. I long ago lost track of how many weekends I spent on my SNES, happily using the Persuadatron to mind control drones, and later I did pretty much the exact same thing with Syndicate Returns on the Playstation (never did find the Graviton Gun). I was utterly delighted when I found out a game billed  as a spiritual successor had been released and as soon as I could, I snagged a copy.And now I kinda really, really wish I hadn't.The game is supposed to be set up so you can go through in two different ways - guns blazing, old school cyborg killing machines slaughtering everything or stealthy, in and out before anyone ever knows you were there. I decided to try the stealthy approach (the game actually encourages this, you get more experience for your goon squad by sneaking into places. Hell, there's a string of achievements for doing it!) but good god it is AWFUL. One of the main rules about making games is that the player should always be involved - you should always have something important happening for him/her to react to. There really shouldn't be a point where the player has so little to do they think 'why am I playing this?' Well, if you try and go stealth, that's exactly the question you'll be asking yourself as you sit there waiting for the various guards to sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowly make their way somewhere else. I have a book here. To read while I wait for the AI pathfinding to decide to move the NPC guards away from the place I need to go. At no point in a video game should the person playing feel the need to pick up a book to keep entertained while waiting.I suppose I should give a few points for actually setting up random pathing for NPC's instead of just having them patrol the same route for all eternity though. It even spawns different NPC's every time you load. The developers were obviously trying to keep things from getting too dull and to give the game some replayability (the various weapons and items you can aquire are randomised as well, or so I've been told). I just wish the NPC's didn't also seem to have randomly determined sight and hearing as well - sometimes the guards can't see you if you are stood right in the open twenty feet down the road directly in front of them and sometimes they can see you from off the screen and through the wall you are trying to hide behind.I don't think I'd be too bothered about all of the above save for one thing - the save system is completely awful and probably the worst I can think of. You need to be near relay beacons to save. Okay, save points. There are plenty of them, and you can warp directly to them. That's not so bad, right?Well, you can only warp to them if you A. have all your team alive, B. not under attack or C. not trespassing. Whenever you go into a mission area, you are most likely going to be trespassing. See where I'm going with this? (Here's a hint: go reread the bit about randomised NPC's, I'll wait here. Done? great!) You want to sneak into somewhere, you can't quicksave, so you can't chop it up into managable little bits, you need to do the entire section in one go. Trial and error time, right? Oh, wait, no, because the NPC's change where they are everytime you reload! It pretty much comes down to pure luck, and that's a slow and miserable way to do things.There's also the obvious problem of not being able to save if you need to leave suddenly or whatever - you can't pick this up for a quick five minute session, set aside an hour or so or just don't bother.What else? well, the graphics aren't utterly terrible. They aren't amazing, and the way the camera pans slowly from side to side doesn't help. At all. It's actually giving me a headache. It does look all retrofuturey cyberpunkish but it just looks utterly washed out. It's raining, of course - pretty sure there's a rulebook somewhere that states any game in a dystopian future is only allowed to have scenes set in the rain at night.All told, for anyone who wants a game like Syndicate, you could always snag an emulator from somewhere and play the actual SNES version instead.Edit: Okay, like ten minutes after I type the review and I'm back, I need to add this in: There literally are psychic guards in the game. I just spotted one who couldn't have seen my team at any point suddenly stop patrolling, turn around and run right over to where everyone was hidden and only then stop and turn on the 'Gosh, these people aren't supposed to be here!' orange flashlight of doom. This wasn't 'oh, I got a bit too close and he spotted me', this was 'he suddenly knew where we were from across the compound while my team was hiding behind a wall that was itself behind a second bigger wall'.

Early Access Review
								I stopped playing this game for a while after initially buying it in early access and I am blown away by how much progress this small indie studio has made in such a small amount of time. Gameplay has improved, loads of content has been added, the game has been substantially optimized and loads of bugs have been fixed.So what is it? Short answer: it's a reboot of the original 1994 Syndicate. For those of you that haven't played the original Syndicate: It's a cyberpunk themed game where you command a specialized team of agents. I guess you could call it a RTS with action and stealth elements. As you play your agents gain skills, you research new weapons and technology and can outfit your agents with augments.The developers have created a very believable dystopian future city that you can explore, do missions in, sneak around in, fight in, and in some cases manipulate systems in to give you an edge over rival corporations and security forces.You have to play this game for at least a few hours to appreciate why it is so good. It reminds me of Deus Ex in that the more you upgrade and outfit your agents the more possibilities you have in terms of infiltrating compounds. It's up to you whether you'd like to go in guns blazing or if you'd rather take a carefully planned approach.For example, you can hack an enemy drone and let it fly past all security to check the place out before you go in. Then you can have the drone attack key security cameras that you'll need to get past. The enemy will destroy the rogue drone, but they'll have no idea you were controlling it. Then you send in your infiltrator, using stealth to avoid being seen, climbing through vents, and picking off lone guards with melee attacks and a silenced sniper rifle. The tactics in the game are really deep and really well thought out.The only criticism I have is that I'd like the clone, augmentation and inventory management interfaces to be revamped to feel more tactile and impactful. Augmentations were a big part of the original Syndicate and it feels a bit hollow in this game.Overall though, great game!			"

												This isn't even close to a Syndicate remake.Using real time as a resource management bottleneck is probably the dumbest thing I have ever seen in an action rts. Forcing me to wait real life hours so I can equip my guys made me stop playing. This isn't Farmville, wtf is this♥♥♥♥♥♥The action isn't even that important because you will always be underequipped in addition to being outnumbered (because of said bottleneck). Instead the game forces you to play it like a real time stealth tactical game, which then suffers from several UI restrictions.The presentation is also forgettable, which in summary means you can safely skip this game.

												Awesome game, the atmosphere is very immersive. Had several wow moments; either with the nice landscape that make me feel I was in the future or the enemy encountered. The heroes complement each other well. Can choose the playstyle you like: rogue like, warrior, take control of the ennemies... Generally have multiple paths and approach to complete each mission and the levels are well balanced and take some thinking to solve the way you want. Lore and story are well presented. I didn't get many bugs (only character got stuck once or twice on crates or zipline but with the fast load it wasn't an issue) the devs have really iron the game out.Great game, lets hope there is more to come...

												Classic cyberpunk. There are a few clunky things about it, but the world is immersive and you can actually walk around the city admiring all the little touches while you subvert the place. The ""realtime with pause"" option lowers the difficulty considerably, as it's implemented by giving you from start what would regularly be a mid-tier tech upgrade.Unlike Syndicate where you can very easily outgun the police, here it's a lot harder (but not impossible) to do, so at times it makes sense to let your agents make a last stand and wait for the heat to come down.Do note that laser is not a straight upgrade from ballistic, or plasma from laser - each technology has its pros and cons.Not sure if this is in the same universe as Invisible Inc. but it should be. Definitely worth the money. "

								If you liked Sydicate back in the day you will definitely like this game.Some small flaws have been encountered so far but nothing to put me off the game, especially given it's still in Beta testing.Be warned though, it has a very steep learning curve and after some simple early missions it ramps up quite allot.Combat can be difficult until you get the hang of it and you will have to be prepared to do allot of reloading or cloning of your agents.Overall at this stage, I'd give it 8.5 out of 10.

												The game is great fun and a real spiritual sucessor to Syndicate.The open world is not as open as it could be, though the world is large even through it keeps resetting itselfMy main issue is the constant crashing for my system. In each 30 min of play I will crash atleast twice if I am lucky and upto 6 to 8 times if I am not. This just means a ton of save games, but if you are on a mission in places you shouldn't be you cannot save. I recently did a mission that took 40 or so minutes and combined three parts to complete in enemy teritory. As I was walking my team out (no police/security alive) the game crashed and I lost all of my progress. I will still keep playing the game, because I think it is just that good, it is just very frustrating on my system.			"

												Quite an Awesome game if I should say myself.As seen in the pictures, you command a squad of 4 units, and each unit can get better by hijacking enemy or neutral units and be sent for cloning, making classes such as the soldier as tank and infiltrator have quite a big impact based on the clone.In addition to the game, it has quite good length (varies about if you hesitate due to cameras, guards and so on), replayability. Oh and I shouldn't forget, it has a nice, good soundtrack wether you're idle or in combat. However, there are quite some few bugs here and there, but, in my play-time I haven't really encountered some game-breaking bugs (maybe because I haven't even bought something from the Black Market ingame). Also, the AI can be a bit questionable, especially if you have hijacked NPCs, they will not react to being fired at and will most likely just stand idle and die, however, your squad has some basic AI where they will shoot back, and perhaps take cover (I had them fully controlled throughout the game), so I can't really tell much more about Satellite Reign, other than it's really awesome.

												I played Satellite Reign and completed it a little while ago now, after playing other games such as XCOM 2, I started looking back at how much fun Sattelite Reign was and so was compelled to quickly write something about this game. Satellite Reign is set in a cyberpunk setting, (think Sydicate by Bullfrog Studios) it's a real time, squad based tactical shooter and it does all of those things really quite well. It's far from perfect, it has it's nuances and the occasional bug, but its solid and addictive gameplay trigger that 'I'm having fun' vibe that many games can just miss despite all of the trimmings on offer. If you were a fan of the old Sydicate games then this is about as close as you can get within a modern game to the glorious nostalgic feelings of your younger days that you've been clinging onto. For anyone just trying this game out without any pre concieved ideas then it's going to be a challenging and addictive game from beggining to end.It does get a little grindy towards the end, and the story is a little weak in places, however there is just enough to keep you coming back for more, watching your technology ramp up and develop new and interesting technology to deal with your enemies.If you're into tactical squad based combat, stealth, a little micro management... and of course massive devastating weapons and cool gadgets then this is your game.I think everyone should give this one a go.

												This game came so close to being on my ""Games I will annoy everyone around me because I won't shut up about them"" list that it is frustrating. It's a great game, and definitelyworth it, but the few shortcomings were insanely disappointing.The game is a great game that is a spiritual successor to sindicate wars, yada yada, what everyone else says. It does almost everything right. The world is a thick and atmospheric rainy distopian cyberpunk city that feels great to be in, and the gameplay is fluid and great (most of the time anyways). The missions could be more varried instead of just ""Go to the green door,"" or ""Talk to the guy on the street."" not that big of a deal, but it would be good to get a ""break in and shoot a guy"" mission or something a little different.Problem is where it really falls short. As a game that seemed primarily focused on stealth, a lot of simple bugs drove me CRAZY such as when walking around the city, my soldiers will think that the best way from point A to point B while walking around a corner is through A HEAVILY ARMED MILITARY FORTRESS!!!! Same goes with civilians. You will be stealthily sneaking along, and a random civilian will walk into the enemy compound and get shot up, putting all the guards on high alert. Other bugs include enemy's seeing through solid walls, my soldiers completely disobeying orders and running in the middle of enemy fire, and my soldiers getting stuck in walls. That last one was especially frustrating when I literally spent about 15 minutes completing a mission, only to have my infiltrator who was carrying the package get stuck in a wall within sight of the doorway! None of these bugs were single occurences, and happened at least once every time I played.The last thing I have to complain about is the story. It's something about a coorperation that figured out a way to transplant human consciousness into other bodies after you die. Not really sure how that's a bad thing, but aparently they are evil so you have to stop them. The only time you get any story (outside of little world buidling emails and such that you find around the city) is at the beginning and the end. I spent about 40 hours playing the game, so I forgot the beginning by the time I finished it. This wouldn't be a problem, as it's a good game without a story, however the ending doesn't fit with that. It pretends sort of like there was a lot of story, and so it tries to be impactful, but instead it just left me sitting in my chair going ""why do I care? who is that person that the narrator is talking about?"" If they had more story throughout and made us actually care about the characters, the ending would be AMAZING! Seriously, just some more talking from the narrator throught the game to characterize her a bit could have fixed it.TLDR; I played the game for 40 hours, and didn't regret it at all (other than the time I played it instead of writing an english paper). It's so good, and just spending time in the rainy city feels good, and completing a well coordinated mission with al 4 agents feels even better. It's a shame that the few bugs and lack of story really bring it down. Still recommend.			"

TLDRI enjoyed the game and it certainly held my attention long enough to finish it (a little more than twenty hours, taking my time). There was enough Syndicate heritage present to be worthy of the name and enough freshness to avoid being labelled a retread. If only there had been time for a little more polish and the possibility of large-scale destruction as was seen previously in Syndicate Wars, this could have been a classic. As it stands, I am unlikely to make a second play through any time soon.As a Syndicate fan and an early Kickstarter backer, I was hugely excited to see this game funded. Kudos to 5 Lives for delivering on their promise to provide a recognisable new game in the venerable series that should be appreciated by fans and newcomers alike. Anyone who has played either the original Syndicate or Syndicate Wars will be familiar with the cyber-punk setting, but the gameplay has changed significantly. The developer has gone in a slightly different direction to the earlier Bullfrog titles, eschewing the previous emphasis on combat for stealth. Unfortunately, while this is a generally positive review, its also an inconsistent one. Most of the new ideas are well conceived, but I frequently found myself annoyed or disappointed with the implementation.Open worldThe entire game takes place in what is effectively a single, well-realised and lovingly crafted city, rather than a discrete map for each mission. There are a reasonable variety of locations and plenty of life in terms of civilians and traffic, but unfortunately it quickly feels superficial. Buildings can't be entered in any meaningful way, cars can't be driven, civilians are practically window-dressing. Missions involve infiltrating secure corporate compounds that are scattered liberally throughout the city. This can make for some interesting possibilities, with multiple routes of ingress and escape. Often, there is no ""right"" way, with the best option being dictated by your agent's skills and equipment. However, nothing of consequence really seems to occur on the rest of the map. Apart from what boils down to a few treasure hunts, there are no other agents to fight and no meaningful, long-term way to affect the world. Environmental destruction is possible, but only in a very limited way. Doors and some machines can be destroyed, but will be repaired automatically after a period of time or on loading a game. Large-scale destruction is unfortunately not a possibility; those hoping for more Satellite Rain will sadly be disappointed.StealthOne of the largest differences from the prior games in this series is the focus on stealth and to a lesser extent, environmental puzzles. I would go so far as to say that without a stealthy approach, the game would often be impossible. Cameras are everywhere and endless reinforcements can be alerted at any time. Stealth kills, which are relatively easy to pull off, are by far the most effective way to remove irritating patrols. This is often necessary, given that patrols are often unpredictable and most enemies are incredible bullet sponges. I found the unpredictability refreshing, others may disagree violently (and have done so in the forums)... That is not to say that when stealth fails, its curtains immediately. Most of the time it is viable to shoot your way out or just run, but often this is just to create enough of a diversion to go back and try again more stealthily...Gear and abilitiesLike the original games, there is a wide variety of weapons and augmentations to be obtained and researched. These are usually rewarded for completion of missions, but can also be purchased from the black market. This is nice feature, since the gear on offer is randomised in each game. Unlike previous Syndicate games, there is also skill progression, which is split amongst four distinct classes (as represented by your four agents). Each of the classes has a specific and useful role, however due to the heavy emphasis on stealth, there is what I consider to be an unhealthy reliance on the assassin. This becomes even more pronounced once key upgrades are researched that allow your agents to cross-skill (although none are ever completely redundant). At this point, its often easier to leave all of your other agents somewhere safe while the assassin operates as a lone wolf.Many of the gadgets and skills are incremental improvements, but others enable whole new strategies and the game really shines in this regard. Ultimately however, there are a few key skills and strategies which are unreasonably effective, meaning others are relegated to novelty status. That being said, if you really wanted to experiment, there are many viable options and different ways to approach problems. It would be nice if this was reflected in the achievements on offer.Cover-based combatInitially, I found this an immense improvement on the earlier games, which lacked any kind of tactical finesse in combat. I recall that agents would simply charge at the first sign of your kiting squad, usually in a bee-line for your carefully prepared meat grinder... Now, position matters and enemies will attempt to manoeuvre and flank your agents. However, it falls down quickly and frequently in combat for a number of reasons. Enemy AI is inconsistent and all too often brain-dead, path finding isn't great, your agents don't automatically protect themselves and essentially its all too fiddly to control effectively in real time. Dammit, why are you just letting them shoot you; get your weapons out! Get under cover! NO, NOT THAT SIDE, HE'S RIGHT NEXT TO YOU IDIOT! WHY ARE YOU RUNNING ON THE SPOT!?!? GET YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WEAPONS OUT! Later in the game especially, things can go from well-planned ambush to farcical defeat very quickly. To their credit, the developers responded post-release to similar criticism by providing direct access to a skill that allows time to be slowed. However, this is a workaround rather than a solution for most of the afore-mentioned issues.			"

												For those who want a short, snappy review:This almost beats Masters of Orion 3 as my most regrettable gaming purchase.I love Syndicate. I long ago lost track of how many weekends I spent on my SNES, happily using the Persuadatron to mind control drones, and later I did pretty much the exact same thing with Syndicate Returns on the Playstation (never did find the Graviton Gun). I was utterly delighted when I found out a game billed  as a spiritual successor had been released and as soon as I could, I snagged a copy.And now I kinda really, really wish I hadn't.The game is supposed to be set up so you can go through in two different ways - guns blazing, old school cyborg killing machines slaughtering everything or stealthy, in and out before anyone ever knows you were there. I decided to try the stealthy approach (the game actually encourages this, you get more experience for your goon squad by sneaking into places. Hell, there's a string of achievements for doing it!) but good god it is AWFUL. One of the main rules about making games is that the player should always be involved - you should always have something important happening for him/her to react to. There really shouldn't be a point where the player has so little to do they think 'why am I playing this?' Well, if you try and go stealth, that's exactly the question you'll be asking yourself as you sit there waiting for the various guards to sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowly make their way somewhere else. I have a book here. To read while I wait for the AI pathfinding to decide to move the NPC guards away from the place I need to go. At no point in a video game should the person playing feel the need to pick up a book to keep entertained while waiting.I suppose I should give a few points for actually setting up random pathing for NPC's instead of just having them patrol the same route for all eternity though. It even spawns different NPC's every time you load. The developers were obviously trying to keep things from getting too dull and to give the game some replayability (the various weapons and items you can aquire are randomised as well, or so I've been told). I just wish the NPC's didn't also seem to have randomly determined sight and hearing as well - sometimes the guards can't see you if you are stood right in the open twenty feet down the road directly in front of them and sometimes they can see you from off the screen and through the wall you are trying to hide behind.I don't think I'd be too bothered about all of the above save for one thing - the save system is completely awful and probably the worst I can think of. You need to be near relay beacons to save. Okay, save points. There are plenty of them, and you can warp directly to them. That's not so bad, right?Well, you can only warp to them if you A. have all your team alive, B. not under attack or C. not trespassing. Whenever you go into a mission area, you are most likely going to be trespassing. See where I'm going with this? (Here's a hint: go reread the bit about randomised NPC's, I'll wait here. Done? great!) You want to sneak into somewhere, you can't quicksave, so you can't chop it up into managable little bits, you need to do the entire section in one go. Trial and error time, right? Oh, wait, no, because the NPC's change where they are everytime you reload! It pretty much comes down to pure luck, and that's a slow and miserable way to do things.There's also the obvious problem of not being able to save if you need to leave suddenly or whatever - you can't pick this up for a quick five minute session, set aside an hour or so or just don't bother.What else? well, the graphics aren't utterly terrible. They aren't amazing, and the way the camera pans slowly from side to side doesn't help. At all. It's actually giving me a headache. It does look all retrofuturey cyberpunkish but it just looks utterly washed out. It's raining, of course - pretty sure there's a rulebook somewhere that states any game in a dystopian future is only allowed to have scenes set in the rain at night.All told, for anyone who wants a game like Syndicate, you could always snag an emulator from somewhere and play the actual SNES version instead.Edit: Okay, like ten minutes after I type the review and I'm back, I need to add this in: There literally are psychic guards in the game. I just spotted one who couldn't have seen my team at any point suddenly stop patrolling, turn around and run right over to where everyone was hidden and only then stop and turn on the 'Gosh, these people aren't supposed to be here!' orange flashlight of doom. This wasn't 'oh, I got a bit too close and he spotted me', this was 'he suddenly knew where we were from across the compound while my team was hiding behind a wall that was itself behind a second bigger wall'.

												Now that the Cyberpunk genre is pretty much dead and buried, its nice to see a good throwback game with a cyberpunk theme done right.  This game reminded me a lot of Baldur's Gate, but with a Deus Ex theme.  My only gripe was the level of difficulty near the end was pretty lame.  Once you get the best sheilds, armor, weapons and cybernetics, you hardly need to hide anymore, you can just walk into any building and clear it out and take whatever you want.  At the begining of the game, its really hard tho, you have to sneak around or you will die.  I prefered this better.  I think this game has a very steep learning curve, because you have to control a team of 4 people, each with different skills and styles of play.			"

												Great graphics and atmosphere, and really reminds me of Syndicate, but as soon as you start shooting its like one of those scenes out of the naked gun where 2 people hide behind the same trash can taking shots at each other. Also, its jsut not very fun to play. Performance is abysmal, 30fps on a GTX970.  To summarise, in a schoolyard insult nicknames style of rating,  i'd rate this ""Sattelshite reign"".			"

												The multiplayer is region-locked. It may not be a problem for most people, but I usually play with people from across the sea. If you're not going to change that in a near future would be nice to have at least a warning.  Since the co-op was the biggest selling point for me I can't avoid feeling let down. I will change this review if the region-lock is removed.			"

												How the hell in CURRENT YEAR does any game justify region locking it's players?  I bought this game specifically to buy with friends of mine who live in different parts of the world.  This game could be the greatest RTS ever and I won't know.  Because a region lock means a quick refund request from me.			"

Early Access Review
								I stopped playing this game for a while after initially buying it in early access and I am blown away by how much progress this small indie studio has made in such a small amount of time. Gameplay has improved, loads of content has been added, the game has been substantially optimized and loads of bugs have been fixed.So what is it? Short answer: it's a reboot of the original 1994 Syndicate. For those of you that haven't played the original Syndicate: It's a cyberpunk themed game where you command a specialized team of agents. I guess you could call it a RTS with action and stealth elements. As you play your agents gain skills, you research new weapons and technology and can outfit your agents with augments.The developers have created a very believable dystopian future city that you can explore, do missions in, sneak around in, fight in, and in some cases manipulate systems in to give you an edge over rival corporations and security forces.You have to play this game for at least a few hours to appreciate why it is so good. It reminds me of Deus Ex in that the more you upgrade and outfit your agents the more possibilities you have in terms of infiltrating compounds. It's up to you whether you'd like to go in guns blazing or if you'd rather take a carefully planned approach.For example, you can hack an enemy drone and let it fly past all security to check the place out before you go in. Then you can have the drone attack key security cameras that you'll need to get past. The enemy will destroy the rogue drone, but they'll have no idea you were controlling it. Then you send in your infiltrator, using stealth to avoid being seen, climbing through vents, and picking off lone guards with melee attacks and a silenced sniper rifle. The tactics in the game are really deep and really well thought out.The only criticism I have is that I'd like the clone, augmentation and inventory management interfaces to be revamped to feel more tactile and impactful. Augmentations were a big part of the original Syndicate and it feels a bit hollow in this game.Overall though, great game!			"

TLDRI enjoyed the game and it certainly held my attention long enough to finish it (a little more than twenty hours, taking my time). There was enough Syndicate heritage present to be worthy of the name and enough freshness to avoid being labelled a retread. If only there had been time for a little more polish and the possibility of large-scale destruction as was seen previously in Syndicate Wars, this could have been a classic. As it stands, I am unlikely to make a second play through any time soon.As a Syndicate fan and an early Kickstarter backer, I was hugely excited to see this game funded. Kudos to 5 Lives for delivering on their promise to provide a recognisable new game in the venerable series that should be appreciated by fans and newcomers alike. Anyone who has played either the original Syndicate or Syndicate Wars will be familiar with the cyber-punk setting, but the gameplay has changed significantly. The developer has gone in a slightly different direction to the earlier Bullfrog titles, eschewing the previous emphasis on combat for stealth. Unfortunately, while this is a generally positive review, its also an inconsistent one. Most of the new ideas are well conceived, but I frequently found myself annoyed or disappointed with the implementation.Open worldThe entire game takes place in what is effectively a single, well-realised and lovingly crafted city, rather than a discrete map for each mission. There are a reasonable variety of locations and plenty of life in terms of civilians and traffic, but unfortunately it quickly feels superficial. Buildings can't be entered in any meaningful way, cars can't be driven, civilians are practically window-dressing. Missions involve infiltrating secure corporate compounds that are scattered liberally throughout the city. This can make for some interesting possibilities, with multiple routes of ingress and escape. Often, there is no ""right"" way, with the best option being dictated by your agent's skills and equipment. However, nothing of consequence really seems to occur on the rest of the map. Apart from what boils down to a few treasure hunts, there are no other agents to fight and no meaningful, long-term way to affect the world. Environmental destruction is possible, but only in a very limited way. Doors and some machines can be destroyed, but will be repaired automatically after a period of time or on loading a game. Large-scale destruction is unfortunately not a possibility; those hoping for more Satellite Rain will sadly be disappointed.StealthOne of the largest differences from the prior games in this series is the focus on stealth and to a lesser extent, environmental puzzles. I would go so far as to say that without a stealthy approach, the game would often be impossible. Cameras are everywhere and endless reinforcements can be alerted at any time. Stealth kills, which are relatively easy to pull off, are by far the most effective way to remove irritating patrols. This is often necessary, given that patrols are often unpredictable and most enemies are incredible bullet sponges. I found the unpredictability refreshing, others may disagree violently (and have done so in the forums)... That is not to say that when stealth fails, its curtains immediately. Most of the time it is viable to shoot your way out or just run, but often this is just to create enough of a diversion to go back and try again more stealthily...Gear and abilitiesLike the original games, there is a wide variety of weapons and augmentations to be obtained and researched. These are usually rewarded for completion of missions, but can also be purchased from the black market. This is nice feature, since the gear on offer is randomised in each game. Unlike previous Syndicate games, there is also skill progression, which is split amongst four distinct classes (as represented by your four agents). Each of the classes has a specific and useful role, however due to the heavy emphasis on stealth, there is what I consider to be an unhealthy reliance on the assassin. This becomes even more pronounced once key upgrades are researched that allow your agents to cross-skill (although none are ever completely redundant). At this point, its often easier to leave all of your other agents somewhere safe while the assassin operates as a lone wolf.Many of the gadgets and skills are incremental improvements, but others enable whole new strategies and the game really shines in this regard. Ultimately however, there are a few key skills and strategies which are unreasonably effective, meaning others are relegated to novelty status. That being said, if you really wanted to experiment, there are many viable options and different ways to approach problems. It would be nice if this was reflected in the achievements on offer.Cover-based combatInitially, I found this an immense improvement on the earlier games, which lacked any kind of tactical finesse in combat. I recall that agents would simply charge at the first sign of your kiting squad, usually in a bee-line for your carefully prepared meat grinder... Now, position matters and enemies will attempt to manoeuvre and flank your agents. However, it falls down quickly and frequently in combat for a number of reasons. Enemy AI is inconsistent and all too often brain-dead, path finding isn't great, your agents don't automatically protect themselves and essentially its all too fiddly to control effectively in real time. Dammit, why are you just letting them shoot you; get your weapons out! Get under cover! NO, NOT THAT SIDE, HE'S RIGHT NEXT TO YOU IDIOT! WHY ARE YOU RUNNING ON THE SPOT!?!? GET YOUR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WEAPONS OUT! Later in the game especially, things can go from well-planned ambush to farcical defeat very quickly. To their credit, the developers responded post-release to similar criticism by providing direct access to a skill that allows time to be slowed. However, this is a workaround rather than a solution for most of the afore-mentioned issues.			"

												Now that the Cyberpunk genre is pretty much dead and buried, its nice to see a good throwback game with a cyberpunk theme done right.  This game reminded me a lot of Baldur's Gate, but with a Deus Ex theme.  My only gripe was the level of difficulty near the end was pretty lame.  Once you get the best sheilds, armor, weapons and cybernetics, you hardly need to hide anymore, you can just walk into any building and clear it out and take whatever you want.  At the begining of the game, its really hard tho, you have to sneak around or you will die.  I prefered this better.  I think this game has a very steep learning curve, because you have to control a team of 4 people, each with different skills and styles of play.			"

												Wasn't sure what to expect but Satellite Reign has depth, style, and most importantly is quite a lot of fun.  You control a squad of 4 (sometimes with extra help) and each member has their own skills and progression path.  Soldier, Support, Hacker, and Infiltrator.  Pretty self-explanatory.  You gain XP and level up, using skill points to upgrade specific abilities and passives on each character.  In addition, each character has augment slots for mechanical upgrades and gear slots for all sorts of things... from cloaking devices to drones to grenades.  There are also quite a few varied weapons, which also have available upgrades.The graphcs are GREAT.  The city is awash in neon and it looks VERY futuristic/cyberpunk.  While you'll likely be playing zoomed out for a beter tactical vantage point- zooming in rewards you with some AMAZINGLY fine detail.  It's a shame that you need to have a panned-out view of everything because the attention to detail up close is amazing.  The gameplay alternates between combat and well-put-together stealth mechanics.  Early on your only option might be to run in and out as quickly as possible on a given target, killing everything possible and running when outnumbered/outgunned.  This quickly changes.... as you gain access to various gear/augments/skills/etc you'll find that the planning of a raid is half the fun.... tactical and strategic options open up exponentially as your toolset expands.  At about 22 hours into the game I've gotten to the point where there are many viable options on a given strike.... but from the list of technology that I have yet to research/buy I can see that I still have a LONG way to go in terms of available tools and options.  Also- at 22 hours I don't know exactly HOW far I am into the game.... but without spoiling anything I DO know that I'm AT MOST at the 25% mark.  It's nice to get good bang-for-your-buck.This is an open-world game to a degree.  You are in one giant city and while you don't have access to the whole city right off the bat- you CAN, in theory, force your way into parts of the city that you clearly have no business being in yet.  Your map is littered with possible targets and it's up to you to pick which targets to hit and when, balancing the risks versus the rewards of each.  Oh- another neat part of this game: the cloning system.  You pretty much abduct people off the street and clone them to enhance each of your team members.  Your soldier might start out as a black dude.... but you might find a white girl on the street with better stats.  Abduct, clone, and BOOM-  your soldier has had a gender change and has changed ethnicities.  Each time a character dies you can respawn but your stats decrease.  Not your XP-earned skills, but your base stats like health, speed, accuracy, etc.  There is a level where it won't go below, which is essentially a 0% bonus across the board, but it's a neat system and it's fun to troll around for abduction victims.  As you level up your ""Hijack"" ability you can start abducting soldier, and eventually high-ranking soldiers, giving your team access to better and better stat-buffs.I expected Satellite Reign to be OK, but it turned out to be REALLY good.  I'm thrilled that it's a really big game, too, as my current rate of play should have me getting at least 70 hours out of this.  At least.  I tend to go through games slowly, taking my time and enjoying the scenery, but I still couldn't imagine someone tearing through this game TOO quickly.... at least not if they want to research all the cool toys and see everything.  I feel I've already gotten my money's worth and I have a lot of game left to play.  Glad I picked this up.			"

												This is a video game. A good video game.It's not quite Syndicate, but as its own thing it plays very nicely. The big futuristic city is the main star of this game and it drips with gorgeous atmosphere. The soundscape also draws you in, but could have used a little more variety in general ambience as far as city noises go.Upgrading your agents with gear and wetware is rewarding and the missions play out satisfyingly.This is a very good effort from a small studio.

												The game is great fun and a real spiritual sucessor to Syndicate.The open world is not as open as it could be, though the world is large even through it keeps resetting itselfMy main issue is the constant crashing for my system. In each 30 min of play I will crash atleast twice if I am lucky and upto 6 to 8 times if I am not. This just means a ton of save games, but if you are on a mission in places you shouldn't be you cannot save. I recently did a mission that took 40 or so minutes and combined three parts to complete in enemy teritory. As I was walking my team out (no police/security alive) the game crashed and I lost all of my progress. I will still keep playing the game, because I think it is just that good, it is just very frustrating on my system.			"

												I am really enjoying Satellite Reign. It definitely feels like a modern version of Syndicate, there seems to be a lot to do in the game and a lot of skill involved.There are some things I don't like, but they are kinks in the armour rather than game breaking issues. I wish the AI was smarter - I don't like the fact you can literally gun down a lot of enemies and then their comrades will forget about it in seconds if they can't see you, for example. I feel like the game abuses this mechnic because it is simpler to balance than if it were done properly.The user interface is clumsy. The cloning screen is especially poorly done, and it is quite cumbersome in general. I also would have preferred better time management in the game; you can leave the game running to wind down the clock but some kind of safe house and an option to fast forward time would be better.However it is still a great game. I hope they improve on it some more in a sequel.			"

												If you ever played syndicate and liked it, then this is for you.  It's more than just a spiritual successor.  It has an overall enhanced feel with a greater flexibilty as to what you can do.  An example being, hijacking enemies and theen using them to scout or cause diversions and even assasinate target's without ever revealing your own agent's.There are minor bug's but nothing that break's the overall experience and progression can be slow in place's, but it get's what matter's most right.  A solid and worthwhile purchase for those that have fond memories of syndicate.			"

												Completely unbalanced, unfair and unconsequential difficulty scaling makes this game unplayable.I really wanted to play and like this game but there was NO WAY I could get past the difficulty you hit on about 20+skill points.As you progress, enemies are bumped up, too. The order in which you play makes nearly no difference. You may get some bonuses like 4% less accuracy on enemies or 50% slower security cameras, but they all make no difference.You must unlock some crucial blue prints from the black market, research some crucial tec and apply some crucial stealth techniques to get anywhere near CBD (which is the 4th of 5 levels).By the time you are in CBD you have everything nailed down, you know the game very well, play it excellently and have the max gear/augs/weapons you can get and then...You can't simply keep up with the amount of enemies that are thrown at you for every SINGLE error you do. So you restart and retry to be even more precise despite real-time is totally unfair. You, as a human, can by no means manage 4 agents in real-time without ever doing an error.So you restart, prepare, infiltrate, take out cameras and plan ahead... but some 30+ minutes into the operation it gets tighter, room comes at a premium and time (and timing) must be on-spot. The time you do a tiny error, there's no way you can force/fight your way through OR EVEN OUT. You're doomed.So what do you do? You reload, because once the clones are degraded, you're weaker than before. So there's no point to move on from a failure, your best bet is to reload.And you do this over and over again until.... RAAAGE!! Sometimes pathing is not perfect, sometimes enemy mobs CLEARLY move towards you without having seen you, giving the AI an unfair advantage.It is STUPID to insist playing beyond a certain point because it's not fun anymore, you're stuck and wasting 30+ minutes at a time is very VERY frustating.But I did not pay to be frustrated, I payed to have fun. So what do you do at that point?CHEAT.I give myself 100,000,000,000 HP and HP regeneration. With those numbers the game can't keep up with the rounding effect and any damage you take is ""rounded away"", so you stay there unmovable. You're immune to any kind of damage. No need for money, augs, weapons, shield, tactics, planning, whatever. You can just waltz into the missions and complete them.Boy, was I happy I CHEATED!!! I've seen what this game really is. I got to about 60% of the content in a legit way and saw the remaining 40% only by cheating.I can tell you, there is more mob spawning than crazy, they can hit you with 30K+ per second and shoot relentlessly. If you give yourself 1,000,000 HP they're gone in about 30 seconds. This is surely not a chill game, it is totally unbalanced and imposes on you impossible and frustrating difficulty.That said, the ending isn't even that good, I had to dial down audio because it was a constant WHACKWHACKA machine gun sound all time long. The end music didn't even consider I had no music and audio at a minimum. The devs must have thought that the song is SOOOO good you must hear it even if you didn't want to. WRONG. Some people have different tastes.Even with immortality and RUNNING STRAIGHT INTO missions some took over 1 HOUR to complete, because once you think you're done you realize you have to endure more (like getting an infiltrator out of the red zone without getting him killed). So you don't get right to completion but the missions are sometimes longer.I'm so happy I cheated because if I didn't I would have thought ""maybe I'm not that good at this game"", instead I know that I hit my maximum potential at 60%. I also know that some ADHD hardcore players will go beyond... Yeah, like up to 70-75%.I don't feel guilty for cheating, quite the contrary. My opinion is that an unfair difficuly is not acceptable. The devs are responsible for this, they think real-time impossible is something good, instead people bail out midway. And they're doing well. There should be a difficulty setting and the choice to completely remove difficuly scaling in favor of a prefixed difficuly setting per-area. But that's even more difficult to implement because the devs should have gone through the game many times to balance everything. Difficulty scaling, on the contrary is pretty easy to implement and calibrate. So they went that route and now defend it as a FEATURE.To the devs. A FEATURE is when I can CHOOSE to play this way or not. Locking players into this scheme is not a FEATURE, it is a lack of manual balancing on your part. Countering this argument only proves that you know what we're talking about and you couldn't/wouldn't want to afford that kind of painstaking work.My advice to those stuck in the game: CHEAT and at least see all mobs, levels, items, texts and the ending fight and song. Getting there by cheating will open your eyes on how IMPOSSIBLE it is to complete this game.I suspect many players having completed the game cheated, too, but don't want to admit it. I can think there's some special person who actually could do this feat but, many most probably aren't that ""special"", but just like me. A very mediocre player.			"

Not your XP-earned skills, but your base stats like health, speed, accuracy, etc.  There is a level where it won't go below, which is essentially a 0% bonus across the board, but it's a neat system and it's fun to troll around for abduction victims.  As you level up your ""Hijack"" ability you can start abducting soldier, and eventually high-ranking soldiers, giving your team access to better and better stat-buffs.I expected Satellite Reign to be OK, but it turned out to be REALLY good.  I'm thrilled that it's a really big game, too, as my current rate of play should have me getting at least 70 hours out of this.  At least.  I tend to go through games slowly, taking my time and enjoying the scenery, but I still couldn't imagine someone tearing through this game TOO quickly.... at least not if they want to research all the cool toys and see everything.  I feel I've already gotten my money's worth and I have a lot of game left to play.  Glad I picked this up.			"

												I am really enjoying Satellite Reign. It definitely feels like a modern version of Syndicate, there seems to be a lot to do in the game and a lot of skill involved.There are some things I don't like, but they are kinks in the armour rather than game breaking issues. I wish the AI was smarter - I don't like the fact you can literally gun down a lot of enemies and then their comrades will forget about it in seconds if they can't see you, for example. I feel like the game abuses this mechnic because it is simpler to balance than if it were done properly.The user interface is clumsy. The cloning screen is especially poorly done, and it is quite cumbersome in general. I also would have preferred better time management in the game; you can leave the game running to wind down the clock but some kind of safe house and an option to fast forward time would be better.However it is still a great game. I hope they improve on it some more in a sequel.			"

												Overall a pretty fun game. It isn't perfect but definitely worth a play, especially if it's on sale.Pros-Appealing asthetic-Ineresting class abilities and cloning system-Stealth feels satisfying (infiltrating a base and escaping undetected feels great)-Most pieces of gear are useful and lead to tough kit choices-Gear allows you to expand versitility with classes (ex. make your hacker a heavy weapons juggernaut)-Open world and gear system allows for many routes of progression-Offers a good challenge at times without feeling impossible.Cons-Some bugs (you and ai can get stuck in walls/objects)-Commands don't always execute-World can feel shallow. There's nothing but civilians walking around mindlessly and cars driving about. No interesting interactions.-AI is not very smart-Stealth always seems better than ""going loud."" Perhaps I just didn't build my team correctly or I need to ""git gud,"" but everytime I get into a big firefight I lose.-Will probably feel repetitive if you're not enjoying the gameplay			"

												I've barely played the game, but that's because I didn't like it. Controls were just too awful. And a game like this, with squad management and isometric view should either be real time with pause or just plain turnbased, with a preference for the latter.			"

I play slow though and take my time reading and exploring. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes ARPGs, RTS's, Strategy, or Action games.

												Очень симпатичная игра. Напоминает и синдикат, и коммандо.Город, разделённый на районе. В реальном времени ходят патрули, прохожие.  Можно их даже спровоцировать на перестрелку между собой. И наши четверо агентов - солдат, хакер, ""саппорт"" (поддержка) и ""разведчик"". Задачи - убить кого, пробраться на базу и вынести новый пистолет и т.д. Можно пробраться незаметно, можно, хотя и трудно, пострелять всех, можно промыть мозги прохожему и расстрелять им видеокамеру, заведомо зная что его убьют.Есть особые элементы окружающей обстановки - всякие пульты управления, генераторы, провода по которым можно скользить.Есть апргейд агентов - установить киберулучшения, новое оружие. Но после первой ""смерти"" агент теряет бонусы к точности, здоровью и т.д. Можно поймать прохожего (а лучше солдата) и промыть ему мозги, сделав агентом.В общем приятная, неторопливая игра.			"

												Solid game, got 35 hours first play through. Probably won't play it a second time because there doesn't seem like much replayability to be had.Few annoying bugs here and there where one of your toons might get stuck somewhere. Some mission text still has errors. No way to lock your toons into place and combat requires a whole lotta clicks so your will find yourself swearing at your screen from time to time as your dudes run outta cover and generally do all sorts of silly shiat in a firefight.It's an RTS / RPG sorta game, so no combat pause, no quicksave/quickload.

												I do recommend this game, but very slightly. This is a micromanagement simulator in real time. Your troops will do almost nothing if you don't tell them to. They won't even return fire in a lot of situations. So you have to be VERY busy while you're in a mission area.The UI is SO CLUNKY. Finding the info or panels you need sometimes feels like it's own mission in game and forget about complicated troop movement. You're taking constant shots while you try to get your cursor to align with a wall correctly so that your men will move to cover instead of stand up and get shot in the face repeatedly. All my success has been based on finding a strong location to fight from, and pulling enemies to it. Movement under fire is most often suicide. And while I can appreciate the Realism of that, it certainly makes a very slow game.Once you get a couple level ups on your agents things start to go much more smoothly as you have some desperately needed tools in your arsenal, but the opening was utterly demoralizing. The only thing that is going to get you through is either a fondness for dying or an overwhelming love of cyberpunk.If you DO love Cyberpunk, however; you are in for a treat. The environment of the game is just excellent from the dingy alleys to the neon skyscrapers. Did they reinvent the wheel? No. It looks like every other cyber-whatever I've played. But it's still very pretty. Sadly, it's the mechanics of the thing that bog it down. If they ever open it up to the modding community I think it could be my Game of the Year, but it NEEDS work to really be a Finished Game. Work that I don't really think is coming. Most games on this sort of budget have to claw their way just to get a release build and then the development money is gone. I think this game is being presented 'As Is' and the Kickstart studio likely going their seperate ways.			"

TL;DR: Visually one of the best designed game worlds i have seen in a while, and one with solid gameplay to boot. If you can forgive a few glitches and some occasional NPC stupidity it is well worth the price. See the “The Verdict” section for a short list of pro’s and cons. Intro - What is the game about?Satellite Reign takes place in a cyberpunk world ruled by corporations rather than governments. Your objective is to to overthrow the Dracogenics company and overtake their resurrection network of satellites. This is mostly a background for the game though - during the game the story itself is thin so do not expect an opus magnum quality novel. A few spoken notes at the start of each district and some background text from hacked terminals is pretty much al the story that is availible.You play the game as a squad of four characters, each with its own specialization and talents. You are free to upgrade your characters as you wish – a single play trough will most definitely not unlock all their skills – even half may be out of reach. Aside from that you customize their weapons, tools, armor and the like. These tools partially mimic other class abilities so you can create a pretty neat customized squad, perfect for your playing style.The gameplay itself resolves around breaching ever-more-difficult compounds on the map, looting them for money and gear prototypes you can then use to support your own soldiers. Money can either be spend on new weapons or researching the gear you found so you can duplicate it. Aside from that it is only used for bribes to make objectives simpler or to bypass sections of the game.Infiltration – Silent as a shadow or loud and clear?Infiltrating compounds can be done through both stealth and brute force, both of which have their advantages and disadvantages. Going silent allows you to bypass difficult fights entirely, but being caught can be quite lethal. Going loud could get you swarmed with enemies, but it will create a clear path with little surprises behind you. Both paths are surprisingly well developed and complemented by the available gear and skills. Players focusing on stealth will develop skills that allow them to access high vents  and ziplines, which can bypass areas of the map. Loud players will not want to waste points on these skills and will instead take a different path using skills that increate damage. Regardless of your gametype there are always multiple paths to a single objective, which always creates a tactical consideration: Will I just blow up those turrets and then fortify myself for a fight, or so I take one of those two routes around them and risk being spotted and ganged up by half the base?The verdict – Pro’s and Con’sPros Open world gameplay:  The entire world is accessible from the start of the game and there is no loading screen whatsoever during gameplay, not even when switching zones in the city. Outstanding visual quality: The world is exceptionally well designed. Visual quality is very high, and of such variety that you will have difficulty finding area’s that look alike. Customization: The character customization can personalize a squad to your wishes, with sufficient options to make them feel “Unique” Replay value: My stealth and loud games feel sufficiently different to warrant another playtrough. Even a third which mixes skills from both might be an option.Well optimized: My current system is medium specced at best. The game runs flawlessly with a high framerate trough, and looks very appealing. Playing around: Hijacking 5 citizens and setting them on a guard is never boring, nor is causing a fight between two corporations. Neither will luring a set of guards to a spot with gunfire before throwing a grenade get old. Plenty of tactics around that are fun just because they are possible.Neutral Game time: My first stealth game took about 40 hours to complete, though I did play around with the game world a lot rather than progressing. My second loud playtrough is going faster. All in all I suspect most players will find around 20-30 hours’ worth of time in a single play trough. Less if you are rushing, more if you are playing around. ConsThe AI:  The AI in the game can be rather dumb at times. If you find a dead body you shouldn’t charge in on your own. If you are in a gunfight, you don’t pell-mell trough the gunfire to take cover near the enemy. If you chase an enemy at the heart of your base you don’t search a minute on your own and return to patrol afterwards without even raising the alarm.  Pathfinding: You will see NPC’s running into closed doors or standing in from of them without taking the 10 second detour around. You will see your men cut corners to shortly only for them to stagger into the terrain. You will see your own soldiers and enemies run into standing cars. It is not always a problem, but often enough to take note off. Glitches: Hijacked civilians can run through closed doors if they sprint to them. Citizens entering vents can end up exiting in mid-air instead of the other end. Positioning between walls and objects can glitch you inside the building or wall. Again somewhat rare and you can always correct it yourself, but definitely an immersion breaker.The open world: The world is well designed, but feels somewhat devoid of objectives at times. You travel trough it to reach compounds and wander around it for ATM's, terminals and scientists and the occasional quest objective. These are one-off's though. A few procedurally generated and repeatable side missions to assasinate a squad or breach an enemy compound might have been fun to keep wandering around more interesting.All in all I can heartily recommend this game both at a discount and at its full price. Visually the game is excellent. Both the gameplay and level design is done well enough to support a variety of tactics and play styles – there is no “Only” or “Best” way to play the game. If you can forgive its quirks and glitches it will make up with the rest it has to offer.			"

												For a tactical game, this one deals a really bad hand:- ABOVE ALL: broken AI- no ability to rotate the game camera- saturated color and heavy bloom make it difficult to see what's going on- no 'tactial map' or 'active pause' feature that would help plan and execute the assaults on heavily guarded areas- it just doesn't have that 'thing' that would make you yearn for more...A word on broken AI, because this is what eventually made me put the game away.The game teaches you  about cone of visions of the enemies. Each NPC ( be it a soldier, a drone or a camera ), sports a 'flashlight' sort of thing that shows where it's looking and how to avoid it. A key thing when it comes to sneaking past them, which the game stronly encourages you to do. But they don't work - as a matter of fact the only check the game seems to make when checking if you're seen by an enemy is a distance check.So after a number of failed attempts to sneak past a few guards in one of the protected areas, I gave up.Gonna wait for when those issues are fixed and play then, but right now, I don't recommend this game.

												To be honest I am quite disappointed with the purchase. There is probably a very good reason why, even the people who gave this game a positive review their average play time on record is 20 hours or less…Pros: 1. nice scenery2. Very retro soundtrackCons1. No pause for combat considering there’s only 4 team squad (soldier, support, hacker, infiltrator) and most of them are relatively squishy2. There is no AI, he/she will literally stand there and be shot to death, and I thought if I at least drew my weapon he’d shoot back, nope…3. The stamina bar is remarkably short considering the AI tends to run and get stuck walking into walls or corner of stairsWith the inability of the ai to auto fire let alone provide overwatch/support, this game is 100% a stealth game, scratch the strategy and action tags...  if your found out, you have to run, out of the restriction zone and hide, chances are one of your team will die from derping it out with a wall and the 5 seconds revive or die timer will run out along with your short burst run timer.I will try to keep playing this. try...

												Okay, so let's talk.I liked Syndicate, and this game inspires a lot of the same feelings. Love the modern, lush depiction of what once was a sterile, dystopian society writ in abstract by the limits of graphical fidelity. I enjoy that they've tried to keep a significant portion of the game's variety of approach. I liked the small unit tactics, of the original, but most especially liked that you could complete most (indeed, eventually almost all) missions with the application of stupid amounts of boom.But that was then, and this is now. So let's talk about how the game plays, right?Pathfinding? Yeah, it's there, but it's not 100%. You'll have agents (as I just did, yet again) who fail to pathfind around the end of a chainlink fence, and instead end up dancing a pathfinding failure as they're gunned down in realtime, with you more or less helpless until you notice that they're spazzing instead of fighting back.Skill and character customization? Yeah, it's there, and the game adds its own wrinkle of sorts in the form of variable clone stats that you can take advantage of. It's not a major feature, but it adds a little edge. Of course, the developers fail to telegraph how certain design choices will play out vis-a-vis the support character - the lynchpin of the entire game and squad (but don't sprint). The decision to opt for a triggered ability instead of a tactical pause sounds good, at first - it did to me too, and then you add cover for a more tactical game? Hell, the original Syndicate never had cover, so how could they get it wrong? Well.. this is where the train starts to leave the tracks.See, in the original Syndicate, you could mod your agents hormonal levels, in order to ""boost them"" later by ""nerfing them"" early on. Effectively, you'd turn down an agent's adrenal response until you needed them to really kick it out, and then you'd light the whole system all the way to maximum, and in this way, you could make your agents superhuman when you needed it, and drop back to subnormal when you don't.Satellite Reign has opted to take this, and combine it with the design vision involving a total lack of a tactical pause, to create a realtime game where the enemies use cover effectively, and think 'independently', but you're expected to respond to this, in realtime, for four agents, who more or less don't think or act unless you explicitly tell them to, and that's bad, in realtime, if kill times get too short.So why the big deal about a pause?Well, the original Syndicate also had a PAUSE KEY. Don't take my word for it. It's in the flippin' manual, fer cryin' out loud! This allows the player to compensate for a general lack of ""I don't have eight hands or four separate brains to control every fine aspect of four avatars in realtime"".Satellite Reign doesn't have one. It sounds good at first, but you quickly become reliant on the support class's stims to be able to manage the game's complexity and keep the clusterf----s controllable. See, your agents are stupid - they dont' take ANY actiosn you don't tell them to take. No AI. No taking cover. No firing back, no moving to a better location if LOS is blocked and they're shooting a lamp post or wall instead of a soft target.That's bad alone, but then you add in the game's simply enormous emphasis on stealth play and cover, and suddenly you're playing as the only brain in a four-man squad in a tactical game with stealth elements and cover in realtime, everytime your stims are down, with agent avatars that have no volition. You're running an entire puppet troupe by yourself.Oh - and you can't let the guy with the stims sprint, or he can't stim the group, because the devs have made the decision to totally constipate the class by using the same energy pool for sprinting as for stims - and so intead of being a feature of the player's control (as it is for a tactical pause, or even allowing the *PLAYER* to stim the group on a cooldown/timer) it's instead an unwanted bit-and-harness on the support class - if he's not hidden away, all your fights WILL happen around him, because he can't move away and disengage reliably at all while also permitting you to act like a controller for the agents.....and that's about where it falls flat, for me. Syndicate had a pause for a reason - controlling four units in tight micro, while also monitoring various abilities and trying to monitor the minimap begins to border on the nutbar level of ""things to monitor at once"". Something will give, and for me, that's my patience with this game.Stims aren't pause, guys - and the game hurts for it. I'm sorry, you can claim ""vision"" but that doesn't polish a bad decision, and it cores out a game that otherwise feels like it will be fairly solid shortly (once the rough edges get a bit of a sanding). Maybe they'll relent or the modders will save them from their arrogance, but I'm not going to recommend a game I cannot enjoy, and this was definitely one of those.6/10, would only recommend for people with a deep seated need to hone their RTS micro, and not to fans of Syndicate. More style than substance, and several design decisions and buggy implementations mar what should otherwise have been a fantastic reboot and retelling of the Syndicate theme and tone.A shame, really.

												To be completely honest, I'm on the same bandwagon as those who followed the game because they knew and loved good ol' Syndicate. I got dubious at first, but after some time I decided to give it a shot.Essentially it could be summed as this : Came for Syndicate, stayed for Satellite Reign. I got Really hooked on all the tactical aspects, the cross references and all the stuff you need to check ahead and plan before actually doing it. For that matter, I might be the type to have been using the Support's world scan ability the most, and that gave me a pretty good idea of the degree of complexity involved in the level design. There are 4 zones. Might seem short, and that's because it is. If I could have another 2 zones, I'd take em without hesitation. The fact is, the concept works. You have a small team of experts with the potential of being ludicrously powerful near the end, but like all Elites, you'll die in a swarm if you take the wrong approach. Meanwhile, if you're particularly patient, you can go through without being spotted at any point in time, and have that sweet sensation of being a really sneaky and cunning little twerp (which you can most likely guess, I was in my playthroughs). Another great thing I enjoyed was how you can trick civilians into tripping guard patrols, wasting their times, getting them blamed for a body they happened to walk near-by and other sort of thing that make you grin because you're allowed to shift all the blame of your nasty stuff onto some completely innocent bystander that'll end up fined or shot for the transgression.What do I reckon could use some polishing : Well pathfinding occasionally messes up. It doesn't happen often, but still regularly enough to be noticeable. Guards tend to try to go from a door to another, and simply fail to exit. Luckily, your agents have a wide array of skill to just mess with them and get them killed.Inventory tend to be too limited, even with the Pack Mule skills available to all. But in a way it serves as much as a balancing feature as much of reinforcing the idea that you're only specializing a team of specialists further. Still, I would have liked at least more freedom in the way of weapon carrying capacity. In a similar vein, Hijacking units is very fun and actually very useful, but would be much deeper if there was a way for players to instruct the hijacked to pick up weapons, or allow them to get kitted out via the relay beacons, even if that weapons the weapon is lost when the hibjacked is freed or dead. Again within the same vein : I found that enemies not using sniper rifles was actually kind of a swing and miss : the sniper rifle handling would work Very well with a computer, since aiming is both visible to the player, and gives enough time for them to either duck for cover or run and gun the sniper. Still the possibility of having a sniper nest as an obstacles would make for a nice amount of challenge and a change of pace.As mentionned above, I found 4 zones to be too short, even if all 4 zones were handcrafted and the systems associated with each spots were very well made indeed. The fact of the matter is, this layout wont change, which mean you atleast need a certain number to limit repetition. As an alternative, releasing a map editor and letting players create their zones might yield interesting results (even if I have no doubt it'll take a year or so for someone to make as detailed a map as the ones ingame. Ultimately, I hope the team pursues development, having additional zones available (through DLC or expansion, or via a map editor).It's not Syndicate (Syndicate was a lot more straightforward and simple), rather it's closer to Commando, but it's pretty much the same lore and the same gameplay architecture, with a more complex and tactical system.Do I recommend it ? Hell yeah ! The game stands on it's own, and it's a genre you simply Dont see done so often anymore.			"

												As an old Syndicate fan I wanted to like this game, but like many games these days I ran into technical issues that put me off right from the get-go. The game is clearly pretty badly optimized, as switching between Low and Ultra settings on my rather high-end PC barely did anything to my framerate. Disabling SSR (?) boosted my framerate from 30 to about 80, but considering the type of game it is and the quality of visuals, it should be running much better. I'm glad the game supports 120hz, but apparently it can't quite run at those framerates.I also quickly got frustrated with the unintuitive interface which seemed to get in the way. I'm sure with time I could get used to it, but as I didn't find things responding to my controls quite like I expected - if at all - it just wasn't worth the hassle for me when there are many other games out that don't have these problems.Games need to get their basics right because first impressions make all the difference. I'm not going to experience the rest of the game if I'm put off by so many other things.			"

												As a huge fan of Syndicate series I was excited to find this spiritual successor in the series.  Unfortunately I found it very boring and uninspired.  For an active city it seemed dead, hardly any interactions with the environment.  The AI is horrible, constantly getting stuck in areas and running around firefights instead of actively engaging with my team.  Also the graphics in my opinion are too bright for the cyberpunk setting.I truly wish this was a solid modern take on such an amazing series but it didn't hit the mark with me.			"

												One of the most frustrating games ever made. Devs clearly do not understand the difference between difficult and punishing. This is clearly NOT Syndicate. With a myriad of skills and game elements thrown in to try to give the game depth the devs missed the boat on the most crucial aspect: the combat. It is a mess plain and simple. When the game is best played with just 1 character stealthing around to avoid combat as much as possible you know you have severely failed in the most important aspect of the game.			"

												Make sure you live near the people you want to play with. The multiplayer won't work across continents. If only there was some way of connecting with people around the world... some sort of... international network or ""internet"" if you will, that could connect people all over the world.This review is also less sarcastic than the developers were when we came to them with the problem. Don't buy this game or anything else they make. Not worth it.Don't worry though, they will never see this review. They live in a different country.			"

												It saddens me that I find myself giving this game a bad review.  However, it is so poorly optimised that frame rates drop as low as 10-15 fps at times.  This is seemingly random, as there doesn't appear to be any particular graphical effect, or very busy area that causes it, and dropping my resolution and turning off all effects and setting the graphics to low also doesn't resolve the problem.  I may not have the most high-end machine, but it can run games like Elite: Dangerous and Alien Isolation on ultra, and achieve 60 fps with no problem, and GTA V on medium at 60 FPS.  This game should not be taxing my GPU so much that it will drop below 20 FPS even on low graphics settings. Additionally, there are areas where the cover system just does not work. Combine that with a clunky interface and you will often be frustrated by one of your agents running out into the open during a firefight, after you tried to command them to move to a different cover-location.  I could normally work round something like this, but Satellite Reign is so unforgiving that there is absolutely no room for mistakes.There are suggestions that switching to the nightly build of the game might relieve some of these issues, but not so far.  I would wait a while for the devs to do better QA and optimise the damn thing before buying.  If they sort these issues out, or at least either resolve the varying frame rate, or lock it to 30fps, I will gladly change my review to recommend, as it looks beautiful, even if it runs like a dog dragging it's hole across the carpet, the sound design is excellent and the fluff that I've seen so far is great too.

												This game is... my second refund on steam. I expected, from the video and screeshots, something like a mix of X-Com and Invisible Inc. What I found is... not that. Not sure what this game is about really.First from the start, the game ""throws"" you in with an introduction made from brief news extracts, and then you start the game itself. No clue why I'm here or what I'm supposed to be doing. I start through the tutorial, shooting a few guards along the way. The tutorial describes sneaking as ""hey, now that you learned to shoot, let's try sneaking, it works too"" or something similar. So I did. Next encounter, the tutorial let me do as I wish and I shot people.Until the ""end"" of the tutorial, the game seems comprised of group of short connected rooms which each propose somewhat of a challenge (I suppose) and then you can go back wherever your ""teleporter which rez people"" are located. The game is very insisting about that part: my agents respawn.Then I suppose I finished the tutorial and got my first mission, ""going to the police station"" (maybe ?). I stopped there.Problem with this game is that its mechanics seem great at doing whatever they're supposed to do (they are responsive, there seem to be a good layer of interaction between the classes and with cover and map objects), but the game doesn't convey ""WHY"", as a player, I should do any of those things.Stealth is the primary offender here. I litterally sat in the front of 2 guards with my 3 agents for 20+ seconds, they did nothing for some reason (the previous guards I found had to be passed or shot on sight), they I got little flashing red thingies when i got my weapons out and I decided to shoot them. None of my agents were even hurt. Is this really a stealth / infiltration game ?Also, It needs more story. Who are these ""guards"" ? What are they guarding ? Do they are from a single corp ? Multiple corp ? Do every guard know my names & face ? Are we in a building or in a street ?Maybe there is a great game 20 hours in. But if the first 30 minutes are so confusing and erratic, that they make me want to leave, there is no point.			"

												I really, REALLY wanted to like Satellite Reign more than I did, but it's so riddled with problems and flaws that overtake it's positive points.- Unresponsive units that take forever to do orders, have terrible pathfinding and are in general absolutely stupid. They'd be much, much easier to use if the game wasn't realitime, which it is, sadly. Units will disobey your orders, break formation ""just because"", will not shoot back if they are shot at first, etc.- Terrible performance- Horrible U.I, that is cluttered and obscures actually useful information- Broken stealth mechanics- enemy sightlines are not accurately shown to the player, guards behave in mysterious and weird ways and will often glitch themselves in an attempt to find you, and their reasoning is brain dead stupid (huh, these 4 glowing cyborgs just broke into our secret military installation? better kindly escort them out considering none of them are currently armed! Oh, some are carrying weapon/gear prototypes? Better let them just keep those!).- Lots of loading- Droning music that sounds good at first but quickly gets old when it turns out they loop forever- Repetitive gameplay and missions that drag down the open ended nature of the game. ALWAYS break into this bright glowing green door.- Micromanaging the units is way too tough for what they want you to do. Coordination is key, but your units move too fast and combat happens so quick that you have no time to react.- You deal a pitiful amount of damage early on, which means stealth or bust. It's only until the midgame, 10 or so hours in that you can begin to go in guns blazing, and even then enemies send hordes and hordes after you, endlessly respawning. Apparently one soldier with a machine gun can easily take down one of your dudes early game, which is just... pathetic, really. I'm not asking to mow down tons of soldiers easily, but I am asking to at least stand a chance against one.-No quicksaving.- The awful, just.. TERRIBLE controls. To say the game feels unresponsive is giving it too much credit. It is a chore to get your units to do anything at all.Just go play Syndicate instead.Now, despite this, I did clock 11 or so hours into the game before I gave up. You may say... why? Well, because it's a fun game. If you can look past all of these flaws, you'll adore the game for sure. I enjoyed myself, but these flaws got me to stop playing.			"

												To be completely honest, I'm on the same bandwagon as those who followed the game because they knew and loved good ol' Syndicate. I got dubious at first, but after some time I decided to give it a shot.Essentially it could be summed as this : Came for Syndicate, stayed for Satellite Reign. I got Really hooked on all the tactical aspects, the cross references and all the stuff you need to check ahead and plan before actually doing it. For that matter, I might be the type to have been using the Support's world scan ability the most, and that gave me a pretty good idea of the degree of complexity involved in the level design. There are 4 zones. Might seem short, and that's because it is. If I could have another 2 zones, I'd take em without hesitation. The fact is, the concept works. You have a small team of experts with the potential of being ludicrously powerful near the end, but like all Elites, you'll die in a swarm if you take the wrong approach. Meanwhile, if you're particularly patient, you can go through without being spotted at any point in time, and have that sweet sensation of being a really sneaky and cunning little twerp (which you can most likely guess, I was in my playthroughs). Another great thing I enjoyed was how you can trick civilians into tripping guard patrols, wasting their times, getting them blamed for a body they happened to walk near-by and other sort of thing that make you grin because you're allowed to shift all the blame of your nasty stuff onto some completely innocent bystander that'll end up fined or shot for the transgression.What do I reckon could use some polishing : Well pathfinding occasionally messes up.

The atmosphere / sound track is very good as well.My only complaint is that the game isn't long enough, I feel sad finishing it but ill probably play it again.10/10 Props to the devs for not cranking out another soul-less reboot like most of the big game companies.

												Satellite Reign is the most authentic feeling cyberpunk themed game I've ever played. And rivals that in terms of atmosphere than even some of my most beloved movies, comics, and games that use cyberpunk in the past!HOWEVER.....at the time of writing this and my current experiene, the thing that this game needed the most, it lacks. A fun story with memorable characters. The agents you control, and the story in general seems to lack any personality that would create a sense of anticipation and desire for what feels at times like simply a setting, without a story. You're fighting a seemingly corrupt corporation ...and? That's the start of or a major part of any cyberpunk experience! It shouldn't stop there, but that's exaclty what it feels like so far. I still highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys cyberpunk themed entertainment. Everything else is very polished and fun. What the story lacks, the gameplay makes up for in creating a  memorable experience.For more, check out my ""First Look"" video on my YouTube Channel!

												I have a powerful PC (i5-3570k at 4.4Ghz, GTX970 overclocked to 1500mhz.) that runs GTAV at 90+FPS on high settings and Doom 4 at 120+ on ultra.This game is lucky to run at a stable 40FPS. The developers recommend turning civilian density down, but not only does this do nothing at all, the setting doesn't stick, so you have to change it every time you launch the game.I have enjoyed what I've played of it, but this kind of performance is inexcusable. This game doesn't look half as good as it should for how utterly abysmal it runs. I will change my review when it has performance more in line with its graphics (which should easily be over 100fps.)			"

												Judging by the mixed reviews of late this is either a love or hate game. I personally loved the game although it was hard to ""get into"" initially and it has some flaws. Here my pros and cons:Pros:- Co-op - I have played this game in solo and co-op mode and altough co-op has its connection issues it was still very enjoyable.- Cyberpunk setting - I absolutely love the style in this game. The city feels rich and looks amazing, think TRON.- Different playstyles possible to accomplish goals. - For the elder among us: Syndicate Wars 2.0 Cons:- Performance/connectivity issues. The game can feel sluggish/laggy. By lowering my settings (even tough i have better than recommended stats) it ran fine.- Some achievements are fubar. For example: you have to shut down all camera's in one district in one go, since the game wont save or keep track of the ones you already shut down before. So 100%ers better stay clear of this game unless you feel sadomasochistic.Verdict:Overall i enjoyed the game but it has its flaws. I recommend getting this game on sale (7/10)			"

												Multiple issues. Saves would not load, pathfinding a mess, and it commits the cardinal sin of stealth games by not giving the player clear indications whether or not they are being observed. I certainly like the look and feel of the setting, the gameplay when it works is original but in its current state it is a bit of a dogs dinner.			"

												This is the remake that Syndicate deserved.  It is the right combination of RPG, squad shooter, and strategy game.  If you enjoyed the originals from the 90s, you'll love this.  If you've never played them... probably should skip them and just play this as they're horribly dated at this point.  I hadn't expected much from the novella, because, let's be honest there's a lot of video game related fiction that is just plain awful.  It ended up being a good, quick read, and provided a ton of back story for a game that already has a solid back story.  The game is also just about the right length of time.			"

												Have been playing it for a little while. I bought it for two reasons: firstly because I was a fan of Syndicate back in the day, even though I sucked at it and probably still do; and secondly, because a friend of mine tried to get me into the Netrunner card game, which I would have liked to do if I had the cash to burn and the guarantee of regular matches in my MtG loving country.But I digress. This seems pretty cool so far. The system for hijacking agents and cloning them is a bit confusing --- actually, no, it's very confusing, and the un-intuitive interface doesn't help. I'd recommend checking out some YouTube vids explaining it. Otherwise, everything else is easy enough to figure out with a bit of tinkering.It's great fun. I tend to play it as a top-down stealth game, but I'm still rather early in - and I'll explain why momentarily - but on the whole, it's great fun circling compounds trying to find all the access points and planning which route you're going to take and such. It might get to the point later where I'll have to beef up and take a more combative approach to some missions, though.The reason I'm not too far is because the game is fairly stable (on my Windows 10 PC) until I try to load a game. Then a crash is about 50/50 likely to occur. Maybe this has been fixed in the cloth dynamics patch. I'll have to check.But on the whole, if you liked Syndicate, and could do with that kind of gameplay in an open world, be sure to check it out.			"

												Satellite Reign is the perfect example of a game that it worth more than the sum of its parts. The world and story are rich and deep. There is almost no story telling but you do feel like you progress into a story you create yourself. Every gameplay systems are well thought and well put together. The skill and augmentation systems works perfectly with the few objects you can interact in the world. The combat is kinda meh but rewarding and challenging. I guess that technically speaking the game could use some optimization.After you finish the tutorial you are free to decide what to do and how to do it. I spent literally hours to carefully craft plans for a full stealth mission. Of course it would rarely go well and the mission would either end up in messy success or in a general retreat.Overall the game is immense fun. A full cyberpunk city of fun. I am not too familiar with the old Syndicates games but Satelite Reign is a good game in its own rights. I wish they release some extra districts or cities via DLC or that they give us some development tools to mod it ourselves.----------------8<-------------[ cut here ]------------------Editing my review to tone it down a little bit.I am still having great fun with the game and I still recommend it heartidly BUT be warned that there are indeed a lot of bugs between you and the endgame and I can now understand why some people would give it a bad review.Character get stuck randomly or get under the map etc. One bug in particular is preventing me from getting 100 achivements. This is bothering me way too much that it should be.			"

												Excellent game overall.  Took me about 25 hours for one playthrough.It's kind of like a real-time XCOM, you're given a team of 3 (eventually 4) people and your job is to overtake your 'benevolent' corporate overlord.  Each team member has a fixed class, but you will eventually find gear that will allow you to turn any one into basically any of the classes.Experience is gained from your characters doing various tasks, or just spending time in a restricted area, and you use the points to upgrade your characters skills.  Skills like hacking, cloaking, hardwiring, healing, drawing fire.Gear is obtained as prototypes, either bought on the black market or raided from various locations.  You then have to find researchers and pay them to research the prototypes, giving you the ability to buy the gear at will.  Gear ranges from various weapons (three types, ballastic, laser, plasma), to general gear (grenades, zip claws, armor, stealth units), to augmented body parts (head, arms, legs, body).I wanted to try to stealth the game, so everyone had a silenced sidearm, a rifle of some sort in case we went loud, a shield, body armor, personal cloak, and zip claw.  They were augmented for greater energy regeneration (used for stamina and abilities), greater accuracy, greater health/armor, and the ability to use high vents.  Stealthing became a lot easier at endgame than early game due to my greater selection of gear, skills, and general knowledge of how the game plays.There's multiple ways to approach your objective.  There's going stealthy or loud, but there's also mutiple paths.  If you scout properly, or complete the right side quests, you can open up easier ways to get to your objective.  Go in through the ventilation system, or get access to a locked backdoor where there's no guards.  Don't want to have to deal with those sentry turrets?  You might be able to pay someone off to deal with that.The game has a good directional cover system, is isometric but has no camera rotation and limited zoom, but everything is placed with this in mind and it's never a problem.Graphics are excellent, sound is excellent, gameplay is excellent (once I got into the swing of things, only The Division and Hitman got me to put it down, and even then for limited periods), just be aware that the game has a bit of a learning curve, some of the mechanics aren't fully explained (to my recollection).I give it a solid 9.5/10			"

												Comming as older gamer who has played the Syndicate titles when they were first released, I was looking forward to this title,  After playing the tutorial part I found it a bit confusing and overwhemed I guess, as I have gotton used to a bit more structure in my titles. But after a few hours of play I have gotton to grips how the game operates, and the punishment for losing a clone is'nt very servere, I would of liked a better introdution to what was Main MIssions and what were side missions at least for a few more missions. I am pleased the developers whave introduced the slow mo stims for players at the start as although I am not using this I can see why people want a real time tactical pause.I can understand if players are confused and frustrated at the start of the game, but please stick at it as its a wonderful game, but It could just do with a bit more user friendly at the start for younger gamers who have'nt played this type of genre before, but I suppose the game was pitched at old gits like me. Hopefully this will sell decent, but I think it was a bad time to release it out of early access. With Metal Gear Solid and Mad Max a similiar time, PC gamers need this style of games, but hopefully this will attract a younger crowd.			"

												The game is cool and I give it a 7/10 where at least 2 points are because of nostalgia.Gameplay is a bit weak and maybe too easy (not sure yet since only played a couple of hours) because it's simply easier to run away and wait until the alarms cool down than confronting enemies.The city is huge with a complicated power/data network for cameras and terminals that pretty much conditions all the gameplay. I think they should have implemented a minigame for the hacking/hardwiring instead of a tier of difficulty levels to be able to hack them.The teleport system is also lame, they should let you use the roads to drive/ride cars or public transport instead.

												The first thing you notice about this game is the beautiful asthetic and world.It feels alive, and there are plenty of things to do and interact with.While controlling four agents at one time can be difficult, it can be done, and when you get the hang of it the games becomes much better.The best part is how you can approach each mission from multiple angles, and the long list of customization for each agent.

												Finished the game with a bug ... - all of them died, respawned, went to an elevator and stuck! - used the beacon to respawn them all, and they got invisible except for the team captain ... - killed the final boss with unlimited grenade spam :3 (no cheat just stand on the beacon) and defeat the game ... - then a sudden power surge on my home (karma acts fast LOL) - repeats the game with the same tactic but without a bug, beat it! - 11/10 would do it again ...

												Most excellent game. Can be a little overwhelming at first, but once you figure out how to play, you won't be able to stop. Obviously, if you liked Syndicate you will probably love this for all the right reasons, although it's certainly not required to enjoy and appreciate this masterpiece. Just make sure you have a decent GPU for this one, as there are a lot of high-res textures and dynamic lighting effects. Makes for a gorgeous experience, but one that will easily blow well past the limits of many lower-end and/or older systems.			"

												This is Syndicate, brought up to the modern day, which if you are at all familiar with syndicate should know how good that is.For those that do not, syndicate was a game where you use cybernetically enhanced clone soldiers toting super high tech weapons and equipment to gradually expand your dominance on the world.This game is fantastic in how it has improved over the original.  Things like graphics and UI are obvious, but in the original syndicate you basically had two choices on how to do things, you either strapped your cyborgs up with the biggest weapons you could and marched on the enemy, or used a mind control device to get swarms of civilians, who you then armed and flooded over the enemy.  Or you could do both.This game brings in options like full/soft stealth, completely buying your way past obstacles, and more in depth approaches to combat then simply wading in with big guns, additionally instead of simply being extra bodies to hold guns like in the older games, ""persuaded"" civis and enemies essentially are like entire characters, with thier own skills and abilities and consumables.As an illustration, if there is a door in your way, what do you do?You can blow it up, shoot enough holes in it that it falls down, hack a nearby terminal, hack the door itself which is generally less convoluted but more dangerous, brainwash civilians or enemy soldiers to do it which is less likely to succeed but puts your guys in less danger, create a scene or something similar outside to cause someone inside to investigate and bumrush the door when they open it, completely bypass the door by looking for alternate ways in like venting or ziplines or areas filled with hazards which you can nullify.  Or you can just buy whatever it is you were going to break in there to get, cause you dont have time to♥♥♥♥♥♥around!And that is just to open a door, and there is probably even more options besides that, and a lot of situations have similar amounts of ways you can get around them.But the game is full of really nice features and peices of attention to detail.   For example one of your abilities is to hack the implants in other peoples brains, this lets you take control of them.  If you do that alot then enemies start not knowing who is and is not friendly, because anyone could turn out to be the thing, so they start killing each other off.  This makes sense, makes the enemies seem like more than HP amounts, and is something that doesnt need to be in the game, is never flat out said to be a thing, but makes the game much better for being there.Seriously though, this game I really damn like.It does have some bad points however, the primary one is that it is glitchy as all hell.  This does not seem to be the norm though, and is likely due to me playing on windows 10 (because I like microsoft stealing all of my personal information).But another one is that you only have 4 clones, and each of those clones is a specific class.  You cannot change your class balance.  This is a shame because it gives you less freedom to approach situations as you like.  It is also wierd as the game is built in such a way that each class can do the job you need them to, but each has thier own way of going about it.  This would make sense if you could change your class loadouts.  But because you always have one of each, you will tend to just use whichever way is the shortest distance wise.And the last major one is the cover based combat.  The game is built around cover based combat for you and the enemies.  The only problem with this is that both your soldiers and the enemies often bounce out of cover for no reason, or decide to leave cover to shoot the thing they could have easily shot, or decide to just start shooting the wall they're hiding behind instead of the enemy.  While it effects the enemies as much as it effects you, it is really rather irritating.  Especially once you get into really dangerous gunfights.  The difference between being in cover and not being is surviving well enough to fight back versus being incapped immediately in situations like these, so when one of your guys randomly pops out of cover for no reason he goes down.  The person you try to pick him up with also goes down because of course he does and so on and so forth.  This is rather irritating.There are other minor niggles like UI issues (The ability buttons are close to the bottom of the screen, going to the bottom of the screen disables any targettable ability you are currently targeting, if you click the ""ability buttons"" for instance a lot of the time they will immediately stop because of this), but they can be lived with.

												many years ago i grew up on syndicate wars for the ps1, it was a very strange and complex game and yet i fell in love, somthing about lighting every citizen around me and having them follow me armed to the teeth just to all clown car into a flying vehicle then dog pile out and blast a small armed area with a force enough to rival a small nation gave me great joy, this game is missing a couple parts i loved about syndicate wars like jumping into vehicles but THAT is NITPICKING compared to what it does give me, i recommend this game as it is beautiful, fun, violent, open world AND with up to 4 player co op you truly have some fun replayability and stratagy i mean just taking a SINGLE compound can take up too several hours if you are low on money and outgunned and outmanned which means you need to stratagise and sneak around. do yourself a favor and buy it. if i had to give any rating i would give it easily NOW with co-op 9.5/10tl,dr CYBER PUNK DYSTOPIAN OPEN WORLD RTS/RPG WITH ONLINE CO OP.

I finally got this after being on my list for a year or so, if you like rts with optional stealth then get this. Dont hesitate on getting it, it is worth it. I should have gotten it sooner, but the reviews made me wait. And the stealth as well, was thinking it was going to be boring. Between assasins creed and pillars of eternity, a mix of both. But its not boring, get this you wont be disapointed.From what I can see there are no cons, get this and support 5 lives studios.			"

												This was one of the nicest surprises in the last couple years: a very athmospheric, surprisingly deep game that combines just the right depth of RTS, RPG and Stealth. Throughout the game, your playstyle can (and, sometimes, must) adapt and there are alway multiple, truly different, ways to achieve the objectives thrown at you. Add to that the well-toned amount of humor that is woven into mostly item descriptions, and you got yourself a great way to have a good time!I rarely experienced such a varied and well-thought-out game and am hoping for a sequel or DLC.

												I cannot recommend this game.While the basics are great, the execution lacks a lot.So the game has a very hard save system, becuse you cannot save mid mission, even if the missions are over 30 minutes long. Thats completly fine and acceptable. The mechancs are justfied in the game world and story.What's not fine, are bugs, a ♥♥♥♥ tone of random bugs, that screw your character up, either making it not move, or just gets stuck in the maps 3D mesh. Stuff like that ruins, usualy until then a perfect mission run. There's nothing else for a player to do to just restart or get around that bug, which makes things even harder.Other stuff are really bad are graphic/physics glitches, bad AI pathing, strange AI NPC behavior, bad weapon/combat stats and their meaning, unclear cover/none-cover walls and many many other things I don't feel like mentioning becuse this is enough for a thumbs down.So in other words, it's great someone rebooted syndicate (wars), but we deserve better, especialy for this price.

												This game had some harsh reviews, but for what it was meant to be - a spiritual successor of Syndicate - it did surprisingly good for the little money and time that was offered by the Kickstarter. I think the authors hoped to receive more and I was kind of sceptical about this title.But it worked out! Not without issues. NOWHERE near perfect. But it was fun. It didn't drag on. I liked it andeven hoped it would be a little longer. But overall I am happy that this game was created and I would kickstart the second game right away!It has this nice dystopian feel, heavy cyberpunk, but the story is on the light side. It's more about tackling different areas, planning your way in and out or making sure you can efficiently eliminate all the threats.I'd personally give this game a 7/10 score, but if you don't care for the old titles or particularly enjoy the setting, you can drop 2 points.I know I had fun to the end of the game. While I couldn't finish all the AAA games that came out last years, which should say something. I am torn, so I just suggest reading forums. The issues go way beyond what I could cover in this review anyway, but I still do not regret this at all. I just think it's worth it :)			"

												An excellent return to a cyberpunk dream we envisaged our cyberpunk nightmare would actually become but unlike reality this group RTS cyberpunk puzzle adventure delivers in so many ways.Obviously inspired by games such as syndicate and hawking back to era of less forgiving mechanics this game blends an RTS control scheme with a highly demanding puzzle mentality to provide a highly challenging and compelling journey through a futurist city on the eve of total domination but corporate security & big money, with you the underdog the only one who can save the day. Some raise the high levels of punishment for losing a character in a perma-death system, or the nature of the way we approach these games [as an issue]; always wanting a perfect run [which won't happen] but if you can embrace the risk and dare the challenge the reward can be so much sweeter. Highly recommend the game and additions such as CO-OP play make for an excellent addition in recent months. Mod support for C# coders wishing to try their hand given extensibility even I hope to utilise soon, only extending the shelf like of this hidden gem of a game! "

												So I Just FIred the CEO.What a game. Originally a fan of syndicate this was on my radar a long time. I Thank the developers for such a great game. What did i Like: Awsome customability. The agents can be made just like you want. Agressive or stealth. Lots of guns, augs, skills and gears. Open world.  Great story If you bother reading the missions. What I did not like: High learning curve. Starting running into enemy bases is not a sound tactic at first. Got killed ever time. Almost put the game away until i got into the ""rythm"".Experienced no bugs throughout 42 hours gameplay. Except agents got stuck a couple of times. COOP is amazing later on in the game. THe agents have so much skills that its impossible to control them all at once.The singleplayer and multiplayer has the same savegames. Best recommendations. IMPORTANT NOTE: LEARN THE BASIC SKILLS. DO THE TUTORIAL. I did not know takedowns existed until later in game.			"

												This game is advertised as having local co-op. It does not have this feature.Maybe the developers think ""local"" co-op means ""local"" area network. This is the equivalent of mistaking peanut butter for butterflies.			"

												This game borrows heavily from an old game I used to play called Syndicate. That is not a bad thing. It looks and plays like a polished and updated Syndicate. I almost missed this game because of the title though. This game deserves a better title.			"

												The game has great graphics and atmosphere, although it is plagued by terrible controls, unoptimised performance, and tedious gameplay.The default camera mappings are the arrow keys instead of WASD, and if you try to change the keys A always remains mapped to some cursor shooting cursor.The text on the UI is very small which makes the game hard to use on a TV.I'd love to recommend this one, since I love the cyberpunk genre, but it's not fun and it plays like an early access title.

												Just a couple of brief comments:Overall feeling is - that the game was originally something like an amateur mod-like type and later somehow was transformed into a full fledged project. Visuals are ambiguous -  nice mocap and models on one hand but weird colors and eclectic art style on the other. Gameplay is plain, straightforward and very monotonous - there is no place for tactics or fun just overflood enemies with cursor fire. Stealth is an option in theory but on practice it is just a dull and repetative movement from cover to cover.  UI is bulky and IMO overcomplicated which in conjunction with primitive gameplay gives a somewhat inconsistent and even frustrting experince.To sum it up -  Unfortunately it is not a ""new Syndicate"" as somebody saying. Just a very mediocre game which is going to sell itself trying to mimic classic titles. Definitely would not recommend it.			"

												This game had a lot of potential, had it incorporated some xcom, with shadowrun probably would of been a masterpiece. Sadly the controls are wonky, the start is so slow and like most games that throw tutorials at you to get acclimated.  This game relies on your past experiences with similar games.  The atmosphere is unique and allows  the player to be quickly immeresed in the urban sprawl of the future.  The AI however is the biggest deal breaker of the game, trying to control 4 characters with a slow down system instead of turn based or pause is such a deal breaker.			"

												idk, I want to like this, after all the good reviews, but somethings lacking so far. An hour in.This isn't syndicate. Perhaps its more like commandos, and reading that before I like both games so thought I would like this. It doesnt have weight, it would be better if the characters actually moved people out of the way rather than gliding through them. Cars just appear. The neon glow is a bit much. Gun fights seem lack luster. That's not Syndicate. The enemies don't seem to do logical things. Gun fights can be chaotic when the enemy units runs to your squad and stands amongst them and you're trying to shoot him. They soak up bullets. Controlling squad members and weapons could be better. It doesnt have the precision of Commandos.After getting the 4th squad member, research happened, and then instantly ran out of money which meant I couldn't bribe a researcher. So I hacked an atm which seemed to be the only thing to do to gain money. It's not really clear how else to get money or how those things work.The cities nice enough, if there was a little more precision and weight to squads, balancing gun fights. The cameras and security door mechanism is okay. sometimes a little unclear when you enter a danger zone due to the neon and brightness mixing with camera spot lights. So it's a little disappointing.I want to keep coming back to it, becasue perhaps there's some thing here later in the game which is worth it, due tothe reviews. But this is the second time quitting and not having the urge to continue.			"

			You can get the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/268870 A non-biased quick look @ 'Satellite Rain' - Fans of the original Amiga version of 'Syndicate' will love this.		

Fans of the original Amiga version of 'Syndicate' will love this. Satellite Reign is a real-time, class-based strategy game, set in an open-world cyberpunk city. You command a group of 4 agents through rain-soaked, neon-lit streets, where the law is the will of mega-corporations. Use your agents to sneak, shoot, steal, and sabotage your way up the corporate ladder, and take control of the most powerful monopoly of all time. Each of your agents can be tailored toward your favoured play-style, while still maintaining their own unique specialisations. Shape your team into an offensive war machine, or an elite covert spec-ops outfit, and take the open-world city as your own. - Highly Recommended!			"

												Was looking forever for a cyber punk game, with action, in a free roam city; and wasn't Deus Ex; and finally found this; was unsure at first, because I am not big into RPGs; fired it up to check it out for a moment before bed, and am now what feels like ages later; beat the first mission and enjoyed the experience immensly. The team working on this has done a great job; I love the action; and the stealth; and the old school feel; and the art work around the city is FANTASTIC; your art team has killed it hardcore on this; the amount of work they put into every video board is incredible.The music is perfect; I am pulled right into the game; and exploring the city is great fun.I don't know much about coding, but it's clear their team went above and beyond on this side of things too; the World View skill is a great layer; and the AI works well; especially compared to the AI in a lot of modern games.

												In short, this is a good game, worth to buy and worth to play. It recall me the happy time with Sydicate.However, there are some very annoying bugs to drive you mad. I wish the developers fix these as soon as possible.The one bug really trip me is the one related to hacker's skill upgrade. The skill points get missing when failed to upgrade hacker skills. I found my hacker did not get full skill set after he reach the max level of skill points(67), it means, my hacker can not performance his full skill set. I have to replay the game from the beggining to keep watching the growth of my hacker.So, if you are new player, you'd better to keep this in mind - do one save before skill upgrade, and check if the skill level change after skill points have been assigned, reload if it failed(esp to hacker, change a new clone is a work around as I found in this forum)The version I am talking about is 1.07.08. I think this bug should be fixed with high priority.			"

												Well.. I'd like to say I love this game, but it seems to keep getting in its own way.  Buggy, unoptimized (low frame-rates by comparison to similiar graphical demands) and nonsense options, like giving you key-remapping option that simply doesn't work.  Overall I tend to spend more time being frustrated with the poor implementation than enjoying the good nuggets of content buried under low-performance and bugs that should have been launch-stoppers.Seriously in need of a 1.1 release / bugfix patch.  Disappointing.  Will take a look at it again in 3-6 months to see if I can update my review.  Otherwise its ""holiday sale"" fodder, at best.			"

												I WANT to like this game.  I really really do.  I grew up playing Syndicate and this could have been a good sequel to it.  Everything about this game is really well done.  Hats off to the developers for attention to detail.So why am I not recommending this game?  It's too darn hard.  I've tried and tried and tried to play it and my party gets wiped on almost every mission.  I've scoured the web to improve but there's not a whole lot out there.  It's not fun when you die constantly.  I don't enjoy that.  Maybe it's just me and I suck.  If so, so be it.I would really like to see a selectable difficulty level on the game.  Easy mode, Normal Mode, Ultra-Hard Mode, etc...  Spawning is an issue in my book.  Whenever you get detected, the waves of enemies keeps spawning and spawning and spawning getting progressively harder with each wave.  Once you're discovered you're pretty much screwed if you think you can stand and fight.  You HAVE to run and hope to find a spot to evade detection which seems very hard to do.  Even if you're hiding, they always seem to magically detect you eventually.  Very frustrating.If you like really hard games and you enjoy the challenge, you'll probably like it.  If you're like me and want to ""casually"" play and actually have fun, then then I wouldn't recommend it.  And for the record, I completed XCOM and XCOM2.  Those were quite challenging but still loads of fun.			"

												What a terrible disappointment. Perhaps nostalgia got the better of me with this one.The game had me so hyped that it was going to be a worthy followup to Bullfrogs Syndicate. Honestly I dont know how they could be mentioned in the same sentence. This game seems to be more about hacking, than the four cyborgs with massive miniguns tearing up a city I remember from my youth. I just seem to have walk around the map right clicking on ATMs. Played it for an hour and got bored with the clunky controls. The stealth mechanics are a joke and the combat is uninspired.Really glad i didn't by on release and waited for the Lunar New Year Sale. £7 you pay your money and take the chance. £23  way way overpriced for this indie nostalgia cash in.

												I was thrilled to see this game come out of early access. I heavily considered backing it during its Kickstarter campaign due to my love of cyberpunk, but had already contributed money to other projects. The game does a some things right, particularly with its setting, but fails in so many other areas that I cannot recommend it.I've only played the game for 3 hours and felt like I was fighting the controls the entire time. - Often I'd place a sniper in a high position only to watch her refuse to take a shot at anyone below once the combat start. Occassionally she would run down an elevator to join the other combatants, getting gunned down the entire way. There's no way she didn't have line of sight to at least one of the army of enemies below her.- Any time I tried a stealth kill with a silenced weapon, the character would run up to arms length with the target, who would trun around at the approach and initiate a gun fight. Outside of the tutorial these stealth kills never once worked. - Characters I'd moved around for a wide flank would end up getting flanked themselves by one of the enemies that seem to come from every single direction. Not so much a problem in itself, but while I was focusing on my other two operatives, the two moving around to flank would completely ignore anyone shooting them in the face from 5 ft away unless expressly told to return fire. There is no toggle I know of for characters to automatically return.- Weapons must be manually drawn, meaning I needed to pull out the weapons for each of my characters if they got into a fire fight. Clicking on enemy would not automatically instruct the characters to pull out their weapons, which made absolutely zero sense.I could go on, but these represent that major annoyances encountered in just the first few hours. The above, however, does not include the bugs.- I crashed to desktop every single time I tried to exit to main menu or load within the game.- Cars in the game could be seen doing sharp donuts in the middle of a high security facility. Cars also seem to pass right until my operatives, who launch over them and back onto the ground as if nothing happened.- Enemies spawned from alarms return to their doors and run in place agains the door, sometimes stacking up to 3-5 enemies stacked on eachother fruitlessly running into metal for no reason.Satellite Reign is severely flawed both mechanically and operationally and still feels like an early access/unfinished product. The game desperately needs a pause feature, more information on chances to hit and the benefits of cover, stealth kills that actually work, info on character line of sight, and so much more. This is a tactical game that removes your ability to operate tactically and as such needs a lot of work.			"

												This is a good base for a better game to be built off of.The world is big, but has nothing really holding it together. You just run from compound to compound doing missions which... have little to no story to them.The story is almost nonexistant if you don't bother reading all the extra materials.The complete lack of variaty in weapons, augmentations, and gear can be terrible frustrating.Enemies are gigantic bullet sponges, more often than not your guys will never hit when shooting at them, unless you tell them to more often than not they won't even fire back to save themselves.Unless you don't want them to, in which case they will.This game needs a smaller venue with more focus on missions, rather than an open world.A smaller more narrative focus will benifit it greatly because without that... well, I couldn't tell you why I did anything in this game beyond the need for better gear.It needs more weapons, more augmentations, more gear. And it would be even better if researching the various things unlocked more hidden items.The ability to pause would be a godsend.The ability to easily differentiate between friends, foes, and civilians would be nice. More often than not they all blend together except on extreme zoom, or for the occassions where you're facing the heaviest opposition.Personally I enjoyed the style of gameplay, but this game itself was boring and frustrating.I see lots of potential for a sequel if they fix the problems.But after the ending do I recommend this game? Ugh, that ending made it a no.No, I forced myself through in the hopes that something of value was going to happen and what do I get? Out of nowhere (spoiler censored) nonsense and a really... really bad pun.If you want this, wait for a sale. Or some serious tweaking.			"

												A wonderful game for when you want to bang your head against the wall untill the blood flows, this game drove me potty until I finally realised what was wrong and unistalled it. This thing is a sod to play, thanks to the checkpoint save system and the totally random natures of the stealth encounters. you can get ten minutes into a perfect stealth intrusion and then get it blown by one error, which invariably results in a firefight. At that point you either quit and start from scratch, wasting ten more minutes getting back to the same point, or you fight it out, at which point you might have well just started shooting the second you started the mission and saved yourself some time. I wasted an entire saturday trying this and just got fed up with it. Uninstalled. Wish I hadn't brought it.-----------Slightly changing my opinion on sunday. Re-installed and gave it another shot. Still s**t. the camera angle being fixed is dumb, makes everything harder and wholever chose that on the Dev team needs to get slapped. the checkpoint save system still makes everything artifically harder. It needs way more worldbuilding. some very dodgy gliches, like watching an infiltrator with a SNIPER RIFLE running right up behind a guard and sniping him. from five feet away. Apparently, stealth kills have to be done from close range. Nice to know, you should have made that clear. Why doesn't he change to the pistol? since killing guards is core gameplay, why didn't this bug get fixed? So many stupid little things, that just show how limited the develpoment of this game really was. gliches and bugs. gameplay errors. this game is a damning inditment of modern game development, ambious but deeply flawed and far short of its potential. It can be fun when you win, and i have been playing it for two days now. But this game is seriously unwhelming and frustrating.			"

												Hello,Stop playing the game after 6 hours. I am going to be short and to the point.Major frustrating issues:a) Agents didn't shoot back when fired upon.b) No Pause feature. Can be very handy if you want to switch guns or reassign tasks. c) Switching my guns/weapons without unholstering them. d) There is no toggle scanner feature.  A kind of overlay that shows the view cone of your enemies that you can toggle     with a shortcut.General:-Micromanagment is way to heavy. ( Also because you have to re-target after each kill ). Small hick ups: I never had the feeling i won a battle. Each time i got into battle agents keep calling for backup what left mewith only one option ""fleeing away"". Doesn't feel very victorious... after a while it wears you out. I am following the news/updates and hope to receive an update of these improvements so i can continue playing the game. Kind regards,Trisnake.			"

												A deeply flawed game hiding what could have been a very good game. Unfortunately, endless bugs, pathing errors, and other assorted glitches often turn a fun gaming session into a lesson in frustration and wasted time.Then you get into the poor design decisions like the constant wobble cam, and the scaling difficulty. I did like the aesthetic and the setting, and there was good support for being a sneaky crew or a smash down the door playstyle. Unfortunately these things aren't good enough that I want to do everything two, three, or more time because my character carrying the mission macguffin glitched off the map, or the game corrupted my save and reset me to the tutorial setting when I'm two districts in.

It is an immensely frustrating game about ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that doesn't even tell you what ito do. This is by far one of the worst selections I've made on a game in a long ♥♥♥♥ing time. I should have gone for the refund. I could stab myself in the face and still have more fun then I did in this terrible cofusing(and I did manage to get through a lot of missions, even without it telling me why or what or who). Hopefully the developer takes a good long look at their product and make sure they aren't this stupid a second time.			"

												Review is short as I don't want to waste any further time on it. No tactical pause sucks... unless you spend points and then it's only partial. So there is no team exection as it would be if you and I we're on a headset and said ""GO"".  Line of sight was horrible IMHO; AI was weak, guard spawn was lame. SR lacks character depth, weapon depth and the quest/mission delivery felt like a moshpit. For those of you with family and work there are no saves during a mission. This was a PITA for me as Murphy always seemed to strike mid-mission. Anyways, to each his/her own but not for me.  "

												Bought this game in the Winter sale. A tactical game Wannabe I woudld say. Great idea but poor design. The mechanics is straight forward. The Devs try to make the game more challenging and unique but it ends up only making stuff more complicating and boring. The story and the context is rather dull. Shooting scenes are like cupboards shooting each others until one falls. The visual design is horrible. Making everything neon doesn't mean it's in the future. It makes me feel like the game is designed for boys under 16yo (Those boys who make 'your mum is so fat' jokes). Refund requested.			"

												After about 2 minutes to load the game for the first time, and being thrown in a level with little to no context, I figured this was terribly programmed, optimized and planned.And that was exactly what I got.Bad camera, weird balance, and the way to ""fix"" the bad balance is that your characters can die as much as you like and only get spawned in the nearest beacon. Decent visuals, but I would certainly go for something like X-com instead. I cannot recommend this game, specially if you have a low/mid spec machine.And no, this is not better than Syndicate. Syndicate was lightyears better than this, it stands as a good game even today, while this one is a bugfest with little campaign plot tought.			"

Morally...this game sucks! Do I really have to murder my way through just about every mission? Heck, some of the missions I need to advance are literally assassinations. Not cool.

Add to that the fact that there isn't a whole lot to do in terms of variety, from what I've seen so far, and top it all off with some bugs or missing features on the Linux version like not being able to remap control keys, and it sums up to be underwhelming and somewhat of a disappointment.

												This Review is based off the short time I played the game.I'd Like to love this game I would, But for me this game was extremely Buggy.The two major bugs I had are as follows.Units when in combat would stop doing anything and would just stand up in the open and waggle their gun left to right even after being given orders. This even happened to the enemies on occasion.The other major bug I had was everytime I loaded my save I could not give any orders to my units at all, The only way to fix this was to just keep reloading till it worked.When I did get to play the game was fun, But moments of it working were far and few between.I Have refunded this game as of right now, But I will most likely pick it back up in the future when a sale happens.

												This game is half done gameplay. The only good things relatively well done are the stealth, the graphics and the animations of the whole town, and the writing is ok but nothing great, and that's it.The combats means controlling real time 4 characters with zero pauses and they have ZERO AI!!! Any RTS do much better since 20+ years, lol. There's covering, movements, weapons switching and targeting, if a character get shoot he doesn't fire back nor even go in cover, the controls are still rather bad, and there's a lot of abuse of enemies spawning. That's ridiculous.The economy is also ridiculous with a system where you just wait time to get more money. For sure some missions allow get more money but that free money mechanism break all and pinpoint the inability to build a true gameplay.Other than that everything else is at level of a casual game, hacking is a simple click and a short cooldown, rob a bank is a simple click, and so on.

												As much as I wanted to like this game, the economy just completely killed the game for me. In order to keep you agents with decent equipment you need to research them, which costs a ton of cash, and most of the cash you get in game is through a passive ATM hack. The problem is that even when you're actively pursuing objectives you never have enough money to research the required equipment. Since the enemies scale with your team's level, I felt outmatched by the enemies before I completed the first area. You have the ability to buy new equipment, but most of it costs 10k-20k and I was getting at most $3 a minute.The game pauses after any length of inactivity, so there's really no way for you catch up with the curve.I enjoyed the strategy, but the lack of funds to keep my team going, and what appeared to be RNG equipment drops, just killed my enjoyment of the game.

												This game is mediocre at best. If you are desperate to revisit your gilded memories of Syndicate Wars on DOS, this might be your fix. All others should exercise caution. I'll put this in simple STEAM review pro/con parlance:PROs:+ Depth: Quasi-customizable character models with numerous options for tweaking your squad of agents. Includes various weapon types, mods, and augmentations that cater to multiple play styles.+ Art: Well done cyberpunk art direction. The game world is accented with plenty of neon to break up the urban dystopia.CONs:-Annoying, unskippable tutorial that seems intent on shoving blinking boxes in your face.-Clunky, unsatisfying combat. Picture a smooth, flowing river. Now picture a dude trying to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥after sex. It's the latter one.-Lame auto-scaling enemies ensure you are almost always out-gunned if you want to ""go loud"". -Tedious, grindy missions.Short story long?

												TLDR: if you want the Syndicate experience go to GOG and get Syndicate, gg&wp. If you want to try Sattelite Reign which is not and no where near Syndicate, well, enjoy. If you are a fan of Syndicate like myself and want to buy this game because of that reason, I suggest don't, not even on a sale because it'll probably leave you sorely disappointed.The way missions work, the way augments, ammo, utilities and weapons gathered are completely different. For example in Syndicate people you killed dropped weapons which you could pick up, there would be missions to get scientists and tech for research. There were missions for money and to recruit agents. There are missions here as well but all the missions are on the same map, there's no base, there's no globe (yet loading screens...). This big map with smaller districts have all your missions in it and your agents never leave that field, there is no base hence pretty much no management aspect. You siphon money from ATMs and that's it. Recruiting scientists? Nope. There's this ""bribe"" mechanic basically you go around ""scanning"" random NPCs or mission NPCs and bribe them for various reasons. Recruitment works in a similar way, you scan a dude, hijack him and ""send him back"" as clone material (you may go ""the what material?"") well it turns out you use people as meat to recreate your dudes but then the meat people you hijack and send back... oh my f**king god... are listed as they are and can be used as they are. So you clone your guys' minds to new bodies or some sh*t I don't know. Anyway the screen where you set your active agents is designed in a way to make you want to break your keyboard. You want to click on a new guy to see his stats? Sorry, no can do, you recruited that git you're stuck with him forever. I guess they all start the same? Nobody knows, it's a mystery, forget about it! There are 4 slots in your group: soldier, support, hacker, infiltrator and you set a guy's job hence abilities as they level up by clicking on the slot then clicking on a guy but it gets so messy, good god a pot head must have designed that thing, or maybe someone on bath salts.Weapons work in a weird way too. You invest a crap load of money to research a better(!) gun then end up emptying clip after clip on a lowly guard but then can 1-shot assasinate someone with a lower tier pistol. Just like in real life? Sure, why not? Oh and one sucky thing is you can knick any cars, no driving in this one.Graphicswise it's not amazing, music, voice-over work, sound effects are generic and poorly done. AI & pathing can be quite funny, you shoot a guard down for example, his buddies show up, you run around a corner and hide and a short while later they say that the suspects have gone and then you can come out of hiding and say hello, they won't know it's you or you have to tag a building for a mission (basically most if not all your missions involve going to the designated building, entering it then exiting it and you're done) it's surrounded by guards, you double click, your guy runs in, by the time cameras or guards notice him he's out and running back (LuL), or a guard of one faction can waltz in to the base of a different faction and since all guards can pass through gates it starts a small faction war for no reason (sometimes messing up your progress). Similarly messed up paths of civilians sometimes crossing into a restricted area can cause all hell to break loose too.With the amount of bugs even though not that much but can find you at the worst possible time you might think: ""hey, that's what quicksaving is for"". Nope, sorry champ, there is no quick saving. Autosaves are frequent and you can manually save but the game won't put you where you saved, instead you spawn at the last beacon you visited (because immersion). Long story short, you can't try anything for science, this game hates science it seems. No shenanigans allowed.			"

												Not worth buying!Overall i realy want to like this game. but NO! Too much failed gameplay elements for a good game! It makes fun for around 5 hours till than the game is ruined.It seams to be some kind of tactical somehow, be sneaking-in steal information and go on, but there to much unbalance to make this game fun. Like the XCOM series its leveling up, do missions and upgrade your units - that makes real fun and is the best part of the game till the point where no more upgrades make sense und you do the same as at the beginning only against a overcrowed bunch of overupgraded soldiers. You have better weapons but its against higher hitpoints, there is no balancing for this. The NPC only are upgrade according your gear and your fight exactly the same again only with higher hitpoints. the missions are quiet always to same, that would not realy be a problem because some possibilies to make diffrent chooses (like use a vent for stealth instead of shooting) but its always to same. go to the at hardes secured area, always after lotting be invaded by alot of high soldiers and mostly your death, beside the fact you absolute stealthed in, there are always alarm... realy senselessThe open world is realy great, very cool ambient. To bad it's mostly ruined the gameplay that the low soldiers running around try to kill you without any reason, only kill at sighn. they die you have to wait that the timer go down and than next way to to mission or more shooting. if not soldiers try to attack you some of the security cameras always reports. put you guns out and you have alert, let it in you have alert to... run and maybe already run into soldiers. alert = fight...The missions are sometimes realy funny, pribe a person to get information, use a person to get key information for easier entrance. but after all its only running around, click on them and mostly they are useless. you do it anyway by the mostly obvious easiest entrance and you have mostly more success than as the mission logs described. some of the mission absolut makes no sense. if you got in there you got bad loot for a high death rate. the loot is quietly always to same, blueprints and a mission description. use it to get better weapons are arms and after all the enemys get stronger and you have absolute no progress for looting it. very sad.

Trapped.""Ok, no worries, bugs happen. I'll just use my second squad member to travel to the next checkpoint so everyone respawns together.""""...Right after I check what's back in the corner...""Proceed to lose second squad member in same pathing bug, trapped outside the map.Uninstall and shelve Satellite Reign""It was a good run."":'(			"

												Have to run it at 960x600 at otherwise lowest graphics settings to get anything approaching decent FPS.Criticism 1 here: Even as is i see many effects on that do not need to be on, weather effects, shader effects, etc. If there were more options the game could be tuned to run fine on higher resolutions.Criticism 2: Sadly, at that resolution the UI is completely unusable, since the fonts are tiny and blurred into smudgy messes, and you're expected to make use of buttons that are mere pixels across.If they fixed either of those, it be good to play, but as it is, if you have a weak-ish machine, i cannot recommend this game.

												Satellite Reign is an engaging and stylish homage to the classics. It includes all the improvements you'd expect from the last 20 years of game design theory: A high-contrast neon cityscape to play through; your operatives  have classes rather than being interchangeable; the game is set in a single sprawling, explorable location and, of course, it has multiplayer.  Satellite Reign feels like the game Syndicate would have been if it were conceived with the advantages of 2010s design theory and hardware. Highly recommended to fans of the genrel, or anybody who likes cyberpunk ambience and realtime squad-based action.			"

Connection to server sucks and controls made me want to hang myself.

												Obviously this isn't a complete review but here is why I didn't bother investing more time into this game:Beware of the skill system that doesn't allow re-specing points in combination with incredibly stupid checkpoint based (!!) autosaves that happen right after you made the wrong choice. OUCH!!!Want to save during a mission? Nope, not possible - you'll have to start from the very beginning  of the mission if you make a mistake.Why punish the player like that?And: Characters tend to get stuck permanently in certain spots, even in the tutorial. Combine this with the saving issues and you're in for a lot of ""fun""!			"

												It's just not good.It's a real time tactics game in which the tactics are ""shoot the guys.""  You don't get to make a lot of interesting decisions, and the stealth is kind of laughable.  I wish this game were good, because it looks great and it has a great premise, and I credit the developers for delivering what they promised. But it just isn't engaging, interesting, or satisfying to play.It's lacking in tactical depth, and tries to make up for that lack of complexity with the cloning system that lets you grab random passersby and turn them into agents.  Yeah, just what I wanted, to run around looking at the stats of random civilians to determine who has a +1 I can use.How about you add some interesting dimensions to the tactical play instead?			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!The game has one of the most amazing concepts ever. Literally ever. I want a game like this SO BAD.This game, however, is a steaming pile of garbage. The controls simply DO NOT WORK. There is a system of having your weapon drawn or holstered. Holtered means you can walk around undetected, and that works fine. Drawn weapon draws attention, but you can fire at people. This...doesn't work. I have all my agents with weapons drawn, I click to attack something, and they all just run from cover like excited puppies that need hugs. They charge up and proceed to get shot in the face OVER AND OVER. Finally, after a few full blown shotgun blasts to the face, they start to fire back...from...out in the open.The tutorial will teach you that you can hide REALLY close to a guard and not be noticed. I had one on the other side of a chest-high wall I was crouched behind not notice me SEVERAL times. Once you get out of the tutorial though, oh HELL NO! I get spotted from across the map while in cover in a few moments flat.This game had all of the potential in the world, but instead took a dump and asks you to eat it.0/10, do not play, do not buy, do not look at. Don't even contemplate. I wish like crazy I could remove this pile of garbage from my library, but Humble Bundle means no refund.♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												I was gifted this game.We intended to play it multiplayer, but apparently the developers didn't do very well on that part of the game because every time a player would try to host, the game, and occasionally Steam itself, would crash.I didn't bother playing the singleplayer, because multiplayer was the entire purpose we had the game in the first place.Would I pay full price for this game?

												This review has a lot of my opinions in it, and doesn't necessarily reflect my objective review of the game as a whole. In addition, I only made it through the tutorial before making my mind up about it. So, to digress: I'm a HUGE fan of the cyberpunk genre, and when I heard of this game's release I pretty much exploded. It was exactly what I was looking for in a game: huge, open-world environment, player-character customization, and of course the cyberpunk aesthetic. Add that the game is on sale currently and I bought it almost immediately. I was extremely excited, sat down, lights turned down, and launched the game.It was extremely boring.It was the letdown of the century: the gameplay was tedious, the environment had no life, it just lacked any sort of fun. Believe me, I tried to look past this for the sake of the fact I was playing a cyberpunk game but the novelty soon wore off. For me, it just wasn't what I was looking for. If you're a detail-oriented, micromanaging player who doesn't mind a bit of monotony here and there, then Satellite Reign might be just up your alley. But if not, and you feel monotonous gameplay might get on your nerves, give this one a pass.			"

												Convoluted confusing mess. It might be a good game, but unless you're the game developer or have hours to search for basic game questions and information on how to actually play, forget about it. The tutorial is beyond poor and explains very little. Things occur in the game that aren't explained and with the poor save check point system makes playing it a pain because one mistake usually result in reloading from the very beginning of a mission.The game insists on itself that you are an expert and know how to do everything right from the beginning. Good luck trying to figure it out.			"

								This game shouldn't be released on early access yet. It's in very early days and while it looks pretty, the graphics are highly UNoptimized and the game extremely buggy.That said, the atmosphere created is incredible. Such a rich expansive cyberpunk world.I cannot wait for the finished product, but as it is this is just a complete tease. Right now it's more of a tech demo. You can see where development is going but it's a long way from completion.Keep patiently waiting, it'll be worth it.			"

												Unbelievably bad game. I played and completed Syndicate ages ago when it was first released. Hard to believe that with modern hardware they can release a game that is much worse than the original.I got a bad feeling when I first launched the game and it took forever to load. This is the slowest launching game I've played in many years. It goes downhill from there. The tutorial is next to useless. There is no manual and I disliked the game so much I wasn't willing to put the time into figuring out the details of how to play the game. "

								While I love the concept of the game (I've played original Syndicate games as a teenager) and I see a great potential in this title, unfortunately it's not there yet. This game is very badly optimized and runs at average ~8 FPS for most of the time on my PC, in lowest possible settings. In highest possible setting - it's almost the same. I had no problems in getting AC: Unity or ME: Shadow of Mordor to run at 30 FPS in full HD on mid settings.Still, if your PC is maxed out, I've heard you can get it to run at 20 or even 30 FPS. It's still not good, but playable. Best, PawelPS. My PC: i7-4700MQ, 8GB ram, Nvidia GTX 760M.			"

												This is a review that I will constantly update as I play more and get more feels for the game. But since everyone downvotes it because they don't agree with me I might as well write this: WORST GAEM EVURZ LOL DYE NUBS because the voting system on steam is more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t than this game.The game suffers from several flaws that I feel could make the game a lot better:1. The enemies have two sets of flashlights, White and Yellow. When Yellow they are looking for you, but haven't found you yet, and White, everything that isn't yellow, all from not knowing about you to outright attacking you (This can be annoying as you never know if they're running towards you to kill you, or running past you.2. You can target enemies that your agent cannot attack properly, making them shoot at an impenetrable wall all for nothing. Another thing that is a real bother about your agents and shooting is how, while there is a way to make them move and attack as they meet targets, there are no ways of making them stay in cover, and shoot at any target, you have to micromanage it so incredibly deep.3. A lot of the game is based on you having to micromanage everything, from setting up every agent, choosing their targets, using their abilities, and ressurecting fallen agents, all while under fire from multiple locations, having enemies come from all directions and leaving you to either stay where you are (Which mostly ends up killing you) or running up against the enemy in a hail of bullets to get a better position. Neither is very fun to choose.4. When in a gun fight you want to get into cover as fast as possible, so if you happen to get your agents not standing in cover, you'll want to mark them all and click on the closest cover, right? well this game punishes you for it because actually clicking for them to get in cover or just standing next to cover is pixel-close, easily making your agents just wander around in a damn ugly dance.5. Movement is very forced, your agents don't change direction or turn corners with anything but ugly drunken stagger, whenever they reach a corner they stop for a split second before shambling into the new direction.5.1 The movement get's extra terrible when trying to Stealth Kill enemy guards, due to if the guards turn a corner your agent will first run to the place they were when you clicked them (Even if it's out of the way), then they will take the same drunken stagger around the same corner the guard did, and then they go after the guard! (And hope that it didn't turn any more corners as it'll make even more drunken staggering on your side!)The game is very unforgiving, there are security cameras everywhere, guards randomly patrolling, something simple like hacking an ATM machine can become a fight where the game throws everything and the kitchen sink at you, and the ATM hacks are giving such small rewards you begin questioning the games intent. You always wish you have 4 hackers and 4 assassins just so you can kill everything without being heard and hack everything because your hacker needs to be in so many places at once.So far I can say that if you want a casual game, Don't get it.If you like RPGs where you have soooo much options (you're able to Force some actions, like hacking, to happen, but without the right skills your agents can die to RNG and alert nearby enemies to his location). But you also need to think extremely Strategical as you are constantly surrounded by enemies and have to think fast, even if you've planned greatly. You also need to micromanage the game on an insanely deep level that I've explained earlier in the review.HOWEVER, the game feels incredibly great when you have managed to get past a certain objective which has given you problems for a while.BUT, the game seems to punish both Guns Blazing and Stealth styles as stealth is very easy to screw up and requires a lot of work, most of the time by one or two agents leaving the other two to just stand and hope not to get outflanked while you're busy. Likewise the Guns Blazing option gives you a better feeling for loosing, since you're going in blazing! It's to be expected if you screw up, but it's still easy to be outflanked, outnumbered, not having the opportunity to shoot down alarming guards, and you're having to out-micromanage a computer. ♥♥♥♥ that!

Cannot interact with much, and not really any story/plot. In it's current state, it is not worth the near $30. Don't be fooled by all those positive reviews, I am a developer myself and even I wouldn't release such an empty and buggy game like this, even on Early Access. Don't buy this. Also one last note, this game took up almost 3 gigs of RAM on my computer, so the developer doesn't know what they are talking about when they say 2048 MB RAM for the minimum requirements. Keep that in mind before purchasing.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't know what's going on. I thought this would be like Syndicate, but upon starting the game I was dropped into the middle of a mission with one agent missing, cops everywhere and no ability to customise my team. There doesn't seem to be a way to rotate the camera or zoom out very far. I couldn't find a way to the police station so gave up.This game isn't really developed enough to be charging £20 a purchase. Hopefully it will improve soon.I was at least expecting an intro and the ability to set up my organisation/team/base before being dropped into a mission. I thought it was possible to customise agents? I couldn't find any way of doing that in this version.			"

												Commandos + Syndicate Wars = Satellite ReignIts punishing, doesn't hold your hand or spoonfeed you. It can be frustrating and occasionally annoying. However, I love it. Very open ended. A great sandbox to exercise your creativity. Excellent for those who love strong, emergent gameplay.You basically control 4 agents - Infiltrator, Soldier, Hacker and Support - in a surprisingly large sandbox of a city. It's not a GTA like open world, but feels lived in and atmospheric. You break into secure facilities and steal stuff. Method of approach is up to you. Plays a lot like Eidos's Commandos franchise, where you sneak around enemy bases.The Agent's skills, the equipment and augmentations make all kinds of playstyles viable and fun. Hijack enemies and create a slave army, sneak in with suppressed weapons or blow up the main gate with Miniguns and grenades - its a very flexible game. NOTE: AI quirks and inconsistencies can make the experience frustrating, especially for new players. It gets a lot better after the 8 hour mark. Play this if you have a lot of time at hand and like long game sesions.  "

												This game would have been much more fun if it didn't crash randomly. I have no idea what's causing the crashes and nor do I know how to find out. All I know is that it's quite frustrating to keep restarting and reloading... I can't recommend this game until this is fixed. This is the only app/game that is crashing on my computer.Found another starting option that uses DX9 instead of DX11 and that works much better. Now I can give the game my approval! ;)			"

It is OP, and your screwing yourself if you do not use this view. Problem with that is simple, the game is pretty to look at....But i never saw the game because i spent it running around in tron.

												I bought this game in pre-alpha status. There are quite a lot of missing contents and also a lot of bugs, but this game makes a lot of fun. It is like the old Syndicate from Bullfrog! I hope the developers will do their job to create a new syndicate in a new version.Update 14.11.2015:Downloaded the game today and deleted it...This is no Syndicate like in the old times. A way to much micro-management when running through the city. No fluent gameplay it feels wodden and the AI is dumb. Also there is a real time mechanism.This is no Syndicate, this game feels like Commandos!So no backflash to 4 soldiers equiped with mini-guns and a horde of enemy soldiers.			"

												If you liked the original Syndicate, you will like Satellite Reign. This game brings back a lot of memories.  SR is open world with some nice UI overhauls and other added game play features, but plays very much like the original.   Augment your agents, go in sneaky or guns blazing.  Think of it as what the new Syndicate should have been.  A few minor bugs, but nothing game breaking.  One was really funny as my plasma beam got stuck on with infinite ammo so it just mowed down everything as I walked through the base.   It will take a beefy computer to run it on ultra.  With 780ti and 4470K and 16 Gb ram at 1920x1200 res everything was on max and it was averaging 56fps with drops into the mid 40's, but still very playable.  16-20 hour play through if you complete all tasks.   Very much recommended.			"

												Basically my fetishBe a cyber terrorist in a cyberpunk world. Spend 30 minutes just harassing local law enforcement and murdering them. Start attacking bases and clearing objectives with extreme prejudice and not really play to the main plot. In all seriousness this game has so many great parts about it, you can replay it multiple times, theres many paths to choose but only one that really is tough. Not being a total asshat.You can highjack people to conscript them to your cause and use them as cannon fodder, overload power couplings and generally just cause some chaos to clear areas. The graphics are gorgeous (even on my potato comp)The AI is responsive but sometimes stupidThe difficulty is well, mid-levelThe tactics are necessary, You need cover.Some character customization available.The enviroment just makes me sigh, its so beautiful. You can spend time zoomed in just looking at your characters and the people around you to see what neat little outfits they are wearing.I will have to legitimately give this 8.5/10.Highly reccomended for RPG/RTS/Sci-fi Fans.

												This game has amazing potential. I have enjoyed what I have played so far. It reminds me of the old DOS game Syndicate series of games by Bullfrog. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_(series)I am not sure how this could lend to Co-Op but that could be fun to play with my friends. I just purchased copies for each of them over the 2015 holiday sale. At $13 each for the Deluxe Edition it was a bargain. "

												I was a backer and I was really looking forward to a spiritual successor to Syndicate.I think they do the cyberpunk setting pretty well but it just does not feel like Syndicate.Suprisingly this feels more like a top down stealth game than an action game. But when you finally get spotted it is just not very fun to shoot things. In syndicate there was a real heaft to the weapons, you really felt like you were moving down all and everything, here it feels hollow and flat.Very unfortunate.			"

												Satellite Reign was kickstarted on the idea that it's a modern Syndicate Wars. On that basis it actually... isn't that great. The quintessential experience of having four hulking trenchcoated replicants shooting through crowds and buildings with miniguns isn't there, or if it is, it's near or at the end of the game. Satellite Reign is actually its own beast, and the squad of cyborgs you command is actually a lot more like four individual ""hero"" units from RTS games. There's a distinct advantage to stealth, so the hacker and assassin did (for me) get more use than the other two (heavy weapons and ""support""). I don't think this is really an oversight, they just did stealth right, and wanted to avoid making the heavy weapons guy a man-tank at the beginning of the game.It's got bugs and problems. Everything does. The ending is dumb, but not unreasonable. I don't feel like any of the problems are serious enough to warrant inclusion in this review.SR was made by a team the size of early Introversion Software, and for a first effort, it's fantastic. I played the Shadowrun Turn-Based game, but I feel like this game is a lot closer to the RPG, and I actually kind of wish someone would re-create the Second Edition cover with Satellite Reign units. I liked this game a lot, but I think that $30 is kind of pricey for an isometric shooter. Buy it when it's $25 or less. I suspect it'll be $20 come Steam Winter Sale, and for $20 you should BUY IT for sure.			"

A spiritual successor to syndicate that improves on the original.Mechanistically, this is a birds-eye real time simulation of a small team of agents in a cyberpunk setting. The inspiration from bullfrog's syndicate is obvious, yet this game manages the impressive feat of improving on that original.I absolutely love that you can approach your objective in a number of different ways... Yes, you can tool up and go in guns a-blazing, but you can also sneak in one or two agents to try and complete the mission without raising any alarms... or mind-control the right guard, or bribe a disgruntled ex-employee, send your soldier to cause a distraction on the opposite side of the compound, and so on.bugs/issuesI have had a few issues with escorted characters sometimes getting stuck when going through vents.

												I'm struggling to stop playing this game. I remember spending many an afternoon after school playing its spritual predecessor Syndicate, and then many years wishing someone would make a more modern version. This is everything I hoped for and more. The genre is a little hard to pin down - perhaps a mix of Deus Ex, X-Com (but realtime) and something like Commandos - but that doesn't really do it justice. It's a large open-world, with many different possible paths - pure stealth, stealth killing/assassination or plain frontal-assault. Combat isn't usually plan A, but it makes a very fun plan B if your carefully laid plan goes to pot. It's had me on the edge of my seat during missions so many times and I'm probably only two-thirds of the way through. I suspect when I finish it I'll have another go and make some different choices too.			"

Sadly as things progress, the gameplay fails to become succinctly diverse from regions to region, and the story aspects of the game are fairly weak. I'll definitely come back to it, because the game is great fun, but that fun has to be limited to 10-20 hour chunks.			"

												There's an obvious question to ask about Satellite Reign:I loved Syndicate - will I like Satellite Reign?The simple answer is yes, from the very moment you get to the main menu, the style and feeling of Syndicate suffuses this game, even down to the fact that the UI sounds brought back warm fuzzy feelings to me.It's not just an updated reskin of Syndicate though - fundamentals are there, but Satellite Reign feels a little more sophisticated and mature, as you would hope after over a decade in which for the has become more sophisticated and refined as a whole.But this leads me to a second, prehaps less obvious question:I loved Commandos - will I like Satellite Reign?The simple answer is again yes. In case you're not aware, Commandos[en.wikipedia.org] was a stealth heavy game where you had a group of soliders each with a unique set of skills. You'd need to use these skills in coordination to complete the missions, and the same is very much true of Satellite Reign.Fortunately for me, I loved both of the above games and therefore I can't get enough of Satellite Reign :)			"

												Pros-Enjoyable game.  The game allows you to tackle objectives the way you want.  You can smash your way in or sneak.  I play a combination of the two.   Map design is good that it makes choices on making those objectives enjoyable.  The Art and music are fitting the game.  Nothing seems out of place.  Controls work well.  Leveling and character outfitting is well done and makes sense.Cons-The game play has some quirks.  Path finding issues, small problem but noticeable if not careful.  The factions act as enemies and allies at the same time.  If you hijack a person of another faction and bring them in to another factions base they will attack them, but if you alerted a faction and run into another faction will attack you as if they were on the same side. Also rare but noticeable is when your character gets stuck on terrain. Conclusion- Buy this game.  The issues with the game are not major and will probably get fixed with a patch.

												I had to restart like 4 times and completely finish the first area before I finally got how to (effectively) play the game and once it all clicked, only then did I really experience how fun this game is... the game is not perfect, but what's there is really special and I'm hoping there's more to come from the developer because I need more (:			"

												This game is awesome. I lost interest in RTS's many years ago as I found them all much the same...This is a standout title I would recommend to any RTS fan. Reminds me of the old Commando's series so if you are a fan of those, this is a must have game.			"

												The perfect homage to the original Syndicate game. The persistent world is gritty and dark, cyberpunk in style. Loads of different ways to complete your missions, ranging from walking in the front door guns blazing to sneaking through a side entrance and slipping through gaps in the patrols. It's basically the game 12 year-old me wished Syndicate was when I first played it.			"

												This game is awesome I love the feel and the way its brutal. I only have one thing that bugs me is there is no pause and your agents requrie a ton of micro if you anything happens that you didnt plan for. That said the slow down time ability is helpful but really removes using your agents to there full potential. All this to say I could just really suck at the game.Either way buy it you wont regret it!			"

												This game has an interesting tunr on RTS's with it's squad based system and futuristic setting. The things that are possible (such as hacking other people and cloning them.) are amazing. The strangest bit is that it kind of has, dark overtones. You kill and clone people to further your own bussiness' gains. You walk into a corrupt world and don't do anything to help anyone but yourself.8/10 would have been better if I had started with a small loan of a million dollars			"

												If you were a fan of Syndicate Wars.......""...... Target in LOS....Request order update?""""Destroy""Then you will really like this game. If it had the ""Cataclysm"" weapon it would have been better. It was obviously an important part of what made Syndicate Wars so much fun, raining the fire of hell down from the sky on anything unfortunate enough to get in your way. Or else why else would you name the game after it??Add it into the game as a $0.99 DLC and I will buy it! :DGood work on a really good game! I definitely reccomend it and I've been playing PC games since Wolfenstein 3D was the most controversial game on the market, so you can take my word for it.			"

												This game was clearly made by a bunch of passionate people who played the old syndicate and loved it. I haven't played syndicate for many long years, but I couldn't help remembering it while going through this one. The old one was repetitive as hell, and this one did improve somewhat on the recipe by adding some layer of story on top of each mission, but it's still more or less of the same gameplay mechanics throughout, peppered with upgrades and various powerups to spice it up.For those who did not play the old Syndicate, this is a real time and squad based action game, where you control 4 agents in a futuristic cyberpunk city, reminescent of the movie ""Blade runner"" where it's always night time and raining. Each agent has core skills common to every agent, and a few special skills specific to their profile (soldier / hacker / support / infiltrator). You tackle various missions spread all over a big map starting low in equipment and firepower and slowly building it up.I liked the art, the environment and the music very much, and although the AI was dumb it did not stop me from liking the game. I felt like I was playing the old game again, but having grown older I viewed this game with my 2016 eyes and experience and I think that this game is a worthy successor.[edit after some checks] actually some of the devs worked on the old syndicate so that explains why the game feels so true to its ancestor.

												are you a Commandos fan?well buy this game! cause its your futuristic cyberpunk Commandos-like game.are you a XCOM fan?well buy this game too, cause its your real-time strategy XCOM!now lets rant about the awesomeness of this title:AGENTS: Satellite reign is a real time tactical squad strategy game, god that was mouthful...anyway you control four agents each with certain set of skills (Class Based as mentioned in its description) so you have a soldier as your frontliner and damage soaker/dealer, you have a support/medic that can heal and operate as a team leader and buff your other agents, a hacker that can hack atms and security doors/cameras and also HIJACK people how awesome is that!, and of course lastly my favorate class the assassin that can snipe people from a far or slice them up and close in stealth, your agents level up and you spend their points the way you want your agents to perform you can also customize your agents with augmentations from techs you steal and research, buy awesome laser and plasma prototype weapons and also a variety of gears each with a certain purpose to it.MAP: now lets talk about the map, the game has a HUGE map different districts to get access to and a lot of corporations that you need to infiltrate and encounter in order to progress and aquire techs, you can travel through the map by walking and that take time cause its really huge, or you can respawn your agents using becons scattered around in every district.Objectives: the game offers a variety of objectives and different WELL THOUGHT AND IMPLEMENTED ways to achive those objectives, through bribes, recruiting informants, hijacking indeviduals and sometimes getting your hands dirty and bloody to get informations.Satellite reign is a 10/10 game for me, the game offers everything a tactical squad game player can hope for, the only downside for me is there is no voiceover for the characters and since I am a creature driver by sounds I find that side lacking, everything else is perfect.thanks for reading			"

												My previous review was positive.Having played the game past the tutorial, I'd say think twice before buying this. It's finicky, repetitive (even very early on) and you'll be repeating missions until everything lines up correctly (i.e. by chance) There's very few ways to do missions and the loading times are very long. So enjoy that. The controls are also poor, as is pathfinding. My agents have been stuck inside buildings and walls several times which leads to reloading again. And don't forget - you can't save inside a mission, so you're right back at the start. How ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful is that? I bet you want to punch the idiot developer that made that decision right? I sure do.♥♥♥♥♥ on the corpse of the old syndicate, but slightly less so that the other remakes.It's also very buggy. Agents get stuck inside buildings, disobey your orders and if left alone, will just comply with arrest orders (even if you've told them to run away beforehand, you'll have to do so again). This in a game without pausing and being able to give orders.So yeah, do you want to deal with all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?			"

You control a team of four agents, each with distinct and unique abilities, collectively battling for control of a fully simulated, living cyberpunk city.The game world is designed to facilitate emergent gameplay, giving you the tools and freedom to play how you want to play, so you can create strategies and scenarios that not even we had anticipated!Customise your team with the strength to destroy your enemies head-on, or hack into their facilities to manipulate their infrastructure without them ever knowing you were even there.Will you take down your enemies with brute-force?

												A fun isometric style rpg game set in a dystopian future. The art boasts a great feeling of cyberbunk cityscapes and gives off a great atmospheric place. You get the vibe of Blade Runner, corporations with ideas to toppe mega corps. Reminds me a bit of XCOM series with real-time RTS instead of turn-based.It's got great balance for it's upgrades, missions that you can select anytime you want to do it, great details on settings, makes it an enjoyable game thats really beautiful to look at.My concerns are just the combat, is seems heavy and sluggish, it just doesn't feel quick enough, or lacking slickness. Aside from that, if you love real-time rts with isometric view set in a dystopian future, you'll grow to love it.			"

												A solid remake of an old classic game, syndicate. Gameplay is fairly good, offering multiple ways to solve a task, customizable characters, different loadouts and cybernetic upgrades, which increase replayability. The world of the game feels just right, visual design, in-game lore and soundtrack create a very cyberpunk-y vibe, something you don't see in games often. The ending, sadly, is not as good as it could've been, but it's sensible at least and doesn't really ruin the impression this game makes.Definitely recommending if you like cyberpunk.			"

												Co-Op evaluation, Stable for the most part. There were many benifits to playing Co-op. I controlled the soldier and infiltrator while my buddy used the Hacker and Support. After 1/2 way through the game when it before more combat viable i took over the Support and we really laid waste to everything. Also the hacker gets to take over other units so he needs more focus to manage his squade while i still had mine. Stability, For the most part the game was very stable and there was not much lag at all. He mentioned a little bit of clunkyness but this was felt by me also. a few times the game would not register the attack of one unit. There was a bug where i had an extra soldier and infiltrater spawn. I had to exit the game and enter single player to zone into another area because the checkpoint door did not transition us due to the game thinking there was 2 people not present for the transition. The extra members also had no gear and we had to force kill them then reload single player to get rid of them. Not many issues other than that, mildly annoying.Finished, (no spoilers) We finished the game in about 26 hours. 6 of the hours were afk time while we saved up money before the big fight. We both enjoyed the game and highely recomend this game to anyone who enjoys the coop experience. 9/10			"

												I really really wanted to like this game, but imo it is too broken to be enjoyable.  I love cyberpunk, and though I found the couple Shadowrun reboots to be somewhat pleasant, they are too linear for my taste.  I was hoping for something more open world, like Satellite Reign.  Unfortunately this game is plagued by poor performance, long load screens, and it's just buggy where my characters keep getting stuck in walls.  Nothing sucks worse than being halfway through a mission only to have one of my characters get stuck in walls, and then I need to reload the mission again and pray that no one gets trapped in a wall again.  Add to it that there is a lot of the game that just isn't very intuitive and gets a half-there tutorial.tl;dr, I could live with the other little issues, but my characters have gotten stuck enough times where i'm ready to rage quit each time it happens (ie. no longer fun).

												Very enjoyable game. I've played the original Syndicate and Syndicate Wars this is a very nice spritual sequel, far more colorful at that.I really enjoyed the variety of gear and options you have to really customize your approach at every objective.Economy system is nice and well thought, as also the research. What i disliked (sort of, not really complaining) is how the random early prototypes are given. Sometimes I got some advanced hardware too early on and ""early"" hardware so late that was already obsolete. I wish there would be a smarter linearity in that.Also, due to that some prototypes that you can acquire through the black market become overpriced and meaningless if you acquire advanced pieces early on.All in all, a very good and enjoyable game. Recommended.			"

												8.5/10If you need a crew of terminators to unambiguously murder it's way into destroying a rival corporation on a blade runner-esque backdrop, this is your game. It's a blast. I think I got this on sale for 15 bucks and it was worth every penny, if not more. I have some thoughts on the ending and the future of this game at the end of this review.Graphics: Gorgeeous, gritty cyber-punk, it's always night time and it's almost always raining. I wished for more camera control. The Unity engine it was built on did an impressive job.Gameplay: This is a real-time strategy squad control game. If you're familiar with Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, then you know these games can be frustrating. Controlling 4 agents in a fast-paced gunfight is not easy. You won't regret taking the Team Stims skill early on. This allows you to slow down time so you can make good tactical decisions when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. Speaking of which, the game is very ""sandbox"", -you can take a stealthy approach or go in guns-a-blazin', and there's no penalty for mindlessly slaughtering every thing in your path, including innocent civilians. Make no mistake, this game does not punish you (unlike Deus Ex) for killing innocents. So go ahead and enjoy some collateral damage. I felt free to take on any mission I wanted at any time, in any order. I could start a gun fight anywhere for no reason at all, rob a bank, or do missions to collect blueprints, prototypes and research upgrades for my agents.Sound: I have nothing to say here, except it's good.Music: The music in this game is awesome. The 'battle song' never got old, kicking into a solid beat when bullets start flying.Story: The 'back story' if you can call it that, comes through when you hack data terminals. It's easy to miss, but you get copies of emails that you can read. Through these various emails, a rather intricate plot starts to unravel between the 3 rival corporations (The Eternals, UzyKorp, and Dracogenics). I feel like the devs, who built this game un roughly half a million USD (an impressive feat TBH), had to cut a plot-driven ending and gave us something else entirely. I liked it, but it might not impress everyone. tldr; If you like cyberpunk, GTA-style freedom, Syndicate, Syndicate Wars, buy this game. Personal note for 5 Lives Studios: I LOVE this game. But I also see soooo much potential here for more. The story revealed through hacked emails didn't translate in the gameplay and I'm wondering if there's opportunity here for a sequel. There' a ton of mod potential here too, and I missed that. Custom cities, models, missions, weapons and augs would add a lot of replay value. I would totally throw down for another kickstarter.			"

												This is an incredible game that the author never bothered to write a manual for, and left out too much in the tutorial.  You must read the manual guide first.I played the original Syndicate all the way through around the time it came out.  This is a worthy and much improved successor.  It adds a lot of elements that the original game didn't have, and has much better gameplay and a lot more depth.  Also, the fan provided steam controller profile works well, this is a good game for a steam controller.The combat feels great, and so does the preparation and stealth.  It isn't too easy like the original Syndicate.  In the original, you could just stand there with miniguns and kill all comers without much thought or difficulty if you did a little bit of prepositioning.  This one requires a little more thought and tactical awareness, and makes stealth effective, while still leaving Rambo style invasions viable.  It reminds me of Deus Ex, in that there are many ways to do the same objective, which I love.The load time when you first start the game is really slow, but don't let it put you off.  The way the game is designed you shouldn't need to load the game unless you just started it up, even if you die, so it isn't really a problem during play sessions.  The game will not punish you significantly for dying as long as you do not use prototypes in combat.  The cloning decay mechanic on death is quite gradual, and does not go below 0.  The tutorial left me thinking that I had to load or I would be kneecapped - but that is totally unecessary.READ THE GUIDE WITH THE FANMADE MANUAL FIRST!Read the guide that is a fanmade manual for the game before you start.  The tutorial misses important gameplay elements and is a bit buggy, sometimes repeating parts when you load unnecessarily.  Retreating to the beacons lowers your alert level more quickly, and the game needs to tell the user this, but does not.  It's really important.10/10			"

												Didn't know what to expect when I got this game, but was totally smitten by its premise. Set in a dystopian future where the city is run by greedy, unscrupulous, amoral megacorporations. You emerge as a rival corporation set to bringing down the big bad megecorp that has the monopoly on Immortality.You start off small and you need to build up your resources by infiltrating and stealing from other rival corporations. Weapons, Cybernetic implants, Money, Gear are all up for grabs as you build up to prepare for the final showdown. It is an open-world environment where you extend your will through your four agents. Each are a different class with their own special functions to help you go about waging corporate espionage. Most jobs have more than a few ways of going about, from guns blazing thru the front door to softly softly approach via zipline. You can customise the weapons, gear and implants to further whichever playstyle mix you choose. I say mix because you're going to need to be able to switch between going Loud and Quiet when things don't go your way.It takes a bit of getting used to for figuring our stealth and combat. There aren't any visual representation for line of sight so you'll have to be patient to get the feel for what the enemies can see and which cover will hide you from them. Otherwise knowing directional cover, using flanks, silent takedowns, agent abilities are keys to waging effective corporate warfare.Game is not without its imperfections however. AI can sometimes do stupid things at times. An Infiltrator with silenced sniper rifles screwing with patrols till they are all picked off without sounding alarm for backup is an example of the limitations of the AI. Your agents and enemies sometimes get stuck in the environment on rare occasions, forcing a suicide for affected agent. When alerted, enemies seem to develope eyes on the back of their heads to catch your agents going the other way while ignoring the big obvious distraction you've set up.But overall this game should keep you entertained for at least 40 hours depending on pace. But if you want a teamplay element added to the mix or you find it too hard to manage 4 agents all at once in realtime, there is a co op feature where you can have up to 3 other friends control an agent each, tho i find it easier just playing with one other player and just controlling 2 agents.

												I purchased expecting a mostly modern take on the old Syndicate game. I was not disappointed. Great graphics and depth to the upgrading of your agents. Plot line is pretty basic. Gameplay is a bit overwhelming at first but the complication is very rewarding later when you find that you need to try different strategy. Easily one of the more entertaining games in my library.This game does require a fair amount of thinking how to approach a scenario. And, to up the risk/reward, there is no pause, so your strategy has to be workable in realtime AND account for changes. The guards might look like they're walking a static route but they can and do change the route randomly! It makes for a much different type of strategy game than you might be used to from turn based games. You should really have at least a plan B for when it all goes wrong. If you don't, you're going to get crushed.8.5/10			"

												I have never played original Syndicate so can't really compare. But as a fan of Commandos games and it's clones I am having a blast. Prepare to infiltrate enemy facilities, hack their upgrades and steal their prototypes. It will all benefit you in the long run. Unless you get spotted and it's time take your guns and blast through enemy defences. Or you can mind hack an enemy officer and make him open all the doors for you. This game really deserves more attention. I would consider it a hidden gem. True some things are pretty jank and not everything always work as intended, but if you get immersed into the gameplay and story you will get your money's worth.Found it by a pure luck on Steam. Playing this is really fun and engaging. Try it out.Also music is pretty good.			"

												It's a good game but it isn't without it's flaws. The pathfinding is shockingly bad at times. The reaction time of the agents is often slow and unplayable. It also needs a lot of work on the sound. It just doesn't feel lively enough for a supposed living, breathing city. No use of vehicles and no full on skyscraper/bank destruction either. Get it on discount.			"

												This is the perfect cyberpunk game.  There's neon lights, rain tinting the puddles.  The world is dark, the story is dark.  And in co-op the game is soo much fun!  Slightly buggy still, sometimes agents will get trapped in scenery.  But wandering through a base, being as stealthy as a SEAL team, and then breaking out rocket launchers when♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down is amazing.  Or the katana.  Or stealth kills with pistol.  Or grenades.

												Even if you never played Syndicate way back when, this game will entertain anybody who likes a good squad based rts (think XCOM in realtime) Pick your favorite methods, be they stealth, brute force, or a combination. The game really shines when you are knee deep inside enemy territory and trigger an unexpected alarm. All this makes for a great single player experience, and if you happen to have friends to play with, it becomes something unique. The UI is a bit clunky at times but nothing that killed the experience for me.			"

												NOTE: THIS GAME IS GREATLY CPU INTENSIVE, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BEEFY CPU!The review: After finally getting a cpu that can play this smoothly, this is a great game that was made by the developers of the original syndicate series, including syndicate and syndicate: wars. Do not let the syndicate from 2012 give you a tainted view on what was once a top notch game series, as these devs had nothing to do with it. Satellite reign is the spiritual successor to syndicate and syndicate wars, bringing new features and combining it with the old. If you have played the older syndicates then you most likely know what youre getting into, however if you havent then keep reading. you play the role of a CEO opperating a hostile takeover of this city after corperate corruption has overdone politics, you remotely control an elite team of 4 cloned operatives to do your bidding, research new tech and expand your secret corperate empire by taking control of the assets of your enemies. using your modified clones you will kill, steal, wreak havoc and coherse your way through an insanely detailed open world from a birds eye point of view. the controls are rather simple and the AI could have been improved a bit more but overall this game does the classics more justice than the shooter reboot in 2012. i do recommend getting it if youre a fan of the classic syndicate or if youre looking for a uniqe strategy/tactical experience.

Coming from a Kickstarter this game definitly is worth a playing. The combat is amazing versatile, eather you sneak or fight, both paths come to the same ending and have the same difficulty. It is perfectly balanced. The World is design with love in detail. Eather you watch the tele or look for hidden entrances hidden everywhere. By the time the combat and sneaking will get step by step more difficult. But all the time you find a new way to overcome those challanges.The graphic is as it should be for a game like this.			"

												Good as crap. That's really good where I come from. I think the linear quest style and free-roam blend really well here. I like the extreme damage mode, it makes combat more realistic and decisive, requiring a more calculated approach. The concept of increasing characters base stats through genetic cloning of random people that you have scanned is very refreshing. SR hits a lot of the right notes but there is a blandness to it all that I can't quite put my finger on. I think it stems from the lack of variety in the environment and atmosphere, such as sounds and interactions between NPC's. The city is populated with moving bodies that do little else. That is forgivable however seeing as how they really serve no purpose besides upping your crews stats with their DNA. The save system is frustrating...			"

												For a very first look the game is not yet ready.It has got the potential, it has got a little bit of ""Syndicate"" feel, but IMHO it is a little to early.Moving your agents is not to intuitive.I wasn't been able to attack anybody.Driving a car is mess, as the camera doesn't follow the car.Cars are driving on the left side instead of right (I know you are from Australia, but I'm pretty sure that most of your potential customers are living in the right-lane countries).I'm saying No, at the moment, but I will be back in few weeks to take another look.If you wish to support the developers, pick it up. if you would liek to play the game, wait.EDIT: changed to thumb up			"

												When I play this game, I feel like in Neuromancer. Due to the beutiful neon shaded city it is one of the best athmosphere which I ever experienced in a game. It contains everything that you read in Wiliam Gibson's novel, watched in Ghost in the Shell or Blade Runner. The missions are challenging, the augmentations and various equipment give you a choiche how to approch it, however it seems to me that the game prefers the stealhty and sneaky way to complete the mission, at least at the beginning of the game. Unfortunatley I found some bugs in the map feature and in the skill three and these 2 is quite frustrating, but I hope that it'll be fixed soon.Overall, this game deserves a place in my top 5 game. If you love cyberpunk, it's MANDATORY for you!			"

												I used to keep a PC in the closet that ran Windows 98 just so I could load up Syndicate and Syndicate Wars every so often and newer versions of Windows just didn't work right.   I recycled that computer.  This is a great successor to the originals with some cool new features.  I was skeptical about the classes at first but they do work and make it fun.     Graphics, mood and atmosphere are all great.   Although I wish they had brought back the voice when you select your weapon.  Friends of mine still drop a ""Mini gun"" and ""Gausss...Gun"" in reference to the old voices.    Gameplay.  It's fun.  I played without cloning drops as I found it made the game too easy but the combat is so satisfying I found myself wanting to go into the major bases repeatedly just to have fun mowing down enemies.   Get it.			"

												It is very clear that this game was set out from the start to be the successor in spirit if not in name to Syndicate, and although it could have been a lot more if it'd done just a little better during the kickstarter, it's still succeeded at being a worthy successor in many regards. Differentiating the roles of your four core team members helps a lot to diversify the experience, and lets you try your hand at a lot of different playstyles instead of having one cookie-cutter build you apply to all cyborgs. Gameplay can get a bit repetative at times, but the levels are well designed and the difficulty ramps up well, and there's usually many different approaches to get to where you need to go, and the many side quests that give you some small bonusses and your opposition some small penalties are nice as well.

												are you a Commandos fan?well buy this game! cause its your futuristic cyberpunk Commandos-like game.are you a XCOM fan?well buy this game too, cause its your real-time strategy XCOM!now lets rant about the awesomeness of this title:AGENTS: Satellite reign is a real time tactical squad strategy game, god that was mouthful...anyway you control four agents each with certain set of skills (Class Based as mentioned in its description) so you have a soldier as your frontliner and damage soaker/dealer, you have a support/medic that can heal and operate as a team leader and buff your other agents, a hacker that can hack atms and security doors/cameras and also HIJACK people how awesome is that!, and of course lastly my favorate class the assassin that can snipe people from a far or slice them up and close in stealth, your agents level up and you spend their points the way you want your agents to perform you can also customize your agents with augmentations from techs you steal and research, buy awesome laser and plasma prototype weapons and also a variety of gears each with a certain purpose to it.MAP: now lets talk about the map, the game has a HUGE map different districts to get access to and a lot of corporations that you need to infiltrate and encounter in order to progress and aquire techs, you can travel through the map by walking and that take time cause its really huge, or you can respawn your agents using becons scattered around in every district.Objectives: the game offers a variety of objectives and different WELL THOUGHT AND IMPLEMENTED ways to achive those objectives, through bribes, recruiting informants, hijacking indeviduals and sometimes getting your hands dirty and bloody to get informations.Satellite reign is a 10/10 game for me, the game offers everything a tactical squad game player can hope for, the only downside for me is there is no voiceover for the characters and since I am a creature driver by sounds I find that side lacking, everything else is perfect.thanks for reading			"

												I've been a massive fan of Syndicate and Syndicate Wars since their releases. They've consistently been some of my favorite games and I've always remembered them very fondly. Here's what's different this time:Corporations are monolithic institutions with control over every facet of the world. The police are omnipresent, but if you get caught by them, they're just as likely to beat you and rob you as they are to arrest you. Everything you see is connected to a network which can be exploited to breach all sorts of security. Civilians are everywhere, but they don't really do anything other than walk around aimlessly and have no real purpose.Oh...oh THE GAME! The game, right. Satellite Reign is awesome and it's an excellent Syndicate game. If you liked Syndicate you should check it out. If you loved the Syndicate games, you need to buy this one.			"

												Commandos + Syndicate Wars = Satellite ReignIts punishing, doesn't hold your hand or spoonfeed you. It can be frustrating and occasionally annoying. However, I love it. Very open ended. A great sandbox to exercise your creativity. Excellent for those who love strong, emergent gameplay.You basically control 4 agents - Infiltrator, Soldier, Hacker and Support - in a surprisingly large sandbox of a city. It's not a GTA like open world, but feels lived in and atmospheric. You break into secure facilities and steal stuff. Method of approach is up to you. Plays a lot like Eidos's Commandos franchise, where you sneak around enemy bases.The Agent's skills, the equipment and augmentations make all kinds of playstyles viable and fun. Hijack enemies and create a slave army, sneak in with suppressed weapons or blow up the main gate with Miniguns and grenades - its a very flexible game. NOTE: AI quirks and inconsistencies can make the experience frustrating, especially for new players. It gets a lot better after the 8 hour mark. Play this if you have a lot of time at hand and like long game sesions.  "

If you screw up in an op you're people can be dead.  I spent a lot of time getting things all set up for a certain raid, and one glitch followed by some bad path finding and it all went to hell.  I was totally hacked...  Such is life.  I watched a few youtubes and did some thinking and came back later to find that the game is pulling me in.  It's been good fun as I understand the interface and the basic need to not be totally stealth all the time.  I think I get it now and am looking forward to working through the next two districts.

												For a very first look the game is not yet ready.It has got the potential, it has got a little bit of ""Syndicate"" feel, but IMHO it is a little to early.Moving your agents is not to intuitive.I wasn't been able to attack anybody.Driving a car is mess, as the camera doesn't follow the car.Cars are driving on the left side instead of right (I know you are from Australia, but I'm pretty sure that most of your potential customers are living in the right-lane countries).I'm saying No, at the moment, but I will be back in few weeks to take another look.If you wish to support the developers, pick it up. if you would liek to play the game, wait.EDIT: changed to thumb up			"

												If you enjoy cyberpunk you'll enjoy this game.I picked it up a while ago, only have maybe 30 minutes  and I sucked at the game (I still do now to some extent) but after feeling really in the mood for a cyberpunk game I decided to play it again. Got through the first mission, did a couple of bits and bobs in the world and oh my god I can't believe I skipped on it before.The strategy is fun, the story is interesting and the whole city design itself captures the cyberpunk feel perfectly.Every time I enter a restricted area and a tense skulking about followed by a firefight (avoidable if your good unlike me) keeps me engaged. However I recommend playing in bursts as it can seem monotonous in the way you move around the city.The different classes, (Soldier, Support, Hacker and Infiltrator) are a nice balance between Uniqueness and Similarity. To put it simply a Soldier  could  hack a terminal but a Hacker does it better. A Hacker  could  fight off the local Security forces but a Soldier does it better. The beauty of this is, is that it means you're never limited in options which is crucial when things come down to the wire.Overall the game is fun if you're craving something cyberpunk in a pinch but can also become kinda boring when played in large intervals. So I shall give it a 7/10.			"

												Satellite Reign is a very good proof of concept that truly captures the mood and feel of the classic Syndicate games. What isn't asked though, is if that is a very good idea. I remember the Syndicate games feeling old only a few years after their release. The combat controls just weren't precise enough and the environments and missions felt samey.Reign's story, limited though it is, makes more sense than Syndicates, one long night of bringing down a corporation. It too suffers from average controls, lacking in finese to get your agents to do what you want. In stealth and hacking, the game succeeds. That is why I recommend this game. It's satisfying and very well made, but the game they were emulating perhaps wasn't the best idea. It is very good that a carbon copy was not made.			"

												I'm giving this a positive rating because it's quite enjoyable, but I want new buyers to be aware of something.I found this game really fiddly to play, in the way that a game from the 90s would be fiddly to us now. Some of the UI/UX concessions we are used to are not here. The biggest issue is that there is no AI on your squad members, so they don't indulge in sanities like returning fire when being fired upon. The game doesn't even notify you when your people are getting shot, it just happens silently. It would have been preferable to have a simple rule: When your weapons are drawn, get to the nearest cover and return fire.I'm also sort of clumsy and prone to mis-clicking and sending my people around to the wrong side of cover. Games like this usually have tactical pause, and normally I just pause and reissue the command. But Satellite Reign doesn't have a pause mode, it only has a 'Team Stim' skill that slows time for about 5 seconds and then takes a few seconds to recharge. It's not bad, it's just different, but 'different' can be hard to get used to.			"

												Put stats into my hackers hijacking. Made super soldiers and a hijacked army. Wooped a strongholds♥♥♥♥♥through distractions caused by the hijacked army and my infiltratiors ability to instakill troublemakers. Walked out of the stronghold in a blaze of glory and no deaths.I would recomend the game. Its great for a strategy game or if your into massive weapon overkill a great brute force game. You really can play it different ways unlike a few similar games where its just a shoot and run type game. You can send in scouts to get a scope of your hit or you can simply blast the front doors open and walk straight in and take care of business.10/10 would hijack a army of heavy gunners again.			"

												This game oozes Sydicate.  So Fun. So Beautiful. So Frustrating.Pros+ Enemy units do not stick to a planned route.  + Great selection of weapontry+ Each team member has different skills+ Maps designed for sneaking and frontal assults+ Pretty funny easter eggsCons- Squad don't change targets after killing an enemy.- Squad don't target an enemy when getting shot at- Bugs. - Saved game corruption. - Progress stopping bugs. I absolutely love this game however there are some issues that still neeed to be fixed.  The developer is still working an resolving issues which I am very happy about.  The frustration after spending an hour or more making my way through an enemy stronghold, getting the prize and then the person carring the package getting stuck in a ventalation duct or going through a door and not coming out the other side has caused a rage quit on more than 1 occasion.  Units not rendering but still there.  An enemy soldier may not be rendered but it is still there and often killing your squad without you being able to see it to target it.Even with the complaints, I still give the game a 9/10 rating.  I would consider a 10/10 if it wasn't for the bugs. "

												If you liked the original Syndicate, you will like Satellite Reign. This game brings back a lot of memories.  SR is open world with some nice UI overhauls and other added game play features, but plays very much like the original.   Augment your agents, go in sneaky or guns blazing.  Think of it as what the new Syndicate should have been.  A few minor bugs, but nothing game breaking.  One was really funny as my plasma beam got stuck on with infinite ammo so it just mowed down everything as I walked through the base.   It will take a beefy computer to run it on ultra.  With 780ti and 4470K and 16 Gb ram at 1920x1200 res everything was on max and it was averaging 56fps with drops into the mid 40's, but still very playable.  16-20 hour play through if you complete all tasks.   Very much recommended.			"

												Basically my fetishBe a cyber terrorist in a cyberpunk world. Spend 30 minutes just harassing local law enforcement and murdering them. Start attacking bases and clearing objectives with extreme prejudice and not really play to the main plot. In all seriousness this game has so many great parts about it, you can replay it multiple times, theres many paths to choose but only one that really is tough. Not being a total asshat.You can highjack people to conscript them to your cause and use them as cannon fodder, overload power couplings and generally just cause some chaos to clear areas. The graphics are gorgeous (even on my potato comp)The AI is responsive but sometimes stupidThe difficulty is well, mid-levelThe tactics are necessary, You need cover.Some character customization available.The enviroment just makes me sigh, its so beautiful. You can spend time zoomed in just looking at your characters and the people around you to see what neat little outfits they are wearing.I will have to legitimately give this 8.5/10.Highly reccomended for RPG/RTS/Sci-fi Fans.

												I'm sinking a ton of hours into this game and having a great time.Pros: - Feels like there is a lot of places left to explore and infiltrate- Each type class feels like it contributes differently but effectively to the team- Gives you a strong feeling of progression as your team gets stronger & your hold on the city increasesCons:- I bought the game because it said it supported local co-op, but it doesn't - you need to buy two copies of the game (I wanted to play splitscreen!).- This game is not well optimized even on lowest graphics settings- Pathfinding is clunky feeling and occasionally glitchy, which is extra bad for playing real-time strategy.

												I play fairly slowly, I suppose, but I have 27 hours in on Satellite Reign as of my first beating of it.  It's not bad.  there's no real customizability, no real choices to make, no consequences that i noted to making any particualr choice.  No significant replay value.  Gameplay works well, cover works, and getting surrounded is a death sentence.A number of the achievements are bugged - specifically the pacifist achievements - as i got all of them and i was by no means pacifistic.  FPS was low on occasion, not as low as others noted - this may be explained by the brute of a PC i playted it on, but i never dropped below ~35 FPS, which is more than playable if you're not picky.  Anything over 20 is gravy on games like these, as far as i'm concerned.Pick it up on sale if you like fairly linear top down tactical shooters.			"

												when I picked up this game, I thought it was going to be a squad-based strategy game, kinda like the commandoes. what I didn't know was that it was going to be such an amazing open world heist game. casing each stronghold and then dropping into bullet time so your infiltrator gets to sneak in at just the right time was amazing.I think my only regret with this game is that the last mission had me running going to assasinate the CEO, so I set up a beautiful execution. he was standing right next to the end of a zip line from a less guarded point of his stronghold, so I had my guys zip down the line, getting off and just opening up with heavy weaponry as my infiltrator sniped him from accross the catwalk; guy dropped like a sack of potatoes...only for my game to glitch and have him come back infinitely without spawning the next chain of the final fight.Still, even with the final mission being combat dependent, the game I got up to that point was such an amazing heist game that I can't recommend it enough, have fun and don't forget to pick up the stealth kits early(seriously; that stuff is AMAZING) "

												I love this game.  I played Syndicate (1993) to death, and this is the best successor that I have yet seen.I guess it took some time after the kickstarter to get some of the bugs ironed out and the performance dialed in -- but I missed out on that.  By the time I started playing, it ran smooth and I didn't encounter any problems in my first 40 hour playthrough (maybe some of that was idling time).I found it to be smooth and polished.  I enjoyed the cyber-noire story and it was worth finding all the terminals to make sure that all of the narative was revealed (I did use some maps I found online for this, as well as the Steam achievemnents list so that I would know when I found all the terminals in a given zone).There are lots of valid aproaches to playing.  You can go loud and shoot everything up, or use brain-jacked agents to open all the doors as you speed-run through, or take your time and stealth everything.  You can even stealth the final boss fight if you have the patience for it.Now that the coop beta is out, I expect to give this a lot of replay.  I have a few friends in different time zones that I think will play, and each group can keep its own persistant multiplayer save.I usually review games with a list of caviats and qualifications, but in this case I have none. I have no detractors to caution you about, and endorse this wholeheartedly.Do check through the forums though, as it seems some folks have some complaints.			"

												Co-Op evaluation, Stable for the most part. There were many benifits to playing Co-op. I controlled the soldier and infiltrator while my buddy used the Hacker and Support. After 1/2 way through the game when it before more combat viable i took over the Support and we really laid waste to everything. Also the hacker gets to take over other units so he needs more focus to manage his squade while i still had mine. Stability, For the most part the game was very stable and there was not much lag at all. He mentioned a little bit of clunkyness but this was felt by me also. a few times the game would not register the attack of one unit. There was a bug where i had an extra soldier and infiltrater spawn. I had to exit the game and enter single player to zone into another area because the checkpoint door did not transition us due to the game thinking there was 2 people not present for the transition. The extra members also had no gear and we had to force kill them then reload single player to get rid of them. Not many issues other than that, mildly annoying.Finished, (no spoilers) We finished the game in about 26 hours. 6 of the hours were afk time while we saved up money before the big fight. We both enjoyed the game and highely recomend this game to anyone who enjoys the coop experience. 9/10			"

Only 2 hours in, but so far I like the layout and the controls. Combat feels modern and tactical without being overwhelming. Almost not looking forward to team stims, since I like to keep it going but it's an option available when starting a new game.I would like to be able to play around with my squad composition a bit more. Maybe try an all infiltrator squad, or run around with only 2 guys. Overall a decent enough single player game that I don't really care if they actually finish the multiplayer. Another thing reminiscent of older games.			"

												My previous review was positive.Having played the game past the tutorial, I'd say think twice before buying this. It's finicky, repetitive (even very early on) and you'll be repeating missions until everything lines up correctly (i.e. by chance) There's very few ways to do missions and the loading times are very long. So enjoy that. The controls are also poor, as is pathfinding. My agents have been stuck inside buildings and walls several times which leads to reloading again. And don't forget - you can't save inside a mission, so you're right back at the start. How ♥♥♥♥ing wonderful is that? I bet you want to punch the idiot developer that made that decision right? I sure do.♥♥♥♥♥ on the corpse of the old syndicate, but slightly less so that the other remakes.It's also very buggy. Agents get stuck inside buildings, disobey your orders and if left alone, will just comply with arrest orders (even if you've told them to run away beforehand, you'll have to do so again). This in a game without pausing and being able to give orders.So yeah, do you want to deal with all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?			"

												This game was clearly made by a bunch of passionate people who played the old syndicate and loved it. I haven't played syndicate for many long years, but I couldn't help remembering it while going through this one. The old one was repetitive as hell, and this one did improve somewhat on the recipe by adding some layer of story on top of each mission, but it's still more or less of the same gameplay mechanics throughout, peppered with upgrades and various powerups to spice it up.For those who did not play the old Syndicate, this is a real time and squad based action game, where you control 4 agents in a futuristic cyberpunk city, reminescent of the movie ""Blade runner"" where it's always night time and raining. Each agent has core skills common to every agent, and a few special skills specific to their profile (soldier / hacker / support / infiltrator). You tackle various missions spread all over a big map starting low in equipment and firepower and slowly building it up.I liked the art, the environment and the music very much, and although the AI was dumb it did not stop me from liking the game. I felt like I was playing the old game again, but having grown older I viewed this game with my 2016 eyes and experience and I think that this game is a worthy successor.[edit after some checks] actually some of the devs worked on the old syndicate so that explains why the game feels so true to its ancestor.

												I haven't played Syndicate so my review is only going to be based on what a player new to the franchise perceived. Love the idea, some great visual tricks and an excellent soundtrack. It's unlike anything I've ever played but the best analogy would be an xcom in real time.And now for the bad: everything else. The micromanagement is endless and can get very frustrating because your agents will not do ANYTHING by themselves, including returning fire. You even have to select a new target every time you kill one, which also interupts any channeling skills you might be using on the respective agent immediately placing it on cooldown. I can't count the amount of times my agents run out of cover for no apparent reason during the round-robin click-fest of combat and or the amount of times they attempted to shoot through unbreakable walls/barriers instead of moving to a better firing position.The levelling system seems completely useless. Everytime you level up or get a new piece of kit, all enemies magically get some kind of equivelant. Just got your first shield? Congratulations! Now every man and his ♥♥♥♥ing Patrol Dog too! Armour? We got that when you first hit level 5! Lasers weapons?! You must be new here...They should have just removed the levelling/equipment aspect and just given you everything from the start because there is absolutely no reward for smashing your face into a wall long enough to level up enough or finding those prototypes deep in enemy territory. Atleast that way you're on the same level instead of playing catch up the whole way through.The stealth system is the only option. However when you inevitably fail because of some random patrol or camera you're most likely going to die if you can't run away and hide from the endless amount of obscene enemy forces that spawn. So do what I did and destroy cameras (even though it will alert/ spawn guards) and shut down generators, and stealth kill as many patrols as you can so atleast your deaths aren't meaningless right? Wrong. Cameras respawn, generators turn back on, and patrols respawn incredibly quickly. I once hit the pause button to invest in a new skill only to find when I returned a patrol had respawned from thin air right in front of my face.There's challenging and then there's padding combined with punishing you for overcoming that challenge. If you enjoy the latter, then get this game, but I can not recommend a game that I will probably never finish. For all those hours I only reached what I think is about halfway.			"

Your job is to infilitrate corporations by killing troops, by passing cameras and turning off turrets and gates. You can play stealthily or guns blazing. You can upgrade your agents with augments that giver better stats, weapons or possess higher quality clones. You use these clones so you can respawn if one of your agents goes down and dies. Technically you can just respawn and rush the enemy compound but respawning early costs money and it is not that easy to obtain it. Interesting that one of the biggest backers from Kickstarter is the main villain Stephen Dengler. You get to fight him in the end :). Word of warning, it starts slow but it gets better and better towards the end. 7/10.			"

												I used to keep a PC in the closet that ran Windows 98 just so I could load up Syndicate and Syndicate Wars every so often and newer versions of Windows just didn't work right.   I recycled that computer.  This is a great successor to the originals with some cool new features.  I was skeptical about the classes at first but they do work and make it fun.     Graphics, mood and atmosphere are all great.   Although I wish they had brought back the voice when you select your weapon.  Friends of mine still drop a ""Mini gun"" and ""Gausss...Gun"" in reference to the old voices.    Gameplay.  It's fun.  I played without cloning drops as I found it made the game too easy but the combat is so satisfying I found myself wanting to go into the major bases repeatedly just to have fun mowing down enemies.   Get it.			"

												I love the cyberpunk atmosphere. It has beautiful graphics. Developers did a good job designing each district.  I didn't play the game long enough to have a final say about it but so far I am loving everything in the game. Gameplay is great the only problem is; early in the game before unlocking fast travel you have to do a long walk between point A and B but after unlocking it you will be saving time. Will update this once I am done with the game.

												Successor of syndicate and syndicate wars.Game is ok if you play alone, but just ok, because it gets boring after a while.Really good game if you play co-op with friend(s).Pros:- Great Cyberpunk feel.- Sneaking is the best part of this game.- Money gain and leveling are done well.- CO-OP!Cons:- Dying in this game means almost nothing.- Level scaling enemies.- Repetiteve mission objectives.

												I had no idea what I was getting into. I had no expectations at all. I totally forgot that a while ago I noticed a Syndicate-like game (I usually keep a list of games I'll check out when released).So for me as a big Syndicate fan, this was a huge surprise. After playing it for an hour I thought to myself ""hey.. this feels like a modern Syndicate."" :-)I really like the Soundtrack, too. Great game, Can absolutely recommend it judging by the 6 hours I put into it until now.			"

												Note that this is only after playing 5 hours. This is a game that I will play still, but there is a bit left to be desired from it. It is a decent remake of a game I loved from the past called ""Syndicate"" by Bullfrog studios from the early '90s. Strangely enough, while both games are playable and indeed enjoyable, they both lack a certain refinement that I am struggling to articulate. It's almost as if there's too much information, while at the same time not enough logic to it. Ultimately I end up confused as to what's important in the game, what I'm really trying to accomplish, and how certain upgrades benefit the mission. Robbed a bank, spent the funds on a prototype to research and promptly found the prototype for free after a simple mission, but hamstringed myself unnecessarily for hours in the first area. It's as if they used the same blueprint for the ""Syndicate"" without improving any of the confusing camera angles and warning systems or immsersion with the actors. 5/10 will still play it though at least for a once through. Grab it if you can on sale.			"

Theme, style, gameplay are solid and the game is well polished and not too easy to beat like most modern games. It's just perfect.The only downsides, again are that I personally always prefered 'going in loud' in Syndicate instead of stealthing all the time and this game focusses mostly on stealth. And that you can not drive cars.I give it a 9 out of 10.			"

												I am hooked on this game because it is like Syndicate Wars with 201x graphics and gameplay. I loved Syndicate Wars as a kid on our 486.It is a little hard to play without a mouse without a zoom wheel, as the levels are very detailed requiring close in to click on things and then wanting to get an overal picture of things. And it keeps a lot of the gameplay elements - like not being able to zoom too far, meaning you need to stick your team together or spend forever togling between members, like the syndicate had as challenges.

												Satellite Reign was kickstarted on the idea that it's a modern Syndicate Wars. On that basis it actually... isn't that great. The quintessential experience of having four hulking trenchcoated replicants shooting through crowds and buildings with miniguns isn't there, or if it is, it's near or at the end of the game. Satellite Reign is actually its own beast, and the squad of cyborgs you command is actually a lot more like four individual ""hero"" units from RTS games. There's a distinct advantage to stealth, so the hacker and assassin did (for me) get more use than the other two (heavy weapons and ""support""). I don't think this is really an oversight, they just did stealth right, and wanted to avoid making the heavy weapons guy a man-tank at the beginning of the game.It's got bugs and problems. Everything does. The ending is dumb, but not unreasonable. I don't feel like any of the problems are serious enough to warrant inclusion in this review.SR was made by a team the size of early Introversion Software, and for a first effort, it's fantastic. I played the Shadowrun Turn-Based game, but I feel like this game is a lot closer to the RPG, and I actually kind of wish someone would re-create the Second Edition cover with Satellite Reign units. I liked this game a lot, but I think that $30 is kind of pricey for an isometric shooter. Buy it when it's $25 or less. I suspect it'll be $20 come Steam Winter Sale, and for $20 you should BUY IT for sure.			"

In syndicate there was a real heaft to the weapons, you really felt like you were moving down all and everything, here it feels hollow and flat.Very unfortunate.			"

Always tiny spots to improve but wow.Really captures the spirit of the whole era of games, plenty of choice on how to approach things, and the ability to use gear/augments to kit your non stealth/hacking characters out to keep up/remote hack is an amazing addition.Combat is nicely paced, even without any pause which surprised me as I'm a fan of pausing, but the combat stims more than make up for the lack of pause.

												I can't really downvote or upvote this game, but let's make it an upvote so people don't immediately get mad at me for downvoting their "" syndicate remake "". Now onto the review.This game is average at best. The graphics are amazing and the combat isn't horrible nor is it good. It's just boring, the stealth is a little better but there's no way to know how far the guards vision is, so i have to constantly wait for the exact moment when they are 3000 ft away so i can sneak into the compound. The "" Missions"" in this game are extremely grindy. I've been into the grind, Downtown, and the industrial district, and i cannot find a difference between the missions except for some minor details, (Example) Mission: Get prototype,make cameras slower/reinforcements slower etc. I have a hard time because i dont find doing the same thing over and over again fun, so i just kill civilains until the guards show up. All i can give this game is an Average, not good nor bad.6/10 this game promotes massacres in the streets			"

												takes bit and pieces from cyberpunk icons such as Syndicate, Syndicate Wars, Blade Runner and Neuromancer and creates a vibrant city scape with various caper mission types; (steal X, blow up Y, sabotage whatever, you get the drift), and creates an exciting realtime team strategy game.Its not without its flaws.   The game can be punnishingly difficult when you're first start off, and woe be you should you try to enter a corperate compound guns blazing; but, once you get the hang of the cover system and understand its not to be played as a run and gun game, it's a great game you will lose hours to.

												Frustrating at first, but once your agents become more powerful, then the fun starts. I had performance issues - sub 30 fps on hardware that is capable for at least 40-50. Encountered a few bugs - pathfinding and stuck soldiers, mission completion triggers, untranslated strings.Practically no story to follow. The map is huge, but the city feels empty, you just do missions for some unknown reason. Save system is punishing - you can loose an hour progress if you are not careful. Especially if you prefer stealth based approach - one wrong step and all can go to hell. All that said - I enjoyed the game! At some point i was going to leave it, but I'm glad i didn't. It has a nice atmosphere and sucks you in a pleasant way. You have to do just one more mission and get that gear upgrade :)			"

												Pros-Enjoyable game.  The game allows you to tackle objectives the way you want.  You can smash your way in or sneak.  I play a combination of the two.   Map design is good that it makes choices on making those objectives enjoyable.  The Art and music are fitting the game.  Nothing seems out of place.  Controls work well.  Leveling and character outfitting is well done and makes sense.Cons-The game play has some quirks.  Path finding issues, small problem but noticeable if not careful.  The factions act as enemies and allies at the same time.  If you hijack a person of another faction and bring them in to another factions base they will attack them, but if you alerted a faction and run into another faction will attack you as if they were on the same side. Also rare but noticeable is when your character gets stuck on terrain. Conclusion- Buy this game.  The issues with the game are not major and will probably get fixed with a patch.  Fun experience for me so far.			"

												8.5/10If you need a crew of terminators to unambiguously murder it's way into destroying a rival corporation on a blade runner-esque backdrop, this is your game. It's a blast. I think I got this on sale for 15 bucks and it was worth every penny, if not more. I have some thoughts on the ending and the future of this game at the end of this review.Graphics: Gorgeeous, gritty cyber-punk, it's always night time and it's almost always raining. I wished for more camera control. The Unity engine it was built on did an impressive job.Gameplay: This is a real-time strategy squad control game. If you're familiar with Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, then you know these games can be frustrating. Controlling 4 agents in a fast-paced gunfight is not easy. You won't regret taking the Team Stims skill early on. This allows you to slow down time so you can make good tactical decisions when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. Speaking of which, the game is very ""sandbox"", -you can take a stealthy approach or go in guns-a-blazin', and there's no penalty for mindlessly slaughtering every thing in your path, including innocent civilians. Make no mistake, this game does not punish you (unlike Deus Ex) for killing innocents. So go ahead and enjoy some collateral damage. I felt free to take on any mission I wanted at any time, in any order. I could start a gun fight anywhere for no reason at all, rob a bank, or do missions to collect blueprints, prototypes and research upgrades for my agents.Sound: I have nothing to say here, except it's good.Music: The music in this game is awesome. The 'battle song' never got old, kicking into a solid beat when bullets start flying.Story: The 'back story' if you can call it that, comes through when you hack data terminals. It's easy to miss, but you get copies of emails that you can read. Through these various emails, a rather intricate plot starts to unravel between the 3 rival corporations (The Eternals, UzyKorp, and Dracogenics). I feel like the devs, who built this game un roughly half a million USD (an impressive feat TBH), had to cut a plot-driven ending and gave us something else entirely. I liked it, but it might not impress everyone. tldr; If you like cyberpunk, GTA-style freedom, Syndicate, Syndicate Wars, buy this game. Personal note for 5 Lives Studios: I LOVE this game. But I also see soooo much potential here for more. The story revealed through hacked emails didn't translate in the gameplay and I'm wondering if there's opportunity here for a sequel. There' a ton of mod potential here too, and I missed that. Custom cities, models, missions, weapons and augs would add a lot of replay value. I would totally throw down for another kickstarter.			"

												Basically my fetishBe a cyber terrorist in a cyberpunk world. Spend 30 minutes just harassing local law enforcement and murdering them. Start attacking bases and clearing objectives with extreme prejudice and not really play to the main plot. In all seriousness this game has so many great parts about it, you can replay it multiple times, theres many paths to choose but only one that really is tough. Not being a total asshat.You can highjack people to conscript them to your cause and use them as cannon fodder, overload power couplings and generally just cause some chaos to clear areas. The graphics are gorgeous (even on my potato comp)The AI is responsive but sometimes stupidThe difficulty is well, mid-levelThe tactics are necessary, You need cover.Some character customization available.The enviroment just makes me sigh, its so beautiful. You can spend time zoomed in just looking at your characters and the people around you to see what neat little outfits they are wearing.I will have to legitimately give this 8.5/10.Highly reccomended for RPG/RTS/Sci-fi Fans.

												I'm giving this a positive rating because it's quite enjoyable, but I want new buyers to be aware of something.I found this game really fiddly to play, in the way that a game from the 90s would be fiddly to us now. Some of the UI/UX concessions we are used to are not here. The biggest issue is that there is no AI on your squad members, so they don't indulge in sanities like returning fire when being fired upon. The game doesn't even notify you when your people are getting shot, it just happens silently. It would have been preferable to have a simple rule: When your weapons are drawn, get to the nearest cover and return fire.I'm also sort of clumsy and prone to mis-clicking and sending my people around to the wrong side of cover. Games like this usually have tactical pause, and normally I just pause and reissue the command. But Satellite Reign doesn't have a pause mode, it only has a 'Team Stim' skill that slows time for about 5 seconds and then takes a few seconds to recharge. It's not bad, it's just different, but 'different' can be hard to get used to.			"

												This is basically Syndicate, and I loved Syndicate. Was a nice challenge for a change as well.Incursions into hostile territory can go from a nice, quiet sneaking mission to♥♥♥♥♥♥up and your agents are being swarmed by corporate security.Alternatively you can blow open the front door and go guns blazing and see how well that goes.Would love to get more games in the same vein.10/10 Would mindjack again.

												If you liked Syndicate and Syndicate Wars you will like this game. If you never played those previous games but are a fan of realtime tactics you will like this game. If you are a fan of XCOM you will probably like this game. Its awesome infiltrating bases with multiple paths to the goal. Leveling and upgrading your squad is fun. Lots of gear to choose from.Graphics are awesome, the music is great. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys fun. :P			"

												This is very reminicent of Syndicate which I loved back in the Amiga days, and I'm sure can be played in the same way.... run in, shoot everything, run out. Bam!However there is a surprising amount of satifaction from creeping around and trying to achive everything with stealth. Very enjoyable either way and definitely worth picking up on sale.			"

I mean heck, you can control 4 unique trooper men (and women) and each one can accomplish different tasks with varying success and you can customize them out the wazoo!!! (sorry for language but I'm pretty frickin excited!! (sorry again can't help myself this game is so hecking cool! (deepest apologies I can't seem to control my foul fingertypes)Anywhootles, buy this game if you enjoy the following things:1. Good games2. Bad games that are actually good3. Futuristic4. A gun shooting bad guys5. Stealing money from ATMs so you can buy more guns and robot parts so you can become a robot6. Shooting bad guys and sometimes good guys7. Existing inside a futuristical city full of power generators and cameras that you can destroy so you can sneak into a place and steal more money and technologies for make benefit glorious nation of Khazhistan (just a little Borat humor haha had to do it )Well that's only about half of the reasons but I just alt-tabbed out of the game in the midst of a blissful 6 hour game sesh to let everyone know how great the game is and that you should go buy it thanks for reading.

												When I play this game, I feel like in Neuromancer. Due to the beutiful neon shaded city it is one of the best athmosphere which I ever experienced in a game. It contains everything that you read in Wiliam Gibson's novel, watched in Ghost in the Shell or Blade Runner. The missions are challenging, the augmentations and various equipment give you a choiche how to approch it, however it seems to me that the game prefers the stealhty and sneaky way to complete the mission, at least at the beginning of the game. Unfortunatley I found some bugs in the map feature and in the skill three and these 2 is quite frustrating, but I hope that it'll be fixed soon.Overall, this game deserves a place in my top 5 game. If you love cyberpunk, it's MANDATORY for you!			"

												I used to keep a PC in the closet that ran Windows 98 just so I could load up Syndicate and Syndicate Wars every so often and newer versions of Windows just didn't work right.   I recycled that computer.  This is a great successor to the originals with some cool new features.  I was skeptical about the classes at first but they do work and make it fun.     Graphics, mood and atmosphere are all great.   Although I wish they had brought back the voice when you select your weapon.  Friends of mine still drop a ""Mini gun"" and ""Gausss...Gun"" in reference to the old voices.    Gameplay.  It's fun.  I played without cloning drops as I found it made the game too easy but the combat is so satisfying I found myself wanting to go into the major bases repeatedly just to have fun mowing down enemies.   Get it.			"

												If you enjoy cyberpunk you'll enjoy this game.I picked it up a while ago, only have maybe 30 minutes  and I sucked at the game (I still do now to some extent) but after feeling really in the mood for a cyberpunk game I decided to play it again. Got through the first mission, did a couple of bits and bobs in the world and oh my god I can't believe I skipped on it before.The strategy is fun, the story is interesting and the whole city design itself captures the cyberpunk feel perfectly.Every time I enter a restricted area and a tense skulking about followed by a firefight (avoidable if your good unlike me) keeps me engaged. However I recommend playing in bursts as it can seem monotonous in the way you move around the city.The different classes, (Soldier, Support, Hacker and Infiltrator) are a nice balance between Uniqueness and Similarity. To put it simply a Soldier  could  hack a terminal but a Hacker does it better. A Hacker  could  fight off the local Security forces but a Soldier does it better. The beauty of this is, is that it means you're never limited in options which is crucial when things come down to the wire.Overall the game is fun if you're craving something cyberpunk in a pinch but can also become kinda boring when played in large intervals. So I shall give it a 7/10.			"

												I love this game.  I played Syndicate (1993) to death, and this is the best successor that I have yet seen.I guess it took some time after the kickstarter to get some of the bugs ironed out and the performance dialed in -- but I missed out on that.  By the time I started playing, it ran smooth and I didn't encounter any problems in my first 40 hour playthrough (maybe some of that was idling time).I found it to be smooth and polished.  I enjoyed the cyber-noire story and it was worth finding all the terminals to make sure that all of the narative was revealed (I did use some maps I found online for this, as well as the Steam achievemnents list so that I would know when I found all the terminals in a given zone).There are lots of valid aproaches to playing.  You can go loud and shoot everything up, or use brain-jacked agents to open all the doors as you speed-run through, or take your time and stealth everything.  You can even stealth the final boss fight if you have the patience for it.Now that the coop beta is out, I expect to give this a lot of replay.  I have a few friends in different time zones that I think will play, and each group can keep its own persistant multiplayer save.I usually review games with a list of caviats and qualifications, but in this case I have none. I have no detractors to caution you about, and endorse this wholeheartedly.Do check through the forums though, as it seems some folks have some complaints.			"

												Satellite Reign really draws you in and keeps you interested throughout the game.  It plays as an RTS, but has an option to play with a 'Pause-Mode' that maxes out a time-slowing ability off the bat.  Guns blazing or stealth-based, this game let's you play the way you want to play.			"

												It is very clear that this game was set out from the start to be the successor in spirit if not in name to Syndicate, and although it could have been a lot more if it'd done just a little better during the kickstarter, it's still succeeded at being a worthy successor in many regards. Differentiating the roles of your four core team members helps a lot to diversify the experience, and lets you try your hand at a lot of different playstyles instead of having one cookie-cutter build you apply to all cyborgs. Gameplay can get a bit repetative at times, but the levels are well designed and the difficulty ramps up well, and there's usually many different approaches to get to where you need to go, and the many side quests that give you some small bonusses and your opposition some small penalties are nice as well.

												Outside of this being a worthy successor to Bullfrog's Syndicate and an interesting story that you have to read instead of it being narrated to the player the soundtrack alone with its flawless transition between a stealth sounding feel to open accidental combat action music makes it all worth it.  The balance in gameplay feels right.  Satellite Reign has enough Hard to frustrate the hell out of you to keep you wanting to try to complete an assigned task, but not so difficult it requires constant search of a Wiki to fulfill an endevour.  Each objective can have multiple ways of completion instead of a single path so based on personal gameplay style each player may tackle an assignment how he/she sees fit.  As a player you may choose skills go in through the largest most guarded front door guns blazing or to tactically maneuver one or all of your agents a side path toward the goal.			"

												This is almost everything I've ever wanted out of a Shadowrun game. The combat takes some getting used to if you're used to a more turn based style, though if you do want to pause to issue orders, a skill has been added to allow a massive slowdown in time for just that purpose. That said, the depth of options and customization is surprisingly varied. You can clear things using just stealth or just combat, or go for a hybrid of the two. The number of options for getting from point A to B is also really enjoyable. Gotta make it through a door? You could cut the power, hack the door, hijack a personnel member who has access, use an explosive satchel on the door, etc. This same sense of possibility exists for just about each point of infiltrations. I very much recommend this game.			"

												This is basically the Commandos series in a cyberpunk style. I liked it, but it was definitely not as difficult as the Commandos series, and it didn't offer depth in the right places. Still, it was a cool game that I enjoyed playing. Here's some pro's and cons that I experienced!Pro's Commandos style gameplay, offering a tactical strategy game with 4 (sometimes more) distinct and original characters. Nice cyberpunk design. Clear directions of what to do and where to go to (this tends to be pretty vague at these kind of games). Rewarding stealth gameplay. Multiple paths to one solution (though sometimes this is cheap - like a door that has a terminal next to it that you can hack to open it, but there's also a machine right on the other side to ""hardwire"" it, giving almost the same result: the door opens).Cons I would have liked more diverse situations. I had a character with a sniper rifle that I rarely used, as there were never any truly good spots to use the range to your advantage. The ending was really poor. The same boss came back over and over again. Not to mention the awful music at the end that totally didn't fit the entire ambiance of the game. The story, it's simply not good. Only the highlights in the storyline missions have real voiced dialogue, which isn't all that special to begin with. That's about five times. The story is not captivating, and even though I thought the ending was pretty cool, it didn't make any sense (in the last minute a new female person was introduced with a significant role, that altered ending of the story, but either I missed something or I had no idea who they were talking about). Overly complex systems such as the research system and the cloning system. It didn't really add to the gameplay, it just made it unnecessarily complex (I did like the income system tho - that was kind of different than usual!). "

												So where to start.  Pro's:Expansive world, its H U G E fortunately there is fast travel waypoints.  Adjustable traffic & civilain foot traffic.  Well detailed and interactable for example you can put siphons on ATM machines.  Shut off cameras, hack security systems, talk with certain NPC civilians.Combat feels impactful, missing a beat or forgetting to buff your teammates during a fight can mean life or death.  AI is good enough to feel that often times your best choice is to simply run away and find a more easily defensable position pop a few cops and then put your guns away and hopfully avoid Drones and Cameras long enough for your ""wanted level"" to go down essentially.  Also I love that there is an actual ""wanted level"" meter in the game, gives you that option to jump on and say what the hell lets see how long I can surivive with 5 stars.  Lots of weapons, attachements, and augmentations to choose from that give a WHOLE LOT of customizability to each and every character.Graphics are actually really nice the only thing I don't like is the outfits your team is given default glow and you can't see a lot of detail on them.  Fortunately that isn't true for the other characters in the game, and you can get better gear later on in the game.  Story, the story isn't what I'd call deep but it's there and if you want to do some reading into the missions and story its actually really cool.  Essentially in the future at some point a megacorp figures out whats called Rez Tech, exactly what it sounds like.  The technology to transfer consciousness from human to computer to another human.  The Corp uses this first for political power only offering immoratility to those who can offer them power.  They then build a small army and sieze control of major cities and at this point esstentially controller the area.  Your a group of mercs motivated to remove said Corp from their seat of power.  I would sum this game up by calling it a expansive shadowrun, while its missing a noticable ""class system"" there is classes, but instead of it being combat oriented its more ability oriented while everyone can do eveything up to a point.  Everyone can Hack but a hacker can break in bank systems and steal you money while a non-hacker may be able to open a door they can't do that.  I like it a lot so far and would reccommend it.Cons:The game is optimized to a point where you'd think such a small game with low req's should be.  try turning off shadows that did it for me.  ITS H U G E the first mission consists of you planting fast travel/vendor stations around the city and you realize how huge it is and you can't believe you have to run all this way and figure out w t h to do.  Stick out the first mission and the game gets AWESOME real quick.  Once you get a handle on the expansiveness and the combat you'll have a ball.  I feel for first time RPG players this game has a big learning curve.  If you've played shadowrun or divinity you'll be fine or related games.  But if your new to real time RPG games, take it slow don't skip the tutorial and finish the first mission and you will have fun.   "

												takes bit and pieces from cyberpunk icons such as Syndicate, Syndicate Wars, Blade Runner and Neuromancer and creates a vibrant city scape with various caper mission types; (steal X, blow up Y, sabotage whatever, you get the drift), and creates an exciting realtime team strategy game.Its not without its flaws.   The game can be punnishingly difficult when you're first start off, and woe be you should you try to enter a corperate compound guns blazing; but, once you get the hang of the cover system and understand its not to be played as a run and gun game, it's a great game you will lose hours to.

												I liked the original Syndicate. This game is not Syndicate. Pretty far from it. And in a good way. While syndicate was a run and gun type of game, and you were the one shooting and aiming, this handles like a tactical rpg.While the graphics are pretty good though obviously not the best there is and the game has some rough edges here and there in the form of bugs or control issues, the guys making this beauty really loved their job. Or knew what they had to do.The game has a surprising depth and everything in it is to make gameplay better. No unnecessary trash, no handholding, it's quite brutal, yet at the same time it allows you to try again as many times as you want.Kind of like Santa with a knife. He stabs you, but smiles while doing it and then even bandages you, waits till you heal up... then stabs you again.Those that like coop or even just single player, are in luck - the game works nicely though as mentioned some bugs my surface - since you can drop in drop out, coop client control loss issues are easily circumvented and they rarely pop up thankfully (while at the same time this is the only actual bug I can name, don't remember any others).It's like why indie games are usually better than AAA titles, personified. Basically you trade polish for depth and true entertainment. Okay, the ending could use some work in my opinion but overall it was worth the cost I paid for it. Not many games can say that about themselves, on sale or not.Job well done and it shows.			"

												+leveldesign (really well made maps, lots of variety and options presented)+setting/atmosphere (gritty/gloomy-cyberpunk-zaibatsu-world)+style (well themed writing, graphics, music and sound effects)+fanservice (Bullfrog's syndicate-fans should love it)+ironman mode (and designed to work with it)-missing AAA-polish (UI needs some love, horrible default control settings, overall balancing)-occasional A-bugs (stuck in terrain/crash that need a load & replaying to fix)-Camera/Controlls/lack of Agent AI makes it quite impossible to try and use fancy tactics like in for example XCom, which faster leads to a lack of variety in gameplay (there are a lot of mechanics, you just don't have the controll needed to use all the exploits, you probably end up brute forcing most of your problems)Almost gave up on this game before I even began playing it (got one of my characters stuck in a wall during the tutorial, where you can't save). Had to replay roughly 1-3h total (of 35h for playthrough) due to ironman mode + bugs.Luckily with this version you could choose to have the slow time down upgrade from the start, which I found myself using a lot (especially in the early game, while learing the mechanics). I might not have gotten into the game without this option available at the start.Especially since I chose the ironman mode. Which works well for this game. It more or less forces you to reload if one of your agents die during a mission, which to me feels like a fair tradeoff (hardcore mode wouldn't work, imo, as the game is now).There are multiple ways to tackle the missions. Usually several ways to enter the secure areas and approce your target. There is also the full range of going full stealth to full combat (both seam to work fine). Cudos to the level designers.The story/lore is completly optional. You can enjoy this game on its mechanics alone.Overall a good game, got a bit repetative towards the 4th map (5 total, last map is the final mission).			"

												Having just completed my first run of this game, I gotta say that it's a lot of fun, but a little slow in the beginning. The amount of micromanagement can vary, and when you don't have many options (like in the first district) you may spend a long time in each compound, since you're poor and probably didn't outfit all your agents with silencers.Now, I never played Syndicate Wars or whatever this game is dubbed to be the spiritual successor to, but the factions, lore and weapons all fit perfectly with their respective styles. The atmosphere is bleak, as is your mission. Push through each district and witness terribly awful things happen to your agents, like when a giant robot fires a plasma mortar and wipes all your agents into a purple paste as well as approaching each obstacle in an opportunistic way, such as taking contol of a 10 foot tall, minigun toting robot and ordering it to squish every guard in the checkpoint to make it to the next district. You'll have fun, if you're into this sort of tactical stealth style. You'll also not have fun, as an inconvenient angle gets you spotted and surrounded and subsequently killed. Either way, when you make it to the end, you'll see the height of what your digital people can accomplish. miniguns are sorta trash, avoid the ballistic one. laser one is alright "

												I've played Satellite Reign for about 12 hours (6 hours weren't counted due to offline mode).Even though I was a huge fan of Syndicate (Wars), I never kickstarted this because the kickstarter seemed to promote fancy graphics over gameplay. When they came out of Early Access I bought the game because I was curious and left me pleasantly surprised.The game feels very much Syndicaty to me. You roam around a city doing cyborgy stuff, and there's plenty to do. It can be quite challenging, and you more or less get to set your own pace. In a way SR does some things better than the original that inspired this title; the things you do in the world make a lot more sense and serve you well, and the agent specialization and skill system work really well.That said, the game isn't without its flaws. Combat can be frustrating (due to technical issues; responsiveness of agents, pathfinding, enemy spawning, illogical terminal placements, etc), the other side of the coin means that it can be incredibly rewarding when you /do/ manage to complete a mission.(TLDR) Despit its flaws, it's still a really interesting game that plays unlike anything else that was released in recent years, and well worth the price they're asking (which at this time of writing is below 30 euro). But if you're someone who gets frustrated easily, you may want to skip this one.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. Syndicate was one of my favourite games and so backed this without hesitation on Kickstarter and it delivered more than I expected. The game is a spiritual successor in the best possible way. There are moments in the game where it perfectly captures the feel of syndicate but it is very much its own game that isn't afraid to change things up and experiment.Exploring the city and planning out how to attack a facility is lots of fun, and once you're in, you often have to change your plans quickly, switching from a stealth infiltration to blasting your way in and out when things go wrong. The game gives you plenty of tools for both options and I got a lot of enjoyment from raiding the same facilities in different ways to complete all the objectives. Overall, great fun, capturing the spirit of a great game while delivering a modern take on the concept.			"

												I am about 25% done with Satelitte Reign.  Buy this game.  Right now the price is $29.99 which is cheap for a game of this calibre.  Maybe I'm a little biased because I loved the Syndicate series from back in the 90s.  This game hits all the right beats.  Great audio design, graphics are spot on.  Love the classes and the cyborg tech upgrades and weapons.  Man this game is great!			"

												Having just completed my first run of this game, I gotta say that it's a lot of fun, but a little slow in the beginning. The amount of micromanagement can vary, and when you don't have many options (like in the first district) you may spend a long time in each compound, since you're poor and probably didn't outfit all your agents with silencers.Now, I never played Syndicate Wars or whatever this game is dubbed to be the spiritual successor to, but the factions, lore and weapons all fit perfectly with their respective styles. The atmosphere is bleak, as is your mission. Push through each district and witness terribly awful things happen to your agents, like when a giant robot fires a plasma mortar and wipes all your agents into a purple paste as well as approaching each obstacle in an opportunistic way, such as taking contol of a 10 foot tall, minigun toting robot and ordering it to squish every guard in the checkpoint to make it to the next district. You'll have fun, if you're into this sort of tactical stealth style. You'll also not have fun, as an inconvenient angle gets you spotted and surrounded and subsequently killed. Either way, when you make it to the end, you'll see the height of what your digital people can accomplish. miniguns are sorta trash, avoid the ballistic one. laser one is alright "

												+leveldesign (really well made maps, lots of variety and options presented)+setting/atmosphere (gritty/gloomy-cyberpunk-zaibatsu-world)+style (well themed writing, graphics, music and sound effects)+fanservice (Bullfrog's syndicate-fans should love it)+ironman mode (and designed to work with it)-missing AAA-polish (UI needs some love, horrible default control settings, overall balancing)-occasional A-bugs (stuck in terrain/crash that need a load & replaying to fix)-Camera/Controlls/lack of Agent AI makes it quite impossible to try and use fancy tactics like in for example XCom, which faster leads to a lack of variety in gameplay (there are a lot of mechanics, you just don't have the controll needed to use all the exploits, you probably end up brute forcing most of your problems)Almost gave up on this game before I even began playing it (got one of my characters stuck in a wall during the tutorial, where you can't save). Had to replay roughly 1-3h total (of 35h for playthrough) due to ironman mode + bugs.Luckily with this version you could choose to have the slow time down upgrade from the start, which I found myself using a lot (especially in the early game, while learing the mechanics). I might not have gotten into the game without this option available at the start.Especially since I chose the ironman mode. Which works well for this game. It more or less forces you to reload if one of your agents die during a mission, which to me feels like a fair tradeoff (hardcore mode wouldn't work, imo, as the game is now).There are multiple ways to tackle the missions. Usually several ways to enter the secure areas and approce your target. There is also the full range of going full stealth to full combat (both seam to work fine). Cudos to the level designers.The story/lore is completly optional. You can enjoy this game on its mechanics alone.Overall a good game, got a bit repetative towards the 4th map (5 total, last map is the final mission).			"

												I took my time to finish off this game before writing any kind of review. And hear me out... It's like sindicate and paradice cracked mixed up together and it's actually really quite enjoyable and challenging game. You get to play as a sort of ciberpunk ISIS operative cell, who dedicate themselfs to bring down the man, the old corporations who are ruling the world. Your group was created by a different corporation, staying in the shadows with a single purpouse to bring down the cloning company using their own tricks against them. So, grab your popcorn, grab your can of tactical bacon and get ready for a threat. You got at your disposition tons of gadgets, implants, abilities and guns of all sorts and shapes. How you want to do it, it's completelly up to you. Make small stealth heists or upgrade your hacker to brainwash the enemies and bring a gоddамn army to their doors. Your choise. Map is separated in 4 section (5, actually) and you get to choose where to strike and how you do it, it's pretty much a open world, so you are the one who are calling the shots. What should be do the next course of action. Personally, I just used a hacker and a bunch of civils and random guards to knock on enemy's door. It's really fun, once you get used to it. Learn well your team abilities, buff up by raiding enemy structures and don't forget to research new prototypes, most of them will add quite a bit of new tactical features.So... To make it shorter: It's a good game and in my personal opinion, it even managed to surpass both the original Paradise Cracked and Sindicate. It does worth your money, if you are into open world tactical games with good coop, look no further, this is the one you should try. 10/10, would blow the CEO the fucк up once again.			"

												This game is a real-time tactical RPG. It's like a blend between shadowrun and deus ex, but the story falls by the wayside. It's a very indie feel. This game did one other important thing well: it gives you a bunch of different tools and actually makes you want to use them to solve problems. I could see several different legitimate play styles being viable. This is probably the first stealth game I've ever played that got the stealth detection mechanics perfectly right. You can allow your operatives to be detained by simply not resisting, and sometimes thats the best approach. You can fight if you are kitted out for a fight. If you run and hide, the enemy is not relentless and cheaty in its ability to find you. The stealth balance is spot on.Replayability: Not much for single player. Where this game would really shine is with 3 of your mates, definitely a sure pickup for coop potential.Play time you can get: 20-30 hours completionist single player (same for multiplayer).Performance: With a GTX 970 I was almost always sub 30fps at 1080p medium settings, but strangly I found it tolerable. This game is poorly optimized.Very few bugs and the primary drawbacks are, since it is an indie feeling title, it lacks real depth. Missions can get repetitive after a while, and there isn't much substance in the overworld. Still, given the prices you can get it on sale, it's a worthy buy.			"

												Though it has a bit of a learning curve and the first few hours can be exceptionally frustrating if you stick with it it is a rather fun game. The puzzles and strategy aspect is not too difficult once you get the hang of it, the humour of hacking rival corps and sending them to their doom as a distraction never seems to get old. Just don't get too attached to your agents. Allowing them to die and respawning them is all part of the game. The story is lacking and you can completely forget there even is a story if you don't hack the datapoints, though it does kinda have one with an odd twist ending. If you wait for it to be on sale then it is fine for a few days of few days of glorified neon strategic killing.			"

About the gameSatellite Reign is a cyberpunk-themed RPG, in which you control 4 different characters at once.Most of the game is either based on stealth or combat, depending on your preference. The vast majority of the missions can be done either way.Is it open-world?Not really. To me, for a game to be open-world, the world actually needs something to do in it. Satellite Reign has more of a hub with certain areas in which you do missions.The core of the game is to do missions in each area to aquire items, which make your characters stronger. Some of these items are weapons, some are stat upgrades, others give your characters new abilities.Other than that, there's no reason to remain in a district after every mission has been completed.Singleplayer vs. MultiplayerI highly recommend you to play this game together with at least one friend. Team communication is very important, so be sure to use a VoIP service when you play.Singleplayer is possible, but controlling 4 characters (or more) at once is just incredibly difficult. Even controlling two at once is sometimes hard.Is the game fun? How long does it last?Absolutely! After a tough battle or an intense stealth section, you feel quite the reward, simply for beating the mission.I played the game for about 28 hours from start to finish together with a friend and we really had a blast while we played.As for replayability, there is not really that much of a reason to play it more than once.Sure, you could do an ""all stealth"" or ""all loud"" run if you want, but the XP and skill system doesn't force you to make any choices.The only choice you have is which skills to get first.Is the game stable?It's a bit of a mixed bag. In general, I'd call it stable.Multiplayer over internet works fine, but Multiplayer over LAN does not work at all.The game itself doesn't crash and can be minimized without problem.However, sometimes the characters in-game start to glitch out. Once (in 28 hours of gameplay), my character got stuck and died.At times, characters are slow to respond to commands, especially if they choose to reload after switching targets, or if they have to put their gun away.All in all, I would say these can be annoying when they happen, but it's not frequent enough to really spoil the fun.Does it perform well?This is the only major downside. If you have a very weak CPU, then the game doesn't perform well at all (State: Jan 2017).As far as I could read from forum entries, the developers vowed to improve the performance. If you have a very weak CPU, don't expect top performance.SummaryAll in all, Satellite Reign is 20-30 hours worth of multiplayer fun. If you have a friend to play with, give it a shot!			"

												Awesome game, tons of fun, don't let the haters convince you otherwise.  I loved Syndicate, to which this game is a spiritual successor.  This game is very atmospheric, has lots of nice touches, and is an overall well-thought out game with plenty of depth.  Sometimes you can operate purely in stealth, other times with guns blazing, or combinations thereof.Part of the fun was discovering what you could do with your abilities and how to use the combinations effectively, in addition to brute force.Highly recommended.  I hope there's a second one in the works!  Great work, guys.			"

												Nice graphics (even though no fully rotating camera, but you can manually rotate almost 90°, which is sufficient in everything I encountered so far... and I'm still in the first area, Downtown)Nice ambiance and atmosphere.  Very cyberpunky.Difficulty (default) is a mixed bag.  But not too hard (some will find it too easy, because I'm really not the best gamer in the world :P).  It does take some tactical thinking in places and especially in the beginning (I think, see ""Downtown"" parenthetical remark above).Cons are the camera and the lack of auto-fire.  Your characters only fire when you tell them, but they keep firing at a designated target.Frankly, with an 85% sale, you can't go wrong anyway, but I think I'd have spent more than that... if, say, I could have tried a demo.  *hint, hint, nudge, nudge* knowwhatImean			"

												Overall - I recommend this game. Definitely enjoyable, esepecaily if you're fan of Syndicate Wars. Pros: - Detailed expressions of the city of destopian future, with excellent cyberpunk atmosphere. - Co-op play available. - Good follow of the Syndicate Wars with the same feeling. If you still remember Syndicate Wars, this game would be great- Sneaky and stealthy play - Good system regarding upgrade clones, gears, and weapons. - Good ecomomic balance (researching and blueprint are expensive but IMO this idea is good). Cons: - Need more optimizaiton between performance and graphic. - Too laggy Co-op play, (sometimes) almost impossible to enjoy. - A bit easier battle and tricks when compared to Syndicate Wars. Need more challenges. - Unable to rotate 360 degree, limited rotation. - Not-that-good path finding AI and ""stuck"" in the object bug.- Non-realisitc AI behavior, specially regarding arrest and tracking the player units. - NO GTA = NO car / vehicle / tanks to ride ..... :(- (Personally) Lack of diversity of weapons, specially heavy weapons. I want RAMBO play, not the stealth. - Need more customization of characters.			"

												A game with a cool setting, awesome toys but a bit rough around the edges.  If you can look past the bugs and the difficulty spike in the middle, it definitely a gem in the rough.Pros:- Cool Cyberpunk world with lots of beautiful scenery- Lots of toys (augments, gear and weapons) to outfit your troops with.- Pulling off a mission with either stealth or brute force feels awesome!Cons:- Bugs.  I'm particularly sick of having my guys get randomly stuck in walls. :(- UX problems: there are times when you issue orders and they just don't take.  Very annoying as things can go downhill quickly on a mission.- Braindead AI, particularly for your guys.  They will stand around getting shot even though they have their guns out.  Won't take cover even when it's right in front of them.  Will shoot at a wall instead of the enemy.  You get used to when you have babysit them, but it's annoying that you have to do it at all.- Big diffculty spike in the middle of the game: right about after you clear the first area, the missions get much harder (see tips below for dealing with that).- ""Going loud"" in the early to mid game will probably get your team killed.  Later in the game once you have outfitted yourself with all the cool toys, you can easily mow down lots of enemies.  Thus the game actually gets easier later on as you can survive the mission when you screw up sneaking around.Tips:- Always do the bank mission ASAP and then hack all of the ATMs.  Half (or more) of the strength of your team is the gear you have, so more money = stronger team.- After you clear the first area and have access to the next two, go to both and do the bank missions plus ATMs.  Then use your new found money to gear up as the mission will be much harder now.- Abuse the stealth instant skill, especially with the infiltrator.  It's easy to get behind a patrol using the cloak and then murder them all before they can respond.- Grenades are powerful.  Make sure to equip them and use them on groups of enemies.  Grenades do lots damage, blow up cover and knock down enemies.- Plasma and laser weapons are the way to go.  They're stats might not look much better than bullet weapons, but shields and armor are harder to remove than regular health, so you need weapons that have bonuses against those.- Heavy weapons are mostly meh.  The exception being the rocket launcher and the plasma canon.  These are basically ""guns"" that shoot ""grenades"" :)			"

But I think it's trying to be a different sort of game.In the end I gave up, there is too much sneaking around hacking things and not enough mini gunning the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything for me.Graphics and atmos of the city are very well done, but in the end I found it just a little dull.I would of prefered a game more like Syndicate.Marks out of 10. 4/10.

												Satellite Reign has a cyberpunk, matrix, blade runner kind of feel  to it.  Its a real time tactical rpg where you level up four agents as they hack and infiltrate corporate compounds throughout the cityscape.  Essentially, the game works like this:  your agents steal technology and money so they can get better gear to steal technology and money from other areas in the city.  Along the way they level up to assist in these hacking/stealing/infiltrating ventures.  Rinse and repeat.  I have been playing for about 28 hours and I am almost through my second city district.  So this will keep you busy.Good game but buy it on sale.  This game is on sale a lot during the year.  I picked it up for about $10, but I have seen it as low as $5.			"

												Really good at letting you approach missions your own way and creating emergent gameplay.  Stealth, hacking, and direct combat are all viable options, and sometimes you'll want to use more than one in a single mission. Enemies are appropriately difficult if the alarms go off, but don't result in an automatic loss. There are always multiple viable ways to approach any problem.

												To display this as a syndicate clone, is simply wrong. Its all about hacking, sneaking around and simply getting past those pesky guards. Dont get me wrong, the game is good at what it does. But its not Syndicate or a clone of that, which i hoped for.			"

												Bought this for a second time as I thought I didn't give it a fair chance first time around.Enjoying it more this time, still not the blastathon that I enjoyed with Syndicate back in the 90's. I don't do stealth I'm usally armed to the teeth with mini guns and lasers. But I think it's trying to be a different sort of game.In the end I gave up, there is too much sneaking around hacking things and not enough mini gunning the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything for me.Graphics and atmos of the city are very well done, but in the end I found it just a little dull.I would of prefered a game more like Syndicate.Marks out of 10. 4/10.

												Satellite Reign has a cyberpunk, matrix, blade runner kind of feel  to it.  Its a real time tactical rpg where you level up four agents as they hack and infiltrate corporate compounds throughout the cityscape.  Essentially, the game works like this:  your agents steal technology and money so they can get better gear to steal technology and money from other areas in the city.  Along the way they level up to assist in these hacking/stealing/infiltrating ventures.  Rinse and repeat.  I have been playing for about 28 hours and I am almost through my second city district.  So this will keep you busy.Good game but buy it on sale.  This game is on sale a lot during the year.  I picked it up for about $10, but I have seen it as low as $5.			"

												I loved the original Syndicate, and this game manages to give us a modern replacement, with a few caveats.  It has a great atmosphere and graphics, which really nails the Syndicate feel, with a modern take.  Sound effects are also great.  Unlike Syndicate, the designers give you the option of using stealth or going in guns-a-blazing, which is a nice addition.  Unfortunately, stealth is the easiest, an possibly only practical method to complete some missions, so instead of controlling badass terminator agents you often feel like you are controlling weaklings who have to sneak around and get killed the minute they are noticed.  And that will happen a lot because the unchangable difficulty level is pretty hard, so expect to replay lots of missions many times.  It's also worth noting that you can't save in the middle of a mission, so you have to replay the whole mission, some of which can be pretty lengthy.  Restarting from a save point is also super slow.  OTOH once you get past (in my case struggle past) the earlier parts of the game and finally level your agents up sufficently, the game starts to open up a bit and is a ton of fun.  It just that there is some frustration to get there.  Still, if you liked the original Syndicate and Syndicate Wars, you owe it to yourself to get this game.			"

												What a wonderful game. Lots of bugs and pathing problems, enough to drive you crazy sometimes. But I think the positive sides outdo the negatives. I hope I will se much more of games like this.			"

												Really good at letting you approach missions your own way and creating emergent gameplay.  Stealth, hacking, and direct combat are all viable options, and sometimes you'll want to use more than one in a single mission. Enemies are appropriately difficult if the alarms go off, but don't result in an automatic loss. There are always multiple viable ways to approach any problem. As others have mentioned, there are some glitches and problems with pathing, but none of them were frequent enough to substantially detract from my enjoyment. I had an awesome time playing this, and I hope they release a sequel			"

												Been a little while since I played this, but it's worth giving the thumbs-up for. There are definitely some widespread performance issues, but if you can deal with them, this is a lovely blend of small-squad tactics, isometric RPG, and cyberpunk. It's this generation's Syndicate.			"

												Not played many hours yet but my initial impression is that it a faithful adaption of the old syndicate style games, 4 man team, large areas, in fact the map is open world, to explore, can take control of people, skills to learn and things to research. I can happily recommend this for anyone who is looking for something like syndicate or just likes squad based games. Although there is no tactical pause but there is an option to enable a form of it when you start a new game, not sure if this classes as a cheat mode or not but it works for me. "

												I am hooked on this game because it is like Syndicate Wars with 201x graphics and gameplay. I loved Syndicate Wars as a kid on our 486.It is a little hard to play without a mouse without a zoom wheel, as the levels are very detailed requiring close in to click on things and then wanting to get an overal picture of things. And it keeps a lot of the gameplay elements - like not being able to zoom too far, meaning you need to stick your team together or spend forever togling between members, like the syndicate had as challenges.
